Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, yesterday, I came to the floor to \ncall on Democrats in Washington to wake up, to open their eyes to the \nsigns we see all around us that the policies of the past 2 years are \nmaking our economy worse.\n  Home values are still falling. Manufacturers are showing the weakest \ngrowth in nearly 2 years. Nearly 14 million Americans are looking for \njobs and can't find them. For many, there is a nagging feeling that \nthings will actually get worse before they get better. And who can \nblame them?\n  Over the past 2 months, two ratings agencies have come out with dire \nwarnings over the status of America's stellar credit ratings out of \nfear that we don't get our fiscal house in order.\n  One has already put our rating under review and the other has \nthreatened to do so if we don't do something in a matter of weeks--\nweeks. Yet Democrats here in Washington are doing nothing.\n  The President is patting himself on the back for an auto bailout that \nis expected to cost the taxpayers billions. And Democrats in Congress \nwould rather talk about an election that is a year and a half away.\n  For 2\\1/2\\ years, Democrats in Washington have paid lip service to \nthe idea of job creation--even as they have relentlessly pursued an \nagenda that is radically opposed to it. And the results speak for \nthemselves: an annual deficit three times bigger than the biggest \ndeficit we ever ran during the last administration, a national debt \nthat we now know will this year be greater than our Nation's entire \neconomy, and chronic unemployment.\n  But here is the other problem: Democrats don't want to admit that the \ngovernment-driven policies of the past 2\\1/2\\ years are part of the \nproblem. And until they do, nothing will change. Unless Democrats \nchange their priorities and their policies, the threats of a downgrade \nwill not go away. The debt will not get any smaller. Businesses will \nnot create the kinds of jobs we need to build prosperity.\n  We need to change course. And a good place to start is with trade.\n  The President himself has explicitly acknowledged in front of the \ncameras that free trade agreements will create tens of thousands of \njobs for American families who need them. Yet now, the President's \nadvisers say that the White House plans to hold off on this bipartisan \njob-creating initiative unless it can spend more money on a government \nbenefits program first.\n  At a time when 14 million Americans are looking for work, they \nactually want to hold off on these known job-creating agreements in \nexchange for a green light to spend more money.\n  It is astonishing. I mean, how do you explain to an American \nmanufacturer or farmer that they have to lose business to France \nbecause some Members of Congress want a better benefits package for \ntheir allies in organized labor?\n  You cannot. The White House is free to advocate on behalf of unions. \nThat is its prerogative. But this time it has gone too far. When the \nWhite House is\n\n[[Page S3512]]\n\nactively depriving others of jobs because some union boss isn't getting \nhis way, it has lost touch.\n  So this morning I am calling on the administration once again to send \nus the three pending trade agreements that the President himself has \nsaid would create tens of thousands of American jobs--and to leave \ntrade adjustment assistance out of it.\n  There are 47 duplicative Federal retraining programs out there for \nunemployed workers. No one is denying or minimizing the hardships they \nface. But we will not allow the White House to deny one group of people \nthe chance to get a job in order to have a bargaining chip in \nnegotiating benefits for others.\n  It is not fair, and it is not right. We need to separate these \nissues, deal with them independently, and move ahead with these trade \ndeals. And we should also be doing even more to create jobs by moving \nforward with something that has been a cornerstone of good trade policy \nin this country since 1974. I am talking about trade promotion \nauthority.\n  If the President is really serious about doubling U.S. exports and \ncreating the jobs that would go along with it, he should call on \nCongress to approve trade promotion authority and Congress should do \nit.\n  I would also suggest that any discussion of trade adjustment \nassistance be done only as part of the debate over extending trade \npromotion authority, the way it's been done for decades.\n  Trade promotion authority would give the President the ability to \nnegotiate job-creating trade deals--and allow them an expedited \nprocedure to get an up-or-down vote in Congress so that opponents \ncouldn't block the deals or amend them on behalf of parochial interests \nor as a shortsighted favor to their union allies.\n  Without the protections afforded by trade promotion authority, \nCongress may never consider another trade deal again, and there will be \nno more trade agenda.\n  American businesses want to expand and hire. Here is one way to help \nthem do it that's right in front of us. There is no excuse for \ninaction.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, as I was doing my exercise this morning, I \nheard on the news the announcement that 10 years ago today, when \nPresident Bush--I could hear his voice celebrating the tax cuts for the \nwealthy--said: I know we have these huge surpluses, but these moneys \nare the people's money and, therefore, he was going to do something \nabout it. He did that big time.\n  He certainly did away with those huge surpluses we had, which \namounted to trillions of dollars. He did it in a number of different \nways. We had a program developed during the Clinton years called pay-\ngo. That meant if someone had a new program they wanted to initiate, \nthey had to pay for it either with new revenue or take money from an \nexisting program. It worked extremely well. That is one reason, and one \nof the main reasons, we were able to develop the huge surpluses we did \nduring the Clinton years. We were paying down the debt in the Clinton \nyears. Some said it was too quickly.\n  Well, another way that the President got rid of that huge surplus was \nthe war in Iraq and the war in Afghanistan. The war in Iraq alone now \nis estimated to be about a $1\\1/2\\ trillion--all borrowed money.\n  We also know how important it is to create jobs. Now, as a result of \nthe President finding himself in a huge hole as a result of the \npolicies of the Bush administration, he decided that something had to \nbe done. We passed the Economic Recovery Act. It created millions of \njobs and saved millions of jobs. Was it enough? No, but it was the best \nwe could do. We could only get three Republicans to help us on that. I \nappreciated their support, and I always will. They were Senators Snowe, \nCollins, and Specter. They determined what we could spend and not spend \nwithin certain parameters, and we believed there should be more \ninfrastructure spending. I wish we could have done more. So we have \ndone some things to help significantly the hole that President Bush \ncreated for us.\n  Now this Congress has also done some things. We focused on jobs. We \nknow how important jobs are. Regarding the FAA bill--Federal Aviation \nAdministration reauthorization--we extended that short term 19 times. I \ntalked to Randy Walker, head of McCarran Airport, the sixth busiest \nairport in America. They can't let contracts for runway repairs because \nthey only have 1 month to do it a lot of times. They cannot do that.\n  All kinds of projects that would create thousands of jobs around \nAmerican airports would happen if we could have an FAA bill. We passed \nit here. It has been held up in the big dark hole of the House of \nRepresentatives. Nothing has been done. We haven't been able to \ncomplete the conference on that, and the 280,000 jobs either created or \nsaved haven't been completed. That has been months and months.\n  We have an antiquated air traffic control system in America. We want \nto improve it. That is what it is about--saving and creating jobs.\n  We believed it was important to do something about patents. Senator \nLeahy has been faithful in reporting bills out of his committee, and we \nfinally said bring it to the floor. After a lot of work, we got it \ndone. More than six decades have lapsed, and we haven't done anything \nwith one of the most important things we can do, which is protect our \npatent system and make it better. We passed it here and sent it to the \nHouse. Nothing has happened. They have not voted on that bill.\n  That is very unfortunate, that we have not been able to get those two \nbills. The patent bill is 300,000 jobs and the FAA bill 280,000 jobs. \nThe math is pretty simple. That is a lot of jobs, and that has been \nheld up.\n  We believed it was extremely important that we do something about \njobs, and we did that with something that has worked so successfully in \nthe past. So that is the bill we brought to the floor to help small \nbusinesses innovate, invent, and invest in new jobs. What a wonderful \nprogram it has been. We tried to get that reauthorized. It was killed \nhere in the Senate by many amendments--amendments that had nothing to \ndo with the underlying bill. So we had to take that bill off the floor \nafter spending I think 6 weeks on the bill and not being able to get \nthat accomplished.\n  We brought this bill to the floor that would help small businesses \ninnovate, as I say, invent, and invest in new jobs, but the Republicans \nsimply said: No, we are not going to do that. That jobs bill was so \nimportant. The electric toothbrush was invented with a small innovation \ngrant, and there are many other examples. That is just one of hundreds. \nSo it is really too bad we haven't been able to do something about \nthat.\n  The only thing we hear from the House of Representatives, rather than \ncreating jobs, is destroying Medicare as we know it. The American \npeople don't like that, Republicans don't like it, Independents don't \nlike it, Democrats don't like it, young people don't like it, and old \npeople don't like it. It is not a good piece of legislation. \nOverwhelmingly, it has been just a big zero. But that is what we have \nfrom the House of Representatives. That is their main accomplishment \nthis year.\n  My friend talked about free-trade agreements. I am not a big fan of \nfree-trade agreements. My voting record is\n\n[[Page S3513]]\n\nin accordance with that. I think if you asked people in Nevada: Boy, \nhasn't NAFTA helped us a lot, they would just sneer and walk away. We \nkeep talking about free-trade agreements, but where is the fair part of \nthose trade agreements? Shouldn't we be more worried about our American \nworkers than workers in other places? I think that certainly is the \ncase.\n  In keeping with the theme of jobs, I thought it was important we do \nsomething about creating jobs. I have talked about patents, I have \ntalked about, of course, what we did with the FAA bill, and I talked \nabout what we tried to do with the small jobs innovation bill. What we \nhave decided to bring up now is the EDA, the Economic Development \nAdministration. This has been something that has been in effect since \n1965. It has been a wonderful program. In the last 5 years, we have \ninvested $1.2 billion, creating more than 300,000 jobs. For every \ndollar invested, we get $7 of private capital. That is a pretty good \ndeal. We want to bring that to the floor and have a debate on it, pass \nit, and put more money in the stream of creating jobs. As I said, for \nevery dollar we invest, we get $7 that comes from the private sector. \nWe plan to work this week on debating and reauthorizing this Economic \nDevelopment Administration bill, which for more than 45 years has \ncreated jobs for the most needy and economically distressed \ncommunities--as I have said, in just the last 5 years, more than \n300,000 jobs.\n  This is our first bill of this new work period because creating jobs \nis our first priority. But Republicans are stopping us from moving to \nit because creating jobs, it appears, is the last thing they care to \ndo. They are more concerned about what jobs are being created in \nColombia or Panama or Korea than what jobs are being created here in \nAmerica.\n  The merits of reauthorizing this job-creating administration bill are \nvery clear: EDA works with businesses, universities, and leaders at \nlocal levels, so it creates jobs from the bottom up, and it helps \nmanufacturing producers compete in the global marketplace. I repeat, it \nis a great investment. Seven-to-one is an incredible return rate.\n  Last night, I had to file cloture on this bill. I hope we don't have \nto invoke cloture. We have it set up now so we will have the vote in \nthe morning, an hour after we come in. Maybe during the recess we have \nfor our caucus meetings the Republicans will be able to bring in these \npeople who are stopping us from doing this and we will be able to move \nto it and do something meaningful here on the Senate floor for the rest \nof this day and tomorrow rather than invoking cloture, waiting 30 \nhours, and doing nothing. We need to start creating jobs.\n  Let me repeat. The FAA bill, the House has killed it. On patents, we \nhave done it, and the House has killed it. We tried to do small jobs \ninnovation, but it was killed here in the Senate. We are now trying to \ndo EDA. At this stage, we are not able to move forward.\n  We are ready to create jobs--we Democrats. We have done it before \nwith programs such as the Economic Development Administration, and we \nare ready to do it again. The American people are desperate for stable \nand secure jobs. All they ask of us is that we do our job, and we \nhaven't been doing that because we have been prevented from doing it. \nWhy haven't we passed the FAA bill? Why haven't we completed work on \nthe patent bill? Why were we stopped from moving forward on the small \njobs innovation bill? Why are we unable to move on the EDA bill?\n  Would the Chair announce morning business?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/07/senate-section/article/S3513-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3513]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I rise today to speak in support of our \npending trade agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea.\n  Right before Memorial Day, the Finance Committee held two trade \nhearings, the first on the U.S.-Panama Trade Promotion Agreement, the \nsecond on the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement. Earlier, the Finance \nCommittee held a hearing on the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion \nAgreement. These agreements have been thoroughly reviewed by our \nFinance Committee. In fact, given that the Colombia agreement was \nsigned in 2006 and the Panama and South Korea agreements in 2007, these \nagreements have been more than thoroughly reviewed by U.S. elected \nofficials and U.S. agencies over the past several years. For the sake \nof the U.S. economy and for the sake of our country's standing in the \nworld, it is clearly time to take the next step. It is time for \nPresident Obama to submit implementing legislation for these agreements \nto the Congress.\n  The U.S. trade agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea are \ngood agreements that will benefit the United States and American \nworkers. According to the nonpartisan U.S. International Trade \nCommission, these trade agreements, once fully implemented, will likely \nincrease U.S. exports by over $12 billion and grow the U.S. gross \ndomestic product by over $14 billion. Put simply, our trade agreements \nwith Colombia, Panama, and South Korea will boost U.S. exports, expand \nthe U.S. economy, and thus promote job growth in the United States.\n  The President and members of his administration understand this. They \nhave spoken on numerous occasions on the benefits of the U.S. trade \nagreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea for our country. \nPlease bear with me as I review some of their statements.\n  Four months ago, President Obama, in his State of the Union Address--\n4 months ago--expressed his support for the U.S.-Korea Free Trade \nAgreement, which he stated will support at least 70,000 American jobs. \nHe then asked Congress to pass the Korea agreement as soon as possible.\n\n  Last December, President Obama noted that the South Korea agreement \nis expected to increase annual exports of American goods by up to $11 \nbillion. In that same speech, he said:\n\n       I look forward to working with Congress and leaders in both \n     parties to approve this pact because if there is one thing \n     Democrats and Republicans should be able to agree on, it \n     should be creating jobs and opportunities for our people.\n\n  I couldn't agree more.\n  Just 2 months ago, the President stated that he believes a recently \nannounced labor action plan of Colombia serves as a basis for moving \nforward on a U.S.-Colombia free-trade agreement and that this \nrepresents a potential $1 billion of exports--our exports--and could \nmean thousands of jobs for workers here in the United States.\n  After meeting with President Martinelli of Panama, President Obama \nsaid he is confident now that a free-trade agreement would be good for \nour country, would create jobs here in the United States and open up \nnew markets with potential for billions of dollars of cross-border \ntrade.\n  The President's principal trade adviser, U.S. Trade Representative \nRon Kirk, just last month recognized that the U.S.-Korea trade \nagreement will support more than 70,000 American jobs, and he noted as \nwell that it will result in over $10 billion in increased annual \nexports from the United States.\n  In April, Ambassador Kirk said Colombia represents $1.1 billion in \nnew export opportunities for the United States. Regarding Panama, he \nstated that the Panama agreement will provide access to one of the \nfastest growing markets in Latin America.\n\n[[Page S3514]]\n\n  In speaking of all three pending agreements only last month, \nAmbassador Kirk said that ``the pending agreements with South Korea, \nPanama, and Colombia are at the forefront of our efforts to open new \nmarkets.''\n  In April, Secretary of Commerce Gary Locke emphasized the need to \npass the U.S.-Korea Trade Promotion Agreement through Congress as soon \nas possible. He also said that the administration feels similar urgency \nto get the pending Panama and Colombia trade deals done. He noted that \nall three pending trade agreements will move us even closer to \nPresident Obama's National Export Initiative goal of doubling American \nexports by 2015.\n  Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack has spoken on behalf of the \nadministration in favor of our pending trade agreements with Colombia, \nPanama, and South Korea. On May 12, he stated that the paramount reason \nto implement these three pending trade agreements is jobs. He went on \nto note that these trade agreements will result in over $2 billion in \nadditional sales of U.S. agricultural products. Secretary Vilsack has \nalso stated that until we complete these three trade agreements, U.S. \nagriculture will not have a level playing field in Colombia, Panama, or \nSouth Korea.\n  Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has spoken on the benefits of \nthese three trade agreements for our country. When discussing the U.S.-\nKorea Free Trade Agreement in April, she stated not only that this \nagreement will increase U.S. exports by billions of dollars and thus \nsupport tens of thousands of American jobs but also that implementing \nthe South Korea agreement is profoundly in our strategic interest. When \nspeaking on the subject of trade and economic growth last month, \nSecretary Clinton said that ``one of our top goals is to complete free \ntrade agreements with Colombia and Panama.''\n  As someone might say, there is a lot of upside to these agreements--\nbillions in new exports, billions in economic growth, and thousands of \nnew jobs. What is not to like?\n  So I have a question. What is the holdup? What on Earth is the \nadministration waiting on? This country needs all the jobs and economic \ngrowth we can get. So why does the administration refuse to submit \nthese agreements to Congress for consideration? Despite declaring the \nbenefits of these agreements for the United States at every turn, the \nObama administration is sitting on them, hurting our economy, and \nundermining our job growth.\n  With respect to international trade, the administration has adopted a \npolicy of delay and dither. I see few signs that the administration is \nworking hard to move these agreements through Congress. I don't see \nadministration officials walking the Halls of Congress in attempts to \nbuild support for the Colombia, Panama, and South Korea agreements. \nWhile the administration has said great things about these agreements, \nas I have mentioned, its efforts to build any type of momentum to \nadvance them on Capitol Hill are tepid at best.\n  On trade policy, the administration is all talk and no action, or, as \nmy friends from Texas might put it, on these agreements, the President \nand his team are all hat and no cattle. This is definitely a strange \neconomic strategy. While our economy remains shaky, unemployment \nremains high--the unemployment rate is at 9.1 percent--and while the \nrest of the world watches in bewilderment as the United States lets \nother countries take over our export markets, the administration just \nsits there. It just sits there.\n  Actually, let me correct myself. The administration doesn't just sit \nthere; instead, the administration is actually going out of its way, \nfinding new excuses for not moving forward with the implementation of \nthese trade agreements.\n  Despite countless speeches from the President and his administration \nabout the importance of the three trade agreements to American exports, \ncreating American jobs, and strengthening our alliances with key \nfriends, his administration busies itself concocting more roadblocks, \nmore delays, and more excuses. It is time to be blunt about this. This \nschizophrenic trade policy is doing nothing but hurting American \nworkers, hurting jobs, and undermining our recovery.\n  I believe each free-trade agreement, standing on its own merits and \nwith the full backing of the White House and congressional leadership, \nwill pass with significant bipartisan margins. But we are now told we \nwill never have a chance to vote on any of these agreements unless the \nWhite House and Democratic Senators get what they want on trade \nadjustment assistance.\n\n  Let's put this in perspective. Our economy teeters on the brink with \na weak economic recovery. One in seven Americans happens to be on food \nstamps. Durable goods orders dropped 3.6 percent in April. Last month, \nthe economy added only 54,000 private sector jobs, and unemployment \nwent up to 9.1 percent. The real estate market remains in tatters with \nthe average single family home price falling by 33 percent since 2007. \nWe face an historic spending crisis that has generated warnings from \nStandard & Poors and Moody's that the Federal Government faces a \ndowngrade in its debt rating--an action that would be devastating for \nthis Nation and to America's families.\n  To forestall this coming crisis, leaders in Congress and the \nadministration are meeting on an almost daily basis to determine how \nbest to get our Nation's deficits and debt under control. Every \nspending program and expenditure is being reviewed to find cuts to get \nour fiscal house in order.\n  Everyone recognizes these three trade agreements will promote jobs \nand economic growth at a time when both are in short supply. Submitting \nand passing free trade agreements would be a quick and cost-free way of \ngenerating economic growth. Yet, in an environment where Congress is \ndesperately attempting to encourage economic growth and rein in \nspending to avert a fiscal crisis, the White House and many Democrats \nare delaying the pro-growth trade agreements until we get more \ngovernment spending through TAA, the trade adjustment assistance \nprogram. And for what? If an expanded TAA is so critical, where is the \nrecord of success to prove it? What evidence is there that giving some \nworkers who have lost their jobs more benefits than others improves \nU.S. competitiveness or is a responsible way to spend taxpayer dollars? \nThe mere fact that more people are in a program, and that more taxpayer \nmoney is being spent, is not evidence of success.\n  Congress does not pick winners and losers in the movie rental \nbusiness. When Blockbuster employees lost their jobs because of the \nrise of Netflix, nobody stood up and said we should create a new, big, \nspending government program to help displaced Blockbuster employees.\n  President Reagan recognized the problems inherent in this program \nwhen he said:\n\n       [t]he purpose [of TAA] is to help these workers find jobs \n     in growing sectors of our economy. There's nothing wrong with \n     that, but because these benefits are paid out on top of \n     normal unemployment benefits, we wind up paying greater \n     benefits to those who lose their jobs because of foreign \n     competition than we do to their friends and neighbors who are \n     laid off due to domestic competition. Anyone must agree that \n     this is unfair.\n\n  That is what President Reagan said.\n  By tacking the expansion of TAA onto the stimulus bill, and refusing \nto allow Congress to vote on the extended TAA program on its own \nmerits, it is unclear whether there is, in fact, bipartisan support for \nthis expanded program. It is billions of dollars more. If the expanded \nTAA program can stand on its own merits, as each of the FTAs can, then \nit should be introduced and voted on separately from the free trade \nagreements. Demanding an expanded TAA as another excuse to delay voting \non these important agreements is irresponsible and self-defeating.\n  At the same time, by not submitting these agreements for approval by \nCongress, the administration is doing a disservice to the American \neconomy and, at the same time, is letting down some of our strongest \nallies. Nothing good can come from this continued inaction.\n  Make no mistake about it. Failure to submit these agreements is a \nfailure in Presidential leadership. I am convinced the window for the \nadministration to submit these agreements will soon pass. Given the \nupcoming election season, I am afraid if these agreements aren't \nsubmitted this summer, they never will be.\n\n[[Page S3515]]\n\n  The President needs to act. I appreciate the President's goal of \ndoubling exports. Having goals is great. But we all know that if one \ndoesn't do the work and take action, goals become little more than \nfalse hope. They never become reality.\n  The President and his Cabinet admit these agreements are essential to \ntheir goal of doubling exports and creating jobs here at home. Yet, the \naction necessary to achieve that goal and create those jobs--submission \nof the agreements--remains in the distant future. Instead of benefiting \nfrom these agreements, we watch the days slip by, the explanations and \nexcuses pile up, our export markets decline, and our economy suffers.\n  I strongly urge the President to submit implementing bills for the \nColombia, Panama, and South Korea trade agreements to Congress this \nsummer. There is no time like the present when it comes to encouraging \neconomic growth and business creation.\n  I understand they want to help their union employees throughout the \ncountry who are less than 7 percent of the private sector economy. What \nabout the millions and millions of others who are losing their jobs not \nbecause of this but because we don't export and we don't have these \nfree trade agreements with these three very important countries to us, \nboth from a neighbor standpoint and from a strategic standpoint?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, it is my understanding I have 10 \nminutes; is that correct?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is correct.\n  Mr. CORKER.

Madam President, I rise today to speak about something \nthat is affectionately known as the Durbin amendment. During the Dodd-\nFrank debate that occurred about a year ago and upon its passage, there \nwas an amendment brought to the floor called the Durbin amendment which \ndealt with debit cards and regulating debit cards. This was an \namendment that never had been debated. There had never been a hearing \non this amendment. In the height of people being very concerned about \nthe large financial institutions in our country, this was an amendment \nthat passed. I voted against it. I thought it was bad for us as a \ncountry to allow the Federal Reserve to begin setting prices for \nspecific industries as the Durbin amendment called for. In any event, \nthe Durbin amendment became law. I know numbers of people in this body \nhave been contacted since that time about the effects of the Durbin \namendment.\n  What the Durbin amendment did was tell the Federal Reserve to set \nprices on debit cards based on incremental cost. Let me say that one \nmore time: based on incremental cost. In other words, when a business \ndoes business, there are fixed costs and there are incremental costs. \nIt would be like saying to a pizza company that sells pizzas across the \ncounter that the only thing they can charge for is the dough. They \ncouldn't charge for anything else that went into the cost of the \nproduct that was being sold.\n  I am obviously opposed to price setting. I realize we don't have 60 \nvotes in this body to do away with price fixing in general as it \nrelates to debit cards. I also realize a lot of people in this body \nbelieve there is a problem, if you will, with an almost monopolistic-\ntype atmosphere as it relates to debit cards in general. So what I have \ntried to do is seek a better solution than the one that has come forth. \nSenator Tester and I have worked together. We have made actually three \nrevisions to an amendment that I hope we will be voting on over the \ncourse of the next 48 hours, maybe 72 hours. It has been crafted in a \nway to bring people together. What it does, the essence of it, is that \nit directs the Fed to--instead of setting prices on debit cards based \nsolely on the incremental cost of the transaction--consider all costs, \nboth fixed and incremental, which is something that anybody in this \nbody who happened to be in business certainly would want to be the \ncase.\n  I know there has been a lot of populism in this body and a lot of \npeople have tried to rail, if you will, against financial institutions. \nI know a lot of people have empathy with retailers who find themselves \nin a situation where it is difficult for them to negotiate prices as it \nrelates to debit cards. What this would do, though, is still leave \ndebit cards as a regulated entity. It is not the solution I would \nultimately like to see, but I think it is a solution we may be able to \nagree to in this body. It would leave that regulated, but it would \ndirect the Fed to consider all costs, fixed and incremental. Again, it \nis a very commonsense measure.\n  I know there have been lots of discussions about a solution to this \nDurbin amendment. I know it is an issue most people in this body wish \nto see go away. A lot of people feel as though they are being pitted, \nif you will, between the financial industry and retailers.\n  I think the solution Senator Tester and I, working with Senator Crapo \nand others, have come up with is one that meets the commonsense test. \nIt brings people together around a policy of solving a problem that was \ncreated, again, without a lot of discussion on the Senate floor, and \ncertainly no hearings. So I ask Members of the body to please talk with \ntheir staffs about the most recent changes that have been put forth in \nthis amendment.\n\n  This is not something that is trying to stave off or keep the effects \nof the Durbin amendment from taking place, but what it does is put a \nmore fair structure in place where the Fed can actually look at all \ncosts relating to a transaction. Again, think about it. If someone is \nselling pizzas in a pizza restaurant or a retail establishment and they \nwere told the only thing they could do is charge for the dough that \nwent into the pizza and nothing else--none of the rent, none of the \nother costs that go with operating the facility--obviously they \nwouldn't be in business very long.\n  I think all of us want to see the financial industry continue to be \ninnovative. I think all of us see a day when we are going to be able to \nbasically pay bills with our electronic devices, and continued \ninnovation is going to take place, which causes our economy to expand.\n  I believe this amendment, which has been shaped by a number of people \nin this body, meets the commonsense test. I think it provides a good \nsolution for those people who actually voted for the Durbin amendment \non the floor and realized afterwards what was happening, which was \nputting in place a price structure that is not sustainable for debit \ncards and over time, no question--over a very short amount of time--\nquickly--is going to be very adversely affecting consumers all across \nthis country.\n  I thank the Chair for the time. The Tester-Corker amendment is \ndesigned to create a more productive solution than was offered under \nthe Dodd-Frank debate and the Durbin amendment. I hope all Members of \nthis body will look at this seriously. I know everybody has been \ncontacted. I understand this is a very contentious issue. This solution \nis being put forth to solve a problem, not to take one side or another. \nIt leaves the debit card industry as a regulated industry, but allows \nthe Fed, as it should, to take into account both fixed and incremental \ncosts as they look at what the pricing structure ought to be.\n  In addition, I know a lot of people have been concerned about what is \ngoing to happen with small financial institutions. Obviously, their \ncosts for debit transactions are much higher than the larger \ninstitutions in this country. People have been concerned about the \nimpact on them. What this would also do is give the Fed the ability \nevery 2 years to see if the policy they put in place is adversely \naffecting the smaller and rural banks or the community banks or smaller \ncredit unions, to make sure that if they are being affected adversely, \nthen they can recommend--not prescribe but recommend--some legislative \nfixes for that.\n  Again, I hope Members of this body will see this as a reasonable \nsolution. I urge all of my colleagues to contact me personally or \nSenator Tester personally to talk this through if they have\n\n[[Page S3516]]\n\nany questions, and hopefully we can bring to an end this contentious \ndebate over an amendment that was passed on the Senate floor without \nany hearings, and which I think all of us know is going to create a lot \nof unintended consequences for people all across this country.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/07/senate-section/article/S3516-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3516-S3517]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                MEDICARE\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, we are discussing the Federal budget \nin Washington on a nonstop basis. One point that seems very noteworthy \nis that instead of working to create jobs to help grow the economy out \nof recession, Republicans are still trying to end Medicare as we know \nit, as it has been relied on for generations of Americans, in order to \npay for tax cuts for millionaires. This is the Wall Street Journal \ndescribing the Republicans' plan to essentially end Medicare.\n  The Republican plan to end Medicare would put insurance company \nofficials between seniors and their doctors. You no longer have a claim \nto the individual benefit under their plan. You get a voucher that goes \nto the insurance company, and you are at the mercy of the insurance \ncompany. First of all, they raise drug costs for seniors from day No. 1 \nby repealing the repair we did to the doughnut hole. Then, of course, \n10 years out, you are left at the mercy of private insurance companies.\n  The effect of that is that, on average, seniors will pay nearly \n$6,400 more out of pocket every year as a result of this Republican \nplan. Rhode Island has a lot of seniors. I do not know a lot who have \nan additional $6,359 every year to spend on health care costs that \nwould no longer be covered.\n  It is worth noting that one of the first things that happens when you \ntake the $1 that goes to Medicare and give it to private insurance \ncompanies instead is, the 2-percent or 3-percent administrative costs \nthat Medicare takes out--which leaves you, let's say, 97 cents of the \n$1 to pay for health care--that jumps to between 15 percent and 25 \npercent, leaving you only 85 cents to 75 cents out of your $1 to pay \nfor health care because the private system is so inefficient and eats \nup so much in administrative costs for salaries and for quarreling with \ndoctors and hospitals about payment and all that.\n  They do not even use this to reduce the deficit in a significant way. \nThe savings achieved by ending Medicare and raising seniors' health \ncare costs by nearly $6,400 every year out of pocket are being used to \npay for, guess what. More tax cuts for America's millionaires and \nbillionaires. Every 33 seniors who have to pay that extra $6,400 will \nadd up to one millionaire's $200,000 bonus tax break.\n  The Republican budget makes average cuts of $165 billion per year in \nMedicare between 2022 and 2030. That gives $131 billion in tax cuts for \nmillionaires, billionaires, big corporations, and Big Oil--$165 billion \nout of seniors' pockets, $131 billion to millionaires, billionaires, \nbig corporations, and Big Oil. We think it is time for our colleagues \nto get serious about creating jobs to grow our economy out of this \nrecession and abandon their attempts to ram through a clearly \nideological agenda against Medicare--indeed, that ends Medicare and \nhelps the Nation's very wealthiest at the expense of seniors and the \nmiddle class.\n  Let me talk for just a minute about where we are in the Tax Code with \nour wealthiest versus seniors and the middle class. Clearly, we agree \nwe have to bring our finances into balance. Clearly, we have to avoid a \ndebt-limit failure that causes a default by our country for the first \ntime in its history. Eliminating unnecessary spending should be part of \nthe Federal balancing equation. Indeed, through multiple appropriations \nbills this year, we have pared back billions of dollars in Federal \nspending, and we will do more, but bipartisan consensus seems to end \nhere when we move to the revenue side of the Federal budget. Just last \nmonth, Republicans filibustered a measure that would have ended $21 \nbillion of unnecessary tax breaks for the largest oil and gas companies \nin the world, companies that have been enjoying record multibillion-\ndollar profits and do not need continued support from the American \ntaxpayer.\n  That made the Republican message clear: In balancing the budget, \nclosing tax loopholes and repealing corporate subsidies is not on the \ntable. The debt and the deficit, they tell us, are the most important \nproblems facing the country. But evidently they are less important than \nprotecting tax subsidies for Big Oil. That is what their vote proves. \nThey will cut education, police protection, health care, job training, \nand environmental protection but will not touch tax subsidies for large \ncorporations or for millionaires and billionaires.\n  There is a basic question underlying all this; that is, are the \nsuperrich paying a fair share? Each year, the Internal Revenue Service \npublishes a report that details the taxes paid by the highest earning \n400 Americans. I gave a speech a few weeks ago showing from what was \nthen the most recent data, that in 2007, these super high income \nearners, earning nearly one-third of a billion dollars each in just 1 \nyear, paid a lower tax rate than an average hospital orderly pushing a \ncart down the halls of a hospital in Rhode Island. I showed the \nHelmsley Building in New York, big enough to have its own ZIP Code, \nbecause we know from IRS information gathered by ZIP Code that the \nwealthy, successful occupants of this building actually paid a 14.7-\npercent total Federal tax rate. There is the building. There is the \nHelmsley Building in New York. The people who live there do very well. \nThey are very successful, which is wonderful. That is the American way. \nThey are very well compensated. That too is the American way.\n  But what is different is that they actually paid a 14.7-percent total \nFederal tax rate, which is lower than the average New York janitor or \ndoorman or security guard pays. If averages hold, the very successful \nand well-off inhabitants of this building are paying a significantly \nlower tax rate to the Federal Government than the doorman who works for \nthem and the security guard who keeps an eye out for their security and \nthe janitors who clean up the halls.\n  The most recent IRS report is out about the top 400, from 2008. Let's \ntake a look at that information. The top 400 incomes in America in 2008 \nhad an average income each in that 1 year of $270 million. That is a \npretty good year when you can make more than one-quarter of a billion \ndollars. That is the American dream, big time. But what they actually \npaid in taxes, those 400, on average, was a rate of 18.2 percent. That \nis their total Federal tax rate, all the taxes put in. What did they \nactually pay--not what the nominal rate is but what did they actually \npay? The IRS calculated this. This is not an estimate, this is the \nIRS's calculation. Although we spend a lot of time debating around here \nwhether the top income tax rate for the wealthy should be 35 percent or \n39.6 percent, that is not what they pay. The Tax Code is filled with \nspecial provisions that tend to either exclusively or \ndisproportionately benefit the wealthy so the top 400 income earners in \nthe country pay an average tax rate of 18.2 percent.\n  Who else pays an 18.2 percent tax rate in this country? If you are a \nsingle filer, you hit 18.2 percent when your salary gets to $39,350. \nWhen you are making $39,350 your Federal taxes--income and withholding, \npayroll taxes--combine to 18.2 percent, just like the 400 millionaires \nand billionaires who made actually over one-quarter of a billion \ndollars in the same year that this taxpayer would have made less than \n$40,000.\n  What does that equate to in terms of jobs? The Bureau of Labor \nStatistics for the Providence, RI, labor market says, on average, a \ntruckdriver will earn about $40,200. At that income point, $40,200, \nthat truckdriver is paying the same tax rate as the 400 biggest \ninterest earners in the country. They each earned over one-quarter of a \nbillion dollars. They paid 18.2 percent. The truckdriver earns $40,000. \nHe would be paying 18.2 percent, maybe a little\n\n[[Page S3517]]\n\nover. If that truckdriver gets a raise or if he or she decides they are \ngoing to work a second job at night and increase their income a little \nbit, guess what. They would then be paying a higher tax rate than those \n400 super high income earners. In fact, the highest income earners pay \na rate far below what people who think their average income earners \nactually pay.\n  Of course, tax inequality extends beyond just individuals. At a time \nwhen household budgets are strained, profitable corporations are paying \njust about their lowest share of Federal revenues in 75 years. If you \ngo back to 1935, you see that regular Americans and corporate America \nevenly split the responsibility to fund our country's obligations, to \npay for America's expenses. Then, in each of these following years, the \nratio between what corporations pay in revenues to the government \nversus what individuals pay broke through these ratio levels. By 1948, \nthe individuals were paying twice as much in revenues to the Federal \nGovernment as corporations. By 1971, regular humans, regular Americans \nwere paying three times as much of the revenues of the United States of \nAmerica as corporations were. In 1981, it broke through 4 to 1. For \nevery $1 an American taxpayer paid to support this country, \ncorporations just kicked in one-quarter. In 2009, it broke through 6 to \n1, meaning that the average American, the ordinary taxpayer, the \nindividual human being puts in $6 of revenue to support this country \nfor every $1 corporate America contributes.\n  When people say how overtaxed corporate America is, it is worth \nlooking at this record of an ever-diminishing contribution by America's \ncorporate community to our Nation's revenue. Of course, the Republican \nfilibuster of our efforts to strip Big Oil subsidies that would have \nput $21 billion back into taxpayers' pockets or reduced the debt and \nthe deficit by $21 billion is noteworthy in this light.\n  Even against this rapid decline in corporate tax support for American \nGovernment compared to a huge runup in what individual Americans pay, \nour colleagues on the other side of the aisle insist on continuing to \nsupport tax subsidies for Big Oil, while they are making the biggest \nprofits any corporation has ever made.\n  We looked at the Helmsley Building a moment ago. Let's look at a \ndifferent building. Let's look at a picture that our Budget Committee \nchairman, Kent Conrad, uses. This was taken in the Cayman Islands. It \nis a relatively nondescript building, not worthy of particular note, \nexcept that over 18,000 corporations claim this building as the place \nthey are doing business out of; 18,000 corporations. Really? Do we \nthink 18,000 corporations are doing real business out of that building?\n  As Chairman Conrad has pointed out, the only business going on in \nthat building is funny business, monkey business with the U.S. Tax \nCode.\n  This is estimated to cost us as much as $100 billion every year. For \nevery one of those $100 billion lost to the tax cheaters hiding down \nthere in the Cayman Islands, honest, tax-paying Americans and honest \ntax-paying American corporations have to pay an extra $1 or more to \nmake up the difference.\n  We recently voted for a continuing resolution to fund the government \nfor the remainder of the fiscal year, and in it I supported, and my \ncolleagues supported, belt tightening across many agencies and \nprograms, including even cuts in the accounts that fund Senators' \noffices. So we are not against cuts.\n  But serious people understand we cannot just cut our way back to a \nbalanced budget. There simply is not enough to cut. Not since 1960--\nmore than half a century ago--have we had a balanced budget at the \nrevenue levels as a percent of GDP that the Republican House-passed \nbudget proposes.\n  When our tax system permits billionaires to pay lower tax rates than \ntruckdrivers and allows some of the most profitable corporations in the \nworld to pay little or no taxes at all, even if we had no budget \ndeficits fairness and equality would demand that we address these \npreposterous discrepancies.\n  Our budget crisis, however, brings new urgency to the problem. As we \ncontinue to debate ways to close the budget gap, I hope my Republican \ncolleagues will revisit the potential to significantly cut the deficit \nby addressing tax loopholes, tax gimmicks, tax subsidies, and the daily \ninjustice to the ordinary taxpayer when the wealthiest and highest \nincome Americans pay tax rates that are the equivalent to an ordinary \ntruckdriver in Rhode Island, and the basic lawyer or realtor or doctor \nis paying rates far, far higher than the super, superrich.\n  I see other colleagues have come to the floor, so I will yield the \nfloor to them and appreciate very much the attention that has been paid \nto these remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). With some reservation, the \nSenator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, there is a prohibition in the U.S. \nConstitution from cruel and unusual punishment, and the fact that you \nwill be presiding in the chair when I am going to be speaking on an \namendment which you are offering is truly cruel and unusual, but I am \ngoing to inflict it anyway. I will try to be as gentle as I can in the \nprocess.\n  Very briefly, I want to thank the Senator from Rhode Island for his \ncomments on the Tax Code and the need we have in this country to \naddress taxes in a responsible, humane, and, I would add, progressive \nway. I think he has made the point over and over again, which I will \nmake myself in just a few moments, and I think the Senator from Vermont \nmay follow me.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/07/senate-section/article/S3517-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3517-S3518]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DEBIT CARD SWIPE FEES\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. But before that, I would like to address what is known \naffectionately as the Tester-Corker amendment, which was brought up on \nthe Senate floor earlier this morning by Senator Corker of Tennessee.\n  One year ago--to be more specific, about 11 months ago--we had a big \ndebate on the floor of the Senate about Wall Street: What are we going \nto do about Wall Street and the practices on Wall Street which hurt our \neconomy? Especially we were worried about the last recession and some \nof the things that happened on Wall Street at the biggest banks and \nbiggest insurance companies that hurt Americans across the board; that \nreduced the value of our savings and caused us as a Congress, with \nPresident Bush's cooperation, to pass a basic bailout bill sending \nbillions of dollars to these banks that had made stupid, reckless \ndecisions that wrecked the economy; to try to save them from going \nunder.\n  Think about that. Here are the biggest financial institutions in the \nUnited States that have made terrible decisions--some failed, such as \nLehman Brothers--which harmed our overall economy--we are still \nsuffering from it--harmed individual families and businesses across the \nboard, and then, as they were about to sink out of sight, they said: \nYou have to save us. Send us taxpayers' money.\n  Well, I will tell you something: I voted for that. I am not proud or \nhappy about that, but that is the situation. But when the Chairman of \nthe Federal Reserve and the Secretary of the Treasury came and said, as \nthey did to us: This could be a catastrophe equal to the Great \nDepression if you do not do something--I thought to myself: This \nviolates every value I have about these Wall Street financiers and the \nway they operate, but I cannot let the American economy go down. I \nthink many Senators felt the same way on both sides of the aisle.\n  So we sent them billions of dollars to keep them afloat after their \nterrible decisions. How did they reward us? What was the thank-you card \nthey sent to the taxpayers of America? They gave themselves bonuses--\nmultimillion-dollar bonuses. These same banks, in their reckless \nstupidity, driving us into a recession, bailed out by taxpayers, then \ncame back and announced they were giving each other rewards for great \nperformance--millions of dollars. It finally ended up being billions of \ndollars to these big banks. Outrageous.\n  So last year we sat down with the Wall Street reform bill, the Dodd-\nFrank bill, and said: We are going to change some of the rules you play \nby up on Wall Street so you never have a chance to do this to America \nagain.\n  We went through a broad array of things we considered. One of the \nthings we considered affects virtually every single American; that is, \nthe use of something called a debit card.\n\n[[Page S3518]]\n\n  We may not think twice about it, but for those of us who have been \naround a little while, there was a time when we had cash in our wallets \nand a checkbook. Those were the two ways we paid for things. Then came \ncredit cards. Then came this new invention called a debit card. A debit \ncard is basically a plastic check. When we swipe that debit card for a \ntransaction, money comes out of our checking accounts and pays the \nmerchant we are doing business with. It is a great convenience. I use \nthem now. I think more than half of purchasers across America are used \nto using debit cards and credit cards every day.\n  But at the same time there was this growth in debit card use across \nAmerica, something else was happening that was entirely invisible to \nthe public. Each time that debit card was swiped, the banks ended up \ntaking a fee. Well, you say: That is not unreasonable. They should be \ntaking a fee. They used to collect a fee for processing checks. Why \nwouldn't they collect a fee for using a debit card? Except something \nwas going on that we were not aware of until we looked into it closely: \nthey were raising the amount they were taking each time the debit card \nwas used to now the highest level debit card transaction fees in the \nworld.\n  The Federal Reserve tells us they charge on average 44 cents every \ntime someone swipes a debit card. In other words, if someone is running \na little store in Springfield, IL, and a person walks in--and I have \nseen this happen--and says they want to buy a $1.29 pack of gum, hands \nover the debit card, and they swipe the debit card, that merchant in \nthat little store has to look at it and say: I just lost money. I am \nnot going to make 44 cents of profit on the sale of that pack of gum. \nNow I have to pay that to the bank and credit card company, 44 cents.\n  So a year ago we said: Let's take a look and see what is a reasonable \ncharge, not what they are charging but what is reasonable to pay to the \nbank and the credit card company. The Federal Reserve, which, if \nanything, has a strong bias toward the banking industry--always has; \nthey are never viewed as a consumer protection agency--came back and \nsaid it ought to be closer to 10 cents or 12 cents, one-third or one-\nfourth of what is actually being charged.\n  So here is what we said: The Federal Reserve established a \nreasonable, proportional debit card swipe fee so consumers and \nretailers across America are not giving to the banks across this \ncountry, particularly the largest banks across this country, a windfall \nevery time a debit card is swiped. It sounds reasonable to me. These \nmerchants had no voice in determining how much was going to be charged \non a debit card transaction. They were stuck with it. It was invisible, \nand it was killing them.\n  Well, what happened? What happened after we passed this? The banks \nand credit card companies across America went on a warpath: We have to \nstop this debit card amendment.\n  They have spent a fortune lobbying Congress, working the Members back \nand forth, saying: You have to protect us. You cannot let this new rule \ngo into effect which reduces the fee we collect every time anyone uses \na debit card.\n  Why would they lose sleep over 44 cents? Add it up. Every month in \nAmerica the banks are collecting $1.3 billion from consumers across \nAmerica. Every time we use a debit card to buy gasoline, groceries, go \nto a hotel, restaurant, make a contribution to the Red Cross in the \nmiddle of disaster, pay tuition at a university, they are taking a \npercentage out of every transaction to the tune of $1.3 billion a \nmonth. That is why. They have moved Heaven and Earth to stop this new \nrule from going into effect which reduces the fees these banks--over \nhalf of them, the largest Wall Street banks--are collecting.\n  We are going to have a vote on it this week. It is an important vote, \nand it is a vote I think will be a test as to whether we are going to \ncome down on the side of consumers, small businesses, and retailers in \nAmerica, or on the side of the Wall Street banks and the credit card \ncompanies.\n  Interesting test, isn't it, to find out where the Senate is going to \ncome down on this issue? I think it will be a close vote. I am not \nsure, but I think it will be close, and it is important.\n  Senator Corker of Tennessee came to the Senate floor earlier and \nsaid: Well, we have come up with a solution. There is a new version of \nour amendment today which we are going to offer. Some Members have \ncalled it a compromise. It is not a compromise. A compromise suggests \nthat both sides came together and agreed on something. There has not \nbeen any input from the retailers, small businesses, and consumers \nacross America. The only compromise is among the big banks and the \nbigger banks in terms of what they are going to collect on these debit \ncards.\n  I will tell you point blank, if the purpose of this amendment is to \nprotect credit unions and community banks, there is a way to do it. We \ncan give them more reassurances beyond what the law already says, which \nI think is totally adequate for what we need to do. This amendment, \nthis so-called solution amendment, does not even address it. What it \naddresses is the overall issue and the billion dollars-plus that these \nbanks want to keep collecting while a so-called study goes on for \nanother year. They want to include, incidentally, in the ``reasonable \ncost'' for the debit card executive compensation, compensation of bank \nofficials.\n  How much compensation do we give to those who work at the Wall Street \nbanks? It turns out last year it was $20.8 billion in executive \ncompensation. They want to add that in as part of the operational cost \nof using a debit card. The bonuses? We are going to pay for the \nbonuses? That is a reasonable debit card cost?\n  I want to tell you, this amendment is written by and for the banks, \nthe biggest banks of all, and it is not written with the consumers in \nmind. Look through all the organizations of this new amendment and try \nto find one consumer group, one small business group, one group of \nretailers that were part of establishing what a reasonable fee is. You \nwill not find them. They are all banking regulators--people who have no \nreputation for standing up for consumers.\n  So the debate will ensue for the rest of this week on this amendment. \nI think it is a critical amendment. I hope my colleagues will stand by \nme and the Federal Reserve in the vote we took last year.\n  I see the Senator from Vermont is here. I was told I had a few \nminutes to speak. He appears anxious, so I am going to make my remarks \non the other subject brief.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/07/senate-section/article/S3518-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3518-S3519]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             BUSH TAX CUTS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the Senator from Rhode Island spoke about \nthe 10th anniversary of the George W. Bush tax cuts. These were tax \ncuts that primarily benefitted the wealthiest people in America, and we \nrecently renewed them. There was a decision made that to keep the \neconomy moving forward we were not going to raise taxes, even on the \nwealthiest people.\n  But it is worth reflection for a moment about what happened when we \ncut the taxes 10 years ago. The promise then is the same promise we now \nhear from the other side of the aisle: If you will cut taxes on the \nwealthiest people in America, our economy will flourish.\n  Well, it turns out that was not the case at all. In fact, what \nhappened is that we saw the economy suffer. Ten years ago, President \nBush signed into law the first massive tax cut. He said that this tax \nrelief would create jobs. The month the first Bush tax cuts were signed \ninto law, in June of 2001, the American economy had 132 million jobs--\n132 million jobs. Three years later, we were down to 131.4 million. \nCutting taxes for the wealthiest people in America was not a job \nstimulator. The economy lost jobs in the 3 years following the Bush tax \ncuts. Over his 8 years in office, job growth under President Bush was \n4.8 percent, compared to 16.2 percent under President Clinton.\n  Before I defer to my colleague from Vermont, I will tell you one \nother fact that is worth noting. First, when President Clinton left \noffice and President George W. Bush took over, we had a surplus, a \nsurplus that was keeping the Social Security trust fund flush with \nmoney and growing in strength. At that time, the net national debt, \naccumulated since George Washington, $5 trillion--$5 trillion when \nClinton left office and Bush took over. Fast forward\n\n[[Page S3519]]\n\n8 years later as George W. Bush left office. What was the situation? \nThe national debt had more than doubled to more than $10 trillion, and \nthe projected deficit for the next fiscal year for President Obama--his \nfirst fiscal year--$1.2 trillion, the highest in history.\n  What happened? We waged two wars and did not pay for them--wars in \nIraq and Afghanistan. We added to the national debt. And President \nBush, for the first time in the history of the United States, did \nsomething no other President had done: He cut taxes in the midst of a \nwar, which is counterintuitive; you do not have enough money to pay for \nthe ordinary expenses of government, now you have got the new expenses \nof war, and you are cutting taxes?\n  Not surprisingly, this added dramatically to our national debt. So \nnow comes the Republican side again, with our economy still \nrecovering--unfortunately too slowly--and their recipe is tax cuts for \nthe wealthy. I would say those of us who are fortunate to live in this \ngreat country and have the comfort of a good salary should not begrudge \npaying this country's debts and this country's needs. I think it is \npart of our responsibility of citizenship.\n  There are those who are struggling to get by in lower income and \nmiddle-income categories who I think need a helping hand. But those at \nthe highest levels of income--over $250,000 a year, over $500,000 a \nyear--should not be angry about accepting more responsibility in trying \nto help this Nation move forward.\n  The Bush tax cuts did not help create jobs, they caused the deficit \nto explode and they made it even worse in terms of our inequality of \nincome. Why would we want to do that again? There are 13.9 million \npeople in this country who want to work but cannot find a job; millions \nmore have accepted fewer hours and less income than they like out of \ndesperation.\n  We should be focusing now on creating jobs in America, good-paying \njobs that stay right here at home. We ought to be helping middle- and \nlower income families who are struggling to get by. We ought to deal \nwith our deficit in honest terms, cutting spending where there is waste \nand misuse of funds, and then saying, we need revenue on the table as \nwell.\n  We need to make sure we have a bipartisan approach for this. I will \ncontinue in that effort to try to reach that goal. But I hope we have \nlearned a lesson over the last 10 years when it comes to tax cuts for \nthe wealthy. They led us to the highest deficits in our history. At \nthis point, I am afraid using that recipe again will create even more \neconomic hardship.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/07/senate-section/article/S3519-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3519]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 782, which the clerk will report by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 782) to amend the Public Works and Economic \n     Development Act of 1965 to reauthorize that Act, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, as the chairman of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee who watched with pleasure as we voted this bill \nout of our committee with total unanimous support--except for one, we \nalmost had everyone--I am delighted that the leader has chosen to go to \nthe reauthorization of the Economic Development Administration.\n  I will tell you why. There are three reasons: jobs, jobs, jobs. We \nknow when President Obama took over, he faced a situation where we were \nlosing 700,000 to 800,000 jobs a month. Imagine. We were bleeding those \njobs. Credit was frozen. We almost lost the auto industry. We had to \ntake tremendous steps to turn this around.\n  I personally believe, after listening to the experts evaluate what we \ndid, that we did some very important work to stabilize this economy. \nBut clearly this recession we are trying to get out of is the worst \nsince the Great Depression. The job loss has been severe. So it is very \ndifficult. When you lose 7, 8 million jobs in that kind of a downturn, \nyou need robust job creation to get these jobs back.\n  We had a very important bill on the floor dealing with small \nbusiness--to help small business. That bill was loaded with a bunch of \nextraneous amendments and it never got off the floor. Now is our \nchance. I do not mind it if people attach amendments that they think \nare very important, and we have some reasonable time set aside for \nthose, we have votes on those. I do not have any problem with that. But \nwe have got to get on with the business of job creation.\n  Let me tell you a little bit about the EDA. For 50 years, the EDA, \nthe Economic Development Administration, has created jobs and spurred \ngrowth in economically hard-hit communities. This bill, S. 782, will \nensure that EDA will continue to create employment opportunities, \nmaintain existing jobs, and drive local economic growth.\n  We know the EDA's authorization expired in 2008. And, by the way, the \nlast time it was voted on it was I believe under George Bush, and it \nwas done by voice vote. Even in the House it was an overwhelmingly \nbipartisan vote. George Bush signed it. Can't we get back to the days \nof bipartisanship? I say to my colleagues, this is the moment.\n  A bill that has been voted out of the committee with near unanimous \nconsent, a program that has been in place since 1965, and we know these \nare tough times. All of our communities are going through tough times--\nmost of our communities are.\n  The EDA has worked beautifully with local communities to spur \neconomic development. EDA provides a wide range of assistance to these \nareas. They fund water and sewer improvements. They help manufacturers \nand producers become more competitive. And here is the thing about \nthese investments: They attract State dollars, local dollars, nonprofit \ndollars, private company dollars, so that every dollar we put into this \nprogram yields us $7 in private sector investment.\n  This is the first point I want to make to my colleagues and to the \nAmerican people. EDA leverages Federal dollars to create jobs. One \ndollar of Economic Development Administration investment is expected to \nattract $7 in private sector investment. This comes from congressional \ntestimony in March of 2011. That is why we got such a great vote out of \nour committee.\n  You are going to hear from Senator Cardin later, who serves in a very \nsenior position on that committee. It is rare that we have these type \nof votes. Since January of 2009, even though the EDA was not \nreauthorized, it still continued to go along under the old program. It \ncontinued to go along with appropriations.\n  Since 2009, public-private projects that grantees have looked at say \nthey have created 161,500 jobs. Let's look at that chart. This is good \nnews. I have good news today. This is a program that is working for the \nAmerican people. Since January 2009, EDA has funded public-private \nprojects that grantees estimate have created 161,500 jobs.\n  What we bring to you is a reauthorization of a very popular program \nthat has been in place since 1965, that has always had tremendous \nbipartisan support, that is working on the ground, that the local \npeople love. Let me tell you who has already endorsed this bill: the \nU.S. Conference of Mayors, the American Public Works Association, the \nNational Association of Counties, the American Planning Association, \nthe Association of University Research Parks, the Educational \nAssociation of University Centers, the International Economic \nDevelopment Council, the National Association of Development \nOrganizations, the National Business Incubation Association, the State \nScience and Technology Institute, the University Economic Development \nAssociation, the National Association of Regional Councils. These are \npeople on\n\n[[Page S3520]]\n\nthe ground very close to our constituents. Who could be closer than the \nmayors and the counties? I started out as a county supervisor in a \nbeautiful county called Marin. I can tell you on the ground, when you \nsee these Federal dollars work it is very exciting because the cities \nand counties cannot do it alone. With the infusion of Federal funds, \nthat sparks $7 of every $1 from private sector folks, and it makes a \ndifference. I believe this is a win-win situation for our people.\n\n  In fiscal year 2010 alone, EDA approved investments of $640 million \nfor 928 projects nationwide that are expected to create 74,000 jobs, \nsave 22,000 jobs, and leverage $10 billion in private investment. So \n$640 million is expected to leverage $10 billion in private investment. \nThat is a huge leverage.\n  In my home State of California, we are struggling, as so many parts \nof the country are, with unemployment rates. In California, EDA \napproved investments of $24 million in fiscal year 2010 for 27 projects \nexpected to create 11,000 jobs, save 400 jobs, and leverage $400 \nmillion in private investment. As I stand here now, because of this \nprogram, in 2011, we are going to see jobs saved and created. Imagine, \n11,000 new jobs--11,000 families who can breathe easier, pay their \nmortgage, and maybe go out to a restaurant once a week. That money \ntrickles into the community and helps the small businesses.\n  We now know that in California, the city of Dixon is working on a $3 \nmillion program for water system improvements. That is 1,000 jobs.\n  There is a project in the city of Shafter for $2 million for sewer \nand water improvements, which will allow development of an additional \n600 acres, and it will create 1,485 jobs and leverage $253 million in \nprivate investment. Nationwide, you could look at Boeing. We all know \nabout Boeing. To help to mitigate Boeing's decision to reduce \nmanufacturing jobs in Renton, WA, EDA invested $2 million in 2006 to \nhelp build infrastructure to serve the commercial redevelopment of a \n42-acre aircraft manufacturing site. This redevelopment has created a \nmixed-use campus used by businesses focusing on commercial services, \nhigh-tech, and life sciences, which has helped create 2,500 jobs.\n  I say to my friends that right now we are struggling getting to the \nbill. At this point in time, we have a Republican dissenter who doesn't \nwant us to move forward, and they want to look at this. I hope they \nlook at these numbers. The American people want jobs. This is a bill \nthat is directly related to job creation. This is a bill that leverages \nthe Federal dollar. Why on Earth should there be any objection? This is \na bill that passed the Senate unanimously when George W. Bush was \nPresident. He signed it and it was law. We should not be struggling \nover going to this bill. We ought to get on the bill and then get off \nthe bill and send a message to the people that we are serious about job \ncreation.\n  In Duluth, a $3.5 million grant, matched by $2.3 million from the \ncity, helped build the Duluth Aviation Business Incubator at the Duluth \nAirport. This investment helped Cirrus Aircraft grow from a handful of \nemployees to 1,012 employees by 2008. The incubator is now leased to \nCirrus Design Corporation, which has the largest share of the worldwide \ngeneral aviation market.\n  Here is another one on the east coast. In 2002, EDA provided $2 \nmillion to help build the Knowledge Works pre-incubator facility as \npart of the development of the Virginia Tech Corporate Research Center \nin Blacksburg, VA. The center and its Knowledge Works pre-incubator \nfacility have led to the creation of 2,000 high-wage jobs and the \ninception of 140 high-tech businesses. Repeating, a $2 million infusion \nfrom the EDA led to the creation of 2,000 high-wage jobs and the \ninception of 140 high-tech businesses. They built this corporate \nresearch center in Blacksburg, VA.\n  EDA helps with disaster relief. In addition to helping communities \nrespond to job loss due to the closure of a manufacturing plant or \ndefense facility, for example, EDA helps communities respond to sudden \nand severe economic dislocations to the natural disaster.\n  In 2008, Congress provided EDA with a total of $500 million in \nnatural disaster assistance through two supplemental appropriations. \nWith these funds, EDA was able to assume the role of a secondary \nresponder working with affected communities to support long-term, \npostdisaster economic recovery in response to hurricanes, floods, and \nother natural disasters. We know how important it is to have a program \nthat can respond and help FEMA.\n  I can give you example after example of disaster relief. There was \none case in Cedar Rapids, IA, where EDA provided funding to construct \nand install an upgraded, energy-efficient, natural gas-fired boiler \nsystem following a 2008 flood that destroyed the boiler that had \nprovided steam heat and hot water to St. Luke's Hospital and Coe \nCollege. When the utility that owned the damaged facility decided not \nto rebuild after the flood, it left the hospital and college without a \nreliable energy supply. We all know what happens when there is a \ndisaster and our hospitals cannot function. They came in and made a \n$4.6 million investment, and it was critical in keeping the hospital \nand college open, saving hundreds of jobs.\n  I can only say, in closing my opening remarks, let's step back and \nlook at the big picture. I think Dick Durbin spoke to it quite \neloquently. Senator Durbin was very clear when he said we are at a time \nnow where we have to create jobs. He gave kind of the overview of what \nhas happened.\n  When Bill Clinton was President, I was privileged enough to be here, \nsent by the people of California--my first term here. Bill Clinton \nfaced a deficit, a debt, and a struggling economy. But with very smart \nplans, we turned it around. What were the smart plans? We reduced the \ndeficit to zero, but we did it in a smart way. How did we do it? We \nkept on making investments that made sense at that time in energy, \nhigh-tech research, biomedical research. We made those investments. We \ncut the fraud and waste. We said to billionaires: You know what, you \ncan do more for us, please. They are happy to do it, actually. So the \nmillionaires and the billionaires paid their fair share, and we made \nsmart investments and cut the waste, fraud, and abuse. We not only \nbalanced the budget, but we created a surplus.\n  In comes George W. Bush, and our Republican friends decided that the \nthing they wanted to do more than anything was give tax breaks to the \nbillionaires and millionaires--to the Warren Buffets, who don't need \nit, and to the Donald Trumps, who don't need it. They don't need it. \nThe average of these tax cuts to these millionaires and billionaires \nwas hundreds of thousands a year. What that means is, we are short \nfunds here.\n  What do our Republican friends want to do now? They want to cut \nMedicare--end it--in order to continue to pay for the tax cuts for the \nmillionaires. It is not necessary to go down that road.\n  That is not before us today. What is before us today is, in the \nbattle of how to get that deficit under control, what are we going to \ndo about jobs. Today, we are looking at a program that has strong \nbipartisan support, that leverages the Federal dollars, that gets great \nreviews, that got out of our committee with only one dissenting vote; \nthat is, the EDA, the Economic Development Administration. They have \nsix regions. They have six regional offices, and each region--including \nEast, West, Midwest, South--gets a fair share of the appropriations. It \ngoes to places that have good ideas on how to attract local and State \nnonprofit and private sector funding. Every $1 of EDA investment is \nexpected to attract $7 in private sector investment, thereby saving and \ncreating thousands and thousands of good jobs.\n  I understand my Republican friends are going to have a discussion at \nlunchtime as to whether to allow this bill to move forward. I hope, \nfrom the bottom of my heart, they will do so.\n  I yield to Senator Cardin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, let me compliment Senator Boxer for her \nleadership as chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee. I \nalso compliment Senator Inhofe, the ranking member.\n  This is an important bill, dealing with economic development and the \nEconomic Development Administration. This is all about creating jobs, \nas Senator Boxer pointed out, particularly in underserved communities. \nThat is what EDA does.\n  This is a reauthorization bill. It was worked on in the last \nCongress. It came\n\n[[Page S3521]]\n\nout of the Environment and Public Works Committee in the last Congress. \nIt enjoys strong bipartisan support. Historically, it has been agreed \nto. It is important this reauthorization bill move through the Senate \nand the House and that the President has an opportunity to sign this \nbill so we can continue this important economic tool for our \nunderserved communities.\n  I also compliment the majority leader, Senator Reid. The bills he has \nbrought forward in this Congress have been focused on creating jobs. We \nhad the FAA reauthorization bill, which was important for the \nmodernization and safety of our air traffic system, but it also created \njobs and provided economic opportunity for more jobs in America.\n  We then considered the SBIR bill, which would have helped small \nbusinesses with innovation, growth, and job growth. I regret that that \nbill could not be completed because of extraneous amendments. But it \nshows our priority on moving legislation forward that will create jobs.\n  The EDA bill now before us I hope we can get to and move it quickly \nbecause it is, to me, a very important part of our strategy for the \nrecovery of our economy and to create jobs in particularly underserved \ncommunities.\n  In Maryland, we have many communities that depend upon EDA funding in \norder to save and create jobs. The EDA, through the economic \ndevelopment districts, is helping plan to build roads, spread commerce, \noffice parks, business centers, and for private sector businesses to \nlocate to and expand access to broadband, which is critical to \ncommunication in today's global economy. These are the types of \nprojects EDA sponsors. There are road projects and broadband to connect \ncommunities together.\n  EDA is responsible for promoting job growth and accelerating \nindustrial and commercial development in communities suffering from \nlimited job opportunities, low per capita income levels, and economic \ndistress.\n  As the only Federal agency focusing solely on promoting private \nsector job growth in economically underserved communities, EDA pursues \nregional comprehensive strategy development, public works, and business \nloan funds. They put together a strategy for our areas that have high \nunemployment, areas that are difficult to attract new job \nopportunities. They developed a winning strategy to create jobs.\n\n  In Maryland, the EDA and our State university centers and economic \ndevelopment districts are responsible for helping administrate public \nworks projects in rural communities on the Eastern Shore and in the \nwestern part of our State. These projects have assisted with the \nregional commercial needs as well as services to meet the needs of \nresidents.\n  For example, the EDA has been essential in assisting with the \nplanning and installation of the broadband communication network in \nwestern Maryland. Maryland will be a State that will be totally \nconnected by the broadband. EDA has helped to bring that into \nunderserved areas. We are connecting communities together by having \njobs in broadband capacity.\n  It is also helping us create more small business opportunities, which \nis what we find is the dominant economic growth engine. We know in the \nNation overall it is small businesses, but when we are dealing with \nunderserved communities, small business growth is critical to their \neconomic future. These investments go toward revitalizing, expansion, \nand upgrading of physical infrastructure in order to attract new \nindustries, encourage business expansion and diversify local economies. \nIn so doing, EDA seeks to establish foundations that enable communities \nto develop their own economic development programs for sustained \ndevelopment.\n  The EDA has an established and proven record of using increasingly \nlimited resources to complete projects in a timely manner that \nleverage--leverage--private sector investment. Senator Boxer pointed \nthat out. We are leveraging private sector investment with a relatively \nsmall amount of public funds.\n  In my home State of Maryland, EDA has supported more than 33 projects \nin the last 4 years that are credited with creating more than 2500 \njobs, retaining over 100 jobs, and leveraging $218 million in private \ninvestment from $12 million in EDA investments. That is a much higher \nratio than the average, as Senator Boxer pointed out. It is important \nwe provide EDA with the resources necessary to continue this work. Many \nof these projects are in the more rural or underserved parts of the \nState.\n  Most recently, EDA provided seed money for two exciting projects on \nMaryland's Eastern Shore. In Dorchester County, near the town of \nCambridge, on the Eastern Shore, the EDA is investing more than \n$600,000 in the renovation and repair of an existing vacant industrial \nbuilding to be reused by a new manufacturing company that specializes \nin the production of green products made from recyclable materials.\n  This is a win, win, win situation. This is a project that will \nrestore a defunct industrial facility--recycling an industrial \nfacility--and saving jobs on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. It reduces \nmaterial waste by making new products out of recyclable waste material, \nhelping us with our energy and environmental policies, and saving 103 \njobs while creating 20 new jobs. These 103 jobs would have been lost. \nInstead, we now have 123 jobs in an area where it is difficult to \nattract new jobs. It is leveraging more than $600,000 in direct \ninvestment in a facility that is expected to generate $6.6 million in \nprivate investment once the facility is operational, once again, \nreferring to what Senator Boxer said, the leveraging of public funds \nfor private investment in underserved areas and saving and creating \njobs. This means for every Federal dollar invested, it generates $10 in \nprivate investment.\n  The economies of Wicomico, Worcester, and Somerset Counties have \nhistorically been linked to the health of the Chesapeake Bay. Years of \nChesapeake Bay impairment have taken their toll on the bay's fisheries. \nClosely linked to the bay's impairment is the decline in lowland forest \nlands due to development pressures. The effects of these natural \nresource crises have resulted in the decline of jobs in the seafood \nharvesting and forestry industries on the lower shore. It is a priority \nof mine to restore the health of the Chesapeake Bay and the natural \nsystems and jobs that support a healthy bay.\n  I also support the immediate work the EDA is doing to address the \ndecline in jobs in the traditional industries on the lower shore by \ninvesting over $800,000 in workforce and business development centers \nthat serve the lower counties of the Eastern Shore.\n  Much of the hard work that goes into selecting and developing \nprojects is done by the hardworking men and women on the ground working \nfor the local economic development districts and the university \ncenters. These are the ones with the best understanding of the economic \nneeds in the communities in which they work. That is why I worked hard \nwith my colleagues on the Environment and Public Works Committee to \nimprove the potential resources available to economic development \ndistricts to do the necessary planning for economic development \nprojects in their districts.\n  Planning funds are hard to come by, but planning funds are essential. \nWhen the Environment and Public Works Committee took up the bill last \nCongress, the issue my economic development district urged me to fight \nfor was increasing the authorization level for planning grants because \nthey were so useful to the work they were doing and represented a sound \ninvestment of Federal dollars in the communities that needed the help \nthe most. Planning grants provide invaluable matching funds for \neconomic development districts, tribes, and local communities to pursue \nregional economic development goals and strategies.\n  None of the projects the economic development district helps \nadminister would be possible without these planning grants. The demands \non the economic development districts have increased significantly due \nto the current economic downturn as well as the new mandates by the EDA \nand the evolving nature of the global economy. The scope of the \neconomic development districts' work goes well beyond EDA's projects \nand spans into planning and coordination of rural transportation \nprojects, USDA rural health and water systems projects as well as HUD \nprojects.\n\n[[Page S3522]]\n\n  Without the annual planning investment EDA provides through the \neconomic development districts, most rural areas would not have the \ncapacity to apply for or administer economic development resources. The \nplanning and administrative work done by the economic development \ndistricts is the backbone of EDA's public works and facilities \ndevelopment projects and would not be possible without the planning \ngrants.\n  I greatly appreciate the leadership of Senator Boxer and Senator \nInhofe on our committee, and I am pleased by the bipartisan support of \nour committee that brought out a comprehensive bill, including the \nareas I have mentioned, that will allow EDA to continue its core \npurpose of creating jobs for our community. It is exactly this type of \nlegislation we need to help continue our economic growth to bring us \nout of this recession, to create the type of jobs we need, and to \nencourage private sector capital.\n  This bill translates into jobs. I urge my colleagues to allow this \nbill to move forward, to limit the amendments, particularly those that \nare not relevant to the underlying legislation, so we can get this bill \nto the House and to the President because it will help our communities \ngrow and create jobs.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Remembering Governor Walter Peterson\n\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory of \nGovernor Walter Peterson--a great New Hampshire citizen who represented \nthe very best of the Granite State's independent spirit.\n  Governor Peterson came from what is well-known as the ``greatest \ngeneration,'' and he more than lived up to that label. A veteran of \nWorld War II, he committed his life to public service and civic \nengagement, leaving behind a legacy of civility, decency, and integrity \nin politics.\n  Following his graduation from Dartmouth College, Governor Peterson \nsettled in Peterborough, NH, becoming a lifelong figure in the \nMonadnock region. A small businessman, he went on to serve in New \nHampshire's citizen legislature and rose to the position of speaker of \nthe house. In 1968, New Hampshire voters elected him as the State's \nGovernor, a position he held for two terms.\n  Governor Peterson represented a special breed of politician--someone \nwho could disagree without being disagreeable. A strong leader, he had \nthe courage of his convictions. He believed it was more important to \nstand firm for what he believed was right for New Hampshire rather than \nworry about being reelected. That principled approach and inherent \ngoodness secured his place in New Hampshire history as a deeply \nrespected statesman.\n  Outside of public life, Governor Peterson was the beloved patriarch \nof his family. Together with his wife Dorothy, to whom he was married \nfor over 60 years, they had two children, Meg and Andy. The Peterson \nfamily is well known in the Monadnock region because of their strong \ncommitment and dedication to the community. Andy Peterson followed in \nhis father's footsteps and served in our State legislature with \ndistinction.\n  During my visits to Peterborough--the idyllic New Hampshire town \nGovernor Peterson lived in and loved--I always knew he would extend a \nwarm welcome to me. A steadfast source of Yankee wisdom, I came to \ncherish Governor Peterson's friendship as much as his keen insight into \nthe people of New Hampshire.\n  After leaving statewide office, Governor Peterson took his special \nbrand of leadership to academia, serving as a college president and as \na trustee of the university system of New Hampshire. In those roles, he \nworked to build institutions of higher learning that empowered students \nto take full advantage of the opportunities our great country provides, \nbelieving in the transformative power of education.\n  With Governor Peterson's passing, New Hampshire citizens have lost a \nwonderful, true, and loyal friend. At this sad time, we celebrate his \nlife, grateful to have known a leader who embodied the very best of \npublic service.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, when we are able to move the economic \ndevelopment bill, I will have a bipartisan amendment that will address \nthe interchange issue in a way I think most Senators can support.\n  I wish also to note that I appreciate Senator Durbin's passion on the \nissue--and with any number of issues we have in common--and I look \nforward to working with him again very soon.\n  Most of the folks in this body know I am a farmer; that I come from \nthe agricultural sector. It is important because, over the many years I \nhave been able to be in agriculture, I have watched consolidation in \nagriculture, where fewer and fewer companies control more and more of \nthe food supply. We call it consolidation. The same thing has occurred \nin our energy sector, where we have fewer and fewer companies, with \nless competition in the marketplace. And we are paying that price in \nboth areas.\n  We have seen enough consolidation in the financial area. Why is this \nimportant? It is important because the amendment I am going to offer--\nthe bipartisan amendment--will help so that we don't further \nconsolidate the financial industry. I also come from rural America. We \nall know, as the Senator from Illinois pointed out, that we are coming \nout of a very difficult economic time. In fact, the Senator pointed out \nhe voted for the bailout of the big banks because it was for jobs. I \nwant the record to be clear that I did not vote for that TARP bailout, \nbut I too am concerned about jobs. I am concerned about jobs across the \ncountry, but particularly in rural America.\n  The amendment we voted on a year ago had a provision in it that \nexempted banks under $10 billion from this debit swipe fee rule. \nEverybody thought it would work--at least those who voted for the \namendment thought it would work. But the fact is every regulator has \nsaid, with regard to this $10 billion exemption, we don't know how to \nenforce it. The regulators have said, we do not know how to craft a \nrule to exempt those small community banks and credit unions under $10 \nbillion.\n  The single regulators have said the same thing. In fact, Chairman \nBernanke admitted the rule could ``result in some of the smaller banks \nbeing less profitable and even failing.'' That is because the two-\ntiered system will not work under the current law. That is not my \nopinion. That is the opinion of the folks whose job it is to regulate \nthese banks. And the customers--the hard-working folks--are going to \nget stuck with higher fees, potentially no access to capital or, even \nworse, no local banks at all--further consolidation in the banking \nindustry.\n  Let me be clear. If any one of the regulators--the Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve, the Chair of the FDIC, the Comptroller of the \nCurrency--told me that the interchange rule we passed last year would \nactually protect small banks, I would not be here, we would not even be \nhere having this debate, we would be moving on. But that is not what \nhappened.\n  The Wall Street banks are going to be just fine. My amendment is not \nabout the Wall Street banks. They can distribute their costs. They have \na lot of different irons in the fire. They can distribute their costs. \nThe fact is, the small banks, credit unions and community banks cannot \ndistribute those costs. That will result in less access to capital in \nrural America and I think across the country. It will result in fewer \njobs because you have to have capital to grow business and create jobs.\n  Oftentimes we make decisions based on incorrect information. It is \nnice when you make decisions based on good information, and that is \nwhat we are asking to do here: Take a step back, take a look at this \nstuff, and make a good decision, a decision that will work not only for \nrural America but for the whole country.\n  This is an important amendment. It is a critically important \namendment, from my perspective. If we shut down access to capital in \nrural America because community banks and credit unions cannot compete, \nnot only will\n\n[[Page S3523]]\n\nwe further consolidate the financial industry but we will take away \nopportunity for small businesses, opportunity that will allow them to \ngrow and create jobs at a time when we need growth in our economy and \nwe need more job creation.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/07/senate-section/article/S3523-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3523]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, earlier today I was on the floor speaking \nabout the importance of a program called the economic development \nrevitalization. It has been in place since 1965. It has run out of its \nauthority. Our committee, the Environment and Public Works Committee, \nin a near unanimous vote--almost unanimous--decided it was really worth \nmaking some reforms to the program to make it work even better and to \nreauthorize it.\n  I am going to turn the time over to my wonderful friend, Jim Inhofe. \nHe and I, as everybody knows, are good friends. We work very well \ntogether. There are issues on which we sharply disagree. I think they \nwould fall on the environmental side. But when it comes to public \nworks, when it comes to building the infrastructure of our country, \nwhen it comes to jobs related to the private sector, we are very much \njoined at the hip. On this particular issue, we are together because we \nlook at this and we say that at a time when there need to be jobs, over \na 2-year period beginning in 2009, grantees estimate that EDA-funded \nprojects created over 160,000, and for every $1 invested by the Federal \nGovernment $7 came from the private sector.\n  It is my pleasure to yield to make sure my ranking member has \nsufficient time for whatever he would like to speak to this issue.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, the EDA is something that has worked very \nwell in our State of Oklahoma. First, let me say the Senator from \nCalifornia is right--there are many issues on which we do not agree. In \nfact, we have fought tooth and nail for a long time against the cap-\nand-trade and a lot of these environmental issues and will continue to \ndo so. However, what we agree most on is not necessarily the EDA \nprogram but the need for reauthorization of transportation.\n  We have a very serious problem. In my State of Oklahoma, just a short \nwhile ago a young lady, the mother of two small children, was driving \nunder a bridge, and it crumbled and fell and killed her. There are \nthings like that, crises that are going on right now.\n  We were very proud when we had what we thought at the time was a very \nrobust highway reauthorization bill, a transportation reauthorization \nbill in 2005. While the amount sounded like quite a bit, it was really \njust barely enough to maintain what we had. There are some things \ngovernment is supposed to be doing. I am always ranked as one of the \nmost conservative Members, but I am a big spender in areas such as \nnational defense and infrastructure. Those are needs we have.\n  In putting together this bill and taking it out of committee--and it \ndid come out of committee unanimously--there had been a GAO report that \ntalked about duplication. I put in language in order to have them \nidentify anything that would be duplicative so that would come out. \nThat was a little bit of a surprise to a lot of us. I don't question \nthe report. I think it was probably accurate. But we took care of that \nbecause we don't want to have any duplication of efforts.\n  The chairman said there is a 7-to-1 ratio. We have actually done \nbetter than that in the State of Oklahoma. In one area, it was a $2.25 \nmillion EDA grant, in Elgin, OK, which is adjacent to Fort Sill, OK, \nwhich is adjacent to a live range. It was one that was intended to \nactually produce a 150,000-square-foot manufacturing business employing \nmany people. Because this administration axed some of the military \nprograms, it did not turn out to be that beneficial, but the ratio \nthere was still well in excess of 10 to 1.\n  If we want to get the economy moving, this is a way of doing it. We \nhave to do it in a way that is well thought out. I am hoping this bill \nwill be. It is my understanding it will be open to amendments, and \nthere will be a lot of amendments and a lot of my friends who are not \nsupportive of this want to have this vehicle for that purpose. I \ncertainly respect that and look forward to working on this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the ranking member. I know he has \na series of meetings and he is off to those, but I again thank him. I \nknow he may look at reducing this authority. It is his right to do so. \nMy own opinion is, if there were ever a time to support programs that \nleverage dollars the way this one does, this is one of them. But I \nrespect whatever he feels he needs to do to feel better about the bill.\n  He talked about one of the important amendments he wrote which would \neliminate duplication. There are other reforms that allow private \nparties to buy out the Federal Government investment. There is much we \nhave done to update this program, but it is very important today.\n  The one word I have come to use--perhaps overuse--is ``leverage.'' \nLeverage is crucial. We know we are facing deficits and debts. We know \nwe have to do something about spending, so we want to be wise, we want \nto see that when we do spend $1 of Federal money, it really has a punch \nbehind it. This is one example, again, of that occurring. There is $7, \non average, for every dollar invested, and in the case of Oklahoma, in \nthis one example, $10. There are others where it is even higher than \nthat.\n  I think it is very clear. I am not sure this is the up-to-date list, \nbut we have many supporters of EDA. I am going to show some of them \nhere.\n  The U.S. Conference of Mayors, the American Public Works Association, \nthe National Association of Counties--I mentioned this morning that I \nstarted out in my first elected office as a county supervisor. They \nunderstand how important the EDA is because they are on the ground in \nthese counties, as are the mayors in the cities. They see the needs in \nthese underserved areas, in these redevelopment areas. They want to \nattract the private capital, so they really need the help the EDA gives \nthem to do it.\n  The Association of University Research Parks--let me tell you why \nthey like this. We have seen incubator projects, small business \nincubator projects that start in these research parks that grow into \nmature, job-producing businesses. EDA is the spark, EDA is the leverage \nwe need. That is why you see the Association of University Centers, the \nInternational Economic Development Council, the National Association of \nDevelopment Organizations, the National Business Incubation \nAssociation.\n  We know today it is tough for some businesses to get the capital. \nSome of them are fortunate--they go to Silicon Valley, and they get \nsome dollars there. Some will go to banks, and they will be told it is \ntoo risky. The banks are not lending the way they, frankly, should to \ncreate the jobs, so the leverage that is gotten for these programs from \nthe Federal Government goes a very long way.\n  The State Science and Technology Institute, the University Economic \nDevelopment Association, and the National Association of Regional \nCouncils.\n  We see we have a record of job creation. We have a lot of support, \nand in 2009--this really says it all: 160,000 jobs over a 2-year \nperiod, in 2009. This is a story that is a success story. It is why \nSenator Inhofe and I join together on this issue.\n  I know this is going to be a contentious time in the next few days on \nthis\n\n[[Page S3524]]\n\nbill because some contentious amendments that have nothing to do with \nthe underlying bill are going to be offered. All I would say to \ncolleagues is let's not allow these jobs bills to be weighed down so we \ndo nothing. The American people are sick of it.\n  We have had a small business bill. Mary Landrieu, the chair of the \nSmall Business Committee, stood right here day after day begging \ncolleagues: Don't offer poison pill amendments to that bill. Do you \nknow who lost? Not Mary Landrieu. The American people lost and the \nsmall businesses lost because this bill, the small business bill, \nbecame the way everybody offered everything they had ever dreamed about \nand thought about, and a lot of it was controversial.\n  So I urge colleagues on both sides of the aisle, if you are going to \noffer amendments that are not related, please agree to time agreements. \nLet's get rid of these amendments one way or the other. If they pass, \nfine; if they don't, that is life. But let's get to the reauthorization \nof the EDA. It started in 1965. It has saved jobs, it has created jobs, \nand any problems we have had because of some of the rules, we have \naddressed in this reauthorization.\n  I have here a letter, a legislative alert, hot off the press from the \nAFL-CIO. They support the passage of S. 782, the Economic Development \nRevitalization Act of 2011. They say it ``has played an often \nunheralded but important role in creating jobs and spurring economic \ngrowth in economically distressed communities.''\n\n       The public investments supported by this legislation make a \n     little funding go a long way by leveraging private dollars in \n     support of these projects. Resources for technical assistance \n     and research infrastructure, and assisting in the development \n     and implementation of economic development strategies helps \n     revitalize communities. EDA established an admirable track \n     record in assisting economically troubled low income \n     communities with limited job opportunities by putting their \n     investments to good use in promoting needed job creation and \n     industrial and commercial development.\n       Today when the lack of jobs and income stagnation are the \n     primary issues facing this Nation, S. 782 is a bipartisan \n     bill that can help make a difference. We urge Congress to \n     pass the Economic Development Revitalization Act of 2011.\n\n  I think that really says it.\n  I have one more letter I just got. We have a letter from the U.S. \nChamber, the Business Civic Leadership, saying how much they support \nthe program. They say, ``I am writing to share with you the U.S. \nChamber Business Civic Leadership Center's positive experience in \nworking with the EDA. EDA has served as a valuable partner in many \ncommunities''--they cite ``San Jose, California; Seattle, Washington; \nCedar Rapids, Iowa; Mobile, Alabama; New Orleans, Louisiana; Atlanta, \nGeorgia; Boca Raton, Florida; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Newark, New \nJersey'' and many others.\n  I know some of these programs that went into these cities with this \nrelatively small investment by the Federal Government spurring all this \nprivate sector capital and local and State funds. They say they worked \nwith the EDA in ``conducting regional forums to bring corporate \ncontributions professionals together with economic development \nexperts.'' They provide ``opportunities to build up relationships \nbetween and among companies and government agencies.''\n  They developed ``a report that maps how and why companies invest in \ncommunities across the U.S.''\n  They believe that as they work with them on these programs, including \n``working with local chambers of commerce in disaster affected regions \nto provide local recovery grants,'' that that worked very well.\n  They say they are the ``corporate citizenship arm of the U.S. Chamber \nof Commerce.'' They ``work with thousands of businesses and local \nchambers of commerce on community development and disaster recovery.''\n  They are consistently looking for ``best practices, lessons learned, \ntechnical assistance, planning and strategy support, and other \ninsights, tools, and techniques to make their communities as \neconomically competitive as possible.''\n  They say:\n\n       In our experience EDA members have displayed a high degree \n     of professionalism and technical expertise. They have engaged \n     with us on multiple levels from consultations at the national \n     level to sharing valuable field experience at the state and \n     local levels.\n\n  They say:\n\n       We have canvassed many businesses and local chambers about \n     their community development needs, and they almost \n     unanimously tell us that some of their highest priorities \n     include business recruitment and retention and helping small-\n     and-medium sized businesses grow. They also tell us that \n     support for regional economic development planning that \n     transcends municipal boundaries is an increasing area of \n     interest, and that this is a unique capability that EDA can \n     and does support.\n       As you consider EDA's future roles and responsibilities, we \n     would be happy to share with you our experiences and lessons \n     learned in working with the agency and to provide you with \n     additional information.\n\n  Signed by Stephen Jordan, executive director of the Business Civic \nLeadership Center of the Chamber of Commerce.\n  So here we have an arm of the Chamber of Commerce sending us a letter \nof praise for the EDA, and we have the AFL-CIO doing the same.\n  Senator Inhofe referred to the highway bill. That is another example \nwhere we have both sides coming together, and what I want to say to \ncolleagues who may be watching in their office or hearing this as they \ndo their other work, please, let's get this done.\n  Every single person in this Chamber goes home and talks about jobs, \njobs, jobs. If we mean it, if we are not just posturing or posing for \npictures and we mean it, then let's get it done.\n  We had a bad experience here with the small business bill. It got \nloaded up with things that had nothing to do with anything, and we \ndidn't get time agreements and we couldn't get it done. Let's hope that \nthis gets done.\n  I cannot imagine anybody holding up this bill when we know that in \n2009 it funded over a 2-year period 160,000 jobs at a very small cost \nto Federal taxpayers because that cost is leveraged.\n  I could go on about EDA, and I will later. I think I have spoken \nenough at this particular time.\n  Mr. President, unless there is someone on the floor, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, over the last month, Senator Corker and I \nhave worked with several Senators who are concerned about the \nunintended consequences of the debit interchange amendment the Senate \nadopted last year. We voted against that amendment. We were concerned \nabout the impact of those consequences on folks--especially across \nrural America--who rely on their small local banks and credit unions.\n  The Federal Reserve's rules based on this amendment are about to go \ninto effect, and the result is going to be bad for small banks and \ncredit unions and ultimately for the whole country but especially rural \nAmerica. Even Chairman Bernanke admits that the rule could ``result in \nsome smaller banks being less profitable or even failing.''\n  I am proud to be joined in this effort by Senators Crapo, Bennet, \nHagan, and several others--all folks who share my concern about the \nimpact of debit interchange fees on our local banks.\n  Senator Corker and I began with a concern that local community banks \nand credit unions would end up being subject to the same one-size-fits-\nall regulation designed to address the excesses of some of the world's \nlargest financial institutions. As I have said over and over, those big \nWall Street banks are going to be just fine. They have plenty of \nsources for their revenue. No one needs to shed a tear for them. But \nthe Main Street banks and credit unions will not be OK if these rules \nare implemented.\n  Let me give you one example. Community First Credit Union has two \nbranches--one in Miles City and one in Ekalaka, MT. Those two towns are \nabout as far away from Wall Street as you can get. Ekalaka, in fact, is \npretty far away from just about everywhere. But last year the Senate \napproved an amendment that was aimed at holding the big banks \naccountable for the fees they charge when you swipe your debit card at \nWalmart. Folks were promised we would have a split system where big \nbanks such as Bank of America would get one interchange rate and \nCommunity First Credit Union would be able to get a higher rate. The \nreality is going to be quite different. Without changes, the small guys \nlike Community First will not see this promised benefit.\n  This so-called two-tiered system will not work under the current law. \nThat is not my opinion; it is the opinion of folks who regulate these \nsmall banks.\n  What Ben Bernanke, Sheila Bair, and others say is that market forces \nwill inevitably push the rate down to the lowest level. That push has \nalready started. Retailers are seeking laws at the State level to give \nthemselves the freedom to deny purchases with debit cards that have a \nhigher interchange fee. Given the amount of money the big box retailers \nare putting into their lobbying campaigns, it is only a matter of time \nbefore they are successful. So what happens to the consumer who does \nher banking at a small community bank or credit union? These are the \nfolks I am concerned about because they are the majority of Montanans. \nUnfortunately, they are going to get stuck with higher fees, with no \naccess to capital or, even worse, no banks at all.\n  Let's be clear: If any single one of the regulators--whether it be \nthe Chairman of the Federal Reserve or the Chair of the FDIC or the \nComptroller of the Currency--had told me the interchange system \nproposed last year would actually protect small banks and credit \nunions, we would not be here. But that is not what happened.\n  The Chairman of the Federal Reserve said that without changes, the \nsystem that will be implemented on July 21 will cause small \ninstitutions--the kinds of banks that serve most Montanans--to suffer \nand some could even fail. The Chair of the FDIC said that \nunquestionably these banks would be hurt. The credit union \nadministrator agrees. Perhaps they will make up for those losses by \nraising rates on checking accounts. Maybe it will be higher fees when a \nsmall business comes in looking for a loan to expand. That will surely \nhelp the biggest banks to capture more of the market share at the \nexpense of the smaller banks like Community First.\n  This week, we have a chance to stop and rewrite these rules before \nthey hurt those small banks, before they hurt those small credit \nunions, before the new rules hurt the consumers and the small \nbusinesses in rural America that prefer to do their banking business \nwith folks who know them and who are a part of their communities.\n  Rural America is what I know. It is where I am from. As I have \nwatched consolidation in the agriculture industry and have watched \nrural America get smaller and smaller, I am not about to let this \nhappen in the financial services industry. Fewer banking options in \nrural America is a death knell for rural America, and that is where we \nare headed today. One way to stop this from happening is for us to slow \ndown and fix the debit interchange regulations so the small banks that \nserve rural America do not get hit.\n  We also know how dangerous it is to set a price for a product without \nunderstanding all the costs that go into that product. Small business \nowners certainly could not stay in business if they did not understand \ntheir own costs. Likewise, if we are going to be regulating debit \ninterchange fees, we need to understand all the costs associated with \ndebit transactions and debit programs.\n  When we voted on this amendment last year, we thought we were voting \nto allow the Federal Reserve to consider all costs. However, the \nreality is that last year's interchange amendment limited the costs \nthat could be included. Some fraud costs were allowed to be included \nbut others were not. Some technology costs were included but others \nnot. The result is a proposed Fed rule that sets the debit interchange \nrate at 7 or 12 cents for all transactions--a level most folks agree is \ntoo low.\n  I am sure the big box retailers think 7 cents or 12 cents is too \nhigh. In fact, they have argued that the rate should be closer to 4 \ncents. I have heard from many of my retailers in my home State, and \nsome have said 12 cents is probably too low, and they understand you \nabsolutely cannot set the price of doing business below what it costs \nto do business.\n  If we are going to be regulating this market, we must do it in a way \nthat is fair, in a way that still directs the Fed to determine what is \n``reasonable and proportionate'' but gives them the discretion to look \nat all of the costs associated with debit transactions. That does not \nmean executive pay. That does not mean the cost of a corporate jet or a \nspecial rewards program. All the costs will still need to be justified, \nbut the Fed will not be limited arbitrarily in what they can look at.\n  That is why my friend Senator Corker and I are offering this \namendment today. This amendment is a compromise, and that is how we do \nbusiness in Montana. We find the common ground and we work together to \ndo what is best.\n  Senator Corker and I first proposed a 2-year delay of the Fed's rules \nto allow adequate time to study the impact on small banks and rewrite \nthe rules based on what we learn in that study. The Fed tells us now \nthat it may be able to do this joint study in 6 months. So that is what \nour amendment proposes--just 6 months to study whether the rules that \nwill govern the\n\n[[Page S3529]]\n\ndebit interchange marketplace can protect small banks.\n  In this amendment, we outline the topics the study should address, \nincluding taking a closer look at all of the actual costs associated \nwith debit card transactions, the impact on consumers, and whether an \nexemption for small banks as proposed in the interchange amendment last \nyear will actually work.\n  If, after the study, at least two of the agencies involved determine \nthat the current rules do not take into account all costs, that the \nrules may harm consumers, or that the exemption meant to protect small \nbanks and credit unions will not work, then the Fed has 6 more months \nto rewrite the rules considering all costs.\n  That is 1 year to address our concerns and to make sure rural banks \ndo not get wiped out by this rule. If the agencies find that the rules \nconsider all costs, consumers would not be harmed, and that the small \nissuer exemption will work, then the current rules pending would move \nforward.\n  What about the little guys? We put into place a process that will \naddress any potential impact on small issuers. My contention has long \nbeen that market forces would drive fees for small issuers to the \nlowest rate. Since we cannot fully understand how the market will \noperate until interchange regulation is enacted, we direct the Fed to \nreport the actual impact of the market on small issuers a year after \nthe rules are implemented.\n  The Fed has to present a report to Congress and every other year \nthereafter on the impact of a regulated market on small issuers. Most \nimportantly, the report will include recommendations for how to resolve \nany potential harm to small issuers and to enforce the exemption.\n  This will help make sure that when Congress acts, we will have the \nfacts about how we would impact small banks. That means the regulatory \nprocess is over in 12 months, and Congress does not have to revisit \nthis issue. Let me say it again. Congress does not have to revisit this \nissue.\n  At the end of the entire process, there is still a regulated market \nfor debit interchange fees. That is what the Senate voted for last \nyear, loudly and clearly, and we preserve the regulated marketplace, \nwhich is what Senator Durbin and others have been calling for.\n  We will have regulated the marketplace once we fully understand all \nthe costs relative to debit transactions and the impact of these rules \non consumers and small issuers. That is what the majority of the Senate \nvoted for last year, and that is what we will get. But it will be a \nregulatory framework that does not penalize small banks and credit \nunions and is fair by not setting prices below costs. When every \nbanking regulator who has a role in overseeing the debit interchange \nmarket tells you that Congress has created a system that will not work \nin the way that was intended, then we ought to listen. Today's debit \ninterchange market is not fair for some retailers, so I understand \ntheir desire to see it fixed.\n  But the answer is not to create a new system that is unfair to the \nsmall banks in Montana and other parts of rural America. The amendment \nthe Senate approved last year was designed to punish Wall Street. But \nthe result may be the bank in Ekalaka and the other banks all over \nrural America that will lose customers and potentially even fail.\n  Let's measure twice and cut once. Let's do it quickly, but let's make \nsure we get this right and that if we are going to create regulations, \nwe are doing it in a way that is fair and consistent with the intent.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I rise to speak favorably toward the \nTester-Corker amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, may I ask the Senator from Tennessee if he \nwould mind yielding and indicate how long he might be speaking?\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, 8 minutes max--8 to 10.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. CORKER. I do wish to say that my friend from Montana has been a \ngreat partner in this effort. I know lots of times people use a lot of \nrhetoric down here to talk about what is happening and the fact that \nanyone who might be proposing this type of amendment might be \nsupporting Wall Street institutions. But I think you can see that my \nfriend from Montana is anything but Wall Street. Certainly, I think all \nof us are just trying to come up with a solution that makes sense.\n  I wish to give a brief history. Dodd-Frank came to the floor last \nyear. There were numbers of amendments to the bill. One of the \namendments that came to the floor was called the Durbin amendment. It \nwas an amendment that had no hearings. A lot of us--people such as \nmyself who are opposed to price fixing--what the Durbin amendment said \nwas that the Fed was going to set prices on debit transactions--were \nopposed to it. On the other hand, there were numbers of people in this \nChamber who supported Durbin because they were frustrated with where \nretailers were and their inability to negotiate prices with Visa and \nsome of the other companies. So they thought this might be a type of \nsolution to that dilemma of not being able to have appropriate \nnegotiations.\n  I think what all have understood, regardless of where they are on \nthis issue now, is that the Durbin amendment did not actually give the \nFed the ability to set prices as it relates to cost on debit cards. It \nonly allowed certain costs--in other words, the incremental cost of a \ntransaction. I think the retailers that I know are very strongly \nsupportive of the Durbin language know--they all tell me this anyway in \nprivate--they could not operate under that same scenario.\n  But they are frustrated. So what Tester and I and others--Mike Crapo, \nwho voted for Durbin, I might add; Kay Hagan, who voted for Durbin; \nSenator Bennet, who voted for Durbin--what people have realized is that \nthe Durbin amendment is way too narrow and does not allow appropriate \ncosts to be considered by the Fed when setting these rates.\n  So my friend from Montana who has numbers of rural institutions--I \nhave the same in my State--we all realized this is going to be highly \ndetrimental to the financial system. So what we tried to do is come up \nwith a compromise that works for both sides.\n  As I mentioned, Senator Crapo, Senator Hagan, Senator Brown, Senator \nCarper, numbers of people have gotten involved in this and have come up \nwith a one-vote strategy. I know numbers of people want to vote and get \nthis behind them. I understand this is one of those issues where we \nhave retailers on one side, we have bankers on the other side, and we \nfeel, in some ways, we are trying to deal--we are trying to pick \nbetween friends. What I think we are trying to do is put a good, sound \npolicy in place, a place that the retailers should be very happy \nbecause they are going to end up with a regulated market--something, \ncandidly, I do not support.\n  But I think the Senator from Illinois has been very successful on \nthat front. Basically, the retailers win on this because they are going \nto end up with something that is regulated. They feel as if they do not \nhave the ability to negotiate with Visa and other institutions. So now \nthe Fed is going to be setting pricing.\n  On the other hand, those Senators--most Senators in this body who \nunderstand economics, understand business--also know you cannot run a \nbusiness if you are only going to change the incremental costs. It \nwould be akin to a pizza parlor selling pizza, literally, and only \nbeing able to charge for the dough it takes to make the pizza, not to \nbe able to charge for electricity, not to be able to charge for the \nother things it takes to actually run that particular place.\n  I think we have come up with something that is a good middle-of-the-\nroad solution. The Fed is directed to consider both fixed costs and \nincremental costs, something any retailer or any business in America \nwould want to be considered if they were being regulated. We have also \ncome up with a solution that allows the Fed to look back every 2 years \nand make sure those smaller institutions Senator Tester is so concerned \nabout, and I am so concerned about, that the Fed look at those to \nensure that every 2 years these policies that are being put into\n\n[[Page S3530]]\n\nplace do not disproportionately negatively affect those institutions. \nIf so, they recommend--they do not prescribe, they recommend to \nCongress--possible legislative remedies.\n\n  As the Senator mentioned, I think we should measure twice, cut once. \nI think this ends up putting this issue in the place that is fair. I am \nfeeling momentum building around this. I will say the Senator from \nIllinois is an outstanding legislator. I think he has done a very good \njob championing this issue. I do not think we would be where we are on \nthis issue without the efforts he has put forth.\n  But I think he realizes possibly that by not keeping in place all \ncosts as it relates to a transaction, what you are doing is limiting \nthe availability of that to the public down the road. You limit \ninnovation. You limit the amount of technology investment that goes \ntoward each transaction.\n  I hope very soon to be paying my bills by just swiping my electronic \ndevice in front of a cash register. I think we all see us moving toward \nthis. But what the Durbin amendment does now, in the form it is in, is \nbasically say to these institutions, when you conduct these types of \ntransactions, debit transactions, you are going to lose money every \ntime you do it. I do not think that is where we want to be.\n  Again, there are going to be some unintended consequences whenever \nthere is a bill the size of Dodd-Frank that passes. Surely, all of us \ncan come together and figure out more commonsense ways of solving \nproblems such as this when they arise. I would have so to say that I \nlike the way this body is functioning around this issue. We have people \non both sides of the aisle who have realized this policy is one that is \ndetrimental. We have people on both sides of the aisle who have tried \nto work together. We have three iterations now of Corker-Tester to try \nto get it in a place that is in the middle of the road, that takes into \naccount the concern of retailers, and takes into account the concern of \nsmall credit unions and small banks around this country that are going \nto be devastated, as all of the regulators have said.\n  This is unusual, by the way. We talk about regulatory overreach in \nthis body. This is a case where we have given regulators the ability to \nregulate, and they are saying, please, do not make us do this. This is \nbad policy. That rarely happens in Washington. But it has happened in \nthis case.\n  Out of respect for the tremendous amount of work so many people have \nput into coming up with a slightly better solution than the Senator \nfrom Illinois, who worked so hard on this issue, to put it forth \noriginally, I would ask every Member to please, whether you end up \nvoting with us or not--and I hope you will--please sit down for 10 \nminutes, just 10 minutes, and allow your staff to at least explain. I \nknow a lot of people have made commitments 10 days ago, 1 week ago, to \nbe on the other side of this. But I think most people have not seen the \nlast iteration that puts this in the middle of the road, that keeps \ndebit cards regulated but gives the regulators the ability to at least \nconsider the costs that any normal business has when it functions.\n  I thank you for the time to talk about it. I thank the Senator from \nIllinois, who looks like he is getting ready to speak. I thank him for \nthe way he has conducted himself. As a matter of fact, I think we have \ncome up with such a great solution I would hope the Senator from \nIllinois would consider being a cosponsor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. To my friend from Tennessee, not a chance. My wife over \nthe weekend, in Springfield, said: I would like you to clean the \ngarage. I said: Well, I have decided to clean half the garage. It is a \ncompromise. She said: With whom did you compromise? That is what we are \nfaced with. Senators Corker and Tester have come to the floor and said: \nWe have a compromise. With whom did you compromise?\n  It was not with the people who are affected by these debit card fees. \nNo. They compromised among the banks. The banks all sat down and said: \nLet's work this out among us because we are talking about real money. \nThat is their compromise. It is not a compromise.\n  What is this all about? The average person listening to this debate \nis going to think: What are they fighting over there in the Senate, \nthis bipartisan battle? What we are talking about is something we all \ncarry around in our wallets and purses these days, a debit card.\n  If I take this card and go to a local restaurant--well, let's use a \ndifferent one. If I went to a local convenience store and said: I want \nto get a pack of chewing gum--Wrigley's because that is based in \nChicago--I want to get a pack of Wrigley's chewing gum, here is my \ndebit card, they take the debit card these days and they swipe it and \nthey complete the transaction.\n  What you do not know, but the merchant knows, is he just lost money \non that because it costs more to the merchant selling the goods to \nprocess the piece of plastic than they could possibly profit on the \ngoods they are selling. So you wonder, how did it reach this point, \nwhere the use of this piece of plastic costs so much? It reached that \npoint because the big giants of credit cards, Visa and MasterCard, said \nto merchants and retailers all across America: If you want to accept \nplastic at your place of business, then you are going to pay us a swipe \nfee every time that piece of plastic goes through the reader.\n  How much is that swipe fee? Turns out it is 1.10 percent, on average. \nIt does not sound like a lot, but it is. The banks that issue these \ncards receive each month in swipe fees from all across the United \nStates, from convenience stores, restaurants, hotels, charities--if you \ngave a donation to Red Cross because of the terrible tragedy that \nhappened in Joppa, MO, and used your debit card, guess what. Visa and \nMasterCard got a percentage of it, the amounts you thought you were \ngiving to the charity--college book stores, you name it.\n  Every time you sweep these, it ends up generating, each month, on \naverage, for the banks across America, $1.3 billion.\n  Each year, there are more than $15 billion in swipe fees. What did \nthe merchants have to say about how much they were being charged? \nNothing. Take it or leave it, buddy. If you don't want to pay the swipe \nfee, don't take plastic.\n  Over the years, as you might expect, merchants and retailers said \nthis is a rotten deal. Not only is this an invisible charge that we \nhave to add to the cost of doing business on everything, we have no \ncontrol over it. We are faced with paying a swipe fee or not accepting \nplastic and, in this day and age, imagine how long you would last in \nmany businesses if you didn't accept debit cards.\n  So 4 or 5 years ago, I called for a study asking: What is a \nreasonable amount to charge? I was opposed, naturally, by the banking \nindustry. They put out an all-points bulletin to kill the Durbin study \nof debit fees. They didn't want to study it. All that could do is put \nthe spotlight on them. They don't want that to happen. So we waited and \nwaited and last year we had the Wall Street financial reform bill. I \nsat here patiently on the floor saying I want to offer this amendment \nto finally come up with a reasonable way to regulate this fee, which is \nnot a product of competition and isn't transparent or disclosed. The \nvote finally came along.\n  After 25 amendments on Wall Street reform, they decided this vote \nwould not require a majority, it would require 60 votes, a \nsupermajority. OK. We won with 64 votes in favor of our position. It \nsurprised a lot of people. It sure surprised the banks. They didn't \nthink this Senate, on a bipartisan basis, would hold them accountable \nfor the fees they are charging on the debit cards.\n  What do we say in the law? The Federal Reserve--a nonpartisan bank \nregulating agency--would have the authority to determine what is a \nreasonable and proportional fee for swiping the card, and that fee \nwould go into effect this July--July 21--1 year after we passed the \nlaw. We said, in the meantime, to anybody who has thoughts, ideas or \ncomments, send them to the Federal Reserve. They received 11,000-plus \ncomments. Everybody had an idea. Some didn't like the law, some did--on \nand on.\n  So they came out with a preliminary report--not a rule--in December. \nYou know what they found? They found\n\n[[Page S3531]]\n\nthat the average charge per transaction in the United States was 44 \ncents and the average cost to the bank for processing the debit \ntransaction was about 12 cents--one-fourth. So the plot thickens.\n  It turns out the banks issuing these cards are not only charging this \ninvisible fee, they are dramatically overcharging merchants and \nretailers. Guess what Mr. and Mrs. Consumer. We pay it; we pay it in \nadditional charges. Even if you go into that store to buy a package of \nchewing gum with cash, the price has been raised because they are \nexpecting you to give plastic instead, and you pay more. So then the \nbattle was on--whether the Federal Reserve would issue this rule \nestablishing a more reasonable swipe fee for these debit cards. It is a \nbig battle.\n  Imagine, if you will, what it means to the biggest banks in America \nwhen they have on the line $1.3 billion a month. They pulled out all \nthe stops. A friend of mine--a lobbyist in Washington--said: Praise the \nLord. Come up with some more ideas. This is a full employment \namendment. Everybody in Washington who is a lobbyist is working on this \namendment. We love you to pieces.\n  The sad reality is, it is coming--maybe--to a close with a vote on \nthis amendment. But the banks and credit card companies started piling \nit on. Let me be fair. The other side did too. The merchants and \nretailers said: We want fair treatment, and if we have to fight to \nprotect this new law, we are going to do that.\n  Senators Tester of Montana and Corker of Tennessee have offered an \namendment I am about to describe. This is interesting, though. They are \noffering this amendment in an effort to stop the Federal Reserve from \nissuing a rule that will establish how much that swipe fee is going to \nbe. How soon would the Fed issue the rule? Within the month, within a \nmatter of days. They are desperate to get this amendment to the floor \nto try to stop the Federal Reserve from saying what is a fair swipe fee \nand to protect merchants, retailers, small businesses, and consumers \nacross America. The banks want to stop them.\n  There is one other part of the story that is important. We decided \nthat when we wrote this law, we would give smaller banks, community \nbanks, and smaller credit unions an exemption. In other words, they are \nnot covered by the Federal rule.\n  You say, why? From a consumer's point of view, all the arguments made \nstill apply.\n  Well, that is true. But many of these smaller institutions are more \nfinancially vulnerable. I happen to agree with Senators Tester and \nCorker. I believe in community banks and local banks and want them to \nsurvive. So we carved them out. Instead, if the value of your bank is \nbelow $10 billion, you will not be affected by this. If the value of \nthe credit union is below $10 billion, you will not be affected. How \nmany did we exempt? Out of 7,000 banks in America, only 100 would be \naffected by the law. Out of 7,000 credit unions, only 3 would be \naffected by the law.\n  Then there is another part of the story. It turns out that the three \nbiggest banks in America are the ones that make the most money on debit \nfees. Each month, they collect more than 50 percent of the debit fees. \nWhat are those banks? Chase, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America.\n  They have been fighting viciously to stop this rule from going into \neffect because there are billions of dollars at stake. They don't want \nto lose that income.\n  Let's have a little trip down memory lane about these banks. Do you \nremember a few years ago when these banks got us into the biggest \neconomic mess in current memory? Did you notice any change in your \nsavings account or perhaps your IRA--the money you put away for \nretirement? I sure did. I think Loretta and I lost about 30 percent of \nour value because they were playing games with subprime mortgages, new \nderivatives and AIG offices in London and this holy mess ended up being \nvisited on families, businesses, and consumers across America. We were \nin a panic. The Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, and \nTreasury Secretary Hank Paulson met with us and said: If you don't do \nsomething immediately, banks all across America are going to fail and \nour economy will collapse and not just here but across the world. So \nyou have to come to their rescue.\n  We had to come up with a bailout for the banks. Remember that, \ntaxpayers of America? How did the big three debit card banks do in the \nbailout? Chase got $25 billion in taxpayer money because they had acted \nso recklessly and endangered their bank, and they needed a helping \nhand. Bank of America got $45 billion in taxpayer bailout funds. Wells \nFargo got $25 billion in taxpayer bailout funds. Remember, taxpayers of \nAmerica, when the same banks that will profit from these debit card \nfees were so desperate that they needed a helping hand from taxpayers \nto save their banks? Do you remember how they expressed their gratitude \nto us? It was heartwarming. As soon as they could, they called a \nmeeting of the boards of directors and awarded one another bonuses for \ntheir reckless conduct. It warmed my heart that they were so \nappreciative of the taxpayers across America sacrificing with their \ntaxes to save these big old banks.\n  Well, I have news for the taxpayers: They are back. They are back \ntoday, and now it is smaller--I will concede that--it is only $15 \nbillion a year. But these same big banks are asking for a handout and a \nsubsidy from the Senate. Are we going to get shakedown a second time?\n  That is what this debate is all about. At the end of the day, if this \namendment that is pending on the floor passes, then for at least 1 \nyear--I think way beyond that--these banks will continue to take in \n$1.3 billion out of the wallets and purses of consumers across America \nevery time a person uses one of these plastic cards. I don't think that \nis fair. I don't think it is right. I think there is a way to deal with \nthis honestly. I will tell you what it is.\n  Let the Federal Reserve issue its rule this month. They will come out \nwith it. Let's look at it. Nobody knows what they are going to say. I \nhave heard both Senators who introduced this amendment say: Well, we \ncannot accept this rule. They don't know what the rule is, and neither \ndo I. It has not been published yet. At a minimum, should we not see it \nbefore we say it is unacceptable?\n  I am ready to wait. I trust that the Federal Reserve will do its job. \nI think it can produce a good rule--a rule that is fair to consumers, \nretailers, small businesses, and the banks too. Senator Corker said the \nproblem with Durbin's amendment is, he doesn't allow the banks to add \nin all the possible charges and costs in a debit card transaction; he \nis just allowing them to count the value of the dough and the pizza, \nnot all the other things they might add in.\n  No. What we said was that you can charge a fee that is reasonable and \nproportional to the cost of the transaction. Pretty simple, right? \nReasonable and proportional. Well, this amendment on the floor decides \nto open the door wide. It is no longer reasonable and proportional. \nThey have full pages describing all the different things the banks can \nadd in to establish the fee they charge small businesses and consumers. \nAre you trusting of these banks to be careful with what they add in? I \nam not. I can tell you that when you look at the list of things they \ninclude, it includes executive compensation, because it is about the \ncosts of the operation of the program, which happens to include a lot \nof managers and officers as well. I don't know what else it includes, \nbut it is wide open.\n  Here is what the banks have said. Incidentally, I guess it is \nsomewhat gratifying when your name is associated with an amendment and \nyou hear it over and over--Chase, for example, wrote to every person \nthat is a customer in my State of Illinois and said: Beware of the \nDurbin amendment. If it goes through, it reduces the debit fee charge \nwe can charge, and your fees are going up. Your benefits and premiums \nare going to go down. Here is what Chase failed to mention--and the \nother banks as well. The total amount the Big Three banks take in in a \nyear from debit cards fees is about a little over--almost half the \ntotal amount collected, about $8 billion a year. So the argument that \nJP Diamond and Chase are making is that if you cut our credit card \nfees, your fees are going to have to go up, and it is a cost of doing \nbusiness. What Mr. Diamond and others in\n\n[[Page S3532]]\n\nthat business failed to note is, last year on Wall Street, the banks \nawarded, in bonuses, $20.8 billion. So when they argue that an $8 \nbillion loss means fees are going up, oh, really? Or does it mean \nbonuses might go down? On behalf of consumers and businesses across \nAmerica, that is part of it.\n  Let me tell you a few things about the pending amendment. It is not a \ncompromise. Second, it includes costs that cover the whole ballpark, \nthat they can say we are going to add in the cost of ATM machines to \nthe debit card fees and pretty soon, get serious, they are right back \nup to 44 cents a transaction. That is how it is designed.\n  They carefully wrote this so there is no effective date for the rule. \nIt says the Board will decide the effective date. There is no effective \ndate for this going into effect. That is awful.\n  Finally, the argument made on the floor over and over is that we just \nwant to protect the community banks and credit unions. That is why we \nare doing all this--not a word in here--I take that back--there is one \nreference to these smaller exempt institutions. There are ways--and \nthey know it--if they wanted to, to have even more protection and \nreassurance for the smaller community banks and credit unions. They \ndidn't include them because that is not what this is about. This is \nabout all of the banks. Particularly, it is about the giant banks on \nWall Street that have at stake in this amendment $8 billion a year in \nprofits--$8 billion a year in subsidies through this amendment and \nthrough the second round of bailouts.\n  This is a good test for the Senate. I don't know how it is going to \nend. I won last year, but they have poured it on ever since. The banks \nhave done everything they can to reverse what we accomplished last \nyear. It is up to my colleagues now. They have to decide whose side \nthey will be on. It is simple. They are either going to be on the side \nof the banks and credit card companies or on the side of consumers and \nbusinesses all across America, to give them a fighting chance. How many \nspeeches have we heard on the floor of the Senate about small business? \nIf we could unleash the power of small business--their expansion and \nhiring of more people--we could turn this economy back where it should \nbe. This will be a direct hit on small businesses all across America if \nthis pending amendment is enacted.\n\n  This is our chance to say to the big banks on Wall Street: If you can \nhave $20.8 billion in bonuses last year, you are doing quite well, \nthank you. Incidentally, one of these banks had a 48-percent increase \nin profits. They are doing okay, folks. We don't need a tag day for any \nof the Wall Street banks.\n  Secondly, if you believe in small businesses and merchants and \nretailers in your hometowns, stand up for them, fight for them. That is \nwhat they are asking for. That is what this debate is all about.\n  Let's wait until this rule comes out. Let's defeat this amendment, \nand see what the Federal Reserve says. I have given my word--and I will \nsay it again--to work with any Senator on either side of the aisle. If \nwe need to have any kind of reassurance or protection added to what we \nhave done in this law, I am there. As I have said many times, the only \nperfect law I am aware of was carried down a mountain on stone tablets \nby Senator Moses. The rest of the time we just do our best. If there is \na way to improve it, I will be there.\n  But at the end of the day, let's finally, finally, finally stand up \nfor consumers and small businesses across America and say to the Wall \nStreet banks and Visa and MasterCard: Sorry, this party is over.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Tester-Corker \namendment that, hopefully, will be before us shortly.\n  I have to say I have just witnessed a great discussion of populism, \nand that is, if an institution is making some money, let's take it from \nthem and give it to others in the name of fairness.\n  I think everybody knows there certainly are tremendous numbers of \nsmall institutions across America that are very concerned about the \nDurbin amendment and its effects--and a number of small retailers. And \nthere is no question, let's face it, the big boxes, my friends--\nWalmart, Home Depot, and Target--have funded this effort, as was \nmentioned, on K Street with the lobbyists. There is no question a lot \nof the larger financial institutions have funded the effort on the \nother side. There is no question. But the people who Senator Tester and \nmyself and others listen to are those folks who come in from our home \nStates--the small community banks and credit unions around our country \nthat are very concerned.\n  Let me talk about a couple of things. No. 1, the Senator from \nIllinois talked about timing. Well, we have been trying to find some \nvehicle to attach this amendment to for some time. The fact is, the \nSenate hasn't done any business this year. We come in from time to time \nand vote on a noncontroversial judge, but we have been trying to find \nsome vehicle to attach this to, and we have been trying to do that for \nmonths.\n  Secondly, the Federal Reserve, which has been asked to put forth this \nrule, is the one saying what they have been asked to do is not \nappropriate. They have testified publicly saying the Durbin amendment \nis inappropriate.\n  Let me describe what the Senator said about reasonable and \nproportioned. That means if you went out and built a debit system--you \ninvested in all the technology, the computers, the marketing, the fraud \nprevention, all the things that went into that--the Fed can now look at \nsetting the price. After you have set all that up, and you are \nprocessing millions of transactions a year, if you send one more \ntransaction across the wire, what does that cost you--after you have \ninvested? That is what he is saying about reasonable and proportional.\n  There is no way any business in America could possibly operate under \nthat scenario. Again, retailer after retailer after retailer has been \nin my office and said: We know the criteria laid out by the Durbin \namendment is absolutely inappropriate. We couldn't function with that \ncriteria. We don't know of any other way of solving this problem, and \nwe hate to have the Fed involved in price setting.\n  So all of us set out to try--many of us set out to try--to solve that \nproblem. What we have come up with is, in fact, a compromise, and this \nis what it says: We agree the debit card industry should be regulated. \nWe agree retailers are having difficulty in negotiating with Visa and \nothers. Let's get the Fed to set the prices based on the cost of the \ntransaction, which do include, I hate to say, some fixed costs in \ntechnology and other kinds of things, such as fraud prevention. The Fed \nhas asked us to do that.\n  It is not as if we are usurping the Fed coming in and making a rule. \nThey have testified publicly the way the Durbin amendment is written it \nis going to be terrible for community banks and rural banks.\n  I think we all know the Senator from Illinois likes to use these \nlarger institutions, but all of us know the big guys just get bigger--\nthey just get bigger--when we do these kind of things, and that creates \nhardships for the smaller institutions.\n  The fact that some two-tiered system was set up and won't work--I \nmean the FDIC has come in and said, look, you cannot make it work where \nthe small banks and small credit unions are held harmless. It won't \nwork. The OCC has come in and said it won't work. Market forces will \ntake over. This will not work. They are going to get crushed. The State \nexaminers, the State bank commissioners have come in and said the \nDurbin amendment, as written, is going to be disastrous for consumers. \nIt is going to be disastrous for the smaller institutions with which we \nall deal.\n  I am not trying to carry water for either side. I am trying to come \nup with a solution that is fair. I have worked with Senator Tester, \nSenator Crapo, Senator Hagan, Senator Bennet, Senator Brown, and \nnumbers of other people, trying to come up with language that hits that \nsweet spot. The Senator from Illinois is right, we have probably never \ndeveloped a perfect law. But I think we have a responsibility, when we \nknow something is about to happen that won't work, that is going to be \ndevastating, to come up with something that meets the test of trying to \nbe fair to both sides. And I think that is what this amendment does.\n  The Senator talked about all kinds of things being added. The banks \ncan't\n\n[[Page S3533]]\n\njust add it. The Fed is regulating them. The Fed will decide what is \nreasonable and proportioned. The Fed will decide, but they will use all \nof the costs that it takes to actually do those operations and the \ncost, which the Durbin amendment did not do.\n  I think this amendment meets the test. I know there are numbers of \npeople who voted for the Durbin amendment in the past who have now \ncoauthored this. They coauthored this because they realize the Durbin \namendment was far too narrow; that the Durbin amendment didn't take \ninto account anything but, again, the cost of adding one transaction on \ntop of an infrastructure that had already been built. There is no \nbusiness that could operate that way.\n  The Presiding Officer used to be part of a weekly broadcast. If all \nthat was charged was the incremental cost of that going out and being \nbroadcast to other television stations around the country, and that was \nthe only cost he could get, there is no way our Presiding Officer would \nhave been known to America the way he is now known because there is no \nway that operation could have succeeded.\n  This is a very commonsense solution. People who supported the Durbin \namendment during this debate--even though there was never a hearing \nheld; and it was a pretty major issue to never have a hearing in the \nBanking Committee--and it was passed at a time when many people around \nthis country were rightfully upset with some of the larger players in \nour financial system--have now woken up and they realize this is a bad \npiece of policy. But if we tweak it, then the retailers still end up \nwith a regulated market where they are not overcharged.\n  The institutions are providing this service. By the way, it is a \nservice or people wouldn't use it. Retailers like getting their money \ninstantly and people like being able to carry around plastic to pay \ntheir bills instead of cash. But what this amendment does is puts it in \nthe middle of the road where it is fair to the retailers, fair to the \ninstitutions involved, and most of all it protects consumers around \nthis country. I think we have seen the letters that were sent out as to \nwhat is going to happen to consumers if the Durbin amendment goes into \neffect as it is now laid out.\n  The Senator does a great job, I know, in taking a few of these \ninstitutions that no doubt behaved badly, and causing the whole thrust \nof this to be about poking a stick in the eye of these institutions \nthat have paid bonuses and made bad decisions. But the fact is, this is \na bad policy as it exists. The Tester-Corker amendment, with many other \ncosponsors, is something to bring that into the middle of the road. So \nI ask each Senator to please spend 10 minutes with your staffers and \nunderstand what the third round of revisions does. Look at this \ncommonsense solution that has been put forth by the best efforts of \nthis body, with people working together to get here, and hopefully we \ncan end up with a piece of legislation of which we are all proud.\n  We can continue to have a financial system that is strong and that \nincludes the many small players we depend upon in small communities \nacross this country, and we can also continue to have a viable retail \nindustry that counts on the additional sales they get from having \naccess to these types of transactions.\n  With that, Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wanted to make sure the Senator from \nTennessee knows his amendment is pending. It has already been put into \nplay, and we are on it at this time. I just wanted to be sure he knew \nthat.\n  Mr. CORKER. I thank the Senator. There was some discussion a minute \nago about when it was going to occur. I thank you for that and for your \ndeft management of this bill.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much. The Senator from Tennessee probably \nwon't agree with my position on his amendment, but I do know my friend \nhas worked long and hard with Senator Tester and others, and I \nappreciate all the time he has put into trying to come up with what he \nconsiders to be a compromise.\n  I do want to say this. The Senator talks a lot about the Durbin \namendment. There is no Durbin amendment. It is the law. The Durbin \namendment was included in the bill that is now the law of the land. So \nit is a question of saying that we should essentially repeal it or \ndelay it, study it, whatever the word is, before it has a chance to \nactually go forward.\n  I understand that, and I want to say for the record where I stand on \nit. I have met with all sides. I have met with the retailers, that are \nvery strongly supportive of the Durbin law. I have met with the banks, \nand they are fiercely against it. The credit unions are very worried \nthey are going to get hit with a situation where they will not be able \nto compete with the banks. I have told them all the same thing, which \nis I think what is important when we pass a reform is to see if it is \ngoing to work, and if it doesn't work, I agree with Senator Durbin, we \nwill do everything in our power to work that out.\n  I understand the Fed says, help me, give me guidance. I think there \nis a lot of guidance in the law. I think every bureaucracy in the world \nwould rather have the details fall on us. I think the details fall to \nthem. So I am going to be voting no on the amendment. I do appreciate, \nhowever, all the work and all the time and effort that went into trying \nto pull us all together.\n  I will say the last thing on the swipe fee that I find compelling is \nthe swipe fee reform my friends want to delay--and was signed into law \nlast year--places reasonable constraints on the fees Visa and \nMasterCard fix on behalf of the Nation's largest banks. But here is the \nthing. The United States has the highest debit interchange fees in the \nworld, and the rates keep going up. The average debit interchange fee \nin the U.S. is 1.14 percent. The average debit interchange fee in the \nEuropean Union is 0.20 percent, and the average debit interchange fee \nin Canada is zero. So it is not as if the banks are taking it on the \nchin here.\n  I feel we should give this a chance to work. I am not saying it is \nthe perfect law. As Senator Durbin said, maybe there was one perfect \nlaw--the Ten Commandments--but as far as laws here, they can all be \nmade better. It may well be once the Fed acts, if we are not happy, we \ncan move at that time.\n  I want to get back to the bill, the underlying bill we are debating, \nwhich is the Economic Development Administration reauthorization, and \nto thank Senator Inhofe for his remarks he made on the floor about it. \nHe pointed out that we have a lot of work to do here to create jobs. \nWhen we have a program that takes $1 of Federal funds and it attracts \n$7 of private investments and many jobs, we ought to come together.\n  I will go through a couple of charts.\n  The EDA is an efficient job creator. They just are. In 2009 and 2010, \ninvestments by EDA created over 160,000 jobs and saved nearly 45,000. \nOne dollar of EDA investment is expected to attract--and this is a \nfact--it has attracted nearly $7 in private sector investment on \naverage. Sometimes it is $10, sometimes it is $15, sometimes it is $4, \n$3, $2, but the average is $7. EDA project funding creates one job for \nevery $2,000 to $4,600 invested. You see the average cost of creating a \njob is very low in terms of the Federal investment. This is terrific. \nThis program really works.\n  There are a couple of things we believed we ought to take a look at--\nduplication and also a way for the community to buy out the Federal \nGovernment share of a project. We put that in the reauthorization. We \nbelieve we really strengthened this law, and I again thank the \nDemocrats and Republicans on the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee.\n  This morning, I went through some of the programs in California:\n  The city of Dixon, $3 million for a water system that is expected to \ncreate 1,000 jobs and leverage $40 million in private investment--$3 \nmillion attracting $40 million in private investment.\n  The city of Shafter, $2 million for sewer and water. It is going to \ndevelop an additional 600 acres to enable continued growth of the East \nShafter Logistical Center and is expected to create 1,400 jobs and \nleverage $250 million in private investment.\n  San Jose, $3 million for the renovation and expansion of the Center \nfor Employment Training. They can then\n\n[[Page S3534]]\n\nexpand their capacity by 860 students, expand access to the GED, the \nliteracy, language, and small business entrepreneurship classes to low-\nincome areas. This is absolutely key. It really should bring us \ntogether because they are training students so students get out and get \ntheir GED, get their literacy, and can really make sure the community \nis growing and thriving. That particular grant is expected to leverage \n$3 million in private investment and create 4,900 jobs. So it is a 1-\nto-1. In that case, it is $3 million of public and $3 million of \nprivate.\n  Nationwide--I talked about this. I talked about other examples, but I \ndidn't mention ones on the west coast. In the Central Valley, there was \na 23,000-square-feet water and energy technology incubator, and the \nincubator has housed more than 15 entrepreneurs since it opened in \n2007. They obtained $17 million in private capital and created jobs for \nCalifornians, so $1.8 million attracted $17 million.\n  We have the case of Boeing, and they were able to expand one of their \ncampuses. It created 2,000 jobs.\n  I talked about Duluth. In 2001, an EDA grant of $3.5 million matched \nby $2.3 million from the city of Duluth helped build the Duluth \nAviation Business Incubator at the Duluth Airport. This investment \nhelped Cirrus Aircraft grow from a handful of employees to 1,012 by \n2008. It is now leased to Cirrus Design Corporation, which has the \nlargest share of the worldwide general aviation market.\n  When we are talking about the EDA and the way it attracts private \nsector funding and creates jobs, this is not hyperbole, this is not \njust rhetoric, this is reality. This is a program that has been going \non since 1965. Republicans and Democrats have supported it. The last \ntime it was authorized was when George W. Bush was President. It passed \nunanimously.\n  So I stand here today on the opening day full of hope, hoping that is \nnot naive, hoping we will see a few amendments--that is all fine. We \ndon't mind amendments. Amendments are fine, but let's have reasonable \ndiscussion and reasonable time set aside and move on.\n  There is the Maytag plant in Newton, IA, which employed 1,800 factory \nand administrative workers. It was closed. We all know how painful that \nis. We remember back when we were losing 700,000 to 800,000 jobs a \nmonth. It was not that long ago. By 2008, the city identified two new \nmanufacturing operations that could be located at that old plant--TPI \nComposites, Inc., a wind turbine blade manufacturer, and Trinity \nStructural Towers, Inc., a manufacturer of massive steel towers for \nwindmills. The EDA invested $580,000 in 2008 for grading, site \npreparation, and surfacing for a wind tower storage facility that was \nleased to Trinity and created 140 jobs and generated $21 million in \nprivate investment.\n  That same year, EDA also invested $670,000 in the Central Iowa Water \nAssociation in Newton to help build a booster station and storage tank \nto serve TPI. This project helped create 500 jobs and generate $40 \nmillion in private investment.\n  On the east coast, in 2010 the EDA gave a $750,000 grant to Seedco \nFinancial Services, Inc., a national nonprofit community development \nfinancial institution. Seedco used this funding to provide capital to \nSub Zero Insulation and Refrigeration Technologies, LLC, which is a \nfamily-owned manufacturer of custom, environmentally friendly, energy-\nefficient insulated commercial truck and van liners--Sub Zero. It is \npretty famous. They are located in Brooklyn, NY. They had been denied \nfinancing by a major bank.\n  This is the thing. A lot of our companies--while the banks want to \ncharge very high swipe fees, they are somehow absent when our companies \nneed them. In 2010--that is just last year--Sub Zero was denied \nfinancing. EDA provided access to capital, which allowed Sub Zero to \nfulfill its contract with Edible Arrangement to outfit delivery \nvehicles and to win contracts from Ford, Chevy, and Dodge. This allowed \nSub Zero to hire 15 new staff. They started in 2004 with just 3 \nemployees and producing 75 vehicles a year, and the company now has 20 \nemployees and produces approximately 400 vehicles a year.\n  It goes on.\n  EDA provided $2 million to help build the Knowledge Works \npreincubator facility as part of the development of the Virginia Tech \nCorporate Research Center, and now we have seen 2,000 high-wage jobs \ncreated and the inception of 140 high-tech businesses.\n  The way EDA works is there are regional offices, about six of them, \nand they get funded through the Appropriations Committee to the \nCommerce Department, and then each region makes the decision as to \nwhich projects really meet the goals of the legislation, which is to \nbring economic development to distressed areas, create jobs, and \nleverage the dollars.\n  In addition to this, EDA--in 2008 we gave them an extra $500 million \nin disaster assistance to give to areas which were experiencing \ndisaster problems, and they assumed the role of a secondary responder, \nworking with affected communities to support long-term postdisaster \nrebuilding. As an example of that, again back in Iowa, they provided \nfunding to help construct and install an upgraded, energy-efficient \nnatural gas-fired boiler system in Cedar Rapids, IA, following a flood \nthat destroyed the boiler that had provided steam heat and hot water to \nSaint Luke's Hospital and Coe College. We all know what happens when a \nhospital can't count on a backup generator: they can't count on energy. \nWe know what happens when that occurs: everything shuts down, and \npeople are in peril. EDA steps in in these areas, and while FEMA is \ndealing with the immediate impacts, they are looking a little bit more \nat the long-term work that could be done so that when and if there is \nanother disaster, the community is ready.\n  All I can tell you is nothing is perfect. I am sure there are \nexamples we have that are not as good as the ones I mentioned. I am \nsure there are because nothing is perfect and nobody is perfect. But \nthis is a very good program. It is time-tested, signed into law by \nDemocratic Presidents and Republican Presidents. The last time, it \npassed here by unanimous consent, was voted out of the committee which \nI am privileged to chair with almost unanimous consent. We had one \ndissent, and that is fine. We hope we will win over that dissenter. But \nhere is where we are. We have a chance to reauthorize this program.\n\n  There are reforms we have made. I want to share some of the reforms \nwe have made. This can go on without an authorization and stumble \naround. But what is important at this particular time, when the main \nthree issues on people's minds are jobs, jobs, and jobs, is we have to \ndo a jobs bill. This is a jobs bill. This creates jobs at very low cost \nto the Federal Government. This creates jobs in the private sector in \nsome of our cities and public works areas.\n  This is what we did in order to help people understand why we think \nit is important to reauthorize this. Working with my ranking member, \nSenator Inhofe, we came up with some good reforms.\n  We changed the current cost-share requirements, so we increased the \nFederal share for areas in which unemployment is especially high and \nper capital income is especially low because we want to make sure that \nwhen we go into an area that is deeply in need, we do a little more for \nthem.\n  We require additional planning assistance if overall funding levels \nincrease. In other words, we want to keep our eye on these projects. We \nwant to make sure they are meeting their goals.\n  We modified the existing Revolving Loan Fund Program to allow \nrecipients to convert an existing revolving loan fund to carry out \nanother EDA-eligible project. So we take the bureaucracy and say: Look, \nif they have a better idea, let's go forward and let them use those \nfunds in that way.\n  We modify rules to allow recipients of grants that are more than 10 \nyears old to buy out the Federal Government's interest at a depreciated \nrate. In other words, if a State, city, county or participant says: You \nknow what, we want to do this on our own, this is an older grant and we \nbelieve we want to take it over, they can buy out the Federal \nGovernment's interests.\n  We emphasize that EDA should work with Federal, State, and local \nagency partners to support economic and workforce development \nstrategies.\n  Senator Inhofe mentioned his reform that he made sure happened, which \nis\n\n[[Page S3535]]\n\nthat we are not duplicating other programs. That is important. We don't \nwant to be duplicative. We want to be sure that what we are doing is \nnot being done elsewhere.\n  We walk in and we do something, frankly, that people need now: We \ncreate jobs and we leverage. That word ``leverage'' has become the \nfirst thing out of my mouth when I talk about things I support now. \nThat is why we support the highway bill that we hope is going to come \nhere in a bipartisan way. We leverage dollars. Anytime you can leverage \ndollars--you put $1 down for something good, and people come to the \ntable from local government, the nonprofit sector, the profit sector, \nState, all the different agencies, all the different parties come \ntogether and say: This is a great idea. If we all kick in just a \nlittle, we are going to do something big. That is the idea behind the \nEDA.\n  I visited projects in my own State, shopping malls and other things \nthat were done in these very fine communities where it is tough to get \ncapital, where the banks just turn their backs, where perhaps the \nventure capitalists are saying: This isn't our cup of tea. That is why \nthis is a successful program.\n  Again, I hope we will have debate today on the Tester-Corker \namendment. It is a very controversial one. It is not happy because it \nis one of these things where, if you do one thing, 50 percent of the \npeople think you are right, and if you do the other, 50 percent think \nyou are wrong, although Senator Durbin says the polls show that people \nsupport these lower fees in this case. But I respect the fact that the \namendment was offered on this bill. It is an amendment that is directly \nrelated to our economy. But I hope we vote tomorrow, as early as \npossible, and I hope we do not have a lot of amendments dragging us \ndown because, guess what, people are looking at us and they are \nthinking: Why aren't they doing more to create jobs? This will send a \nsignal that we are making EDA a priority.\n  This is not a big spending measure. This is an authorization, and the \nnumber at which we are authorizing has been frozen so we are not adding \nto it. But we are sending a signal to the appropriators and to the \nCommerce Department that we think this is a good and important program.\n  Madam President, I thank you very much. I have said my piece for the \nmoment. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nmorning business on Wednesday, June 8, the Senate resume consideration \nof S. 782, the EDA Revitalization Act, with the time until 2 p.m. \nequally divided between the proponents and opponents of the Tester \namendment No. 392 regarding swipe fees; that at 2 p.m. the Durbin \namendment No. 393 be withdrawn and the Senate proceed to vote in \nrelation to the Tester amendment No. 392, with no amendments, motions, \nor points of order in order prior to the vote other than budget points \nof order and the applicable motions to waive; the Tester amendment be \nsubject to a 60-vote threshold; and the motion to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid on the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to express my appreciation to \nSenators Durbin and Tester for their warm relationship and to every \nSenator here on this most difficult issue, for allowing us to get this \ndone tomorrow expeditiously. It is something that had to be done and it \nis the right thing to do and we will move forward upon completing this \nto try to do other things on this very important piece of legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/07/senate-section/article/S3535-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     NATIONAL HUNGER AWARENESS DAY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of National Hunger \nAwareness Day. On this day, we focus on the more than 50 million people \nin the United States without enough to eat and reassert our commitment \nto assist those in need.\n  Millions of families live each day not knowing if they will have \nenough to eat. Rather than thinking about what the next meal will be, \nthese parents worry if there will be a next meal. Rather than \nconcentrate on homework, these children are trying not to think about \ntheir hunger pangs. In a nation as resourceful and agriculturally \nabundant as ours, this is inexcusable. If children--or adults--are \nhungry in America, that is a problem for all of us.\n  The level of hunger in our Nation is at the highest level since the \ngovernment began tracking food insecurity in 1995. The number of \nAmericans experiencing hunger increased from 35.5 million in 2006 to 50 \nmillion in 2011. In Illinois, over 11 percent of households are food \ninsecure. These are working families who just aren't able to make ends \nmeet and are forced to skip meals to make sure food will last through \nthe week.\n  At a time when millions of middle class Americans are struggling to \nkeep up with higher gas prices and grocery bills, more families are \nlooking to Federal programs for assistance. Throughout the country, \nFederal hunger assistance programs have responded to this growing need \nby providing essential support to hungry families. Over the past 2 \nyears, Illinois food banks have seen a 50-percent increase in requests \nfor food assistance.\n  According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, applications for \nfood stamps are on the rise at the same time recipients are making more \nfrequent use of food pantries to fill gaps in their grocery needs. Over \n44 million people nationwide rely on the Federal food stamp program. \nCurrently, 1,802,252 people in Illinois receive food stamps, an \nincrease of 14 percent from last year and the highest level ever in \nIllinois. But for the millions of people who don't have assistance, \neverything is different.\n  We know hunger is a reality in our communities. We see long lines at \nour food pantries. We have heard from seniors forced to choose between \ngroceries and medication. And children are in our schools who have not \nhad a decent meal since the previous day's school lunch. We see \nfamilies showing up a day earlier than normal at the food pantry \nbecause the monthly pay is not stretching as far it once did. Parents \nare giving up their own meal to make sure their child has something to \neat at night.\n  Last week, I visited a Summer Food Service Program at the Boys & \nGirls Club in Decatur, IL. This summer program provides 2 free meals a \nday to up to 150 children. For the over 500,000 Illinois children in \nfood insecure households, the summertime means months without the free \nand reduced breakfasts and lunches available in school. Thanks to the \nSummer Food Service Program, food banks, and food pantries, families \nwho are having a difficult time keeping up in our tough economy are \nable to put meals on the table. One woman with three kids in the Summer \nFood Service Program in Decatur said the meals provided in the program \nhelp her save money so she can afford to put gas in her car to get to \nwork.\n  In the Nation that prides itself as the land of plenty, we cannot \nhide the fact that we need to protect these vital antihunger programs \nand that we need to do better at making sure everybody has at least \nenough to eat. As Congress works to rein in our Nation's debt, I look \nforward to working with my colleagues to ensure we make responsible \ndecisions that protect vital antihunger programs like the Supplemental \nNutrition Assistance Program and the Emergency Food Assistance Program.\n  If there is one hungry person in our Nation, hunger will be a problem \nfor all of us. I hope we will continue to work together to fulfill our \nduty to end hunger in our Nation and the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/07/senate-section/article/S3535-2", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3535-S3537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TAIWAN AIR DEFENSES\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, on February 23, 2011, the RAND Corporation \nreleased a report funded by and prepared for the U.S. Air Force \nentitled, ``Shaking the Heavens and Splitting the Earth.'' This report \nprovides a\n\n[[Page S3536]]\n\ncomprehensive review of the capabilities of the Chinese Air Force, and \nit is alarming. In less than a decade, China has transformed its air \nforce from an antiquated service based on 1950s-era Soviet technology \ninto a modern, highly capable 21st century air force. RAND predicts \nthat, by approximately 2015, the weapon systems and platforms China is \nacquiring ``would make a Chinese air defense campaign, if conducted \naccording to the principles described in Chinese military publications, \nhighly challenging for U.S. air forces.''\n  Without question, China's military expansion poses a clear and \npresent danger to our longstanding ally, Taiwan--a threat that also has \nvery serious implications for the United States. In its report, RAND \npredicts that, should the United States have to intervene in a conflict \nbetween Taiwan and China, the United States ``should expect attacks on \nits forces and facilities in the western Pacific, including those in \nJapan. . . . Chinese military writings, moreover, emphasize the \nadvantages of preemptive and surprise attacks, so it is possible that \nChinese attacks on U.S. forces in the western Pacific would precede a \nuse of force against Taiwan.'' RAND further states that, in the event \nof a military conflict off of Taiwan, ``even if the United States \nintervened on a large scale,'' the ``capabilities of Taiwan's armed \nforces would also be critical to the outcome. . . . Defending Taiwan \nagainst air attack is feasible if Taiwan makes systematic, sustained, \nand carefully chosen investments.''\n  These military investments by Taiwan are critical, due to the \ncontinuing deterioration of its air force. A January 21, 2010, Defense \nIntelligence Agency, DIA, report on the current condition of Taiwan's \nAir Force quantified its eroding air capability in stark terms: \n``Although Taiwan has nearly 400 combat aircraft in service, far fewer \nof these are operationally capable. Taiwan's F-5 fighters have reached \nthe end of their operational service life, and while the indigenously \nproduced F-CK-1 A/B Indigenous Defense Fighter, IDF, is a large \ncomponent of Taiwan's active fighter force, it lacks the capability for \nsustained sorties. Taiwan's Mirage 2000-5 aircraft are technologically \nadvanced, but they require frequent, expensive maintenance that \nadversely affects their operational readiness rate.''\n  Last August, the Department of Defense, DOD, released its 2010 Annual \nReport to Congress on the Military and Security Developments Involving \nthe People's Republic of China. It states: ``Cross-Strait economic and \npolitical ties continued to make important progress in 2009. Despite \nthese positive trends, China's military buildup opposite the island \n[Taiwan] continues unabated. The PLA is developing the capability to \ndeter Taiwan independence or influence Taiwan to settle the dispute on \nBeijing's terms while simultaneously attempting to deter, delay, or \ndeny any possible U.S. support for the island in case of conflict. The \nbalance of cross-Strait military forces continues to shift in China's \nfavor.'' This report recounts that China has a total of approximately \n2,300 operational combat aircraft, including 330 fighters and 160 \nbombers stationed within range of Taiwan.\n  These disturbing reports are just the latest warnings that highlight \nboth China's military expansion and Taiwan's increasing need for new \ndefensive weapons. Some have openly questioned whether selling arms to \nTaiwan is worth the political cost to the U.S.-China bilateral \nrelationship. Surely, we would all prefer to have Taiwanese pilots \nflying Taiwanese fighter jets as the island's first line of defense, \ninstead of American military pilots. Taiwan understands this, and it \nwants to remain the primary guarantor of its own freedom and democracy. \nA strong and robust defensive capability built on an air force capable \nof holding its own with China will promote a Beijing-Taipei detente \nthat can build on the work President Ma has done to ease tensions and \npromote better economic ties with China. It remains to be seen how far \nthe Obama administration's support extends to Taiwan and whether this \nadministration will try to strategically counter the military rise of \nChina.\n  China should never be allowed to dictate U.S. policy, either directly \nor indirectly. That includes our decision to sell defensive weapons to \nan important democratic ally. Yet there is evidence that this \nadministration is already bowing to Chinese pressure. According to a \nFebruary 7, 2010, report by Defense News, China's extensive holdings of \nU.S. Government securities are already directly influencing U.S. \nnational security policy. This article reports that, according to an \nunnamed Pentagon official, Obama administration officials softened a \ndraft of a key national security document in order to avoid ``harsh \nwords'' that ``might upset Chinese officials at a time when the United \nStates and China are economically intertwined.'' The article indicates \nthat Pentagon officials ``deleted several passages and softened others \nabout China's military buildup.'' This critical document, the 2010 \nQuadrennial Defense Review, QDR, is intended to provide an assessment \nof long-term threats and challenges for the Nation and to guide \nmilitary programs, plans, and budgets in the coming decades.\n  Although the QDR was watered down by administration officials, other \nreports effectively highlight the disparity between China's diplomatic \nrhetoric and its true intentions, as demonstrated by its rapid and \nrobust military modernization effort. According to the DOD's 2010 \nreport on China, ``The pace and scope of China's military modernization \nhave increased over the past decade,'' increasing ``China's options for \nusing military force to gain diplomatic advantage or resolve disputes \nin its favor.'' The DOD's report highlights to China's military \nmodernization has been focused on ``improving its capacity for force \nprojection and anti-access/area-denial.'' These modernization efforts \nare heavily focused on offensive capabilities, including the \ndevelopment of an antiship ballistic missile with a range in excess of \n1,500 km that is ``intended to provide the PLA the capability to attack \nships, including aircraft carriers, in the western Pacific Ocean,'' as \nwell as an active aircraft carrier research and development program. \nMoreover, PLA Air Force, PLAAF, Commander General Xu Giliang has \nemphasized the transformation of the PLAAF ``from a homeland defense \nfocus to one that `integrates air and space,' and that possesses both \n`offensive and defensive' capabilities.''\n  It is because of China's military rise and the troubling shift in the \ncross-Strait balance in China's favor that Taiwan recognizes its need \nto modernize its air force. As a result, Taiwan has made repeated \nrequests to purchase new F-16 C/D aircraft from the United States since \n2006. Taiwan desperately needs these F-16s--a ``carefully chosen \ninvestment''--which are comparable to China's own domestically-\ndeveloped J-10 fighter aircraft.\n  Yet despite a compelling argument, Taiwanese President Ma's requests \nto the United States to purchase these aircraft continue to be snubbed. \nIn an interview with the Washington Post, President Ma said, ``Our \nobjective in improving cross-strait relations is to seek peace and \nprosperity. However, the Republic of China (Taiwan) is a sovereign \nstate; we must have our national defense. While we negotiate with the \nmainland, we hope to carry out such talks with sufficient self defense \ncapabilities and not negotiate out of fear. This is an extremely \nimportant principle. Therefore, we must purchase the necessary \ndefensive weapons from overseas that cannot be manufactured here in \nTaiwan to replace outdated ones. This is essential for our national \nsurvival and development.''\n  Moreover, the United States has a statutory obligation under the \nTaiwan Relations Act of 1979 to provide Taiwan the defense articles and \nservices necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain sufficient self-defense \ncapabilities, in furtherance of maintaining peace and stability in the \nwestern Pacific region. Our obligations under the Taiwan Relations Act \nrecognize that the key to maintaining peace and stability in Asia in \nthe face of China's dramatic military expansion is ensuring a \nmilitarily strong and confident Taiwan.\n  To that end, in early 2010, President Obama notified Congress of a \n$6.4 billion military sale to Taiwan. This was a welcome step, but it \nremains the only visible step the Obama administration has taken to \nprovide Taiwan the defensive arms it needs, in accordance with our \nstatutory obligations. While the administration dithers on Taiwan's \nrequest for F-16s, evidence continues to\n\n[[Page S3537]]\n\nmount that what Taiwan desperately needs to restore the cross-Strait \nbalance and regain the ability to defend its own airspace is new \nfighter aircraft to bolster an air force that is borderline obsolete.\n  It is my understanding that the administration may favor selling \nTaiwan upgrade kits for its existing fleet of F-16 A/Bs, instead of \nselling Taiwan brand new fighters. Such a tradeoff will not enhance the \nsecurity of Taiwan. What Taiwan's air force needs is new F-16s and the \nability to deploy them in sufficient numbers to strengthen its \ndefensive posture. Simply upgrading airframes that are more than 20 \nyears old is not a solution--it is nothing more than a public relations \nBand-Aid. Efforts to upgrade Taiwan's air fleet have to be coupled with \nthe sale of new aircraft that can serve for two decades or more into \nthe future.\n  Another important consideration is the shrinking time window for this \npurchase. The continuing production of new F-16s is dependent on \nforeign sales. It is my understanding that, if no new overseas orders \nare secured this year, the thousands of U.S. suppliers who help build \nthe F-16 will begin shuttering that capability. Once this happens, it \nwill be very difficult and expensive to restart the supply chain. \nWashington has a longstanding habit of putting off difficult decisions, \nbut the decision on whether to sell new F-16s to Taiwan is literally \nnow or never.\n  As the DIA report made clear, the majority of Taiwan's 400 fighter \naircraft need to be retired or upgraded. Within the next 5 years, \nTaiwan will have to mothball or scrap more than 100 combat aircraft--\none-quarter of its current force. Without the ability to augment its \nair force with new F-16 aircraft, as well as updates to its existing \nfleet, Taiwan will lose all ability to project a defensive umbrella \nover the island. The repercussions of a rising and potentially \naggressive China, able to dominate the airspace over Taiwan, demands \nthe attention of our military planners, government officials, and \nMembers of Congress because it opens the door for China to use force \nagainst Taiwan. To that end, I was proud to recently join with 43 of my \nSenate colleagues in sending a letter to President Obama urging him to \nact swiftly to provide Taiwan with the F-16s that are critical to \npreserving Taiwan's self-defense capabilities.\n  It is time to recommit ourselves to strengthening the ties that bind \nthe U.S. and Taiwan together--from arms sales to free-trade agreements. \nDoing so will promote peace and stability in the region, while also \nprotecting U.S. and Taiwanese security interests. I urge President \nObama and his administration to move quickly and work with Taiwan to \nnotify the sale of these fighter jets to Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/07/senate-section/article/S3537-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            NEVER TO FORGET\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

I \nask unanimous consent that a copy be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            Never to Forget\n\n\n                           Memorial Day 2011\n\n     We commemorate Memorial Day never to forget.\n     Never to forget who they were.\n     Men and women of many titles.\n     To some they were sergeant or colonel or general;\n     To others they were mom or dad,\n     Uncle or aunt . . .\n     Son or daughter.\n     To us, they are all heroes.\n     We honor them all.\n     And we honor their parents who lost children.\n     We honor their children who lost parents.\n     As a head of one of our American Battlefield cemeteries once \n           told me:\n     For those buried in his cemetery\n     They remain each day on active duty. . .\n     And on each day that we fail to remember them . . . that we \n           fail to honor them . . . they have served a day without \n           a mission.\n     Every soldier is entitled to his mission.\n     Here at Ardennes American Cemetary/Henri-Chappelle--we--\n           Belgians and Americans, parents and children--we are \n           that mission.\n     We commemorate Memorial Day never to forget.\n     Never to forget what they did.\n     Every one of them understood when they joined that the road \n           would be rough.\n     They knew that this was not about television commercials \n           boasting pressed uniforms and glistening shoes or \n           steeds clashing on chessboards.\n     They knew this was not about training exercises amidst sunny \n           days in North Carolina,\n     They knew instead that this was about life and death.\n     They knew that for every moment of thrill, there could be \n           months of fear.\n     But they knew that the rest of us needed them. They knew our \n           fellow world citizens had been victims of murder or \n           terror.\n     Perhaps they knew in 1915 that the poppies and the hearts of \n           Belgians had been trampled on the way to 9 million \n           deaths in WWI.\n     Or perhaps they knew in 1944 that Max Gutman was hiding in \n           the woods in Poland after every other Jew in his small \n           town of Biyala Rafka had been slaughtered. Maybe they \n           knew that his dream one day to come to America, to \n           raise a future U.S. Ambassador to Belgium, had nearly \n           been extinguished along with the future for so many \n           Poles and Catholics and Jews.\n     Maybe they knew in 2001 that our citizens had been the \n           victims of terror and remained under threat.\n     Whenever they served, wherever they served, they knew we \n           needed someone to help, to respond, to free, to save, \n           to protect.\n     And they said, ``I will.''\n     We commemorate Memorial Day never to forget the face of evil.\n     We welcome all into the brotherhood of man. We will meet you \n           far more than half way. We and our allies will send our \n           diplomats, help feed your poor, and treat you with \n           respect. But threaten none, harm even fewer,\n     We commemorate Memorial Day never to forget.\n     Never to forget what they died for.\n     Can you hear them each and every one of the 5323 buried here \n           and the tens of thousands buried elsewhere . . .\n     Can you hear them?\n     If not, it is because you are listening with your ears.\n     But on Memorial Day, we listen not with our ears, but instead \n           with our hearts.\n     And with our hearts we can hear them loudly and clearly.\n     They tell us that they lived in a country that believed in \n           freedom and understood right from wrong.\n     And they tell us that they believed in service, in duty, in \n           the mission of creating a better world.\n     They tell us never to forget, but certainly to move forward \n           and build bridges where pools of hatred previously \n           existed.\n     They fought and they died to move us a step closer towards \n           the brotherhood of man. We must never use their memory \n           as an excuse not to get there.\n     Thus while we can never forget, while we will never forget, \n           we will forgive those who have followed. Where we faced \n           each other to the death, we will walk together to \n           rebuild a better life.\n     And that may be the most enduring lesson--lessons for \n           Belgium, for Europe, for the Middle East, or for all \n           places where tensions rooted in the mistakes or ill \n           deeds of the past threaten the progress of the future.\n     The lessons are that we need not carry the blame nor clear \n           the name of our parents and grandparents looking back.\n     Rather that we build a better name for our children and our \n           grandchildren going forward. That we must use the \n           lessons of the past to carve a better future.\n     We are so used to the expression ``Forgive but don't \n           forget.'' And of course Memorial Day proclaims that we \n           shall never forget.\n     But in making sure we don't forget, sometimes we don't truly \n           forgive.\n     We commemorate Memorial Day never to forget precisely so that \n           we can forgive.\n     --Ambassador Howard Gutman\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/07/senate-section/article/S3537-2", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3537-S3538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO RICK COCHRAN\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, my fellow Members of the U.S. Senate have \nheard me say this before, but today I have reason to say it again: \nVermonters are some of the most innovative and hardworking people in \nthis country. The U.S. Small Business Administration recently \nhighlighted one of these great individuals when it named Rick Cochran \nof the Mobile Medical International Corporation in St. Johnsbury, \nVermont, as the 2011\n\n[[Page S3538]]\n\nNational Small Business Person of the Year.\n  Mr. Cochran deserves this recognition for his many years of hard work \nbuilding a successful small business that provides mobile, combat-ready \nshelter systems both in the U.S. and abroad. In collaboration with the \nU.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, \nthe U.S. Air Force, and others, Mr. Cochran and his team provide \nquality medical services to the many dedicated men and woman worldwide \nwho put their lives at risk in the military. Mr. Cochran has also \ndeployed mobile surgical units across the globe to developing \ncountries, giving third world countries cost-effective mobile access to \nmodern medical facilities.\n  From an otherwise nondescript industrial building in St. Johnsbury, \nMobile Medical has touched the lives of thousands of people from across \nthe globe. Whether the company is shipping units to the Middle East, \ndeploying units with National Guard soldiers, or quickly delivering aid \nto communities devastated by natural disasters here at home, the men \nand women who have engineered and manufactured these mobile medical \nfacilities have found a novel and cost-effective way to deliver state-\nof-the-art medical care in some of the world's most challenging \nenvironments. Just last week, I learned that Mobile Medical had already \ndeployed mobile healthcare facilities to assist in the recovery efforts \nin Joplin, MO, following the catastrophic weather that left hundreds \ndead and thousands more injured.\n  Mr. Cochran and his staff have improved the lives of others both \nabroad and locally, as their business has created hundreds of job \nopportunities for Vermonters in our rural Northeast Kingdom. As a \nlongtime supporter of Mobile Medical, I was pleased to see this locally \nowned business recognized for the great work it has done in Vermont and \nacross the globe.\n  I continue to be proud of the many small businesses thriving across \nVermont. And today I am especially proud of the work of one small \nbusiness that has succeeded both financially and socially Mobile \nMedical International Corporation of St. Johnsbury, VT. I wish Rick and \nhis business continued success in the future. I also ask that the May \n20, 2011, U.S. Small Business Administration announcement of this award \nbe printed in the Record.\n  The information follows:\n\n  Vermont Manufacturer of Mobile Health Care Units Is National Small \n                      Business Person of the Year\n\n                         [Friday, May 20, 2011]\n\n       Washington.--When Rick Cochran was working with five \n     employees in his basement in Walden, Vt., his dream was to \n     find a way to provide advanced medical care to underserved \n     areas, and build a company that could deliver it.\n       Today, the Vermont manufacturer of state-of-the-art mobile \n     healthcare and diagnostic units was named 2011 National Small \n     Business Person of the year by Karen Mills, Administrator of \n     the U.S. Small Business Administration. Mills made the \n     announcement during ceremonies at SBA's celebration of \n     National Small Business Week in Washington, D.C.\n       First runner-up is Deborah Carey, president and founder of \n     the New Glarus Brewing Company, in New Glarus in southwestern \n     Wisconsin. Second runner-up is Leigh Kamstra, owner and chef \n     of Roma's Ristorante in Spearfish, S.D., north of the Black \n     Hills.\n       ``The innovation, inspiration and determination shown by \n     Rick Cochran and his employees have elevated his company, \n     Mobile Medical International, to a level that is above and \n     beyond the norm,'' said Mills. ``These are the qualities that \n     make small businesses such a powerful force for job creation \n     in the American economy and in their local communities. Rick \n     had a dream and he persisted--creating jobs, winning the \n     loyalty of his team, and filling a need in the marketplace \n     that has taken Mobile Medical from his basement to a \n     worldwide stage. We are especially proud that when Rick \n     Cochran's company needed financing, he turned to the U.S. \n     Small Business Administration, and the SBA was able to help \n     him.\n       ``I applaud Rick and his team, and I applaud the runners-up \n     and their staffs, and all of the state small business persons \n     of the year who are here today,'' Mills said. ``We are all \n     grateful for their contributions to our economy. They are \n     magnificent examples of the character of America's most \n     successful entrepreneurs.''\n       The National Small Business Person of the Year and runners-\n     up were selected from among the state winners in 50 states, \n     the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, \n     and Guam. All are being honored this week in Washington, \n     D.C., as part of National Small Business Week. The awards \n     were announced at today's National Awards Luncheon, sponsored \n     by Sam's Club at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel.\n       For Cochran the road began when he left a job at an \n     advanced medical equipment provider to establish his first \n     venture, Outpatient Services of America, a consulting firm \n     specializing in planning and developing ambulatory surgery \n     centers. His plan evolved in 1994, when he researched and \n     created an initial design for a mobile surgery unit and \n     established Mobile Medical International, working from his \n     basement with a staff of five. By 1995, he had the capital, \n     and by 1996, he had his prototype.\n       At first, he provided temporary solutions for hospitals \n     undergoing renovations, but he was able to expand the \n     business into broader commercial, military, and emergency \n     response applications worldwide. During one rough patch in \n     1999, much of his core team--inspired by Cochran's \n     perseverance, optimism and faith--worked without pay when \n     financing ran dry and the company nearly closed its doors. \n     They were reimbursed later, when the company rebounded. The \n     company also secured financing support from three SBA-backed \n     loans in 1997, 2005 and 2008.\n       MMI's products include mobile surgical hospitals built into \n     a semi-sized tractor-trailer and an inflatable hospital ward \n     that fits into a trailer pulled by a Humvee. To date, MMIC \n     has 22 mobile healthcare units in its product line, including \n     Mobile Breast Care Centers, Mobile Intensive Care, Mobile \n     Laboratory/Pharmacy, Mobile CT Scan/Dental/Ophthalmology, \n     Mobile Ophthalmology and Mobile Endoscopy Units.\n       Today, MMI's staff has grown to 54, and net income--just \n     $9,835 in 2008--rose in 2010 to $1.68 million on gross \n     revenues of more than $14 million.\n       First runner-up Carey developed her business plan for the \n     New Glarus Brewing Company while her husband Dan, a master \n     brewer, gathered the materials, grains and equipment needed \n     for start-up. In 1993 they negotiated to lease a warehouse in \n     New Glarus, exchanging the lease for stock in the company. \n     They sold their home and raised $40,000 in seed money, yet \n     still needed more cash to fund the startup. Carey pitched her \n     story to local newspapers, and the media attention brought in \n     $200,000 from investors.\n       In the early days, the couple worked hard to establish the \n     brewery's reputation for consistent quality beers. Carey \n     based her plan on developing a very loyal customer base. She \n     set up beer tasting classes along with offering brewery \n     tours, and the brewery started to take off, attracting notice \n     from distributors. New Glarus Brewing Company has grown to 50 \n     full-time employees, has registered growth in profits of 123 \n     percent from 2007 to 2009, and is Wisconsin's number one \n     micro-brewery relative to sales volume.\n       Kamstra, the second runner-up, had been eyeing an old, \n     dilapidated stone building that had stood empty while she was \n     a college student attending Black Hills State University. She \n     didn't know exactly at the time how or why, but she knew \n     somehow her future would be in that building.\n       After earning a degree in business and 10 years in banking, \n     Kamstra changed course and earned a degree in culinary arts \n     at the Colorado Institute of art. In 1999, with the help of \n     an SBA-guaranteed loan, Kamstra leased the old dilapidated \n     building, refurbished it and opened Roma's Ristorante. When \n     the old building proved too small, Kamstra adapted, securing \n     another SBA-backed loan in 2010 to finance construction of a \n     new building, with more space. Since then, sales have nearly \n     doubled and staff has increased from 11 to 35.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/07/senate-section/article/S3538-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3538-S3539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      TRIBUTE TO GRACE S. MATTERN\n\n Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, today I recognize and congratulate \nGrace S. Mattern for her 30 years of service on behalf of the New \nHampshire Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence.\n  Since its inception, the coalition has become a leader in the \nstruggle for victims', women's, and children's rights. Over the past \nquarter century, Grace has shaped the way domestic violence and sexual \nassault is understood and responded to in New Hampshire. Under Grace's \nleadership, the coalition has developed a nationally recognized model \nfor protocols, state law, and health care initiatives. On the local \nlevel, there has been no victim-centered legislation in which Grace has \nnot played a major part.\n  One of Grace's strongest attributes is her ability to work with \npeople and facilitate meetings in a productive way. She has worked \ntirelessly to encourage everyone to work together to strengthen efforts \nto end domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking. Her work \nincludes participation in many boards and commissions both nationally \nand locally.\n  Grace has been involved in various projects that involve \ngroundbreaking work not only for New Hampshire but also for the \ncountry. Because of her leadership in 1997, the coalition, in \nconjunction with the State, was selected\n\n[[Page S3539]]\n\nby the Family Violence Prevention Fund to establish a partnership to \nimprove the health care system's response to domestic violence, called \nthe National Health Initiative. New Hampshire was one of only 10 States \nin the Nation to participate in this program and the only State in New \nEngland. To this day, Grace continues to work with the medical \ncommunity to educate physicians on the impact of trauma from domestic \nand sexual violence.\n  In 1999, the coalition successfully applied to be one of six sites in \nthe country selected for what is known as the Greenbook Project. \nGrafton County was selected and funded as a national demonstration site \nfor improving collaboration between domestic violence organizations, \ncourts, and child protective services in families where there is a co-\noccurrence of domestic violence, child abuse, and neglect. New \nHampshire was the only site selected in the eastern United States. This \nproject has led to more collaborative efforts not only in Grafton \nCounty but across New Hampshire.\n  Grace was highly involved in the creation of one of the first \nAmeriCorps programs in the State. Named the AmeriCorps Victim \nAssistance Program, it was a ``first in the Nation'' model that she \nstarted with representatives from the New Hampshire Department of \nJustice and the State's court system, and is now in its 11th year. The \nprogram recruits and trains members to assist victims of domestic \nviolence, sexual violence, and stalking at crisis centers, police \ndepartments, prosecutors' offices, the New Hampshire Department of \nJustice, and on college and university campuses throughout the State.\n  As Grace retires, I commend her efforts and congratulate her for all \nof the accomplishments of the New Hampshire Coalition Against Domestic \nand Sexual Violence. I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing her \n30 years of service on behalf of the people of New Hampshire.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/07/senate-section/article/S3539-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     MENDOTA HIGH SCHOOL CHESS TEAM\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

A bill to expand geothermal production, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today Sen. Crapo, Sen. Risch, Sen. Merkley, \nand I are introducing the Geothermal Production Expansion Act of 2011. \nThe bill is aimed at making improvements to the Geothermal Steam Act \nand is very similar to legislation introduced in the 111th Congress as \nS. 3993.\n  Both bills contain identical provisions to allow the Secretary of the \nInterior to lease a limited amount of public land adjacent to existing \ngeothermal property at fair market value. The reason for this change is \nto allow the rapid expansion of already identified geothermal resources \nwithout the additional delays of competitive leasing and without \nopening up those adjacent properties to speculative bidders who have no \ninterest in actually developing the resource, only in extracting as \nmuch money as they can from the existing geothermal lease holder. \nCurrent lease holders are understandably reluctant to nominate adjacent \nlands to proven resources for competitive leasing because doing so \nwould immediately signal the value of those adjacent properties. As a \nresult, existing geothermal developers will likely not realize the full \npotential of the geothermal energy resources that they have spent \nmillions of dollars exploring, proving, and developing without these \nchanges. And, the Treasury will not realize the economic value of those \nadjacent parcels, which go unleased and undeveloped as a result. For \nthese reasons, the bill has the strong support of the Geothermal Energy \nAssociation.\n  I want to emphasize that this bill is not a giveaway. The amount of \nland that can be leased non-competitively is limited to less than 640 \nacres per lease. It can only be leased where there are already proven \nresources and thus more likely than not to increase overall Federal \nroyalties paid to the Treasury as the adjacent parcels are incorporated \ninto the developer's geothermal energy project. Third, the bidder must \npay fair market value for the lease as determined by the Interior \nDepartment. Finally, this bill contains an additional provision, which \nwas not included in the prior version, which will significantly \nincrease the annual rental payments for the newly acquired adjacent \nland in order to ensure that the bill comes as close as possible to \nfull economic recovery for the taxpayers.\n  Current law sets two different annual rental payment levels for \ngeothermal leases. These are amounts that the lease-holder pays per \nyear for every acre held in lease. The rental rate for non-competitive \nleases is $1 per acre per year. The rate for competitive leases begins \nat $2 per acre for the first year and increases to $3 for the next 9 \nyears. The sole difference between the bill introduced in the prior \nCongress and the bill being introduced today is that the version being \nintroduced today treats the new, adjacent lease as a competitive lease \nfor determining the annual rental even though it is being acquired as a \nnon-competitive lease. This will have the clear effect of raising the \nannual rental payments on the newly acquired adjacent lands to the \nhigher rate of $2 and then $3 per acre and increase revenue to the \nTreasury. This change underscores our intent, as sponsors of the bill, \nto ensure that the result of these changes in the Geothermal Steam Act \nis truly to increase geothermal energy production on Federal lands \nwithout any overall loss of revenue to the taxpayers from non-\ncompetitive award of these adjacent lands.\n  Geothermal energy is, by definition, a domestic renewable energy \nresource with enormous potential, but developers face high costs and \neconomic risks of finding the right location to extract energy. These \nchanges will help ensure that once those resources have been proven on \nFederal lands, they can be fully developed as quickly and efficiently \nas possible.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1149\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Geothermal Production \n     Expansion Act of 2011''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) it is in the best interest of the United States to \n     develop clean renewable geothermal energy;\n       (2) development of that energy should be promoted on \n     appropriate Federal land;\n       (3) under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. 15801 et \n     seq.), the Bureau of Land Management is authorized to issue 3 \n     different types of noncompetitive leases for production of \n     geothermal energy on Federal land, including--\n       (A) noncompetitive geothermal leases to mining claim \n     holders that have a valid operating plan;\n       (B) direct use leases; and\n       (C) leases on parcels that do not sell at a competitive \n     auction;\n       (4) Federal geothermal energy leasing activity should be \n     directed toward persons seeking to develop the land as \n     opposed to persons seeking to speculate on geothermal \n     resources and artificially raising the cost of legitimate \n     geothermal energy development;\n       (5) developers of geothermal energy on Federal land that \n     have invested substantial capital and made high risk \n     investments should be allowed to secure a discovery of \n     geothermal energy resources; and\n       (6) successful geothermal development on Federal land will \n     provide increased revenue to the Federal Government, with the \n     payment of production royalties over decades.\n\n     SEC. 3. NONCOMPETITIVE LEASING OF ADJOINING AREAS FOR \n                   DEVELOPMENT OF GEOTHERMAL RESOURCES.\n\n       Section 4(b) of the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 (30 U.S.C. \n     1003(b)) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(4) Adjoining land.--\n       ``(A) Definitions.--In this paragraph:\n       ``(i) Fair market value per acre.--The term `fair market \n     value per acre' means a dollar amount per acre that--\n\n       ``(I) except as provided in this clause, shall be equal to \n     the market value per acre as determined by the Secretary \n     under regulations issued under this paragraph;\n       ``(II) shall be determined by the Secretary with respect to \n     a lease under this paragraph, by not later than the end of \n     the 90-day period beginning on the date the Secretary \n     receives an application for the lease;

A bill to prevent and mitigate identity theft, to ensure \nprivacy, to provide notice of security breaches, and to enhance \ncriminal penalties, law enforcement assistance, and other protections \nagainst security breaches, fraudulent access, and misuse of personally \nidentifiable information; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to reintroduce the \nPersonal Data Privacy and Security Act. The recent and troubling data \nbreaches at Sony, Epsilon and Lockheed Martin on U.S. Government \ncomputers is clear evidence that developing a comprehensive national \nstrategy to protect data privacy and cybersecurity is one of the most \nchallenging and important issues facing our Nation. The Personal Data \nPrivacy and Security Act will help to meet this challenge, by better \nprotecting Americans from the growing threats of data breaches and \nidentity theft. I thank Senators Schumer and Cardin for cosponsoring \nthis important privacy legislation.\n  When I first introduced this bill six years ago, I had high hopes of \nbringing urgently needed data privacy reforms to the American people. \nAlthough the Judiciary Committee favorably reported this bill three \ntimes--in 2005, 2007, and again in 2009--the legislation languished on \nthe Senate calendar.\n  While the Congress has waited to act, the dangers to our privacy, \neconomic prosperity and national security posed by data breaches have \nnot gone away. According to the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, more than \n533 million records have been involved in data security breaches since \n2005. Just last week, Google announced that the Gmail accounts for \nhundreds of its users, including senior U.S. Government officials, have \nbeen hacked in an apparent state-sponsored cyberattack. As The \nWashington Post editorial board recently observed, ``[n]ow there is a \nneed for legislative action. As the recent high-profile leaks of \npersonal data at Google, Sony and the data-collecting company Epsilon \nsuggest, this issue is a ticking bomb.''\n  In May, the Obama administration released several proposals to \nenhance cybersecurity, including a data breach proposal that adopts the \ncarefully balanced framework of this bill. I am pleased that many of \nthe sound privacy principles in this bill have been embraced by the \nPresident and his administration.\n  The Personal Data Privacy and Security Act requires that data brokers \nlet consumers know what sensitive personal information they have about \nthem, and to allow individuals to correct inaccurate information. The \nbill also requires that companies that have databases with sensitive \npersonal information on Americans establish and implement data privacy \nand security programs.\n  The bill would also establish a single nationwide standard for data \nbreach notification. The bill requires notice to consumers when their \nsensitive personal information has been compromised.\n  This bill also provides for tough criminal penalties for anyone who \nwould intentionally and willfully conceal the fact that a data breach \nhas occurred when the breach causes economic damage to consumers. The \nbill also includes the administration's recent proposal to update the \nComputer Fraud and Abuse Act, so that attempted computer hacking and \nconspiracy to commit computer hacking offenses are subject to the same \ncriminal penalties, as the underlying offense.\n  Finally, the bill addresses the important issue of the Government's \nuse of personal data by requiring that Federal agencies notify affected \nindividuals when Government data breaches occur, and by placing privacy \nand security front and center when Federal agencies evaluate whether \ndata brokers can be trusted with Government contracts that involve \nsensitive information about the American people.\n  Of course, no one has a monopoly on good ideas to solve the serious \nproblems of identity theft and lax cybersecurity. But, this bill puts \nforth some meaningful solutions to this vexing problem.\n  I have drafted this bill after long and thoughtful consultation with \nmany of the stakeholders on this issue, including the privacy, consumer \nprotection and business communities. I have also consulted with the \nDepartments of Justice and Homeland Security, and with the Federal \nTrade Commission. I have worked closely with other Senators, including \nSenators Feinstein and Schumer.\n  This is a comprehensive bill that not only deals with the need to \nprovide Americans with notice when they have been victims of a data \nbreach, but that also deals with the underlying problem of lax security \nand lack of accountability to help prevent data breaches from occurring \nin the first place. Enacting this comprehensive data privacy \nlegislation remains one of my legislative priorities as Chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  This bill has always garnered strong bipartisan support. Protecting \nprivacy\n\n[[Page S3545]]\n\nrights is of critical importance to all of us, regardless of party or \nideology. I hope that all Senators will support this measure to better \nprotect Americans' privacy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1151\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) databases of personally identifiable information are \n     increasingly prime targets of hackers, identity thieves, \n     rogue employees, and other criminals, including organized and \n     sophisticated criminal operations;\n       (2) identity theft is a serious threat to the Nation's \n     economic stability, homeland security, the development of e-\n     commerce, and the privacy rights of Americans;\n       (3) over 9,300,000 individuals were victims of identity \n     theft in America last year;\n       (4) security breaches are a serious threat to consumer \n     confidence, homeland security, e-commerce, and economic \n     stability;\n       (5) it is important for business entities that own, use, or \n     license personally identifiable information to adopt \n     reasonable procedures to ensure the security, privacy, and \n     confidentiality of that personally identifiable information;\n       (6) individuals whose personal information has been \n     compromised or who have been victims of identity theft should \n     receive the necessary information and assistance to mitigate \n     their damages and to restore the integrity of their personal \n     information and identities;\n       (7) data brokers have assumed a significant role in \n     providing identification, authentication, and screening \n     services, and related data collection and analyses for \n     commercial, nonprofit, and government operations;\n       (8) data misuse and use of inaccurate data have the \n     potential to cause serious or irreparable harm to an \n     individual's livelihood, privacy, and liberty and undermine \n     efficient and effective business and government operations;\n       (9) there is a need to ensure that data brokers conduct \n     their operations in a manner that prioritizes fairness, \n     transparency, accuracy, and respect for the privacy of \n     consumers;\n       (10) government access to commercial data can potentially \n     improve safety, law enforcement, and national security; and\n       (11) because government use of commercial data containing \n     personal information potentially affects individual privacy, \n     and law enforcement and national security operations, there \n     is a need for Congress to exercise oversight over government \n     use of commercial data.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Coburn, Mr. McConnell, Mr. \nBarrasso, Mr. Brown of Massachusetts, Mr. Moran, Mr. Thune, Mr. Enzi, \nMs. Ayotte, and Mr. Isakson) submitted an amendment intended to be \nproposed by her to the bill S. 782, to amend the Public Works and \nEconomic Development Act of 1965 to reauthorize that Act, and for other \npurposes; which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n  TITLE ___--FREEDOM FROM RESTRICTIVE EXCESSIVE EXECUTIVE DEMANDS AND \n                            ONEROUS MANDATES\n\n     SEC. ___1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Freedom from Restrictive \n     Excessive Executive Demands and Onerous Mandates Act of \n     2011''.\n\n     SEC. ___2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) A vibrant and growing small business sector is critical \n     to the recovery of the economy of the United States.\n       (2) Regulations designed for application to large-scale \n     entities have been applied uniformly to small businesses and \n     other small entities, sometimes inhibiting the ability of \n     small entities to create new jobs.\n       (3) Uniform Federal regulatory and reporting requirements \n     in many instances have imposed on small businesses and other \n     small entities unnecessary and disproportionately burdensome \n     demands, including legal, accounting, and consulting costs, \n     thereby threatening the viability of small entities and the \n     ability of small entities to compete and create new jobs in a \n     global marketplace.\n       (4) Since 1980, Federal agencies have been required to \n     recognize and take account of the differences in the scale \n     and resources of regulated entities, but in many instances \n     have failed to do so.\n       (5) In 2009, there were nearly 70,000 pages in the Federal \n     Register, and, according to research by the Office of \n     Advocacy of the Small Business Administration, the annual \n     cost of Federal regulations totals $1,750,000,000,000. Small \n     firms bear a disproportionate burden, paying approximately 36 \n     percent more per employee than larger firms in annual \n     regulatory compliance costs.\n       (6) All agencies in the Federal Government should fully \n     consider the costs, including indirect economic impacts and \n     the potential for job loss, of proposed rules, periodically \n     review existing regulations to determine their impact on \n     small entities, and repeal regulations that are unnecessarily \n     duplicative or have outlived their stated purpose.\n       (7) It is the intention of Congress to amend chapter 6 of \n     title 5, United States Code, to\n\n[[Page S3554]]\n\n     ensure that all impacts, including foreseeable indirect \n     effects, of proposed and final rules are considered by \n     agencies during the rulemaking process and that the agencies \n     assess a full range of alternatives that will limit adverse \n     economic consequences, enhance economic benefits, and fully \n     address potential job loss.\n\n     SEC. ___3. INCLUDING INDIRECT ECONOMIC IMPACT IN SMALL ENTITY \n                   ANALYSES.\n\n       Section 601 of title 5, United States Code, is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(9) the term `economic impact' means, with respect to a \n     proposed or final rule--\n       ``(A) the economic effects on small entities directly \n     regulated by the rule; and\n       ``(B) the reasonably foreseeable economic effects of the \n     rule on small entities that--\n       ``(i) purchase products or services from, sell products or \n     services to, or otherwise conduct business with entities \n     directly regulated by the rule;\n       ``(ii) are directly regulated by other governmental \n     entities as a result of the rule; or\n       ``(iii) are not directly regulated by the agency as a \n     result of the rule but are otherwise subject to other agency \n     regulations as a result of the rule.''.\n\n     SEC. ___4. JUDICIAL REVIEW TO ALLOW SMALL ENTITIES TO \n                   CHALLENGE PROPOSED REGULATIONS.\n\n       Section 611(a) of title 5, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (1), by inserting ``603,'' after ``601,'';\n       (2) in paragraph (2), by inserting ``603,'' after ``601,'';\n       (3) by striking paragraph (3) and inserting the following:\n       ``(3) A small entity may seek such review during the 1-year \n     period beginning on the date of final agency action, except \n     that--\n       ``(A) if a provision of law requires that an action \n     challenging a final agency action be commenced before the \n     expiration of 1 year, the lesser period shall apply to an \n     action for judicial review under this section; and\n       ``(B) in the case of noncompliance with section 603 or \n     605(b), a small entity may seek judicial review of agency \n     compliance with such section before the close of the public \n     comment period.''; and\n       (4) in paragraph (4)--\n       (A) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``, and'' and \n     inserting a semicolon;\n       (B) in subparagraph (B), by striking the period and \n     inserting ``; or''; and\n       (C) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(C) issuing an injunction prohibiting an agency from \n     taking any agency action with respect to a rulemaking until \n     that agency is in compliance with the requirements of section \n     603 or 605.''.\n\n     SEC. ___5.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Debit Interchange Fee \n     Reform Act of 2011''.\n\n     SEC. __2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) in response to the proposed debit interchange rule of \n     the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System mandated \n     by section 1075 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and \n     Consumer Protection Act, the Chairman of Board, the \n     Comptroller of the Currency, the Chairperson of the Federal \n     Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Chairman of the \n     National Credit Union Administration Board have publicly \n     raised concerns about the impact of the proposed rule;\n       (2) while testifying before the Committee on Banking, \n     Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate on February 17, \n     2011, the Chairman of the Board stated in response to \n     questions about the small bank exemption to the interchange \n     rule, ``there is some risk that the exemption will not be \n     effective and that the interchange fees available through \n     smaller institutions will be reduced to the same extent we \n     would see for larger banks'';\n       (3) the Acting Comptroller of the Currency, in comments to \n     the Board, cited safety and soundness concerns and stated, \n     ``We believe the proposal takes an unnecessarily narrow \n     approach to recovery of costs that would be allowable under \n     the law and that are recognized and indisputably part of \n     conducting a debit card business. This has long-term safety \n     and soundness consequences for banks of all sizes.'';\n       (4) the Chairperson of the Board of Directors of the \n     Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation stated in comments to \n     the Board regarding the proposed rule their concern that the \n     small bank exemption would not work, stating, ``We are \n     concerned that these institutions may not actually receive \n     the benefit of the interchange fee limit exemption explicitly \n     provided by Congress, resulting in a loss of income for \n     community banks and ultimately higher banking costs for their \n     customers.'';\n       (5) the Chairman of the National Credit Union \n     Administration Board, in comments to the Board, cited concern \n     with making sure there are ``meaningful exemptions for \n     smaller card issuers''; and\n       (6) all of the comments and concerns raised by the banking \n     and credit union regulatory agencies cast serious questions \n     about the practical implementation of section 1075 of the \n     Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, \n     and further study and consideration are needed.\n\n     SEC. __3.

In all cases \n     when the manager of the conference report is in favor of any \n     motion, appeal, or amendment, the time in opposition shall be \n     under the control of the minority leader or the minority \n     leader's designee.\n       (iv) Amendments in disagreement.--In any case in which \n     there are amendments in disagreement, time on each amendment \n     shall be limited to 30 minutes, to be equally divided \n     between, and controlled by, the manager of the conference \n     report and the minority leader or the minority leader's \n     designee. No amendment that is not germane to the provisions \n     of such amendments shall be received.\n       (v) Limitation on motion to recommit.--A motion to recommit \n     the conference report is not in order.\n       (c) Rules of the Senate and the House of Representatives.--\n     This section is enacted by Congress--\n       (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate \n     and the House of Representatives, respectively, and is deemed \n     to be part of the rules of each House, respectively, but \n     applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed \n     in that House in the case of a bill, and it supersedes other \n     rules only to the extent that it is inconsistent with such \n     rules; and\n       (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of \n     either House to change the rules (so far as they relate to \n     the procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner, \n     and to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of \n     that House.\n\n     SEC. _06. EXPEDITED CONSIDERATION OF COMMISSION SCHEDULE AND \n                   REVIEW BILL.\n\n       (a) Introduction and Committee Consideration.--\n\n[[Page S3562]]\n\n       (1) Introduction.--The Commission Schedule and Review bill \n     submitted under section _04(b) shall be introduced in the \n     Senate by the majority leader, or the majority leader's \n     designee, and in the House of Representatives, by the \n     Speaker, or the Speaker's designee. Upon such introduction, \n     the Commission Schedule and Review bill shall be referred to \n     the appropriate committees of Congress under paragraph (2). \n     If the Commission Schedule and Review bill is not introduced \n     in accordance with the preceding sentence, then any member of \n     Congress may introduce the Commission Schedule and Review \n     bill in their respective House of Congress beginning on the \n     date that is the 5th calendar day that such House is in \n     session following the date of the submission of such \n     aggregate legislative language provisions.\n       (2) Committee consideration.--\n       (A) Referral.--A Commission Schedule and Review bill \n     introduced under paragraph (1) shall be referred to any \n     appropriate committee of jurisdiction in the Senate, any \n     appropriate committee of jurisdiction in the House of \n     Representatives, the Committee on the Budget and the \n     Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of \n     the Senate and the Committee on the Budget and the Committee \n     on Oversight and Government Reform of the House of \n     Representatives. A committee to which a Commission Schedule \n     and Review bill is referred under this paragraph may review \n     and comment on such bill, may report such bill to the \n     respective House, and may not amend such bill.\n       (B) Reporting.--Not later than 30 calendar days after the \n     introduction of the Commission Schedule and Review bill, each \n     Committee of Congress to which the Commission Schedule and \n     Review bill was referred shall report the bill.\n       (C) Discharge of committee.--If a committee to which is \n     referred a Commission Schedule and Review bill has not \n     reported such Commission Schedule and Review bill at the end \n     of 30 calendar days after its introduction or at the end of \n     the first day after there has been reported to the House \n     involved a Commission Schedule and Review bill, whichever is \n     earlier, such committee shall be deemed to be discharged from \n     further consideration of such Commission Schedule and Review \n     bill, and such Commission Schedule and Review bill shall be \n     placed on the appropriate calendar of the House involved.\n       (b) Expedited Procedure.--\n       (1) Consideration.--\n       (A) In general.--Not later than 5 calendar days after the \n     date on which a committee has been discharged from \n     consideration of a Commission Schedule and Review bill, the \n     majority leader of the Senate, or the majority leader's \n     designee, or the Speaker of the House of Representatives, or \n     the Speaker's designee, shall move to proceed to the \n     consideration of the Commission Schedule and Review bill. It \n     shall also be in order for any member of the Senate or the \n     House of Representatives, respectively, to move to proceed to \n     the consideration of the Commission Schedule and Review bill \n     at any time after the conclusion of such 5-day period.\n       (B) Motion to proceed.--A motion to proceed to the \n     consideration of a Commission Schedule and Review bill is \n     highly privileged in the House of Representatives and is \n     privileged in the Senate and is not debatable. The motion is \n     not subject to amendment, to a motion to postpone \n     consideration of the Commission Schedule and Review bill, or \n     to a motion to proceed to the consideration of other \n     business. A motion to reconsider the vote by which the motion \n     to proceed is agreed to or not agreed to shall not be in \n     order. If the motion to proceed is agreed to, the Senate or \n     the House of Representatives, as the case may be, shall \n     immediately proceed to consideration of the Commission \n     Schedule and Review bill without intervening motion, order, \n     or other business, and the Commission Schedule and Review \n     bill shall remain the unfinished business of the Senate or \n     the House of Representatives, as the case may be, until \n     disposed of.\n       (C) Limited debate.--Debate on the Commission Schedule and \n     Review bill and on all debatable motions and appeals in \n     connection therewith shall be limited to not more than 10 \n     hours, which shall be divided equally between those favoring \n     and those opposing the Commission Schedule and Review bill. A \n     motion further to limit debate on the Commission Schedule and \n     Review bill is in order and is not debatable. All time used \n     for consideration of the Commission Schedule and Review bill, \n     including time used for quorum calls (except quorum calls \n     immediately preceding a vote) and voting, shall come from the \n     10 hours of debate.\n       (D) Amendments.--No amendment to the Commission Schedule \n     and Review bill shall be in order in the Senate and the House \n     of Representatives.\n       (E) Vote on final passage.--Immediately following the \n     conclusion of the debate on the Commission Schedule and \n     Review bill, the vote on final passage of the Commission \n     Schedule and Review bill shall occur.\n       (F) Other motions not in order.--A motion to postpone \n     consideration of the Commission Schedule and Review bill, a \n     motion to proceed to the consideration of other business, or \n     a motion to recommit the Commission Schedule and Review bill \n     is not in order. A motion to reconsider the vote by which the \n     Commission Schedule and Review bill is agreed to or not \n     agreed to is not in order.\n       (2) Consideration by other house.--If, before the passage \n     by one House of the Commission Schedule and Review bill that \n     was introduced in such House, such House receives from the \n     other House a Commission Schedule and Review bill as passed \n     by such other House--\n       (A) the Commission Schedule and Review bill of the other \n     House shall not be referred to a committee and may only be \n     considered for final passage in the House that receives it \n     under subparagraph (C);\n       (B) the procedure in the House in receipt of the Commission \n     Schedule and Review bill of the other House, with respect to \n     the Commission Schedule and Review bill that was introduced \n     in the House in receipt of the Commission Schedule and Review \n     bill of the other House, shall be the same as if no \n     Commission Schedule and Review bill had been received from \n     the other House; and\n       (C) notwithstanding subparagraph (B), the vote on final \n     passage shall be on the Commission Schedule and Review bill \n     of the other House. Upon disposition of a Commission Schedule \n     and Review bill that is received by one House from the other \n     House, it shall no longer be in order to consider the \n     Commission Schedule and Review bill that was introduced in \n     the receiving House.\n       (c) Rules of the Senate and the House of Representatives.--\n     This section is enacted by Congress--\n       (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate \n     and the House of Representatives, respectively, and is deemed \n     to be part of the rules of each House, respectively, but \n     applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed \n     in that House in the case of a Commission Schedule and Review \n     bill, and it supersedes other rules only to the extent that \n     it is inconsistent with such rules; and\n       (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of \n     either House to change the rules (so far as they relate to \n     the procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner, \n     and to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of \n     that House.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 396. Mr. CORNYN (for himself and Mr. Kyl) submitted an amendment \nintended to be proposed by him to the bill S. 782, to amend the Public \nWorks and Economic Development Act of 1965 to reauthorize that Act, and \nfor other purposes; which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       On page 29, after line 20, insert the following:\n\n                 TITLE II--DEBT INSTRUMENT TRANSPARENCY\n\n     SEC. 201. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Foreign-Held Debt \n     Transparency and Threat Assessment Act''.\n\n     SEC. 202. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this title:\n       (1) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term \n     ``appropriate congressional committees'' means the following:\n       (A) The Committee on Armed Services, the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations, the Committee on Finance, and the \n     Committee on the Budget of the Senate.\n       (B) The Committee on Armed Services, the Committee on \n     Foreign Affairs, the Committee on Ways and Means, and the \n     Committee on the Budget of the House of Representatives.\n       (2) Debt instruments of the united states.--The term ``debt \n     instruments of the United States'' means all bills, notes, \n     and bonds issued or guaranteed by the United States or by an \n     entity of the United States Government, including any \n     Government-sponsored enterprise.\n\n     SEC. 203. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On March 16, 2006, the United States Senate debated and \n     then narrowly passed legislation, H. J. Res. 47, to increase \n     the statutory limit on the public debt of the United States. \n     In a statement published in the Congressional Record, then-\n     Senator Barack Obama opposed the legislation and stated, \n     ``The fact that we are here today to debate raising America's \n     debt limit is a sign of leadership failure. It is a sign that \n     the U.S. Government can't pay its own bills. It is a sign \n     that we now depend on ongoing financial assistance from \n     foreign countries to finance our Government's reckless fiscal \n     policies.''. Then-Senator Obama went on to say that \n     ``Increasing America's debt weakens us domestically and \n     internationally. Leadership means that `the buck stops here'. \n     Instead, Washington is shifting the burden of bad choices \n     today onto the backs of our children and grandchildren. \n     America has a debt problem and a failure of leadership. \n     Americans deserve better.''.\n       (2) On February 25, 2010, United States Secretary of State, \n     Hillary Rodham Clinton, urged members of Congress to address \n     the Federal budget deficit: ``We have to address this deficit \n     and the debt of the United States as a matter of national \n     security, not only as a matter of economics. I do not like to \n     be in a position where the United States is a debtor nation \n     to the extent that we are.''. The Secretary went on to say \n     that reliance on foreign creditors has hit the United States \n     ``ability to protect our security, to manage difficult \n     problems and to show the leadership that we deserve.''.\n       (3) On February 16, 2011, Admiral Mike Mullen, Chairman of \n     the Joint Chiefs of Staff, testified before the Committee on \n     Armed Services of the Senate: ``Indeed, I believe that our \n     debt is the greatest threat to our national security. If we \n     as a country do\n\n[[Page S3563]]\n\n     not address our fiscal imbalances in the near-term, our \n     national power will erode, and the costs to our ability to \n     maintain and sustain influence could be great.''.\n       (4) The Department of the Treasury borrows from the private \n     economy by selling securities, including Treasury bills, \n     notes, and bonds, in order to finance the Federal budget \n     deficit. This additional borrowing to finance the deficit \n     adds to the Federal debt.\n       (5) The Federal debt stands at more than \n     $14,344,000,000,000.\n       (6) According to a report issued by the Department of the \n     Treasury on May 16, 2011, entitled ``Major Foreign Holders of \n     Treasury Securities'', foreign holdings of United States \n     Treasury securities stood at more than $3,175,000,000,000 at \n     the end of March 2011. The People's Republic of China was the \n     single largest holder with holdings of more than \n     $1,144,000,000,000.\n       (7) Despite efforts by the Department of the Treasury to \n     identify the nationality of the ultimate holders of United \n     States securities, including United States Treasury \n     securities, data pertaining to foreign holders of these \n     securities may still fail to reflect the true nationality of \n     the foreign entities involved. For example, another \n     Department of the Treasury report, issued on February 28, \n     2011, entitled ``Preliminary Report on Foreign Holdings of \n     U.S. Securities At End-June 2010'', assigns $732,000,000,000 \n     worth of United States securities to the Cayman Islands, a \n     British overseas territory with a population of only 55,000 \n     people. The Cayman Islands is not itself a large investor in \n     United States securities; rather, it is a major international \n     financial center and is routinely used as a place to invest \n     funds from elsewhere.\n       (8) On February 25, 2010, Simon Johnson, an economics \n     professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a \n     former chief economist for the International Monetary Fund, \n     testified before the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review \n     Commission that United States Treasury data understate \n     Chinese holdings of United States Government debt and ``do \n     not reveal the ultimate country of ownership when debt \n     instruments are held through an intermediary in another \n     jurisdiction.''. He stated that ``a great deal'' of the \n     United Kingdom's increase in United States Treasury \n     securities last year ``may be due to China placing offshore \n     dollars in London-based banks'', which are then used to \n     purchase United States Treasury securities.\n       (9) On February 25, 2010, Dr. Eswar Prasad, an economist at \n     Cornell University, testified before the U.S.-China Economic \n     and Security Review Commission that the amount of United \n     States debt held by the People's Republic of China is much \n     higher than United States Treasury data indicate. In his \n     revised testimony, Dr. Prasad went on to explain that China \n     is probably currently holding more than $1,300,000,000,000 in \n     United States Treasury securities.\n       (10) According to a February 3, 2009, report by the \n     Heritage Foundation, entitled ``Chinese Foreign Investment: \n     Insist on Transparency'', the State Administration of Foreign \n     Exchange (SAFE) of the People's Republic of China, the \n     government body that purchases foreign securities, is the \n     single largest global investor and the largest foreign \n     investor in the United States.\n       (11) According to a September 2008 Council on Foreign \n     Relations report entitled ``Sovereign Wealth and Sovereign \n     Power,'' ``. . . political might is often linked to financial \n     might, and a debtor's capacity to project military power \n     hinges on the support of its creditors . . . The United \n     States' main sources of financing are not allies.''. The \n     report goes on to argue that, ``the United States' current \n     reliance on other governments for financing represents an \n     underappreciated strategic vulnerability.''.\n       (12) In recent years, Chinese military officials have \n     publicized the potential use of United States Treasury \n     securities as a means of influencing United States policy and \n     deterring specific United States actions. On February 8, \n     2010, retired People's Liberation Army (PLA) Major General \n     Luo Yuan, from the PLA Academy of Military Science, stated in \n     an interview with state-controlled media that China could \n     attack the United States ``by oblique means and stealthy \n     feints'', in retaliation for United States arms sales to \n     Taiwan. He went on to say, ``Our retaliation should not be \n     restricted to merely military matters, and we should adopt a \n     strategic package of counterpunches covering politics, \n     military affairs, diplomacy and economics to treat both the \n     symptoms and root cause of this disease. For example, we \n     could sanction them using economic means, such as dumping \n     some U.S. government bonds.''.\n       (13) The PLA has also referenced the concept of nonmilitary \n     aspects of deterrence in written statements. A PLA textbook, \n     ``The Science of Military Strategy'', observes that there are \n     various forms of deterrence, including economic and \n     technological, all of which need to be developed and \n     consciously strengthened in order to maximize effect. These \n     forms will only work ``with the determination and volition of \n     employment of the force, and by dangling the word of \n     deterrence over the rival's head in case of necessity.''.\n       (14) According to a May 16, 2011, report by ABC News, a \n     congressional delegation of 10 United States Senators visited \n     China in April 2011, and met with Chinese government \n     officials. The news report indicates that, during one \n     meeting, the Senators were reprimanded by a Chinese official \n     regarding the mounting United States Federal debt.\n       (15) A February 7, 2010, report by Defense News suggests \n     that China's extensive holdings of United States Government \n     securities have already directly influenced United States \n     national security policy. According to an unnamed Pentagon \n     official, Obama Administration officials softened a draft of \n     a key national security document in order to avoid ``harsh \n     words'' that ``might upset Chinese officials at a time when \n     the United States and China are economically intertwined.''. \n     The news report indicates that these officials ``deleted \n     several passages and softened others about China's military \n     buildup''. This critical document, the 2010 Quadrennial \n     Defense Review, provides an assessment of long-term threats \n     and challenges for the nation and is intended to guide \n     military programs, plans, and budgets in the coming decades.\n       (16) The United States Government pays China a substantial \n     amount of interest on China's $1,144,000,000,000 in holdings \n     of United States Government debt, and this enhances China's \n     ability to fund its own military programs.\n       (17) According to a March 4, 2011, report by Xinhua, the \n     official press agency of the government of the People's \n     Republic of China, China plans to increase its 2011 military \n     budget by 12.7 percent to 601,000,000,000 yuan (the \n     equivalent of $91,500,000,000). This increase is in addition \n     to China's 2010 increase in its military budget of 7.5 \n     percent.\n       (18) According to the Department of Defense's (DoD) 2010 \n     report entitled ``Military and Security Developments \n     Involving the People's Republic of China,'' the DoD estimates \n     China's actual total military-related spending for 2009 to be \n     over $150,000,000,000.\n\n     SEC. 204. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the growing Federal debt of the United States has the \n     potential to jeopardize the national security and economic \n     stability of the United States;\n       (2) the increasing dependence of the United States on \n     foreign creditors has the potential to make the United States \n     vulnerable to undue influence by certain foreign creditors in \n     national security and economic policymaking;\n       (3) the People's Republic of China is the largest foreign \n     creditor of the United States, in terms of its overall \n     holdings of debt instruments of the United States;\n       (4) the current level of transparency in the scope and \n     extent of foreign holdings of debt instruments of the United \n     States is inadequate and needs to be improved, particularly \n     regarding the holdings of the People's Republic of China;\n       (5) through the People's Republic of China's large holdings \n     of debt instruments of the United States, China has become a \n     super creditor of the United States;\n       (6) under certain circumstances, the holdings of the \n     People's Republic of China could give China a tool with which \n     China can try to manipulate the domestic and foreign \n     policymaking of the United States, including the United \n     States relationship with Taiwan;\n       (7) under certain circumstances, if the People's Republic \n     of China were to be displeased with a given United States \n     policy or action, China could attempt to destabilize the \n     United States economy by rapidly divesting large portions of \n     China's holdings of debt instruments of the United States; \n     and\n       (8) the People's Republic of China's expansive holdings of \n     such debt instruments of the United States could potentially \n     pose a direct threat to the United States economy and to \n     United States national security.

Mr. President, on Friday of last week, the U.S. Department \nof Labor released a dismal update on our Nation's economy. Not only did \nour Nation's unemployment rate rise to 9.1 percent, but the number of \nAmericans looking for work increased to 14 million, and those who have \nbeen jobless for at least 6 months climbed 45.1 percent.\n  It is clear the current economic policies are not working in our \nfavor. In fact, I suggest they are working against us, creating an \nenvironment of uncertainty and hampering job growth in America. When \nthe message coming from Washington, DC, is more taxes, more regulation, \nand more intrusion in the free market system, it is no wonder \nbusinesses are not hiring additional workers.\n  Americans are looking for leadership to get our economy back on its \nfeet so they can find a job and provide for their families. In a recent \nsurvey, 90 percent of Americans said the economy is in bad shape and, \nby a margin of 2 to 1, Americans said our economy is on the wrong \ntrack. I couldn't agree more. Changing the course of our economy will \nrequire Washington, DC, changing its course.\n  Instead of creating barriers to job growth, Congress and the Obama \nadministration should be implementing policies that encourage job \ncreation. History shows that sustainable economic growth starts with \nthe private sector. So Congress and the administration have a \nresponsibility to create an environment where businesses can flourish \nand start hiring again, and that starts by pursuing a series of \nprogrowth policies.\n  First, in my view, Congress must rein in government regulation and \nstop passing burdensome mandates that come at the expense of that job \ncreation. As I tour manufacturing plants and other businesses in my \nhome State of Kansas, owners often ask: What is the next thing coming \nfrom Washington that will put me out of business? Jobs in this country \nare undercut with each new government regulation because it drives up \nthe cost of doing business, erodes our global competitiveness, and \nlimits the access to credit that businesses need to grow. Rather than \nhiring new employees, businesses are spending their resources on \ncomplying with these burdensome regulations and costly mandates--from \nthe EPA's effort to regulate carbon to the mandates imposed by the new \nhealth care law.\n  According to the Small Business Administration, the smallest \nbusinesses--those with less than 20 employees--spend 36 percent more \nper employee than larger firms to comply with Federal regulations. That \nis roughly $10,585 per employee to comply with all Federal regulations, \nand very small firms are burdened even more per employee.\n  Small business, as we know, is the backbone of the American economy. \nThose businesses employ half our private sector workers and have \ngenerated 65 percent of new jobs over the last 20 years. So it makes no \nsense to drive up their operating costs with additional government \nregulations because that leaves them with fewer resources to hire new \nworkers.\n  Second, Congress can spur economic growth by replacing our convoluted \nand burdensome Tax Code with one that is fair, simple, and certain. \nWhen businesses know what to expect, they can better plan for future \nexpenses and will invest in their companies, grow, and hire new \nworkers.\n  Unfortunately, Congress is often too shortsighted when it comes to \ntax policy. A 1-year or 2-year extension of tax cuts does not give \nbusinesses the certainty they need to plan for that future. Employers \nhave to make decisions about the future of their business today, and \ngiven the fact that their taxes will rise in the near future, they are \nreluctant to hire new workers or expand their business. If we are \nserious about creating jobs in this country, we have to give our \ncountry's job creators the ability to plan for the future and a Tax \nCode that encourages investment.\n  Third, Congress must open foreign markets for American manufactured \ngoods and agricultural products. Across the country, thousands of \nAmericans depend upon exports for jobs, including more than one-quarter \nof all manufacturing workers in Kansas. By increasing our Nation's \nexports, we will create jobs and opportunities for all Americans \nwithout raising taxes or increasing the Federal budget. We should be \nexporting our manufactured goods and agriculture products, not our \njobs.\n  Unfortunately, trade agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South \nKorea, for example, have been stalled for 4 years, and each day that \npasses, we risk losing more of our market share to our competitors. \nDuring this delay, Colombia has moved forward on trade deals with \nCanada, Chile, the European Union, Brazil, and Argentina. On July 1, a \npending agreement between the European Union and Korea will go into \neffect. We cannot afford to sit on the sidelines while other countries \ncontinue to move forward in their trading relationships with our \ntrading partners.\n  Together, the trade agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea \nare worth an estimated $13 billion in U.S. exports. The agreement with \nKorea alone is worth $11 billion and would create an estimated 70,000 \nnew jobs for Americans.\n  It is past time for the President to send Congress implementing \nlanguage for these trade agreements so we can open more markets for \nAmerican goods and agricultural commodities. When American businesses \nare given the opportunity to compete on a level playing field for these \nmarkets, they will succeed and more jobs will be created here at home.\n  Fourth, the United States, to remain competitive in the global \nmarket, must develop a comprehensive energy policy that allows for \nample energy supply that is both affordable and reliable. Rising gas \nprices and recent events in the Middle East have again demonstrated the \nimportance of having access to a reliable energy supply. Higher energy \nprices are not only threatening\n\n[[Page S3568]]\n\nour global competitiveness, they are also hampering our economic \nrecovery. I don't know how we can expect our economy to recover when \nenergy prices are what they are. But when employers have access to \nreliable energy supplies, they can spend their resources on hiring new \nworkers rather than on those escalating energy costs.\n  In my view, no single form of energy can provide the answer. To meet \nour country's energy needs, we must develop traditional sources of oil, \nnatural gas and coal, encourage the development of renewable energy \nsources such as biofuels, wind, solar, geothermal and hydropower and \nexpand the use of nuclear energy, as well as encourage conservation.\n  A recent report from the Congressional Research Service found that \nour country's resources are far greater than those of Saudi Arabia, \nChina, and Canada combined. In fact, our combined recoverable oil, \nnatural gas, and coal supplies are the largest on the planet. Yet, in \n2009, the administration canceled 77 oil and gas leases in Utah and \nlast year suspended 61 leases in Montana. The administration has also \nrestricted access to oil and gas exploration in the eastern Gulf of \nMexico and off the Atlantic coast--although these two areas hold \ncommercial oil reserves of 28 billion barrels and up to 142 trillion \ncubic feet of natural gas. More production of energy in the U.S. means \nmore jobs in the U.S. and more U.S. workers at work and lower energy \ncosts for businesses and their employees.\n\n  Finally, Congress must reduce government spending to bring about this \neconomic growth. I think the debate on government spending is often \nseen as some philosophical discussion or a partisan political bickering \nopportunity here in Washington, DC. But the reality is out of control \ngovernment borrowing and spending has very real consequences for the \ndaily lives of Americans. Our failure to balance the budget will result \nin increased inflation, higher interest rates, fewer jobs, and a lower \nstandard of living for every American. But this reality has not yet \nsunk in here in Washington, DC, despite several recent warnings.\n  At the end of April, Standard & Poor's, one of the world's big three \ncredit rating agencies, downgraded our Nation's future financial \noutlook from ``stable'' to ``negative.'' S said our country has \n``very large budget deficits and rising government indebtedness--and \nthe path to addressing these is not clear.''\n  Furthermore, just last week another credit rating agency, Moody's--if \nwe needed another reminder--warned that our failure to reduce our \ngrowing deficit could prompt them to downgrade their outlook on our AAA \nrating to negative. Without a ``credible agreement on substantial \ndeficit reduction''--this is Moody's talking--this could happen as soon \nas next month. This would have a devastating impact on our already \nstruggling economy.\n  Reducing our Nation's debt will require us to work together to craft \na serious plan. President Obama's proposal to balance budgets in part \nby raising taxes on businesses, in my view, would only make our \neconomic circumstances worse.\n  Washington does not have a revenue problem; it has a spending \nproblem. It is time for us to work together and pass a responsible \nbudget to reduce our deficit this year, next year, and far into the \nfuture. The plan should include significant spending reductions, a \nbalanced budget amendment to restrict Washington's future ability to \nborrow money that would put us right back in the mess we are in today, \nand should address our long-term unfunded mandates.\n  As John Adams once quipped: ``Facts are stubborn.'' And the facts \ntell us that Washington must change direction if we are to grow our \neconomy and put people back to work. The failed economy we are \nexperiencing and the financial collapse around the corner is the most \nexpected economic crisis in our lifetime. We know what is going to \nhappen if we do not act, and it would be immoral for us to look the \nother way or to kick the can down the road because the politics of \nthese issues are too difficult to deal with.\n  Americans deserve leadership here in our Nation's Capital to confront \nthese challenges and not to push them off to the next generation of \nAmericans. If we do so, if we confront these issues correctly in a \nresponsible way, businesses will succeed, profits will be made, \nemployees will be hired, and Americans will again be able to live and \npursue the American dream.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I had \nno idea when I came to make my remarks that they would be so in keeping \nwith a part of his speech with regard to regulation and what the \nregulatory regimen of the current administration is doing to economic \nimprovement and economic development in the United States of America.\n  I rise for a moment to talk about the Dodd-Frank legislation, to talk \nabout the qualified residential mortgage provision, and to talk about \nthe six regulators of financial services and a recent decision they \nmade.\n  Shaun Donovan, Ben Bernanke, Sheila Bair, Edward Demarco, John Walsh, \nand Mary Schapiro were challenged with carrying out and writing the \nrules of intent for Dodd-Frank. When they published, a few weeks ago--\nabout 2 months ago now--the proposed rule on qualified residential \nmortgages, it created a firestorm and created a number of speeches on \nthe floor of the U.S. Senate. It also created a letter from 39 Members \nof the U.S. Senate, which I ask unanimous consent be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 26, 2011.\n     Hon. Shaun L.S. Donovan,\n     Secretary, Department of Housing & Urban Development, 7th \n         Street, SW, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Ben S. Bernanke,\n     Chairman, Board of Governors of The Federal Reserve System, \n         20th & Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Sheila C. Bair,\n     Chairman, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., 17th Street, NW, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mary L. Schapiro,\n     Chairman, Securities and Exchange Commission, F Street, NE, \n         Washington, DC.\n     John G. Walsh,\n     Acting Comptroller, Office of the Comptroller Of the \n         Currency, E Street, SW, Washington, DC.\n     Edward J. Demarco,\n     Acting Director, Federal Housing Agency, G Street, NW, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Ladies and Gentlemen: We the undersigned intended to create \n     a broad exemption from risk retention for historically safe \n     mortgage products when we included the Qualified Residential \n     Mortgage (QRM) exemption in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform \n     and Consumer Protection Act.\n       The statute requires the QRM definition to be based on \n     ``underwriting and product features that historical loan \n     performance data indicate result in a lower risk of \n     default,'' and provides clear guidance on the types of \n     factors that can be used, including:\n       Documentation of income and assets;\n       Debt-to-income ratios and residual income standards;\n       Product features that mitigate payment shock;\n       Restrictions or prohibitions on non-traditional features \n     like negative amortization, balloon payments, and prepayment \n     penalties; and\n       Mortgage insurance on low down payment loans.\n       The proposed regulation goes beyond the intent and language \n     of the statute by imposing unnecessarily tight down payment \n     restrictions. These restrictions unduly narrow the QRM \n     definition and would necessarily increase consumer costs and \n     reduce access to affordable credit. Well underwritten loans, \n     regardless of down payment, were not the cause of the \n     mortgage crisis. The proposed regulation also establishes \n     overly narrow debt to income guidelines that will preclude \n     capable, creditworthy homebuyers from access to affordable \n     housing finance.\n       The extensive additional requirements for QRMs in the \n     proposed rule swing the pendulum too far and reduce the \n     availability of affordable mortgage capital for otherwise \n     qualified consumers. Many borrowers would simply be forced to \n     pay much higher rates and fees for safe loans that \n     nevertheless did not meet the exceedingly narrow QRM \n     criteria. Sadly, in many cases, some creditworthy borrowers \n     may not be able to get a mortgage at all.\n       Congress included the QRM to exempt safe, well-underwritten \n     mortgages that have stood the test of time from the risk \n     retention requirement. We urge you to follow our intent as \n     you modify the proposed risk retention rule.\n           Sincerely,\n         Mary L. Landrieu, U.S. Senator; Kay R. Hagan, U.S. \n           Senator; Johnny Isakson,\n\n[[Page S3569]]\n\n           U.S. Senator; Saxby Chambliss; Bob Casey, Jr.; Jeff \n     Sessions; Richard Burr; Chris Coons; Ron Wyden; Mark \n     Pryor; Scott P.

These 39 Senators wrote specifically to these regulators \nto express their concern with the possible effects of the proposed \nregulation that the regulators were proposing on qualified residential \nmortgages. I am pleased to say that a few days ago the six regulators \nextended the comment period from June 20 now to August 1. I have not \ntalked to them, but I hope it is because they have been listening to \nspeeches, they have been reading the comments, they have been seeing \nthe testimony, and they understand, if left uncorrected, and if put in \nplace, the current rule on qualified residential mortgages will be a \nsecond hit to what is already a very fragile U.S. housing market.\n  Just last week, the reports for the most recent month in terms of \nresidential home sales saw the beginning of a second dip in residential \nhousing. This morning the Wall Street Journal reported 40 percent of \nthe homes in America that contain a second mortgage or an equity line \nof credit are now under water--40 percent.\n  One of the reasons they are is because prices are continuing to \ndecline. One of the reasons prices are declining is the buyers are not \nthere. It is a seller's market, we have too many foreclosures, and too \nmany short sales.\n  The impact of the qualified residential mortgage amendment to Dodd-\nFrank was an amendment offered by Mrs. Hagan, Ms. Landrieu, and \nmyself--all with experience in housing and knowledge about the \nmarketplace. We put it in because the original Dodd-Frank legislation \nsaid mortgage people making mortgages were going to have to hold risk \nretention of 5 percent in that mortgage, which basically would put most \neverybody in the mortgage business out of the mortgage business, except \na handful of people. We put in the qualified residential mortgage \namendment the specific parameters by which a mortgage could be exempt \nfrom risk retention, which were a downpayment of at least 20 percent \nor, if the downpayment was less than that, it had to carry private \nmortgage insurance to insure the effect of an 80 percent loan; second, \nqualified ratios that demonstrated the couple could pay back the \nmortgage under any reasonable assumption; third, the house had to \nappraise; fourth, the credit worthiness of the individual had to \ndemonstrate they could pay for the mortgage.\n  Those were all the reasonable underwriting criteria that existed \nbefore the financial collapse of mid 2006-2007. The rule that was \nproposed by the six regulators, on which now they have extended the \ncommentary time, completely avoided and made no mention of the private \nmortgage insurance requirement and said for a qualified residential \nmortgage to exempt risk retention, the buyer would have to put down at \nleast 20 percent. Most buyers in America do not have at least 20 \npercent, and under current economic times and what has happened, they \nhave a lot less than that.\n  But for years--and I was in the housing business for 33 years--the 90 \nand 95 percent conventional loans made in this country were the \nbackbone of the loans that helped support the housing market, and those \nloans required a private mortgage insurance policy on any amount of \nloan exceeding 80 percent, up to 95 percent. We need the ultimate rule \ncoming back from these regulators, by August 1, to contain that \nprovision so as to exempt from risk retention any mortgage that meets \nthe underwriting criteria, including private mortgage insurance on any \namount above 80 percent, and up to 95 percent.\n  If we do not do it, I want to tell you what will be the outcome, and \nit is without question. You will remember, Mr. President, when we got \ninto trouble in housing it was because we directed Freddie and Fannie \nto buy affordable housing loans, which became a consumer of subprime \npackages that were generated on Wall Street. Subprime packages were \nloans that had high coupon rates, and they were made to risky \nborrowers. They were intended to get more people into housing, but they \nbecame an abused process.\n  Because we directed Freddie and Fannie to buy that type of paper, it \ncreated a demand for that type of paper, which Wall Street fulfilled. \nSo, in other words, you had a premium pricing on the coupon, which made \nthe security attractive, but the risk was greater because the loans \nwere to people with less good credit.\n  We have now gone the other way. The pendulum has swung 180 degrees \nthe other way. With the pending rule being circulated, upon which this \ncommentary time has been extended, if it goes into place, you will \ncreate 90 and 95 percent loans being priced just like loans that were \nsubprimer priced because very few people will make those loans--only a \nfew large lenders. They will price the interest rate on those loans \nhigh because of scarcity. In other words, a borrower borrowing 95 \npercent or 90 percent with private mortgage insurance will end up \npaying a premium--a premium in interest rate or discount points--in \norder to get that loan because there will not be a wide distribution or \navailability of that type of conventional financing.\n  The unintended consequence of the rule being proposed--which we, \nfortunately, have an extension on comment time--would create another \nability for lenders with the capacity of risk retention to price a loan \nat such a rate that it is too high for the average consumer.\n  The other thing it is going to do is a lot of consumers who cannot \nget a qualified residential mortgage of 90 or 95 percent will be out of \nthe housing market.\n  What is the result of that? The result of that is an extension of \nwhat the most recent figures demonstrated: lower demand, declining \nhousing prices, and a protracting continuance of the worst housing \nrecession in the history of the United States of America.\n  So I come to the floor today, first of all, to say thank you to the \nsix regulators for extending the comment period; second, to urge my \ncolleagues to urge the lending institutions, the real estate industry, \nthe consumer interest groups, the housing advocacy groups, to have \ntheir input with these regulators on the proposed qualified residential \nmortgage rule, because if left unamended--as it currently is proposed \nby the regulators--it will make housing less affordable in America; the \naccess to conventional credit less available in America; it will \ndecline the demand that exists already, which is historically too low; \nit will protract the continuing decline of housing values in America; \nand it will cause our economy to continue to slide in an even deeper, \ndeeper depression.\n  It is critically important what the Senator from Kansas said be \nrecognized: Be sure when you pass a regulation that the unintended \nconsequence does not cause a bigger problem than the problem you are \ntrying to correct.\n  I admire our regulators. I appreciate the hard job we have given \nthem. I appreciate the fact they have extended the comment time. I hope \nnow they will also listen to the comments being made, come back, and \nmake a qualified residential mortgage rule that includes the provision \nfor private mortgage insurance on loans in excess of 80 percent and no \nmore than 95 percent.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/07/senate-section/article/S3569-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3569]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
