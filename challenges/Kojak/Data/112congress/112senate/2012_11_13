The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                          Welcome to Everyone\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, after our election, I welcome everyone back. \nFor some it was a nice break. For others it was a lot of hard work. We \nwelcome everyone back and look forward to a very productive next 6 \nweeks.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senate is considering the motion to \nproceed to S. 3525, the Sportsmen's Act, postcloture. At 5:30 p.m., \nthere will be a rollcall vote on the motion to proceed to the \nlegislation.\n\n\n                        Facing Great Challenges\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, for the last year, the country has been \nfocused on the difference between Republicans and Democrats. And for \nthe last 2 years, this Congress has not accomplished nearly enough. But \nas we close the 112th Congress, it is time to focus on our shared goals \nand our common purpose.\n  We all agree, I hope, that today--now--great challenges face our \ncountry and this Congress. Those challenges are large--too large to be \nsolved by Democrats alone. They are too large to be undertaken by \nRepublicans alone. And they are too grave for us to allow political \ndifferences to stand in the way of success.\n  On the day Gerald Ford became President of the United States, at a \ntime of great national turmoil, he said:\n\n       There is no way we can go forward except together and no \n     way anybody can win except by serving the people's urgent \n     needs. We cannot stand still or slip backwards. We must go \n     forward now together.\n\n  So said Gerald Ford.\n  Mr. President, that is as true today as it was back then. Today the \nAmerican people have many urgent needs. They need more jobs. They need \neconomic certainty. They need opportunity and fairness.\n  It is within our power as a Congress to quickly address these urgent \nneeds.\n  It is within our power to forge an agreement that will give economic \ncertainty now to middle-class families who can least afford a tax hike.\n  It is within our power to forge an agreement that will ask the \nrichest of the rich--the most fortunate among us--to pay a little extra \nto reduce the deficit and secure our economic future.\n  It is within our power to forge an agreement that will protect \nimportant tax deductions for families and businesses still struggling.\n  It is within our power to forge an agreement that will take a \nbalanced approach to reduce spending.\n  In fact, we could avert the fiscal cliff for 98 percent of American \nfamilies and 97 percent of small businesses today. The House must only \nconsider the Senate-passed bill freezing tax rates for those making \nless than $250,000 a year. This Congress is but one vote away from \navoiding the fiscal cliff for middle-class families and small \nbusinesses.\n  As influential conservative Bill Kristol said this week:\n\n       Let's have a serious debate. . . . It won't kill the \n     country if we raise taxes a little bit on millionaires. It \n     really won't.\n\n  So said Bill Kristol.\n  So solutions are in our grasp. We only have to make the choice to \npull together instead of pulling apart.\n  The hands of the Democratic Caucus are reaching toward our Republican \nfriends, our Republican colleagues. I urge the Republicans to join us \nto do the difficult but necessary work that is ahead.\n  If there is a message to take away from this year's election, it is \nthis: Americans are tired of the politics of\n\n[[Page S6716]]\n\ndivision. They are tired of obstruction and distraction. The American \npeople--Democrats and Republicans--want cooperation and conciliation.\n  I urge any of my Republican colleagues who are considering the same \nstrategy of obstruction to turn away from the divisions of the past and \njoin in cooperation, compromise, and consensus.\n\n  Gridlock is not the solution. It is the problem.\n  How this Congress deals with the challenges ahead will be the test of \nour character, both as individuals and as a body politic--the U.S. \nSenate.\n  As the British playwright John Osborne said:\n\n       They spend their time mostly looking forward to the past.\n\n  We cannot look back. We must show the American people we are equal to \nthe challenges we now face. The challenges are here. We know the \nchallenges. We see the challenges. We can feel the challenges.\n  There are many reasons why--as we wind down this 112th Congress and \nembark upon the 113th--we must succeed.\n  But the best illustration of our duty--our obligation--comes from the \nwords of Medal of Honor recipient Daniel Inouye. Senator Inouye's son \nasked his dad why--after people were designated as enemy aliens, after \nbeing put in internment camps--why did he and the members of the famed \n442nd Regimental Combat Team fight heroically the way they did.\n  Asked why he fought, Senator Inouye told his son--many years after \nthe battle had ended and Lieutenant Inouye's wounds had healed--that he \nfought ``for the children.'' Senator Inouye said that he fought for the \nchildren. So I say to my colleagues--Democrats and Republicans--we must \nlegislate, legislate for our children. They deserve it. We owe them the \nfuture.\n  It is time for Democrats and Republicans to go forward now together--\n``go forward now together,'' as Gerald Ford said--and show the American \npeople that we are equal to the challenges we face. The challenges are \nthere. We must face them and face them together.\n\n\n                   Recognition Of The Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                             The Elections\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to begin by welcoming all the \nnew Members who are here today, Republican and Democrat. \nCongratulations on your victories, and welcome to the Senate. I assure \nyou, it is not as terrible a job as some say it is. We welcome your \nideas, your energy, and your enthusiasm, and we wish you every success \nin your time here.\n  I also want to congratulate the President and the Vice President on \ntheir hard-fought victory last week. And I wish to say a brief word of \nthanks to our own nominees as well, Governor Romney and Congressman \nRyan. They may not have won the race, but they earned our respect and \nadmiration in the effort. They fought valiantly--valiantly--for the \ncause of limited government, free enterprise, opportunity for all, and \na stronger social safety net that is there when people need it most.\n  In short, they fought for the kind of constitutional conservatism so \nmany Americans believe in so very strongly. And their loss does nothing \nto diminish the importance of these enduring principles or our \ncommitment to keep fighting for them. So we thank them, and we thank \ntheir families, for making the sacrifices any Presidential campaign \ndemands. And I want to assure everyone: The cause goes on.\n  Now onto the task at hand.\n\n\n                       Avoiding The Fiscal Cliff\n\n  In politics there is always a temptation among those who win office \nto think they have a mandate to do what they will. But it is important \nto remember that in this case the voters also reelected a Republican-\ncontrolled House last week and a closely divided Senate. And in a \ngovernment of three equal branches, that is hardly irrelevant.\n  Most people may focus on the White House, but the fact is the \ngovernment is organized no differently today than it was after the \nRepublican wave of 2010.\n  Look out across the heartland and you will see vast regions of the \ncountry wary of the President's vision for the future. The country is \nsharply divided about the right path forward. If the President wants to \nunite America, as he has always claimed to, if he truly realizes that \nhe was elected to represent all of its citizens, not just the ones who \nvoted to give him a second term last Tuesday, then he will seek the \ncommon ground that he largely avoided so strenuously in his first term. \nThat is his task. That is the duty that comes with being President.\n  I hope that in this term he rises to the challenge. It starts by \nrealizing that he is the only man in America who can sign a piece of \nlegislation into law--the only one of the 306 million Americans--and \nthat while voters have given him a second term, they have also given \nthose of us in Congress the power and the duty to ensure that he uses \nthat power wisely. And that is, of course, what we intend to do.\n  The campaign is over. The time for slogans and pep rallies is past. \nIf the President is serious about solving current crises and avoiding \nfuture ones, he has to step up and to lead.\n  So let me be clear: When it comes to the great economic challenges of \nthe moment, saying that you want a balanced approach is not a plan. \nSaying people need to pay their fair share is not a plan. The tedious \nrepetition of poll-tested talking points is simply that. The longer the \nPresident uses them as a substitute for leadership, the more difficult \nit will be to solve our many problems.\n  The time for the President to lead is now, and that means offering a \nconcrete plan that takes into account the fact that half the Congress \nopposes tax hikes--not because we are selfish, not because we are \nstubborn, but we know it is the wrong thing to do, we know it will hurt \nthe economy, and we know it will destroy jobs. This is not partisan \npolitics. It is economics. As the President might say, it is math.\n  According to a recent independent, nonpartisan study, raising tax \nrates on top earners, as the President has proposed, would destroy over \n700,000 jobs. It would slow the economy, meaning less revenue would \ncome into the Treasury. As a result, it would not do much to reduce the \ndeficit, even if Democrats actually followed through and used it for \nthat purpose.\n  Think about it: The amount of revenue for which they are prepared to \npush us over the fiscal cliff would not fund the government for a week. \nLet me say that again. The amount of revenue for which they are \nprepared to push us over the cliff would not fund the government for 1 \nweek.\n  So why in the world would we want to do that? What is the point? To \nmake people feel good about whacking somebody else? That is not what we \nwere sent here to do.\n  That is certainly not what the people of Kentucky sent me here to do. \nThat is not how you set economic policy--because it makes you feel \ngood. You set economic policy because you think it will lead to \ninvestment in America, create jobs, and give more people an opportunity \nto lift themselves up, boosting middle-class incomes now and ensuring \nsecurity for the future. This is the kind of vision Speaker Boehner \nlaid out for the country last week. I cannot think of any good reason \nthe President would not embrace it.\n  Some on the other side have said we should just go off the cliff--\njust go off the cliff--and hope for the best. I do not think that is \nwhat the American people had in mind when they went to the polls last \nweek. I think what they had in mind was that we put the contest of the \npast 2 years behind us and work it out.\n  The best way forward and the way that will lead to jobs and growth, a \nsmaller deficit, and fewer political fights is to keep everybody's tax \nrates right where they are for now, to figure out a way to avoid the \nautomatic defense cuts scheduled to hit at the end of the year without \ncutting a penny less than we promised and committing to the kind of \ncomprehensive tax and entitlement reform that we all claim we want.\n  A simpler Tax Code that lowers rates and clears out certain \ndeductions and special interest loopholes would trigger economic \ngrowth, create jobs, and result in more revenue without raising \nanyone's rates. We know this because we have seen it before. It \nactually works.\n  Personally, I do not think Washington should get any of that extra\n\n[[Page S6717]]\n\nrevenue. I do not think we need it. As I have said many times before: \nWashington's problem is not that it taxes too little but that it spends \ntoo much. But in a good-faith effort to make progress on boosting the \neconomy and government's long-term solvency, Republicans like me have \nsaid for more than a year now that we are open to new revenue in \nexchange for meaningful reforms to the entitlement programs that are \nthe primary drivers of our debt, so that we can reduce the deficit, \nprotect these programs for today's seniors, and strengthen them for \nfuture generations.\n  So new revenue must be tied to genuine entitlement changes that \nstrengthen these programs for the future and preserve them and also \naddress our long-term debt and deficit problems. In other words, we \nwould do it if we thought we could make progress in creating more \nmiddle-class jobs and address what is by far the single biggest \nobstacle to fiscal balance. This is the basic outline of a plan, and it \nreflects our seriousness as a party.\n  So make no mistake, Republicans are offering bipartisan solutions. \nNow it is the President's turn. It is his turn to demonstrate similar \nseriousness, bring his party to the table, and take the lead. We are \nready to find common ground, ready to find common ground on revenue--\nnot as I said because any of us actually thinks the government needs \nany more of it, but because Democrats, from the President on down, have \nsaid they are willing to punish everyone if they do not get it. We are \nnot about to let that happen, but we are also not about to further \nweaken the economy by raising tax rates and hurting jobs.\n  Look, this should not be that difficult. Recent history gives us two \nexamples of Presidents who solved big problems by finding common ground \nwith the other side. Ronald Reagan did it with a Democratic-led House \nafter a far more resounding second-term victory than President Obama's, \nas did Bill Clinton with a Republican-controlled House and a \nRepublican-controlled Senate after a more resounding second-term \nvictory than President Obama's. Both examples, both of them, illustrate \nthe rare opportunity that divided government presents.\n  President Obama can follow suit or he can take the extremist view \nthat both Reagan and Clinton rejected by thumbing his nose at the other \nside and insisting that if Republicans are not willing to do things his \nway, he will not do anything at all. If the President is serious, he \nwill follow the lead of Presidents Reagan and Clinton. If he is really \nserious, he will put the campaign rhetoric aside, propose a realistic \nsolution that can pass a Republican-controlled House and a divided \nSenate, and work to get it done. And if the President acts in this \nspirit, I have no doubt he will have the support of his own party and a \nwilling partner in ours.\n  The American people will breathe a sigh of relief knowing not only \nthat we have avoided a crisis but Washington can still serve their \ninterests. Unless we act in a few short weeks, Americans will face a \ncombination of defense cuts and automatic tax hikes that threaten to \nplunge us into another recession and undermine at the same time our \nnational defense. This looming crisis is made worse by the backdrop of \na massive Federal debt that we will never be able to tackle as long as \nDemocrats refuse even the smallest of reforms to strengthen and protect \nthe entitlement programs that are driving that debt.\n  That is why Republicans have remained firm on this point: Any serious \nsolution, any serious solution, must include real spending cuts and \nmeaningful entitlement reforms to strengthen and protect these programs \nfor future generations. We got into this mess because we promised cuts \nthat never materialized and because we could not muster the will to \nmatch entitlements with the changing demographics of our country.\n  We are not going to get out of it until we agree to do both, and \nagree to do it together. Republicans have reached out, made offers \nbeyond our preferred approach in an effort to attract bipartisan \nsolutions. Meanwhile, all we get from Democrats is letters saying they \nwill not even consider reforming the very programs that lie at the \nheart, the very heart of our fiscal imbalance.\n  Instead of showing faith and a willingness to solve the problem, we \nget the same tired talking points that we cannot cut our way to \nprosperity. Well, that may poll well, but it is not a plan. It is a \ncliche that is meant to shut down debate and prevent a serious proposal \nfrom ever taking shape.\n  So how do we get around the stalemate? That is simple. Presidential \nleadership. Let me repeat. There is only one person in America out of \n360 million Americans who can sign something into law and, even more \nimportantly, deliver the members of his party to support a deal that he \nmakes.\n  We will arrive at a plan when the President presents one or we will \nnot get anywhere at all. That is how we get out of a jam. That is what \nthe moment requires. It is the President's move. There is no way we can \navert these job-killing tax hikes before they strike and replace the \ndefense portion of the so-called sequester with cuts of equal size in \nareas that both sides have already agreed to during last summer's debt \nlimit negotiations. We can do all of it in the weeks ahead with a \npromise to do even bigger things next year.\n  That is exactly what we should do. This is one of those moments where \nthe only thing standing between success and failure is Presidential \nleadership. That is why we are calling on the President to seize the \nmoment--seize the moment and do something he has not done before but \nwhich successful predecessors have so often done before.\n  We are calling on him to lead, to take the initiative, propose a plan \nthat is actually designed to succeed. If he does, I am confident he \nwill find he has more Republican friends over here than he thought. I \nam not asking the President to agree with us on the proper role of \ngovernment or the dangers of a creeping regulatory state. I am not \nasking him to adopt our principles. I am simply asking him to respect \nour principles by not insisting that we compromise them because I \nassure you we will not. But we will be happy to work with him on a plan \nto avert the coming crisis and lay the groundwork for further success \ndown the road.\n  Let's put the campaign behind us and get the job done.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nleadership time is reserved.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                            Election Results\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today is November 13. I think what strikes \nme about this date is it has only been 7 days since the election. It \nseems like a lot longer. Maybe it is because the election campaign \nitself felt so long. But it has been 7 days since the American people \nwent out and voted.\n  I have to say this: It was not just because of the victory of the \nPresident which was important to many of us, but it was quite a \nvalidation of this country and this democracy that millions of \nAmericans made the personal sacrifice, took the time, and went to the \npolling places and actually cast a vote. When it was all over, thank \nthe Lord, it was decisive. The President won a majority of the popular \nvote as well as a strong majority of electoral votes. The outcome was \nnot in suspense or in doubt when it was all over. That was good for the \nprocess, it was good for our country, and, quite frankly, it is time \nfor us to move forward.\n  During the course of the campaign, I was actively working in my State \nof Illinois, around the Midwest, on behalf of the President. I was at \none of these spin rooms, which is kind of hard to describe. You will \nnot find it in the Constitution. It is hard to describe. After the \ndebates there was this scrum of politicians and spokesmen who stood \ntogether under little signs with their names on them waiting for the \npress to come up to them and say: What did you see? What do you think?\n  I was in one of those. I can't remember where it was. I think it \nmight have been New York at Hofstra after one of the Presidential \ndebates. One of the reporters said to me: So, Mr. Durbin, I know you \nare here supporting President Obama. What are you going to do\n\n[[Page S6718]]\n\nif Governor Romney wins and becomes President?\n  I said: Well, I am going to respect him, do everything I can to work \nwith him to solve the problems of this country.\n  Do you know what he said? He said: I am going to hold you to that. \nWell, he should. That is the responsibility we all have regardless of \nparty, to work with the President to solve our Nation's problems.\n  Now, there were some who said 4 years ago that when they viewed the \nnew President, President Obama, their goal was to make sure, above all, \nthat he was a one-term President. That was an unfortunate statement \nbecause it suggested that solving problems and dealing with our \nchallenges was secondary to a political victory. I hope that in the \nsecond term the President can turn to both sides of the aisle in \nCongress and find support for solving our Nation's problems. They are \nmany.\n  The first one is this fiscal cliff which Americans are hearing more \nand more about. On December 31 of this year laws will expire and things \nare going to happen. What will happen is taxes will go up across the \nboard, not just on the wealthy but on everyone. There will be cutbacks \nin unemployment compensation, cutbacks in the payroll tax, 2-percent \ncuts. There will be a lot of different changes that affect a lot of \npeople. We are going to see automatic cuts in spending, sequestration \nas we call it, both on the defense side and nondefense side.\n  Many people have said: Well, who dreamed this up? And the honest \nanswer is all of us in Congress, Democrats and Republicans, together \nwith the President created this so-called fiscal cliff, and we voted \nfor it. The Republican leader of the Senate was here a few minutes ago. \nHe voted in favor of it. I did too.\n  The idea was to have a December 31 deadline that was so imposing and \nso threatening that we would do something to avoid it. We created a \nsupercommittee to reduce the deficit, with equal numbers of Democrats \nand Republicans, and said: Find a way out of this deficit mess so we \ncan avoid this cliff.\n  They could not. They were unable to reach an agreement. So now this \nDecember 31 deadline is looming. It is one that ought to sharpen our \nsenses and our attention on solving the problems that face this \ncountry. They are substantial.\n  First, we need to get out of this recession. We are moving forward \nbut slowly. We need to make sure that whatever we do in Congress it \nmoves us in the direction of creating more jobs and strengthening \nbusiness and making us more competitive in the 21st-century economy.\n  But secondly, as important, we need to deal with the deficit, a \ndeficit which requires us to borrow 40 cents for every dollar we spend \nin Washington. That is unsustainable. I say that as a Democrat. \nRepublicans say it as well. We have got to balance the two, keep the \neconomy moving forward and yet make a serious commitment to deficit \nreduction.\n  I was on the Bowles-Simpson Presidential commission which President \nObama created. There were 18 of us. Eleven of us voted for the \ncommission report, a bipartisan report, and I still believe that it \ncontains the basic ingredients for finding our way through this \nchallenge. I hope we could have support from the other side of the \naisle.\n  I listened carefully to the speech just given by the Senator from \nKentucky, and he said repeatedly that the election is behind us, we \nneed to work together. That is exactly the right thing to say. It means \nwe have to ask the Republican side that they join us in finding \nrevenue. We know we need more in tax revenue to deal with this deficit. \nThe President has proposed that those making over $250,000 a year pay a \nlittle more. I don't think that is unreasonable. Those who have been \nblessed with success and comfort in life and doubly blessed by being \npart of this great Nation should be wanting to pay back a little to \nhelp us get through this economic challenge, and I think they will. I \ngenuinely think they will. I also believe those who are in the middle-\nincome categories, working families, need to be spared a tax increase. \nMany of them are struggling paycheck to paycheck. It isn't an easy \neconomy in which to raise a child, put a child through college or keep \nyour home or make plans for the future. We need to give those working \nfamilies a helping hand to make sure they don't face a tax rise.\n  The President said the other day that we have a bill pending before \nthe House that would spare those families making $250,000 or less a \nyear from seeing a tax increase, and he asked the House to pass it. I \nhope they will. That means we can focus on taxes only for those in \nhigher income categories. The Senator from Kentucky said, well, it \ndoesn't raise that much money. I beg to differ. If we impose a tax on \nthose making over $250,000 a year, and if we go back pre-Bush tax cuts, \nit raises $800 billion over 10 years. That is not insubstantial. It is \nan important sum that we need to have to move toward a budget that is \ncloser to being in balance. We have to include it. We need to look at \nentitlement programs in an honest fashion. We need to make sure that at \nthe end of the day the Social Security system is there for generations \nto come, and Medicare, which is so important to 40 or 50 million \nAmericans, will be there for many years to come as well. That is part \nof our responsibility.\n  I welcome the statement by the Senator from Kentucky. I take him at \nhis word that he is willing to work with the President. He has called \non the President to lead, and that is only right; the President is the \nleader of our Nation.\n  I might also add that we need leadership in Congress as well, \nDemocrats and Republicans willing to sit down at a table and reasonably \nwork out our differences. It is not easy, but we can do it and we \nshould do it.\n\n\n                           Veterans Day 2012\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we have heard a lot about the wealthiest 1 \npercent of Americans, and on this session after Veterans Day I wish to \ntalk about another 1 percent, the 1 percent who have volunteered to \ndefend us. I want to say a few words about veterans in earlier wars. \nThirty years ago, thousands of veterans of the Vietnam war came home. \nThey gave themselves a homecoming parade that they deserved but almost \nnone had ever received. The Presiding Officer here from Virginia, I \nknow as a Senator and as an ace Vietnam veteran, knows of what I speak.\n  With wounded veterans in wheelchairs leading the parade, they marched \nup Constitution Avenue to dedicate the National Vietnam Veterans \nMemorial, on whose polished granite walls were etched the names of \nnearly 58,000 dead and missing comrades-in-arms.\n  Here is a photograph that was taken that day. This is Joseph Ambrose \nof Joliet, IL. Mr. Ambrose was 86 years old then. He is wearing the \nsame uniform he wore as a 19-year-old U.S. Army private in France in \nWorld War I. In his arms he carries a flag, the flag that covered the \ncoffin of his son who gave his life for our country in Korea.\n  Joseph Ambrose wore his old Army ``doughboy'' uniform and carried his \nson's flag often to Veterans Day parades and VFW conventions. He \nconfessed that some years he had to go on a crash diet to get back into \nthe uniform, but he did it to honor the veterans of Vietnam and Korean \nwars that he believed Americans needed to remember, and he wanted to \nremind us of an important truth, that no matter the outcome of the war, \nthose who answer the call of duty and risk everything to defend our \ncountry deserve the respect of a grateful nation.\n  In the 30 years since its dedication, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial \nhas become an almost sacred place of remembering, reconciliation, and \nhealing. It has a special impact on visitors. I was one. As you walk \ndown that incline and this polished granite monument starts to loom \nhigher and higher, and the names grow until you are engulfed by them, \nyou have a feeling of the immensity of sacrifice that was involved in \nthat war.\n  This past weekend in Chicago and Quincy, IL, big cities and small \nalike across America communities held Veterans Day parades. Volunteers \nassembled and sent thank-you packages to the troops serving overseas. I \nwas at Union Station in Chicago yesterday. Fifth Third Bank sponsored \nthe sending of these packages to those who are currently serving. It is \nall good and it is important, but it is only a fraction of what we owe \nto veterans.\n  Mr. President, I want to give special thanks to you and a special \nshout-out\n\n[[Page S6719]]\n\nfor what you have accomplished in your service in the Senate. I \nremember the first time we ever sat down and had any serious \nconversation about your service in the Senate for the State of \nVirginia, and you told me your No. 1 priority was a new GI bill. You \nwere brandnew to this place, but you sure knew that subject inside and \nout. I respected you so much for it and respect you even more for \nsticking with it. Your determination led to the creation of a new GI \nbill. Thousands--thousands--of veterans are going to have better lives \nand their families as well because you were determined to make it \nhappen.\n  I know you are retiring and nearing the end of your term here in the \nSenate, but it is a lasting contribution to this country, and I am glad \nthat since it was at the top of your list when you arrived that you got \nit done. Some Senators spend a lifetime around here and never get No. 1 \non the list accomplished, but you did it, and I thank you very much for \nyour leadership in that regard.\n  It was 2\\1/2\\ years ago that we also created the family caregivers \nact to help veterans who survived catastrophic and disabling injuries \nin Iraq and Afghanistan and the family members who sacrificed so much \nto help them. I introduced this bill after Senator Hillary Clinton \nmoved on to the State Department 4 years ago. I thought it was a good \nidea and it was recommended to me by the family of wounded veteran Eric \nEdmundson. His mom and dad and sister came to me, and we talked about \nthe caregivers act. Traumatic brain injuries, as we know, are one of \nthe signature casualties of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\n  In 2005, Eric Edmundson was a 26-year-old Army sergeant. He survived \na roadside blast but then went into cardiac arrest while awaiting \ntransport to a military hospital. His brain was deprived of oxygen for \nalmost 30 minutes. Doctors told his parents that Eric would spend the \nrest of his life in a vegetative state, and they should choose a \nnursing home for their 26-year-old son. But Eric's mom and dad said, \nno, we are not giving up on this young man. They fought for Eric to be \ntransferred to the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, one of the \nbest--in fact, the same hospital that my colleague Senator Mark Kirk \nhas been returning to time and time again for rehabilitation from his \nstroke.\n  I visited Eric at that hospital several times. He worked so hard to \nheal and to make progress and his family was with him every day. I will \nnever forget the time I visited Eric in his hospital room in Chicago \nand his mom said, Eric has a gift for you. I thought, wait a minute, \nEric is giving me a gift, at which point his mom and dad walked over on \neach side of his wheelchair, grabbed one of his elbows each, lifted him \nup, and Eric took three steps. It was amazing. There wasn't a dry eye \nin that hospital room, tears of joy that this young man finally could \ntake a few steps.\n  His dad said at that time, In about a month Eric is going to walk out \nof the front door of this hospital. Can you be there? Of course I was. \nIt was a proud day not only for Eric and his family but for all of us \nto see the dramatic progress he made.\n  Today Eric lives in North Carolina with his wife and two young \nchildren. His mom and dad are there by his side every day. They have \nmoved in today to be full-time caregivers for their son, and the family \ncaregivers act helps their family and so many others make sure that \nEric is home with his family where he wants to be, receiving the kind \nof care he deserves for service to our country. So far more than 130 \nfamilies in Illinois and more than 5,000 nationwide are part of the \ncaregivers program. I am proud of that program. I thank Senator Clinton \nfor a great idea. I thank Senator Danny Akaka, who was chairman of the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee when it passed as part of larger \nlegislation.\n  Posttraumatic stress syndrome is another signature wound of these \nwars that we recently engaged in. These wounds aren't visible, but they \nare wounds to the spirit. They can be just as debilitating and deadly \nas a visible wound. We know that active-duty servicemembers are taking \ntheir own lives at alarming rates, and the suicide rate among veterans \nis even higher. The VA estimates that 18 veterans a day take their own \nlives. The VA has made heroic efforts to keep up with the surge of \nmental health needs in Iraq and Afghanistan veterans. Yet despite those \nefforts only a fraction of veterans with PTSD are receiving timely, \neffective care.\n  President Obama recently issued an Executive order to improve mental \nhealth care for servicemembers and veterans. The order will expand by \n50 percent the capacity of the VA on their crisis line to make sure \nthat any veteran facing a crisis can get professional help within 24 \nhours.\n  There is a bill pending in the Senate that would do even more. The \nMental Health ACCESS Act introduced by Senator Patty Murray, who has \nbeen an amazing champion of veterans--she is the daughter of a severely \nwounded veteran, and a fierce champion for veterans and their \nfamilies--the Mental Health ACCESS Act, which I am proud to cosponsor, \nwould make comprehensive improvements in VA suicide prevention \ncounseling and mental health staffing. It would also expand eligibility \nfor a variety of VA health and mental health services to family \nmembers, which are so important. We also need to step forward as well \nand make sure that we go beyond welcoming home parades for veterans and \nfind them a job. Parades are just fine, but if you really want to \nsupport a veteran, hire that veteran. Give that veteran a job. \nAmerica's military today is the best trained, best educated in the \nhistory of the world. They have done an enormously good job for our \ncountry, and they can do the same for businesses across America.\n  I hope the bipartisan plan which we are working on with Senator Bill \nNelson of Florida to pass will be enacted soon and become part of the \nlaw of the land to help these veterans. The President is prepared to \nsign it, and the sooner we do it the better.\n  Let me salute some of the veterans in the Senate who are here: \nSenator Frank Lautenberg, who served in World War II; Senator Danny \nInouye, a Medal of Honor recipient from World War II; Senator John \nMcCain, Senator Tom Carper, Senator Kerry, and the Presiding Officer, \nSenator Jim Webb, both of whom served with honor in Vietnam, as well as \nSenator Lindsey Graham, who continues to serve as a colonel in the Air \nForce Reserve; and my colleague Senator Mark Kirk, who is a commander \nin the Navy Reserve. And not to leave out Senators Akaka, Bingaman, \nBlumenthal, Scott Brown, Carper, Coats, Cochran, Enzi, Harkin, Inhofe, \nIsakson, Tim Johnson, Kohl, Lugar, Bill Nelson, Reed, Roberts, \nSessions, and Wicker.\n  The elections earlier this month saw at least 9 new veterans of Iraq \nand Afghanistan elected to Congress, bringing the total of new veterans \nin the next Congress to at least 16. They are still counting the \nballots in some States.\n  The people of Illinois are proud that 3 of those 16 veterans are from \nour State: Congressman Adam Kinzinger, an Air Force veteran of Iraq and \nAfghanistan, and two exceptional leaders who will join the next \nCongress, Bill Enyart, a new Congressman from downstate Illinois, a \nveteran of Vietnam and former adjutant general of the Illinois National \nGuard. Then, of course, my friend, my ``sheroe,'' Tammy Duckworth. She \nis the daughter of a Vietnam vet and one of the first women to ever fly \na combat mission in Iraq. She was copiloting a Black Hawk helicopter \nwhen an RPG struck her helicopter. She lost both her legs and the use \nof her right arm. She has worked in both State and Federal Government \non behalf of veterans. What a proud day it will be for America when \nTammy stands to take the oath of office in just a few weeks as the \nnewest member of the U.S. House of Representatives.\n  I want to say a word about my first boss in the Senate, another \nveteran by the name of Paul Douglas, a man who at the age of 50 \nenlisted in the Marine Corps in 1942, went through Parris Island \ntraining, talked himself into combat, where he was wounded at Peliliu \nand then more seriously wounded at Okinawa and lost the use of his left \narm. He was an extraordinary man who refused to take his veterans' \ndisability pay. He sent his checks back to the government every single \nmonth. He joked that you could do the work of a Senator with one arm \ntied behind your back, so it wasn't really fair for him to\n\n[[Page S6720]]\n\ntake disability pay for too long. In too many issues we in the Senate \nhave tied our own hands with excessive rancor and bipartisanship.\n  I hope in this lameduck session and beyond, that at least on the \nissue of helping our veterans, we can come together on a bipartisan \nbasis.\n\n\n                           Immigration Reform\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it was 101 years ago when my grandmother \ncame to this country with three small children and landed in Baltimore \nfrom Lithuania, and came down the steps into America for the first \ntime. The year was 1911. I don't know how my grandmother managed to \nnavigate her way to East Saint Louis, IL, to meet my grandfather with \nthose three little kids and not speaking a word of English, but she \ndid. So it is with some pride that I have displayed in my office right \nbehind my desk my mother's naturalization certificate when she became a \ncitizen of the United States.\n  I think the fact that her son became a U.S. Senator tells a great \nstory about our Nation and the opportunity that is available.\n  I have always had a soft spot in my heart for immigrants because I am \nthe proud son of an immigrant who came to this country and worked her \nway into citizenship and raised a good family. Our story is not unique. \nIt is, in fact, the American story. And this election has really \nbrought to the attention of many the need for us to deal with \nimmigration reform. There are more than 10 million Americans out there \nwho are undocumented, uncertain of their future. Some people mistakenly \nbelieve they live in homes full of undocumented people. In most cases, \nwe find that four out of the five in a family are legally here in \nAmerica and the fifth--maybe even mom--is undocumented. So it is a \nchallenge for us to deal with these folks who have been here for so \nlong in a fair and honest way. We can't turn our backs on them.\n  One can go into a restaurant or hotel in Chicago and by and large \nfind many of these individuals working to clean the rooms and clear the \ntables. A family who has someone in a nursing home probably has an \nundocumented worker who is making sure their mother or father or \nsomeone they love has the basics they need every single day. So we need \na realistic and reasonable approach to address the millions of \nundocumented immigrants living in America today.\n  In this year's election, the Republican Presidential nominee \nadvocated what he called ``self-deportation.'' It doesn't make any \nsense. It would be wrong to force millions of hard-working immigrants \nwho are contributing to our country to leave. Instead, we need a better \nsolution--a path to citizenship for immigrants who will earn their way \ninto that status by working hard, paying their taxes, learning English, \nand being a part of America's future. The American people agree. \nAccording to exit polls from last week's election, 65 percent of \nAmericans--64 percent of Independents, 51 percent of Republicans--said \nthat most undocumented immigrants working in the United States should \nbe given a chance to apply for legal status, and 29 percent disagreed.\n  In my time in the Senate, I have had the opportunity to be involved \nin several bipartisan efforts to pass immigration reform. On the \nDemocratic side, the late Senator Ted Kennedy was our leader, and \nSenator John McCain took the lead on the Republican side. President \nBarack Obama, then a Senator, was part of that effort. Unfortunately, \nwe haven't moved forward since those days.\n  There is one part of immigration reform that is very important to me \npersonally. It is known as the DREAM Act. Eleven years ago I introduced \nthis legislation for the first time. It would allow a select group of \nimmigrant students with great potential to contribute to this country. \nThe DREAM Act would give these students a chance to earn their way to \ncitizenship if they came to the United States as children, have good \nmoral character, graduate from high school, and complete at least 2 \nyears of college or serve in our military. Now, these young people grew \nup in America, and they have overcome great obstacles. They went to \nschool with many of our own kids, and they are valedictorians, star \nathletes, and leaders in the ROTC. They are our future doctors, \nengineers, and teachers who will make America stronger. Why would we \nwant to educate them and then lose their talents for the future of our \ncountry?\n  Last month a new report from the Center for American Progress and the \nbipartisan Partnership for a New American Economy concluded that \npassage of the DREAM Act would add $329 billion to our economy and \ncreate 1.4 million new jobs by 2030. In my home State of Illinois, by \n2030 the DREAM Act would contribute $14 billion to the economy and \nDREAMers would create up to 58,000 new jobs, generating $461 million in \ntax revenue.\n  The young people who would be eligible for the DREAM Act call \nthemselves DREAMers. Like the civil rights activists of past \ngenerations, they speak out. Now they are telling us their stories. I \nhave been coming to the floor almost every week in the Senate to tell \nthe story of another DREAM Act student. It is the best way for people \nto understand who they are.\n  I want to talk about Carlos Martinez today. Carlos and his brother \nwere brought to the United States in 1991 when Carlos was 9 years old. \nWhen Carlos came to this country, he didn't speak a word of English. \nHis father told him, ``Estudien para que no batallen en la vida como \nyo.'' Translated, it means, ``Study, so you don't struggle in life like \nI have.'' That was the advice he received from his dad, and Carlos took \nit to heart. At Cholla High School in Tucson, AZ, Carlos graduated \nninth in his class. He enrolled at the University of Arizona. He had \nnever owned a computer before he went to school, but he loved math and \ndreamed of being a computer engineer. Four years later, in 2003, Carlos \ngraduated with a bachelor of science degree in computer engineering, \nwith minors in computer science, electrical engineering, mathematics, \nand Spanish. He was named the top Hispanic graduate in his class at the \nUniversity of Arizona.\n  After Carlos graduated, reality set in. He received job offers from \nIntel, IBM, and a lot of top tech companies, but he couldn't work for \nthem because he is undocumented. But Carlos didn't give up. He enrolled \nin a master's program for software systems engineering at the \nUniversity of Arizona. He completed the 2\\1/2\\-year program in just a \nyear and a half. He was nominated for the University of Arizona \nGraduate School Centennial Award, given to the school's top graduate \nstudent.\n  This is a hopeful time for DREAMers like Carlos. The Obama \nadministration has granted temporary legal status to young people who \nwould be eligible for the DREAM Act. The status--known as deferred \naction for childhood arrivals--will allow DREAMers to live and work \nlegally in America, and they can renew it every 2 years. This will give \nthese young immigrants the chance to come out of the shadows and be \npart of the only country they have ever really known. It is a historic \nmoment in the long struggle for equal justice in America.\n  The administration's new deportation policy will make America \nstronger by giving the DREAMers a chance to be part of it. Carlos \nMartinez submitted his application on August 15, the very first day \nforms were available, and he was one of the first to receive deferred \naction for childhood arrivals. Thanks to President Obama's new policy, \nCarlos will finally be able to use his bachelor's and master's degree \nin computer engineering. He had to wait 7 years after receiving his \nmaster's degree, but the day has finally come when he will get his \nchance.\n  As soon as he received the notification, Carlos went to a career fair \nat his alma mater and handed out resumes to IBM, Intel, and the other \ntech companies that had tried to hire him years earlier. In a letter he \nwrote to me, Carlos said:\n\n       It was the best news of my life. Finally I would be able to \n     work as a software engineer or own a business and create \n     jobs.\n\n  According to recent polls, the American people clearly support the \nnew DREAM Act policy. For example, a Bloomberg poll found that 64 \npercent of likely voters--including 66 percent of Independents--support \nthe policy, compared to only 30 percent who oppose it. The American \npeople understand it makes no sense to deport these talented young \npeople. They grew up in America, and they can make us a better nation.\n  As America learns more about the DREAMers in our midst, such as \nCarlos\n\n[[Page S6721]]\n\nMartinez, who are ready to contribute their talents to getting our \neconomy back on track, support will build for passing the DREAM Act and \ncomprehensive immigration reform. President Obama has given temporary \nprotection to DREAMers. Now let's pass the law. Let's do the right \nthing for people just like Carlos all over the United States.\n  Mr. President, I have listened carefully to some of the statements \nmade after the elections by those on the other side of the aisle, many \nof whom have opposed the DREAM Act from the start, and I have been \nheartened and encouraged that so many are now speaking out in favorable \nterms about doing something finally for young people like Carlos. Let's \nget this done. This used to be a very bipartisan measure, but \nfilibusters have stopped it year after year. We can pass it, and we \nshould pass it. In 2007, the first time the DREAM Act came to a vote on \nthe floor of the Senate, 52 Senators--a bipartisan majority--voted for \nit, but still the Republican filibuster stopped us. We didn't get the \n60 votes we needed. Three years later, in December of 2010, the DREAM \nAct was again considered on the floor of the Senate. The gallery was \nfilled with DREAMers in their caps and gowns. It was an inspiring sight \nto look up and see them in those seats. That day 55 Senators voted for \nthe DREAM Act. It was a majority but not enough; we needed 60 to \novercome another Republican filibuster. The President and the vast \nmajority of Democrats continue to support the DREAM Act and \ncomprehensive immigration reform.\n  Let me add that the DREAM Act is very important to me, but equally if \nnot more important is comprehensive immigration reform to help not only \nCarlos but many like him--their parents and members of their family--\nwho may not qualify under the DREAM Act but deserve a chance as well.\n  I believe most of my Republican colleagues understand that \nimmigration is good for America. Immigration is America. We are all \nimmigrants but for the Native Americans who welcomed to the shores the \noccupants of the Mayflower. Former President George W. Bush led the \nattempt to reform legislation, and he said, ``Family values don't stop \nat the Rio Grande.'' I disagree with George W. Bush on many things, but \non the issue of immigration, he was genuine and committed, and I agree \nwith what he said. I have been heartened by comments from Speaker \nBoehner and others in the last week. I believe Democrats and \nRepublicans of good will can come together across the aisle, roll up \nour sleeves, and do something good for America and fix our broken \nimmigration system so that it is true to our American values as a \nnation of immigrants.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/13/senate-section/article/S6721-1", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6721]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      VETERANS' COMPENSATION COST-OF-LIVING ADJUSTMENT ACT OF 2012\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                       Honoring Our Armed Forces\n\n                       Sergeant Jason M. Swindle\n\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, at a time when we are seeing reports of \nviolence in areas all around the world, we must never forget that the \nmen and women of the U.S. military are out there fighting on our behalf \nday in and day out so we can live in a safe environment here at home. \nOur servicemembers are well aware of the risks they face as they serve \nthis Nation, and it is our duty to do all we can to honor those who \nfight and pay the ultimate price for our freedoms.\n  Today I am here to pay my respects to SGT Jason M. Swindle, an \nArkansan who, at 24 years of age, laid down his life for our country \nwhile supporting Operation Enduring Freedom. Sergeant Swindle attended \nCabot High School in Cabot, AR, and joined the Army in 2005. He was \nassigned to B Company, 1st Battalion, 64th Regiment, 3rd Infantry \nDivision at Fort Stewart, GA. He was serving his third combat \ndeployment. He was posthumously awarded the Bronze Star and a Purple \nHeart.\n  His family and friends describe him as being a fun-loving guy who was \nvery patriotic and very proud of the work he was doing in the Army.\n  In addition to being a soldier, Sergeant Swindle was also a husband \nand a father. He leaves behind his wife Chelsey, who is currently \nexpecting their second child, and a 1-year-old son, Paxton.\n  Mr. President, it is people such as Jason Swindle who are the true \nAmerican heroes. I ask my colleagues to keep his wife, children, and \nthe rest of his family in their thoughts and prayers during this very \ndifficult time. I humbly offer my sincerest gratitude to Jason for his \nselfless sacrifice in the service and defense of this great Nation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, first I would like to add my condolences \nand sympathy to the family in honor of Sergeant Swindle. I appreciate \nwhat the Senator from Arkansas had to say, and I join all my colleagues \nin recognizing the sacrifice of this soldier and many others who have \nmade such a tremendous sacrifice and have created opportunities for us \nas Americans.\n\n\n                      Global Entrepreneurship Week\n\n  Mr. President, we have just come through a divisive and expensive \ncampaign. Hopefully that divisiveness and that expense is a thing of \nthe past, and I come to the floor today--during Global Entrepreneurship \nWeek--to ask my colleagues to now work together to pursue policies that \nare guaranteed to improve our economy. There have been too many \nopportunities in the past year to pursue issues and policies that \ndivide us. Now we must come together around something that can unite \nus--entrepreneurship, innovation, and startup businesses.\n  The story of America is really a story of entrepreneurs. Our history \nis filled with examples of determined individuals who risked their \nlivelihoods to pursue ideas they believed could solve problems and \nimprove the quality of life of people around the world. These \nentrepreneurs built the foundation of the American economy from its \nearliest days, pushing forward innovative solutions to some of our most \ncomplex problems.\n  They pursued success, and that success built the American economy and \nthe jobs it provides.\n  Entrepreneurs have continued to be the driving force in the U.S. \neconomic growth and expansion in recent times as well. Data from the \nKauffman Foundation shows that between 1980 and 2005, companies less \nthan 5 years old accounted for nearly all new jobs created in the \nUnited States. Since 1977--the first year data was collected--new \nbusinesses have created an average of 3 million jobs each year.\n  At a time when millions of Americans remain out of work and our \ncountry is mired in debt, we need to do more to support the \nentrepreneurs who create American jobs and hold the promise of our \ngrowing economy.\n  Started in 2008 by the Kauffman Foundation, Global Entrepreneurship \nWeek is a worldwide celebration of entrepreneurs and like-minded \nindividuals. Since its founding, Global Entrepreneurship Week has grown \nto include\n\n[[Page S6722]]\n\n129 countries with some 35,000 activities that engage millions of \npeople.\n  In the United States, more than 1,300 partners are planning events in \nall 50 States this week. These events allow participants to interact \nwith entrepreneurs and share their passion for innovation and \ncreativity. In my home State of Kansas, 35 events are taking place this \nweek. Last Friday, November 9, I participated in one of these events at \nthe University of Kansas.\n  To kick off this week, the University of Kansas Schools of Business, \nEngineering, and Journalism organized a half-day event to expose \nstudents to entrepreneurship as a career path, introduce students to \nstartup companies in the region, and to learn the role of government in \nenabling entrepreneurship, innovation, and company creation, as well as \nthe importance of our free market economy.\n  While most of us think first of Silicon Valley as a hotbed of \nentrepreneurship in our country, entrepreneurs are found everywhere. In \nKansas, we have a rich tradition of entrepreneurship. It is a place \nwhere innovators have felt free to pursue their ideas, start \nbusinesses, and pursue dreams. This tradition includes many stories of \nrisk and reward--of entrepreneurs whose businesses succeeded when \nothers were betting against them.\n  Kansas's great entrepreneurs include Cleyson Brown, who founded Brown \nTelephone Company--now the Sprint Corporation--in the town of Abilene, \nKS; Walter Chrysler, of Chrysler Corporation, who began his career as a \nmachinist in Ellis, KS; Clyde Cessna, who left the booming automobile \nindustry to explore the exciting field of aviation. He founded Cessna \nAircraft Corporation in Wichita in 1927; and, Dan and Frank Carney, who \nborrowed $600 from their mother to open their first Pizza Hut in \nWichita in 1958.\n  With persistence and hard work, these entrepreneurs and their \nbusinesses created thousands of jobs and grew into some of the world's \nmost successful companies. Now a new generation of Kansas entrepreneurs \nis continuing that tradition.\n  In Atwood, KS, SureFire Ag Systems has built products that specialize \nin the control and application of fertilizer, seed, and chemicals. \nThese products have been delivered to customers in 42 of our States and \ninternationally as well.\n  In Leewood, KS, a company called Instin reimagined how students and \nteachers managed homework assignments by using mobile apps. Their app, \nmyHomework, has been downloaded over 100,000 times in the Google Play \nStore alone.\n  In Olathe, KS, Lantern Software is connecting homegrown businesses to \nnew markets through high-value, real-time, location-based deals \ndelivered to mobile devices.\n  In today's high-tech economy, the future of Internet-based \napplications such as these is limitless, which is why Kansas \nentrepreneurs are excited about Google's decision to make Kansas home \nto a new fiber project.\n  Google Fiber is equipping Kansas entrepreneurs for innovation that \nfew places in the United States have. With Google Fiber, Kansans now \nhave an opportunity to innovate on Google's ultra high-speed network, \nwhich is 100 times faster than typical high-speed Internet.\n  Kansas City, which has set the goal of becoming America's Most \nEntrepreneurial City, is building what they call the Digital Sandbox, \nin partnership with many Kansas businesses. The goal of the Digital \nSandbox is to significantly accelerate the development of information \ntechnology startups in Kansas City, where IT is already a major \neconomic engine.\n  These developments are empowering the next generation of Kansas \nentrepreneurs with new tools to innovate and build successful \nbusinesses.\n  Today's entrepreneurs may use different technology to develop \nproducts and reach potential markets than their predecessors, but the \nwork ethic and passion to do something new remains the same.\n  This week, I encourage my colleagues to explore the impact of \nentrepreneurs in their communities and to engage with startup companies \nworking to make the lives of Americans better.\n  I met with entrepreneurs in Kansas and across the country during the \nlast 18 months. The passion and creativity of these entrepreneurs has \nencouraged me. One refreshing observation is that these entrepreneurs, \nwhile competitive, want to see their fellow entrepreneurs succeed. They \nare also building new tools that empower others to make their \nbusinesses better.\n  But in conversation after conversation, I have also learned there are \ncommon challenges these entrepreneurs face--some of which can be solved \nby Congress if we follow the entrepreneur's example of seizing an \nopportunity, rolling up our sleeves, and working together.\n  Entrepreneurs in America are finding it increasingly difficult to \nstart a business and to grow that business. Consider the following:\n  In 2010, there were approximately 394,000 new businesses started in \nthe United States. This, unfortunately, is the lowest number of new \nbusinesses since 1977. While these new businesses created more than 2.3 \nmillion jobs, that number is well below the historical average and \nrepresents the third fewest number of jobs created by new businesses in \nmore than 30 years. At the same time, at least seven other countries \nduring this Congress have approved legislation to welcome and better \nsupport entrepreneurs while America has done nothing.\n  To help more entrepreneurs start a business and to help those new \nbusinesses grow more quickly, I introduced Startup Act 2.0 with my \ncolleagues Senator Warner, Senator Coons, and Senator Rubio. Startup \nAct 2.0 addresses critical needs facing entrepreneurs today. The \nlegislation provides new opportunities for highly educated and \nentrepreneurial immigrants to stay in the United States where their \ntalent can fuel economic growth and create jobs for Americans. By \nmaking new visas available for foreign students who graduate with an \nadvanced degree in a STEM field from an American university, Startup \nAct 2.0 will provide a much needed way for fast-growing startups and \nbusinesses in America to get the talent they need to continue to grow \nand to create jobs. This is a critical and growing challenge.\n  The Partnership for a New American Economy projects that the United \nStates will face a shortfall of more than 223,000 workers with advanced \ndegrees in STEM areas by 2018. If the current trend holds, there will \nonly be 550,000 American workers with the needed skills--far short of \nthe projected demand. Without these workers, American businesses will \nbe at a distinct disadvantage and unable to grow in our country.\n  Startup Act 2.0 also makes changes to the Tax Code that will help \nstartups grow and create jobs. By exempting capital gains taxes on \ninvestments held in startups for 5 years or more, the bill would unlock \n$7.5 billion in new investment in startup. The legislation will also \nhelp universities bring good ideas to market by redirecting current \ngrant dollars to support innovative university initiatives to \naccelerate commercialization.\n  Finally, Startup Act 2.0 will make changes to the Federal regulatory \nprocess so the costs of new regulations do not outweigh the benefits \nand will encourage State and local policies that make starting \nbusinesses easier in their States.\n  As our economy continues to struggle, Congress is left with two \noptions: We can remain in gridlock, maintain the status quo, continue \nto leave Americans under- and unemployed, and spend away our future or \nwe can work together to support the American entrepreneur and \nbusinessperson.\n  This week, during Global Entrepreneurship Week, I urge my colleagues \nto join in the latter--in coming together behind commonsense \nlegislation such as the Startup Act 2.0 to unleash the power of \nentrepreneurship in America. The result will be more new businesses, \nmore new jobs, innovation that allows the United States to aggressively \ncompete in a global economy, and the empowerment of every American to \npursue the American dream.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S6723]]\n\n                            Superstorm Sandy\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we have come back here from a few \nturbulent weeks, and not the least of which is the continuation of \nPresident Obama with his work and his responsibilities. For most of us, \nI would say, that was a very positive thing. But something else \nhappened during these very difficult weeks, and that was in my home \nState of New Jersey and the east coast. We were hit by storms never, \nnever before seen in our State and maybe never ever to be seen in our \ncountry in terms of the volume of destruction.\n  My home State of New Jersey is known for a number of things: being \nthe home of innovators, such as Thomas Edison; the place where \nAlexander Hamilton--at my birthplace, Paterson, NJ--helped start the \nindustrial revolution; and it is also known as a State with a beautiful \nseashore, recreation areas. Unfortunately, the wrath of Superstorm \nSandy 2 weeks ago destroyed so much of our shore. Its storm surge \nwrecked boats, homes, and even took trains--whole trains--off the \ntracks. Its winds reached 89 miles an hour, uprooting trees across our \nState, destroying everything in its path, and leaving millions--2\\1/2\\ \nmillion--without electricity and staying in the dark.\n  The force of this storm is so hard to describe in words, so I point \nout a picture here of one of our beachside communities, showing what \nwas left of a house. The destruction was so total. And it was not just \nthe possessions that were lost, it was the memorabilia, it was the \npictures, it was the precious moments that were identified with \ntrinkets or mementos. It was a terrible period. I am here to say that \nwe are going to stand with those who have lost so much, and we are \ngoing to help them recover and rebuild their lives.\n  Superstorm Sandy was one of the most powerful storms in American \nhistory, and it was the largest Atlantic hurricane on record, with wild \nwinds that stretched more than 1,100 miles. We are aware of at least \n119 Americans who lost their lives as a result of this storm, including \n33 in my home State of New Jersey.\n  The human toll of this storm defies description. Roughly 8 million \nhomes lost power during this storm, including more than 2\\1/2\\ million \nin my home State. Food rotted in refrigerators, water treatment plants \nclosed down, and when temperatures dropped, thousands were left cold \nand hungry and forced into hotels and temporary shelters. Many families \nslept in their cars to get out of the bad weather. They had no choice. \nWhen people finally returned home, many found nothing there. Imagine \nseeing the home you worked for your whole life--the place you raised \nyour children and created so many memories--gone.\n  If we look at this picture, we see a depiction of despair, as it was \nportrayed by this person who obviously stood in front of a destroyed \nhome--nothing but timbers and concrete, everything else gone.\n  We saw devastation across our State, not just at the seashore. I went \nto Hoboken--one of our most attractive communities in northern New \nJersey--in the days after the storm. Half of that city was underwater, \nand the National Guard had to rescue those who were trapped in their \nhomes without heat or supplies.\n  We also saw train stations that were flooded and inoperable. Water \nlevels reached more than 6 feet. Can you imagine a room that seated \npeople waiting for their trains 6 feet high in water?\n  New Jerseyans depend on our public transportation and rail systems. \nCommuters in our State take nearly 1 million trips per day, including \ngoing back and forth to New York and into Pennsylvania. And the entire \ncountry depends on the goods that come into our ports and go out by \nrail.\n  Our transportation system was torn apart. Tunnels were flooded, \ncritical equipment was ruined, and rail lines were warped or buried by \ndebris.\n  Here in this picture we see an example of what took place. This is of \na rail line, New Jersey Transit.\n  Each one of our 21 counties in New Jersey was declared a major \ndisaster, but the seashore communities were hit especially hard. The \nboardwalk is the defining image of the New Jersey shore. Many of us \nremember walking on that boardwalk in wonderment of the attractions. \nThe boardwalk has been a constant in the lives of those who live there \nor visit the shore. But for communities such as Belmar, Seaside \nHeights, Atlantic City, and others, much of that boardwalk no longer \nexists--just the pillars where the boardwalk used to be, as we see it \nshown here in this picture. It was a magnificent boardwalk that had \npeople in wagons that were pushed along, and you would view the sea and \nthe attractions on the other side. It was painful to see the \ndestruction of the part of the boardwalk in Atlantic City firsthand \nthat day.\n  I joined President Obama in his visit to the area. For many people in \nmy State, the boardwalk is not just a source of pride, it is a source \nof critical income to our State. In 2008, tourism brought in $38 \nbillion and supported more than 300,000 jobs in the State of New \nJersey. Families came from all over the country to walk the boardwalk \nin Atlantic City or take a fishing boat out of one of our ports, Port \nPleasant or one of the others, or ride the roller coaster at a pier in \nSeaside Heights.\n  This is what Sandy did to that roller coaster. Look. This is almost \nimpossible to conceive that this roller coaster sits in the water. It \nis a terrible end to a lot of thoughts and pleasant memories. People in \nNew Jersey have lost their homes, their belongings, and their jobs. \nMuch of that public infrastructure has also been destroyed. But we are \ntough people in New Jersey. We will fight our way back from this storm.\n  I saw that spirit in emergency shelters in our State. Families whose \nlives were upended by the storm were welcomed into a safe, warm place \nby strangers, given a hot meal, and had camaraderie during these very \ndifficult moments. Nurses and EMTs evacuated babies from hospitals. \nThey were carrying these children out so they would not be overwhelmed \nby flooding. Firefighters went from house to house saving lives as the \nwater rose.\n  Gas station owners who had lost power pumped gasoline by hand so \npeople could run their generators and keep their families warm. At one \npoint, the lines were hours long waiting to get gas. One of the people \nfrom my office got up at 4:30 in the morning to go to a gas station and \nwound up 4 hours later before he could get gas. It was a terrible \nperiod.\n  We saw the worst of Mother Nature in this storm, but we also saw the \nbest of the American people. One thing was established, that there is a \nplace in government, in our country, for government service when it is \nneeded. We cannot simply say: We will turn it over to the private \nsector and let them take care of what FEMA does. FEMA was critical in \nsalvaging whatever we could have saved there. There is no doubt in my \nmind that there is an understanding now that did not exist before. We \nsaw the fiber and the character of our people in these terrible \nmoments. It was wonderful. This is a town not on the seashore. This is \none of the communities in New Jersey where a lot of people commute to \nor work in the various industries around. This is where they had to go \nin order to save themselves from a worse situation than that which \nalready existed.\n  People reached out to save people. It was under the supervision of \nFEMA and our emergency facility organizations. We have a lot of \nimportant businesses to address before the end of this Congress. But \nour agenda must include helping to rebuild and restore the communities \ndestroyed by Sandy. We are going to need a lot of money, a lot of \nmoney. We cannot turn our backs on them. We cannot turn our backs. I \nknow the Presiding Officer had similar situations in his State of \nDelaware. The destruction was all over. We had no ability to stop what \nwas going on. We face serious fiscal challenges in our country, but \nnothing is more important than keeping our communities, our families, \nand our economy safe. We in New Jersey have been there for our fellow \nAmericans from other States who suffered disasters. I am reminded that \nNew Jersey was the first State to sign the Bill of Rights. It started \nthe road to freedom that exists in New Jersey. Now we ask all Americans \nto join us in rebuilding and recovering from this terrible storm. I am \nsure it will get even the most disbelieving people in our community to \nsee that it might\n\n[[Page S6724]]\n\nhave been a good idea to fund FEMA and the other agencies that do so \nmuch.\n  I went to Alaska when the Exxon Valdez was floundering and saw our \npeople, brave people, on islands stretched around Alaska, our people \nwho were on the shore wiping off the ducks and the seals and all that. \nIt says: America is not an accounting firm. America is a democracy with \na heart and a soul. That is what we have to keep in mind as we \ndeliberate what we have in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, before the Senator from New \nJersey leaves the floor, I just wish to say this Senator's heart goes \nout to the Senator and his people. We take hurricanes more as a part of \nour lifestyle in Florida. But when we combine a hurricane in the \nNortheast at this time of year, during the full Moon, at high tide, in \none of the most densely populated coastal areas of the United States, \nthen we definitely have a problem.\n  This Senator wants to help Senator Lautenberg with what is going to \nbe necessary for the additional funding of FEMA and so forth. I want \nthe Senator to think about an idea that we implemented in Florida, to \ncreate, in effect, a reinsurance fund against this kind of catastrophe. \nWe call it the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund.\n  This was done when I was the elected insurance commissioner--prior to \nme, and then I had to implement it in the aftermath of the monster \nhurricane in the 1990s, Hurricane Andrew. I have talked to our \ncolleagues in the Senate about a national catastrophic fund. People in \nother parts of the country do not think hurricanes are their problem. \nBut what they do not realize is that their taxpayers are picking up the \nload. Whereas, if we reinsured against this kind of tragedy in a \ncatastrophic fund that would be paid in over time, a little bit from \neach of the policyholders, then there would not be--there would be this \nfund that would become a cushion for such a disaster that the \nNortheastern United States is experiencing at this time and of which we \nhave so often experienced on the gulf coast and the Atlantic coast in \nthe Southeastern United States.\n  I just wanted to throw that idea out there for the Senator as he \nspeaks so movingly and so eloquently about the suffering of his people. \nOne can just imagine what are going to be the expenses of all the \ninfrastructure that is going to have to be replaced.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. If I may respond, I wish to say the Senator from \nFlorida presents a very good idea because we now know that to deal with \ncatastrophes which are inevitable, we live in nature. We live in places \nwhere volcanoes can destroy an economy, earthquakes. We had the Katrina \ncatastrophe in the Southern States. It is about time, would the Senator \nagree with me, that we looked at what it is that is creating the \nfrequency and the ferocity of those storms. They are accelerated almost \nin geometric terms.\n  This is a good reminder, hey, get off the stick and on the job. I \ncommend the Senator from Florida for his splendid victory. We knew the \nSenator was coming home, we just wanted to make sure he had a nice \nreception.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Thanks to the Senator for his big heart, his \nbig heart toward his people.\n\n\n                           Voter Suppression\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I wish to make a few comments \nbefore the chairman of the Judiciary Committee addresses the Senate. I \nam very happy he is here because he knows about what I am going to talk \nabout, which were the attempts at suppressing the vote in the State of \nFlorida, done a year and a half ago by the State legislature and the \nGovernor. They did a number of things to try to suppress the vote.\n  The first thing they did was to make it much more difficult to \nregister people to vote. The League of Women Voters has been \nregistering people for 72 years in Florida. They stopped because of the \nonerous provisions of up to a $1,000 fine that would be upon their \nmembers if they did not turn it in within 48 hours. That was thrown out \nin court as unconstitutional. But it was a year and a half later, with \nall those registrations not having been done.\n  But then what they did, they constricted the number of early voting \nplaces, constricted the number of early voting days, constricted the \nnumber of early voting hours. What do you think was the result? It is \nwhat we have seen on TV--the long lines.\n  I wish to read a passage from the Miami Herald of November 6:\n\n       When the polls officially closed at 7 p.m., hundreds of \n     people were still waiting to cast ballots in precincts around \n     South Florida in an election that was marked by long lines \n     and the occasional snafu. Even after the networks called the \n     race for President Obama, people in South Florida remained in \n     line. From Hialeah to Country Walk and to Brickell, people \n     waited as long as 7 hours to vote. In Broward County, voting \n     at some precincts came to a halt when the ballots ran out.\n\n  This is the result of the voter suppression by lessening the number \nof early voting days. When this Senator asked the Governor, because of \nthe long lines during early voting, to extend early voting on the \nSunday before the Tuesday election, since it shut off on Saturday, \nthere were long lines then in early voting, the Governor would not do \nit. We see the result. The Miami Herald continues:\n\n       At the South Kendall Community Church, 1,000 people were in \n     line at closing time, and at least 200 still remained three \n     hours later.\n\n  That is a determination to vote, and the people do not want their \nright to cast their ballot taken away. Yet this was the result of voter \nsuppression laws not only in my State but in other States as well. I \nwish to thank the chairman of the Judiciary Committee because he and \nhis subcommittee, headed by Senator Durbin, came to Tampa to take \ntestimony.\n  A professor from the University of Florida gave his study and pointed \nout who used--in the experience of Florida for a decade, who used the \nSunday early voting? It was two demographic groups, African Americans \nand Hispanics. They cut out the Sunday of early voting before the \nTuesday election.\n  Yet with the constricted times and with others being forced to \nshoehorn in between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. on election day, we see the \nresult. As the Miami Herald said, some people waited 7 hours to vote. \nThey were determined that the Governor and the legislature of Florida \nwere not going to take away their right to cast that ballot. And we see \nagain, we had again a close Presidential election in Florida. The \nPresident won by 74,000 votes. What if a number of people--such as the \nlady who waited and waited and she had babysitter problems and after 3 \nhours she left--what if that had happened to a lot of people?\n  Well, maybe that was the design of some people in constricting the \nlaws in an America of 2012. We went through this in the civil rights \nera. The right to vote--as the Senator, our chairman, can tell us, has \nbeen said over and over by the courts--it is absolutely essential in a \ndemocracy that we have the right to cast our ballot. That is what Dr. \nKing said as well.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Does the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Of course I will.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I join my colleagues in welcoming him back to this body, \nin which he has served with distinction from his very first day here as \nhe did in the other body.\n  It tears my heart apart to hear of this kind of suppression. In \nVermont, we have pride in our ability to vote. We have Town Meeting \nDay. I think we had 65 or 70 percent turnout this time. We expect \npeople to be able to vote.\n  The distinguished Senator has referred to the civil rights era. Do \nwe, in this great country--a signal of democracy to so much of the \nworld--want to go back there? I am sure the distinguished Senator has \nhad, as I have had, the honor of being an observer of elections in \nother countries where, finally, a country that has overcome a \ndictatorship or overcome a civil war, they finally can vote, and the \npeople are lining up and saying: Thank God we have a chance to vote and \nit is open for the first time. They would say: You Americans would \nnever have to experience this. I don't want to go to these countries \nthat we ask to come into the fold of democracy and ask them to have \nfree and open voting and have them--those that do not want free and \nopen voting--say: What about what you have done in your country?\n\n[[Page S6725]]\n\n  This is not a Democratic or Republican issue. This is an American \nissue. We fought a revolution. We fought world wars. We worked to make \nthis country of over 300 million people great because everybody's voice \nis supposed to be heard. I think it is shameful and I think it is \nillegal. Those who try to stop it, they should be exposed. They should \nbe punished. I don't care if the person voting is a Republican or \nDemocrat or Independent. They should have the right to vote. If we lose \nthat right, we lose our soul as Americans. I thank the distinguished \nSenator for bringing this up.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Amen to those comments. I would conclude by \nsaying we ought to be making it easier to vote, not harder to vote. \nThen, when we get down to conducting an election, we definitely need to \ndo something about the Citizens United Supreme Court 5-to-4 decision, \nand we can, statutorily. We almost did, lacking one vote breaking the \nfilibuster 3 years ago because it would require the disclosure of those \ncorporations giving the money. If the public knew who was giving the \nmoney, then they would be very reluctant. Whereas under the guise, the \nmask of secrecy, they can give money and try to influence the outcome \nof an election--as they tried this year.\n  It has gone out of control, and I know the chairman is going to be at \nthe point of the spear on trying to pass the DISCLOSE Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                             The Farm Bill\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I think the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Florida has done the Senate and the country a service in what he \nhas said.\n  We each represent our own States. We have matters of interest in our \nStates, but also so many times they are national interests. During this \npast recess, I was in just about every part of Vermont. I was stopped \ntime and time again by Vermont farmers who asked me why Congress left \ntown without passing a farm bill. They knew we had passed it in the \nSenate, but why hadn't we finished?\n  Similar to my fellow Vermonters, I have been frustrated by the \nrefusal of the leadership of the House of Representatives to consider \nthe legislation sent to them by the Senate to extend the farm bill. In \nfact, they blocked consideration of a bipartisan farm bill, one that \nmirrors the legislation passed in their own body by the House \nAgriculture Committee.\n  I have been here nearly 38 years. I have served on the Senate \nAgriculture Committee all that time. I have never seen a case where the \nHouse Agriculture Committee--whether it is led by Democrats or by \nRepublicans--passed a bipartisan farm bill only to see it blocked from \na final vote by its own leadership.\n  The Senate has done its work, but as a result of the House's \ninaction, for the first time that anybody can remember in either body, \nthe farm bill has expired. This is dangerous for dairy farmers in \nVermont and for farmers across the country.\n  This delay threatens our rural communities. We all have rural \ncommunities in our States. The farmers not only need but also deserve \nthe certainty that a 5-year farm bill provides. We pass farm bills in \n5-year segments so that farmers, who have to plan way in the future, \nknow how to plan. We can't say: Wait a minute, put your farming on hold \nwhile we try to get our act together. Don't milk those cows for a few \nmonths while we try to figure out what we are going to do. Don't plant \nor don't harvest that crop while we are trying to figure out what we \nare going to do.\n  It doesn't work that way. The farmers already confront enough \nuncertainty running their businesses. When we let farm programs expire \nwithout enacting a new farm bill, it needlessly compounds that \nuncertainty and it is irresponsible. Decisions must by made today to \ndetermine what is going to be planted next spring. But now they have to \nmake that decision with uncertainty about what may be in the farm bill.\n  The essential nutrition programs in the farm bill provide healthy \nfood for vulnerable populations, such as children and pregnant and \nnursing women. Vermonters, like tens of millions of people across the \ncountry, depend upon these programs where they are struggling to put \nenough food on their table during these very tough economic times.\n  Some of these program benefits will continue. But it is such a \ntenuous position. How does a State plan? How does a community plan? We \nneed the House leadership to allow the farm bill to proceed so we can \nmove this country forward, giving farmers the certainty and vulnerable \ncitizens the security they deserve.\n  The Senate farm bill is a good, bipartisan bill. But more than that, \nit is a deficit reduction bill. It has $23 billion in cost savings as \nwell as crucial policy reforms for dairy farmers facing the challenges \nof the 21st century. It also maintains a safety net for millions of \nhungry Americans.\n  The wealthiest, most powerful Nation on Earth has people going \nhungry. In a nation that spends billions of dollars on fad diet \nprograms or billions of dollars to dispose of waste food, we should not \nhave hungry people. Not in this country.\n  I also point out the farm bill has always been bipartisan. I remember \nthe hard work, mutual respect, and spirit of cooperation that Senator \nDick Lugar and I shared. We worked together as Agriculture Committee \nchairman and ranking member. We put American farmers and families first \nand politics last. My good friend from Indiana and I were able to \naccomplish amazing things together. Obviously, we had some differences \nof opinion as Members of different regions and different parties do. \nBut we knew we had to work together. We did, and America benefited from \nthat. Certainly our farmers did too.\n  The need to work together is as true today as it was then. It is \ngoing to take real leadership in the House and Senate to pass a farm \nbill. We have seen that leadership and bipartisanship in the Senate. \nHaving served as chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee for 8 \nyears, I can say without any doubt that Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow has \nbeen one of the finest chairs we have had of that committee. I have \nwatched how hard she has worked and how hard Ranking Member Pat Roberts \nhas worked. He brought his tremendous experience and knowledge through \nhis time as chairman of the House agriculture Committee. In fact, in \nthe debate over the Senate farm bill--and I commend Senator Stabenow on \nthis--seated around that table we had several people who had previously \nbeen chairman or ranking member of the Senate Agriculture Committee or \nthe House Agriculture Committee, both Republicans and Democrats. In \nfact, even one Senator who had been Secretary of Agriculture. We all \nsaid: We can play games, we can talk, we can posture, we can sloganeer \nor we can sit down like grownups and put together a real farm bill.\n  It took a nanosecond to decide we can be grownups and put together a \nreal farm bill. Republicans and Democrats sat down. We wrote a deficit-\nreducing, meaningful farm bill, and it passed in a Senate which is \noften deadlocked. It passed 64-35. It passed overwhelmingly--from all \nparts of the country and across the political spectrum.\n  Senator Johanns, former Secretary of Agriculture during the Bush \nadministration, sat around that table and helped us write it. That \nshows how bipartisan the approach to reauthorizing the farm bill was in \nthe Senate. We did not let political labels get in the way of what was \nbest for the country.\n  The elections are over. We know who has won or lost. We hope our \nfriends in the other body, in the House of Representatives, will set \naside their obstructionism and pass this bill. I am pleased by the fact \nthat our State's Congressman, Peter Welch, is a member of that \ncommittee. He has been urging both Republicans and Democrats to pass \nthe bill, and I agree with him because it is a bill that directly \naffects every farm family's budget. It helps farmers decide which crops \nto plant, where to sell, how much to borrow. It allows farmers to make \ntheir decisions--which are hard enough to make without this delay--with \nsome kind of certainty.\n  The farm bill affects Vermonters and Americans across the country \nwhere there is food insecurity and uncertainty in these difficult \ntimes. One of the things people lose sight of is that the farm bill is \nalso a disaster relief\n\n[[Page S6726]]\n\nbill. We need the new farm bill to help farmers in the Garden State and \nacross the entire Nation to recover from the nonstop floods of 2012. We \nneed it to help those across the Nation who are stuck on the other side \nof the weather spectrum, with drought.\n  That is all in this bill. Because we know, as much as we wish there \nwould never be floods, as much as we wish there would never be \ndroughts, they occur. We have written that into this bill. Why in \nheaven's name would anybody, from any part of the country--and we are \nall vulnerable at one time or another--want to hold it up?\n  The fact is things are going to get worse very quickly if we begin \nthe new year without a farm bill. Outdated parity price systems will \nmultiply the price of milk on store shelves. It will destroy household \npocketbooks and the milk market nationally.\n  Let me reiterate that. Certainly in my State this is very important. \nIf we don't pass the bill, we will have outdated parity price systems \nthat will multiply the price of milk on the store shelves and will \ndestroy household pocketbooks and the milk market nationally. Ask \nanybody who lives paycheck to paycheck what that would be like.\n  So I urge the leadership in the House of Representatives to allow \nopen debate on the Senate-passed farm bill. They don't have to have a \nbill that is word for word what we passed here in the Senate, but I \npoint out that the Senate bill saves billions of dollars, it does have \na dairy program, and it does speak to disaster, drought, and flood \nrelief. We need it now. Let us stand with our dairy farmers in Vermont, \nour eggplant growers in New Jersey, and our hungry families across the \ncountry. Let's set the political gamesmanship aside, help America's \nfarmers, families, and rural communities that all rely on the farm \nbill. The people in these communities, the farmers in these \ncommunities, do not care whether there is a Democrat or Republican's \nname on the bill. All they know is they want a good farm bill that \nallows them to stay in farming.\n  Farming is hard enough as it is. None of us has to do the farming. We \nought to stand up and help--that we can do.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse).\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise today to urge support on the motion \nto proceed to my bipartisan Sportsmen's Act. Outdoor traditions are a \ndeep and important part of our heritage in Montana and across our \nNation.\n  Two years ago, when I became chair of the Congressional Sportsmen's \nCaucus, I made it my goal to do something significant, something \nhistoric, something responsible that will help this country's hunters \nand anglers.\n  Mr. President, this week we have that opportunity. This Sportsmen's \nAct is the biggest package of sportsmen's bills in a generation. It \ncombines nearly 20 different bills, all important to those who know we \nmust never take our outdoors for granted.\n  These bills increase access for recreational hunting and fishing. \nThey support land and species conservation, and they protect our \nhunting and fishing rights. Most importantly, they take ideas from both \nsides of the political aisle. This bill isn't about Democrats and it \nisn't about Republicans or Independents. This bill is about Americans \nand the great outdoors we all share as a nation. This bipartisan bill \nis supported by nearly 50 different conservation wildlife groups \nranging from the Nature Conservancy, the National Wildlife Federation, \nto the NRA. It earned their endorsement because it includes responsible \nprovisions that are important to sportsmen and women across America.\n  In my role as the chairman of the Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus, \noutdoorsmen and women constantly tell me about the importance of access \nto public lands. What good does it do to protect land for hunting, \nfishing, and hiking if folks are unable to get to it? Right now there \nare some 35 million acres of public land that sportsmen can't access. \nThat is why this bill requires 1.5 percent of annual funding from the \nLand and Water Conservation Fund that is set aside to increase public \naccess to public lands, ensuring sportsmen access to some of the best \nplaces to hunt and fish in the country.\n  Right now, the Congress delegates all power to determine land and \nwater conservation priorities to the executive branch. We can add or \nsubtract money from the President's budget request, but Congress cannot \ndetermine how that money gets spent. This provision ensures that this \nadministration and the next one must authorize, must prioritize access \nto public lands.\n  My bill also reauthorizes the North American Wetlands Conservation \nAct. This voluntary initiative provides matching grants to landowners \nwho set aside critical habitat for migratory birds such as ducks. Over \nthe past 20 years, volunteers across America have completed more than \n2,000 conservation projects. They protected more than 26 million acres \nof habitat under this successful initiative. The North American \nWetlands Conservation Act is a smart investment in both our lands and \nour wildlife, and it needs to be reauthorized.\n  This widely supported bill also reauthorizes the Secretary of the \nInterior to reevaluate the price of duck stamps to keep up with \ninflation. Revenue from duck stamps has been used to purchase and \nrelease more than 6 million acres of wetlands, preserving a viable \nwaterfowl population. It funds new shooting ranges while encouraging \nFederal land agencies to cooperate with State and local authorities to \nmaintain existing ranges. This is a responsible bill. It takes into \naccount the needs of the entire sportsmen's community.\n  Why is this important? It is important because hunting and fishing \nand hiking is a way of life in places such as Montana.\n  One in three Montanans hunt big game and more than half of us fish. \nAn outdoor recreation economy across this country contributes some $646 \nbillion in direct spending to this U.S. economy. Fishing and hunting is \nnot just recreation, it is a critical part of our economy. In Montana, \nhunting and fishing alone brings $1 billion a year to our economy, \nnearly as much as the State's cattle industry. It drives and sustains \njobs. With hunting season in full swing and thousands of Montanans \nheaded out to hunt in Montana's back country over Thanksgiving weekend, \nthis bill is as timely as ever.\n  The Sportsmen's Act of 2012 is balanced, it is bipartisan, and it is \nwidely supported. It is also fiscally responsible. The bill has no \ncost. Before the Senate went out of session, we voted to move forward \nwith this bill by a vote of 84 to 7--84 to 7. It was a resounding \napproval to conserve some of our most productive habitat to pass on our \nhunting and fishing tradition to future generations and to entrust them \nwith the land and water we share.\n  Now it is time to get this bill across the finish line, to approve a \nbill with widespread support that preserves our outdoor economy and \nsecures our outdoor heritage for our kids and our grandkids.\n  We need to take some good Democratic ideas and some good Republican \nideas and pass them. We need to do something for the more than 90 \nmillion sportsmen and sportswomen in this country and for our economy.\n  The time is now. I urge all Members to support this bill.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, all time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to proceed to S. 3525.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second. There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n\n[[Page S6727]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, we are going to complete work on this bill, \nthat is the one we had prior to the clerk announcing the Defense \nauthorization bill. We are going to complete the work on the \nsportsmen's bill before we go home for Thanksgiving. People are going \nto have an opportunity to vote for that bill, either for it or against \nit. As I indicated, it is a widely popular bill. If Republicans want to \ndrag it down and kill it as they have a lot of other things, they will \nhave that opportunity to do that. We have more than 20 bills that are \nimportant to sportsmen around the country.\n  As I said a few minutes ago, I cannot imagine why we are still \nfighting the battles of the last election. We are going to have a vote \non cyber security. I spoke to the chairman of the committee a short \ntime ago, Senator Lieberman. He is going to come over tomorrow and give \na speech about the importance of this legislation. He and Senator \nCollins have worked so hard to come up with a bill. They have \ncompromised and compromised and compromised until the point where \npeople are going to have an opportunity to talk on this also. Senator \nLieberman is going to talk about how important this bill is to protect \nour country.\n  I left the White House an hour or two ago. They believe, the \nPresident of the United States believes the cyber security bill is one \nof the most important issues facing this Congress now--not next \nCongress, now. I have said on a number of occasions that the Pentagon \nand the intelligence community believe this legislation is vitally \nimportant to the safety and security of our country. So before \nThanksgiving we are going to finish the sportsmen's bill. The \nRepublicans can either kill the cyber security bill--they have been \nfollowing the lead of the Chamber of Commerce, which is an arm for the \nRepublican Party anymore. It is just a front for the Republican Party. \nThey spent huge amounts of money that they get from unknown sources to \ndefeat Democrats. They wasted their money this time. But that is the \nway it is.\n  They are opposing this bill for not any logical reason, and then \nSenators Levin and McCain have asked to go to Defense authorization. I \nthink, if this bill is as important as they say it is--and they say it \nis important--I know how Senator Levin and Senator McCain feel about \nit--it looks like they would clear up some of this stuff that is \nstanding in the way of getting that bill done.\n  I think it is a bridge too far to complete the Defense authorization \nbill before we leave, but we need to get on that bill. We are not going \nto stall around on this and spend weeks on the Defense authorization \nbill. I have told the two managers of that bill, Senator McCain and \nSenator Levin, that is the case, and that is what we are going to do \nbefore Thanksgiving.\n  I would like to get out of here so we can go home to our States, our \nfamilies, for Thanksgiving early, but if we have to stay here until the \nday before Thanksgiving, we are going to do it.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Sportsmen's Act of 2012\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise in support of the \nSportsmen's Act of 2012, which is Senate bill No. 3525. This bill is a \nset of bipartisan proposals that enjoys overwhelming support in the \nsportsmen's community, and I was glad to see it clear another \nprocedural hurdle just a short time ago. As the majority leader did, I \nurge my colleagues to give it final approval as quickly as we possibly \ncan.\n  I wish to share some of the reasons why I think it is so important to \nget this bill to the President's desk. As the name implies, the \nSportsmen's Act is focused on helping the Nation's 88 million sports \nmen and women. They want, more than anything, responsible access to \nFederal lands and the conservation of critical habitat and species and \nthat is exactly what this bill does.\n  By dedicating 1.5 percent of Land and Water Conservation Fund dollars \nto improve access for hunting, fishing, and other recreational \npurposes, sportsmen will be able to make better use of our public \nlands. By giving the States greater flexibility over the use of Federal \ndollars to build shooting ranges, sportsmen will have more places to \nsafely sharpen their marksmanship skills and sighting their rifles for \nthe hunting season.\n  By reauthorizing many critical habitat investment programs--for \nexample, the North American Wetlands Conservation Act and the Federal \nLand Transaction Facilitation Act--we are ensuring that sportsmen will \nhave places to continue our proud hunting and fishing heritage.\n  The benefits of the Sportsmen's Act of 2012 will fall most directly \non America's hunters and anglers, but outdoor enthusiasts of all \nstripes will reap the rewards. By improving the outdoor experience of \nall Americans, I am hoping future generations will more readily take up \nour outdoor traditions.\n  I know my colleague from Colorado will join me in commending Senator \nTester for putting this package together. He has taken ideas from both \nDemocrats and Republicans to create the greatest legislative boon for \nsportsmen in a generation, and that is why over 50 of the leading \nsportsmen's groups in our country support his bill.\n  I am particularly grateful to Senator Tester for including a \nbipartisan provision I authored--the Target Practice and Marksmanship \nTraining Support Act. This act will encourage the development of high-\nquality public shooting ranges by giving the States greater flexibility \nover Federal dollars they already receive for certain wildlife \nrestoration and hunter education programs.\n  Since these funds come from an existing excise tax on shooting and \narchery equipment, this bipartisan proposal doesn't cost our taxpayers \na dime and instead simply helps those paying into the system--which are \nprimarily sportsmen--to get a better return on their investment.\n  Earlier this year, I asked our fellow Coloradans to tell me why they \nsupport my efforts and why they would like to see more high-quality \nshooting ranges, and I wish to close with some of their words.\n  Donald, from Pagosa Springs, CO, said:\n\n       We desperately need a range facility in our area to be able \n     to continue teaching our kids and those who are new to \n     hunting how to safely handle firearms.\n\n  From Gary, in Aurora, CO:\n\n\n[[Page S6729]]\n\n\n       These ranges are not just a place to shoot. I cannot stress \n     this enough as we are seeing more and more clubs closing \n     down: We need more places to teach, enjoy and relax with \n     fellow shooters.\n\n  So in the spirit of those Coloradans, I urge my colleagues to support \nthe Sportsmen's Act of 2012 and put these bipartisan, commonsense \nproposals to work for America's sportsmen as soon as possible.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/13/senate-section/article/S6729-1", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6729]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado.

Mr. President, Iowa has lost another native son \nfighting for our liberty on foreign soil. I am sad to announce that on \nMonday, November 5, just as our Nation was preparing to cast our \nballots in the election, PFC Brandon Buttry of Shenandoah, IA, gave his \nlife defending our freedom. He was only 19 years old but had felt a \ncalling to join the military since he was a young child. I thank God \nfor such patriots as Brandon Buttry. Without such brave and selfless \nAmericans in each new generation, our liberty and way of life could not \nhave been sustained.\n  My prayers go out to his parents, Don and Pam, his many brothers and \nsisters, and all those who knew and loved Brandon. He is described as \nhaving a mischievous smile and a twinkle in his eye as well as a slight \ncontrarian streak. By all accounts, he was liked by all who knew him, \nand I know he will be missed very deeply in his community.\n  I understand he had an interest in American history, and his love of \nhis country is evident from his deep desire to serve. He has now given \nthe ultimate sacrifice on behalf of his fellow countrymen, and his name \nwill be immortalized alongside all those other American patriots who \nhave laid down their lives in the name of freedom.\n Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I rise to commend the members of \nthe 4th Brigade Combat Team (Airborne), 25th Infantry Division from \nJoint Base Elemendorf-Richardson, AK, upon the completion of their \ndeployment to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.\n  I had the chance to be there in person when part of the brigade \narrived at Fort Richardson. It was great to see our soldiers reunited \nwith their families after so long apart. I was glad to be there last \nyear when the 4/25 deployed, and I am pleased to offer my best wishes \nnow as we celebrate their return home.\n  The 4/25 accomplished incredible things during its time in \nAfghanistan. Each and every member of the brigade--all 3,500 Spartans--\ncarried the fight to those who would do our Nation harm. In doing so, \nthey have made the world a safer place for those who love freedom and \ndemocracy.\n  However, those victories were not without sacrifice. During this \ndeployment, eight brave Spartans were killed in action--PFC Nathan T. \nDavis, PFC Vincent J. Ellis, SSG Thomas K. Fogarty, SSG Carl E. Hammar, \nCPL Ethan J. Martin, PFC Richard L. McNulty III, SGT Brian L. Walker, \nand SPC Jeffrey L. White. We will never forget them.\n  I would also like to recognize the families of the 4/25. As we all \nknow, our soldiers simply could not do their jobs without the support \nof their loved ones. You are the ones who wrote letters and emails, \nsent care packages, and kept things running smoothly back home.\n  When a soldier raises their right hand and swears in, their family \njoins the Army, too. Thank you all for your service.\n  As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I commend the 4th \nBrigade, 25th Infantry Division, for their dedication, commitment and \nsacrifice. We owe them a debt of gratitude that can never fully be \nrepaid.\n  To both the Spartans and their families, thank you again for \neverything you do. God bless you, and God bless the United States of \nAmerica.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/13/senate-section/article/S6729-3", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6729-S6731]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING OUR NATION'S VETERANS\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, today I wish to honor John V. Klobofski, a \nveteran of World War II. It is my honor to share the story of John's \nmilitary service because no story of heroism should ever fall through \nthe cracks.\n  John was born in Cleveland, MT, in 1919. After graduating from \nChinook High School, he enlisted in the National Guard, where he served \nfor 3 years.\n  He then attended classes at Northern Montana College and worked for \nthe Weather Bureau in Havre.\n  John reenlisted in 1940 and was assigned to the 41st Infantry \nDivision, made up of guardsmen from across the West. As a member of the \n163rd Infantry Regiment, John was a part of the campaign to capture New \nGuinea, which was then under Japanese control. Dubbed Operation \nPersecution, his unit landed ashore at Aitape on April 22, 1944. Within \na number of days, the unit had captured and secured two airfields, and \nsupplies were being delivered to the island.\n  Because of how quickly they were able to seize these airfields, \nJohn's unit was awarded a Presidential Unit Citation.\n  But fighting continued in the region for several days and many men, \nincluding John, were killed. SSG John Klobofski died on April 30, 1944.\n  On October 16, 2012, in the presence of his family, it was my great \nhonor to finally present to John's family his Bronze Star Medal, a \nPurple Heart, and a Presidential Unit Citation.\n  It was also my honor to present an American Defense Service Medal, an \nAsiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with Two Bronze Stars, a World War II \nVictory Medal, and a Combat Infantryman Badge First Award.\n  These decorations are small tokens, but they are powerful symbols of \ntrue heroism. Sacrifice. And dedication to service.\n  These medals are presented on behalf of a grateful nation.\n  Mr. President, today I also wish to honor Alan R. Shennum, a veteran \nof the Vietnam war. It is my honor to share the story of Alan's \nmilitary service because no story of heroism should ever fall through \nthe cracks.\n  Alan was born in Helena, MT, in 1946. After graduating from high \nschool, he enlisted in the Army and trained at Fort Wolters in Texas \nbefore attending flight school at Hunter Army Airfield in Georgia.\n  Alan was sent to Vietnam in September of 1968, where he flew \nhelicopters as part of the Fourth Army Division.\n  In October of 1968, Alan was wounded while flying a combat operation. \nBecause his injuries were not severe, he returned to duty and flew over \n30 missions in all. Warrant Officer Alan Shennum retired from service \nin 1971 but never received his medals.\n  On October 17, 2012, in the presence of his family, it was my great \nhonor to finally present to Alan the National Defense Service Medal, \nthe Army Aviator Badge, the Good Conduct Medal, and the Vietnam Service \nMedal.\n  It was also my honor to present an Air Medal with 32 Oak Leaf \nClusters, a Vietnam Campaign Medal, and two Overseas Service Bars.\n  These decorations are small tokens, but they are powerful symbols of \ntrue heroism. Sacrifice. And dedication to service.\n  These medals are presented on behalf of a grateful nation.\n Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I also wish to commend the members \nof B Company, 1st Battalion, Airborne, 143rd Infantry Regiment of the \nAlaska Army National Guard upon the completion of their deployment to \nAfghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.\n  I had the chance to be there in person when the company deployed, and \nI am pleased to offer my best wishes now as we celebrate their safe \nreturn home.\n\n[[Page S6730]]\n\n  Alaska has a special relationship with our military. That \nrelationship started long before statehood during World War II with the \nAlaska Territorial Guard. Thousands of Alaska Natives voluntarily took \nup arms in defense of our Nation and established a history of \ncommitment and sacrifice that lives on in Alaska today. We are proud of \nthe thousands of Alaskans, and especially Alaska Natives, who continue \nto volunteer to protect our homeland. As members of the Alaska Army \nNational Guard, as Alaskans who have stood up for America, the members \nof Bravo Company carry on our State's long legacy of service.\n  Bravo Company accomplished incredible things during its time in \nAfghanistan. While deployed to Kandahar, Farah, and Zabul, our \nGuardsmen supported three provincial reconstruction teams. Their \nefforts have contributed enormously to promoting security and the rule \nof law in Afghanistan and have helped moved the United States closer to \naccomplishing its mission in the country.\n  I would also like to take this opportunity to recognize the families \nof Bravo Company. Our guardsmen faced a difficult mission in \nAfghanistan, and they simply could not have done it without the support \nof their loved ones back home. Thank you all for your service, \nsacrifice, and dedication.\n  As citizen-soldiers, the members of Bravo Company hail from \nthroughout Alaska. They come from Anchorage, Bethel, Chevak, Delta \nJunction, Dillingham, Eagle River, Ekwok, Emmonak, Fairbanks, Fort \nGreely, Hooper Bay, Houston, Juneau, Kipnuk, Kodiak, Kongiganak, \nKwethluk, Little Diomede, Marshal, Nikiski, Nome, North Pole, Palmer, \nPort Graham, Quinaag, Scammon Bay, Shishmaref, Sitka, Tuluksa, Upper \nKalskag, Valdez, Wasilla, and Wrangell. They return now to communities \nproud of their service and grateful to have them home.\n  As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I commend B \nCompany, 1st Battalion, Airborne, 143rd Infantry Regiment, for their \ndedication, commitment, and sacrifice. We owe them a debt of gratitude \nthat can never fully be repaid.\n  To both Bravo Company and the families, thank you again for \neverything you do. God bless you, and God bless the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the heroic \nUniversity of Arkansas alumni whose actions earned them the Nation's \nhighest distinction for valor in military action, the Congressional \nMedal of Honor.\n  Throughout the storied history of the University of Arkansas, many \nmen and women have served their Nation with honor and valor, and five \nof these selfless heroes have earned our Nation's highest military \nhonor.\n  On Monday, November 12, 2012, we recognized these valiant heroes who \nput their lives on the line. We honored their service and \naccomplishments with the dedication of a memorial flag pole on the \nUniversity of Arkansas campus.\n  Maurice L. Britt was born in Carlisle, AR, in 1919. On November 10, \n1943, north of Mignano, Italy, Army Lieutenant Britt was wounded in \nbattle, but he refused medical attention and proceeded to lead a \nhandful of men in a counterattack against the Germans. Lieutenant Britt \nand his men ultimately captured four Germans and enabled captured \nAmericans to escape.\n  Nathan Green Gordon was born in Morrilton, AR, in 1916. On February \n15, 1944, in the Bismarck Sea, Navy Lieutenant Gordon was the commander \nof a Catalina patrol plane. Braving close-range fire from the enemy, \nLieutenant Gordon rescued U.S. airmen of the U.S. Army 5th Air Force in \nfull view of the Japanese. He made a daring escape under direct fire to \nfly them to safety.\n  Edgar H. Lloyd was born in Blytheville, AR. On September 14, 1944, \nnear Pompey, France, Army First Lieutenant Lloyd was serving as a rifle \nplatoon leader in Company E of the 319th Infantry. Assigned task of \nremoving 200 enemy forces from their position, Lieutenant Lloyd's \ncompany was within 50 yards of the enemy position and suffered many \ncasualties. Despite the enemy threat, First Lieutenant Lloyd encouraged \nhis fellow soldiers by attacking enemy machine gun positions, \npersonally destroying five machine guns. His valor inspired the men to \noverrun the enemy position.\n  Seymour W. Terry was born in Little Rock, AR. On May 11, 1945, on \nZebra Hill, Okinawa, Ryukyu Islands, Army First Lieutenant Terry led \nhis company on an attack when his men came under heavy enemy fire. He \nsinglehandedly began securing the hill, running directly towards the \nenemy and destroying the strongholds. He sealed 4 pillboxes with \nexplosives, killed 20 Japanese and destroyed 3 machine guns. He \ncontinued his assault on the hill to allow his troops to advance. As \nFirst Lieutenant Terry was reorganizing the company, he was mortally \nwounded. His heroism inspired the platoon to continue the mission.\n  James L. Stone was born in Pine Bluff, AR. On November 21 and 22, \n1951, near Sokkogae, Korea, First Lieutenant Stone's platoon was \nattacked by Chinese forces. Courageously, he stood and directed his men \nwhile repairing a faulty flamethrower. He was wounded but continued to \nfire on the enemy during a second attack and encouraged the platoon \nmembers' efforts to protect their position.\n  It is people like Maurice Britt, Nathan Gordon, Edgar Lloyd, Seymour \nTerry, and James Stone whose resilience, bravery, and courage exemplify \nthe American spirit. Their legacies will live on as we remember all of \nour brave service members who selflessly serve our Nation to protect \nits ideals and interests.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I wish to acknowledge the millions of \nbrave American veterans who have given of themselves to protect this \ngreat Nation and our precious liberties. I thank not only our veterans \nbut also men and women currently in uniform and all their families. The \nsacrifices our veterans and service members make are enormous: remote \ndeployments, long deployments, injuries, and worse.\n  Despite the inherent risk, the United States continues to attract the \nmost qualified and dedicated citizen soldiers. The role of the citizen \nsoldier in this country is older than the United States itself. From \nthe first shots declaring our independence to the current war in \nAfghanistan, Americans have enjoyed unparallel freedom and security \nthanks to those among us who are willing to put themselves in harm's \nway.\n  This past Sunday, we formally honored our Nation's veterans and we \ncelebrated how privileged we are to have a fighting force as committed \nto excellence as our own. Our expressions of gratitude, however, should \nmanifest themselves in actions that make positive impacts on the lives \nof the veterans to whom we owe so much. President John Kennedy once \nsaid: ``As we express our gratitude, we must never forget that the \nhighest appreciation is not to utter words, but to live by them.'' So \ntoday I will utter words I hope you will join me in living by. When we \nsay ``we owe our freedom to our men and women in uniform,'' we must \nmake sure our veterans are treated as such. We must make sure that \nthose veterans who need help transitioning back to civilian life have \nthe resources to do so. We need to be sure veterans can find suitable \njobs. When our men and women return home, they should have access to \nthe best medical care, education, and training available so they can \ncontinue to be beacons of model citizenry.\n  Let this Veterans Day be a catalyst for how we treat veterans for the \nrest of the year and beyond. The appreciation, gratitude, and respect \nshown to veterans today should be ever-present. The men, women, and \nfamilies who protect us deserve so much more than just 1 day to be \npublicly appreciated. Every American can do something to repay our \nveterans. There are many organizations dedicated to helping veterans. \nFor instance, I have had the distinct honor to work on legislation with \nmy colleague C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger to help Fisher House, an \norganization that arranges for travel and accommodations for family \nmembers who visit their wounded warriors as they recuperate in \nhospitals away from home. Fisher House established a program called \nHotels for Heroes which allows travelers to donate credit card hotel \nreward points to military families. Many of those families will be \nvisiting their loved ones at Water Reed in my home State of Maryland. \nWith fewer than 1 percent of all Americans currently serving in our \nAll-Volunteer Armed Forces, the sacrifices of the few are not always \nfelt by the many. Donating unused frequent flyer airline\n\n[[Page S6731]]\n\nmiles and hotel points is a wonderful--and easy--way for Americans to \nexpress their appreciation for our brave warriors and their families. \nAnother worthy organization is America's Vet Dogs, which is working \nwith inmates provided by the Maryland Department of Public Safety and \nCorrectional Services to train service dogs to aid returning veterans \nwho are disabled.\n  There are countless other groups doing an immeasurable amount of good \nfor our veterans and their families but we always can--and should--do \nmore. So on this Veterans Day, I ask that all Americans give something \nback to the people who have given so much for this country. Our \nveterans deserve it, and our country is made stronger when everyone \nmakes sacrifices for it. Veterans understand sacrificing for others; we \nhonor our veterans if we understood that too.\n  Mr. President, as we honor the brave men and women who have served in \nour military, we also must turn our thoughts and prayers to those who \ncurrently wear a uniform in service to our country, especially those in \nharm's way in Afghanistan and around the world. They are tomorrow's \nveterans. So during this lameduck session of the 112th Congress and as \nwe prepare for the 113th Congress, I urge my colleagues to consider our \nActive-Duty service members, our veterans, and their families' needs as \nwe legislate. It is my deepest hope addressing those needs will not be \nmired down by partisanship on either side of the aisle.\n  In closing, I would like to extend my deepest and most sincere thanks \nto our Active-Duty service men and women, veterans, and their families. \nI thank you for your selfless service, your dedication, your strength \nof character, and your courage. As a nation, we owe you an eternal debt \nof gratitude and appreciation for your innumerable sacrifices on our \nbehalf.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nthe outstanding military service of a group of incredible Coloradans. \nThese World War II veterans each played a role in defending the world \nfrom tyranny, truly earning their reputation as the ``greatest \ngeneration'' through their service and sacrifice. Now, thanks to an \norganization dedicated to honoring these veterans for all they have \ndone for us, these great Coloradans came to Washington, DC, to visit \nthe National World War II Memorial, to share their experiences with \nlater generations and to pay tribute to those who gave their lives. It \nis an honor to have had them here, and I join with all Coloradans in \nthanking them for all they have done for us.\n  I also want to say a word about the volunteers from Honor Flight of \nSouthern Colorado who made this trip possible. They are great \nColoradans in their own right, and their mission to bring our southern \nColorado veterans to Washington, DC, is truly commendable. They have \nbeen doing great work since their inaugural flight in June 2012, this \nweek bringing another group of American heroes to Washington, DC. The \nvolunteers of Honor Flight of Southern Colorado believe our veteran \nheroes aren't asking for recognition, but they certainly deserve it. \nThis opportunity to come to Washington is just a small token of \nappreciation for those who gave so much.\n  I wish to publicly recognize the members of the Southern Colorado \nHonor Flight who visited their Nation's Capital, many seeing for the \nfirst time the memorials their Nation built as a tribute to their \nselfless service. These are the lucky veterans, the ones who came home. \nTheir war memorials also pay tribute to those who have paid the \nultimate price. Today I honor these Colorado veterans on their visit to \nWashington, DC:\n  From the U.S. Army: Adolph Wolff, Jack Traxler, Earl Clark, Leroy \nJensen, James Beham, and Sherwood Gray; from the U.S. Army Air Corps: \nHoward Casey and Will ``Lew'' Finlaynson; from the U.S. Navy: Raymond \nFeather, Howard Pease, Pete Demario, James Welty, and Clyde Womer; and \nfrom the U.S. Marine Corps: Jess Masias.\n  Our Nation asked a great deal of these individuals: to leave their \nfamilies to fight in unknown lands against a deadly enemy. And each of \nthese brave Coloradans bravely answered the call, placing themselves \nbetween this country and harm. They served our country through \ndangerous times, when democratic nations and ideals around the world \nwere threatened, and they saved entire continents from falling to \nfascism and tyranny.\n  Please join me in thanking these Colorado veterans and the volunteers \nof Honor Flight of Southern Colorado for their tremendous service to an \neternally grateful nation.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, we have all paused to remember our \nNation's veterans this week. This year, the Daniels Scholars wrote \nletters to our country's heroes in uniform. These letters, published in \nBecause of you . . . Letters of Gratitude from the 2012 Daniels \nScholars to the Defenders of American Freedom, are heartwarming.\n  The Daniels Scholarship Program was created by a true American \npatriot, Bill Daniels. Bill was awarded the Bronze Star for his service \nin the Navy in World War II. He was called back into service during the \nKorean War. Bill went on to have a tremendously successful career. Due \nto his generosity, young people from Wyoming, Utah, New Mexico, and \nColorado are selected to be Daniels Scholars. In addition to their \ncollege tuition and fees, they receive tremendous support and \nencouragement to give back to their communities.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe letter written by Megan Saylor from Casper, WY. May it inspire all \nwho read it.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Dear Soldier,\n       I would like to begin by thanking you from the bottom of my \n     heart for your military service to our country. I'm \n     struggling to find the appropriate words that can explain how \n     thankful I am, but the truth is, there are none. Because of \n     you, I am able to sit in this room and freely express my \n     thoughts and begin my path on to a bright future. You made \n     the sacrifice for me, and now it's my turn to return the \n     favor to you. I may not be able to repay you with what you \n     gave me, my freedom, but I can assure you that I will reach \n     for my dreams. I will be successful. I will make a \n     difference. As a 2012 Daniels Scholar, I will live my life \n     with integrity, honesty, loyalty, character, and I will \n     contribute and give back to my community. All too often, we \n     take for granted our rights and freedoms; we live in the best \n     country in the world and you made that possible. You and your \n     family. Actually, after listening to our speakers from the \n     military, meeting with my friend who just returned from \n     Afghanistan, and now writing this letter to you, my major \n     could be changing. Helping our country's soldiers would be \n     the ultimate way to return the favor. You are an amazing \n     person for what you did for our country. Just know wherever \n     you are, whatever struggle you are going through, just know \n     you aren't forgotten. I'll think about you constantly, \n     praying for you and those who are still fighting, and those \n     who will never return. Because of you, I am living a better \n     life, and I won't disappoint you, my country and my \n     community. Thank you again from the bottom of my heart. Never \n     give up!\n       Sending my highest regards, respect, and love, Megan \n     Saylor, Casper, Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/13/senate-section/article/S6731-1", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6731-S6732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING RUSSELL TRAIN\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise to briefly honor a distinguished \nformer Republican environmental and conservation leader. As my \ncolleagues know, Russell Train passed away on September 17.\n  Mr. Train was the first head of the Council on Environmental Quality \nunder President Nixon and the second EPA Administrator, serving under \nboth Presidents Nixon and Ford. He was the chairman emeritus of the \nWorld Wildlife Fund and helped found the organization in the 1960s. He \nfounded the African Wildlife Leadership Foundation in 1961 and was \npresident of the Conservation Foundation from 1965 to 1969.\n  He was a shining example of the age when the political parties \ncooperated on environmental protection, and Republicans even sometimes \nled the way forward. He implemented and defended the Clean Air Act and \nhelped protect the health and welfare of millions of Americans. In \nrecent years, he specifically criticized the modern Republican party's \nrejection of health and science-based decisionmaking, especially as \nrelated to EPA's authority to address climate change and carbon \npollution. In a 2010 interview, he stated that he had become a \nregistered Independent.\n  I hope that the Republican Party will soon return to the example of \nstatesmanship and good governance set by Russell Train. Our Nation has \nenormous environmental challenges, like\n\n[[Page S6732]]\n\nclimate change, that must be addressed in a bipartisan fashion.\n  If today's Republican Party leadership continues to keep its members' \nheads stuck in the sand on the matter of the manmade carbon pollution \nthat is contributing to record-setting drought, heat waves, floods, and \nother extreme weather in the United States and globally, they will bear \nthe greatest responsibility for the economic, ecosystem, and public \nhealth damages that will only accelerate and grow over time.\n  They would be wise instead to adopt Mr. Train's worthy counsel from \nhis memoir: ``Today, as a nation, we urgently need to develop the \npolitical will to overcome our avoidance of difficult environmental \ndecisions. The problems will only get worse, and we have a long way to \ngo.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/13/senate-section/article/S6732-1", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING SENATOR ARLEN SPECTER\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it was more than 40 years ago when two \nyoung prosecutors, one from the biggest city in Pennsylvania and one \nfrom a smaller town in rural Vermont, came together at an annual \nmeeting of the National District Attorneys Association in Philadelphia. \nLittle did Arlen Specter and I know then that we would spend 30 years \nworking together in the United States Senate, building on our bond as \nformer prosecutors, seeking to bridge the partisan divide, and striving \nto find common ground on some of the most contentious issues of our \ntime.\n  Arlen Specter's public service began during the Korean War. When \nelected to serve as Philadelphia's District Attorney, he led landmark \nprosecutions against public corruption and to rid his city's streets of \nsome of the country's most hardened criminals. He was a prosecutor's \nprosecutor.\n  Arlen Specter also was a Senator's Senator. He loved the \nConstitution, he loved and honored the institutions of our democracy, \nand he loved policymaking and the political process. As a Senator he \ntried to put the interests of the Nation and the Senate's special role \nin our system above partisanship while always representing and serving \nthe people of Pennsylvania. He believed in aggressive oversight of \ngovernment agencies, regardless of the administration's affiliation, \nfrom our bipartisan investigation of the shootout at Ruby Ridge, to the \npolitical firings of U.S. attorneys and the threats to civil liberties \nposed during the Bush administration. He reached across the aisle to \npartner with me to try to pass comprehensive asbestos legislation and \nwe joined to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act during the Bush \nadministration. He supported more transparency, in every branch of our \ngovernment, to ensure the American people knew what their government \nwas doing. He was a strong supporter of law enforcement and a vigorous \nand fair judicial system. And he joined with Tom Harkin to direct \nbillions of dollars to the National Institutes of Health and cancer \nresearch.\n  His work ethic and dedication were tested when he was first diagnosed \nwith an advanced form of Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2005. Through that \nordeal, Arlen kept his humor, his spirit, and his rigorous work \nschedule. He served as chairman of the Judiciary Committee in 2005 and \n2006. I was the ranking Democratic member of the committee during those \nyears and worked collaboratively to make my friend a success and \nensured that we treated him fairly. During those years and those that \nfollowed, when it was my turn to chair the committee and his to lead \nthe Republican members, we used to joke that we spoke to each other \nmore often than we spoke to our wives, Marcelle and Joan.\n  Arlen was a fighter. I never knew anyone who worked or fought harder. \nI think he hoped to fight through his disease one more time.\n  The history books will note that Arlen Specter was the longest-\nserving U.S. Senator in Pennsylvania history. History should remember \nArlen Specter as a person who tried to do what he thought was best for \nthe country and to challenge the ever more constricting litmus test of \npartisan politics. He represented Pennsylvania and served the Nation. \nLike the Republican Senators who have represented Vermont, Arlen is an \nexample to all senators, of any party. He will be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/13/senate-section/article/S6732-2", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6732-S6733]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING ROGER D. FISHER\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on August 25, 2012, the United States and \nthe world lost one of its most creative thinkers and problem solvers. \nRoger D. Fisher, Williston Professor of Law at Harvard University and \ncoauthor of ``Getting to Yes: Negotiating Without Giving In,'' the most \nwidely read book ever written on the subject, was 90 years old.\n  Roger Fisher was a pioneer and a giant in the field of negotiation. \nHe not only changed the way people think about dispute resolution, \ninspiring and mentoring countless students who have gone on to use his \nteachings in their own careers, he applied his theories to real-life \nconflicts from South America to the Middle East.\n  I had the good fortune to meet Roger and was struck by his affable \nmanner and big smile, his inquisitive mind, and, perhaps above all, his \nenthusiasm for devising creative ways to help others solve seemingly \nintractable problems and in doing so make the world a better place. No \nconflict was too big or too small. He had imaginative, thoughtful \napproaches to everything, from ending the Vietnam war to resolving an \nargument among siblings at the family dinner table.\n  Roger was a gifted advocate. He had a brilliant mind and an \nextraordinary ability to persuade. But, as others have said, ``he \ntaught that conflict was not simply a `zero-sum' game in which a fixed \npie is simply divided through haggling or threats.'' Rather, it was \nabout how one approaches the problem, recognizing the other side's \nneeds, understanding their interests, and in doing so maximizing \noutcomes for both sides. That was the genius of the ``without giving \nin'' part of ``Getting to Yes.'' While some might assume he meant \ngetting one's way at another's expense, Roger recognized that is rarely \npossible or desirable, and it is often not necessary for a good result. \nBut he also saw how lacking in the basic analytical and practical tools \nof negotiation most people are.\n  I often think of Roger when I see the House and Senate so polarized \nand incapable of the positive, creative thinking and compromise that \nare necessary to deal effectively with issues of importance to our \nconstituents, to the country, and to the world. ``Getting to Yes'' \nshould be mandatory reading for every Member of Congress. It contains \ninvaluable lessons for the job the American people sent us here to do.\n  I want to express my condolences to Roger's two sons, Elliot and \nPeter. Elliot Fisher lives in Vermont, is a respected physician at the \nDartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center and a leading voice for health \npolicy reform. Peter Fisher has had a distinguished career in finance, \nincluding at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and as an Under \nSecretary of the Treasury. I have no doubt they both have put to good \nuse the lessons of their father.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan obituary in the Economist about Roger Fisher.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            [Sept. 15, 2012]\n\n                              Roger Fisher\n\n\nRoger Fisher, lawyer, teacher and peacemaker, died on August 25th, aged \n                                   90\n\n       He might be an academic--40 years on the faculty of Harvard \n     Law School--but Roger Fisher was really a fixer. He would \n     relax by mending the plumbing, or laying brick terraces at \n     the summer house he loved in Martha's Vineyard. But that was \n     tiddler stuff. At breakfast he would scan the New York Times, \n     looking for bigger problems he could fix: arms control, \n     hostage-taking, the Middle East. Over dinner the conversation \n     would be sorting out Vietnam, or ending the war in El \n     Salvador. At his 80th birthday party, most other guests gone, \n     he was found deep in a discussion of peace between Arabs and \n     Israelis.\n       As long as there were disputes in the world and energy in \n     his body, he was going to help resolve them. If it needed a \n     letter to a head of state, he would send it. If it needed him \n     on the next flight to Moscow or Tokyo, he would catch it. \n     People didn't have to invite him in. He would go anyway, \n     tall, slim and smiling, and slip into action behind the \n     scenes. With that sunny confidence he always had, he knew he \n     could make the world better. And so did others: J.K. \n     Galbraith remarked that if he knew Mr. Fisher was on to a \n     problem, it always eased his conscience.\n       Mr. Fisher had a system. He outlined it with William Ury in \n     his book ``Getting to\n\n[[Page S6733]]\n\n     Yes'' (1981), which sold 3 million copies; he also taught it \n     to students, especially, from 1979, through his Harvard \n     Negotiation Project. Like all good tools, it got better with \n     use. In any negotiation, he wrote--even with terrorists--it \n     was vital to separate the people from the problem; to focus \n     on the underlying interests of both sides, rather than stake \n     out unwavering positions; and to explore all possible options \n     before making a decision. The parties should try to build a \n     rapport, check each other out, even just by shaking hands or \n     eating together. Each should ``listen actively'', as he \n     always did, to what the other was saying. They should \n     recognise the emotions on either side, from a longing for \n     security to a craving for status. And they should try to get \n     inside each other's heads.\n       That was the theory, and Mr. Fisher delighted to put it \n     into practice. At the Geneva summit of 1985, for example, \n     Ronald Reagan on his advice did not confront Mikhail \n     Gorbachev, but sat by a roaring fire with him while they \n     exchanged ideas. More summits followed. A border war between \n     Peru and Ecuador was nipped in the bud when Mr. Fisher \n     advised the president of Ecuador (once a pupil of his) to sit \n     on a sofa with the Peruvian president, and look at a map with \n     him. Interviewing President Nasser of Egypt in 1970, Mr. \n     Fisher asked him how Golda Meir, then Israel's prime \n     minister, would be regarded at home if she agreed to all his \n     demands. ``Boy, would she have a problem!'' Nasser laughed. \n     He then grew thoughtful, having briefly seen their dispute \n     from her point of view.\n       The Middle East, which caused him personal grief, also \n     brought his most public success. His principles were used all \n     through the Camp David negotiations of 1978, from the \n     brainstorming over Jimmy Carter's draft of an agreement (23 \n     rewrites) to the moment when Mr. Carter presented Menachem \n     Begin, the Israeli leader, with signed pictures dedicated, by \n     name, to each of Begin's grandchildren. Deeply affected, \n     Begin began to talk about his family. The accords were signed \n     that day.\n       He had his failures. As a Pentagon adviser in the 1960s he \n     suggested several ``yesable propositions'' to put to the \n     North Vietnamese; Robert McNamara listened, but not the \n     military brass. In 1967 he had fun trying to nurse the tiny, \n     dusty island of Anguilla to independent statehood, but the \n     experiment was overturned. South Africa possibly satisfied \n     him most: the Afrikaner cabinet and ANC officials, trained \n     separately by him in negotiation workshops, agreeing to end \n     apartheid without resorting to violence.\n\n\n                         Lessons from the souk\n\n       Mr. Fisher's motivation was as clear as his writing. He \n     hated war. His own service had been as a weather \n     reconnaissance officer; in the course of it he had lost his \n     roommate and many college friends. He had also flown often \n     over Japan, harmless morning flights which the Japanese, pre-\n     Hiroshima, had fatally learned to ignore. All those deaths \n     weighed on him.\n       More light-heartedly, he grew up as one of six children, \n     preferring to strike bargains rather than land a punch. Later \n     on, still bargain-minded, he would stroll the souks of \n     Damascus or Jerusalem, looking to expand his collection of \n     ancient weights. Every one of those pieces represented a \n     tough negotiation successfully concluded. For those who found \n     his principles too idealistic, he could point to age-old \n     haggling tricks he also recommended: pretending not to be \n     interested, refusing to react to pressure, being prepared to \n     walk away.\n       His most pleasing bargain, though, was the one he made to \n     get his lot on the Vineyard. There he built a glass and \n     shingle house right between the pounding ocean and Watcha \n     Pond, where ospreys nested. When he first found the place, \n     the owner refused to part with the few acres he needed. He \n     would sell him only the whole property, 60 acres or so, which \n     cost too much. But Mr. Fisher called in friends, they all \n     clubbed together, the deal was agreed; and he spent 50 \n     glorious summers there, in just the sort of sweet, wise, \n     negotiated peace he always wished for the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/13/senate-section/article/S6733-1", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6733]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REQUEST FOR CONSULTATION\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask consent that the following letter be \nprinted in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                                November 13, 2012,\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Senate Minority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: I am requesting that I be consulted \n     before the Senate enters into any unanimous consent \n     agreements or time limitations regarding H.R. 6062, Edward \n     Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program \n     Reauthorization Act of 2012.\n       I support the goals of this legislation and believe state \n     and local law enforcement agencies are a vital part of the \n     criminal justice system in this country. However, I believe \n     the responsibility to support, fund, and hold accountable \n     state and local law enforcement agencies lies with the states \n     and local communities these brave law enforcement officers \n     serve. Furthermore, while I do not believe this issue is the \n     responsibility of the federal government; if Congress does \n     act, we can and must do so in a fiscally responsible manner. \n     My concerns are included in, but not limited to, those \n     outlined in this letter.\n\n  While this bill is well-intentioned, it could cost the American \npeople approximately $800 million per year for 5 years without \ncorresponding offsets, totaling $4 billion. Furthermore, with the \nexception of the extra stimulus funding in 2009 through the American \nRecovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), the Byrne Justice Assistance \nGrant Program (JAG) has never received funding at the level authorized \nin this legislation. According to the Congressional Research Service \n(CRS), JAG funding has averaged $461 million per year since its first \nappropriation in FY 2005, and appropriations have actually been \ntrending downward since that time. Without including the 2009 ARRA \nfunding, the most Congress has ever appropriated to Byrne JAG in a \nsingle year is $546 million in FY 2009. I recognize this legislation \nreduces the overall authorization for the Byrne JAG program; however, I \ndo not believe this reduction is sufficient to address the growing \nfederal spending problem in this country.\n\n       It is irresponsible for Congress to jeopardize the future \n     standard of living of our children by borrowing from future \n     generations. The U.S. national debt is now over $16 trillion. \n     That means over $51,000 in debt for each man, woman and child \n     in the United States. A year ago, the national debt was $14.7 \n     trillion. Despite pledges to control spending, Washington \n     adds billions to the national debt every single day. In just \n     one year, our national debt has grown by $19 trillion or \n     8.8%.\n       In addition to these fiscal concerns, there are several \n     problems specific to this legislation. First, the Byrne JAG \n     program duplicates other sources of federal funding. State \n     and local governments can use Byrne JAG funds for projects in \n     seven different purpose areas: (1) law enforcement programs; \n     (2) prosecution and court programs; (3) prevention and \n     education programs; (4) corrections and community corrections \n     programs; (5) drug treatment programs; (6) planning, \n     evaluation, and technology improvement programs; and (7) \n     crime victim and witness programs. Several of these broad \n     purpose areas are already covered by other federal grant \n     programs including Community Oriented Policing Services \n     (COPS), Second Chance Act grants, drug and mental health \n     court grants, and the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant program, \n     among others.\n\n  Second, Congress, particularly the Senate, has not performed \nsufficient oversight of the Byrne JAG program to justify its \nreauthorization at this time. Before reauthorizing this or any program, \nCongress should perform oversight to determine how a grant program is \nperforming, evaluate how grantees use federal funds, measure the \nresults of the program, and analyze whether there are other federal \nprograms funding the same purposes. In my federal deficit reduction \nplan, Back in Black, I noted that critics on the right and left, along \nwith the Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General, agree \nByrne JAG experiences waste, fraud, and abuse in a variety of ways and \nshould be reformed. Thus, I do not believe Congress should blindly \nreauthorize this program without oversight through a detailed review of \nits policies and practices.\n\n       Finally, I do not believe the federal government has the \n     authority under the Constitution to provide federal funds to \n     state and local governments for use on state and local \n     criminal justice systems. Article I, Section 8 of the \n     Constitution enumerates the limited powers of Congress, and \n     nowhere are we tasked with funding or becoming involved with \n     state and local criminal issues.\n\n  There is no question state and local law enforcement play a vital \nrole in maintaining order and safety in many communities. However, I \nbelieve this issue is the responsibility of the states and not the \nfederal government. Despite these constitutional limitations, if \nCongress does act in this area we should evaluate the program as most \nAmerican individuals and companies must do with their own resources; we \nshould review current programs, determine any needs that may exist, and \nprioritize those needs for funding by cutting from the federal budget \nprograms fraught with waste, fraud, abuse, and duplication.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Tom A.

Mr. President, on Oct. 27, many of my fellow Michiganians \ngathered to recognize an event of enormous historical and cultural \nsignificance to our State: the 150th anniversary of Congregation \nShaarey Zedek in the City of Southfield, just outside my hometown of \nDetroit.\n  For a century and a half, from its humble beginnings in Detroit to \nits emergence as one of the most important and influential institutions \nin the American Jewish community, Shaarey Zedek has played a vital \nrole, not just for Michigan Jews, but for the community at large. Even \nmore important than its high profile events with high-level speakers \nand guests is Shaarey Zedek's 150 years of day-in, day-out service to \nfaith, community and humanity.\n  Shaarey Zedek has played a vital role in Jewish cultural and \npolitical life. It is no coincidence that, as the threat of Nazi \nGermany rose, Shaarey Zedek hosted one of the most important meetings \nof American Jews in the May of 1938, warning Americans about Hitler's \nthreat to European Jews and to international security and strongly \nadvocating for Jewish emigration to Palestine to escape Hitler's \nclutches. And in later years, Shaarey Zedek was one of America's \nleading voices in support of oppressed Jews in the Soviet Union.\n  It was Shaarey Zedek where Detroit Tigers slugger Hank Greenberg \nattended services on Yom Kippur of 1934, in the midst of the American \nLeague pennant race, receiving a standing ovation from the \ncongregation, serving as a powerful symbol of Jewish identity, and, as \nhe later put it in his autobiography, pleasing his relieved parents.\n  Like any religious institution, Shaarey Zedek has first and foremost \nbeen a touchstone of faith. Congregation Shaarey Zedek is one of \nAmerica's most respected synagogues.\n  Of particular importance to me is the congregation's longstanding \ndedication to tolerance, not just in matters of faith, but in all \nmatters of conscience. At times of strife and conflict in Michigan and \nthe Nation, and in the face of discrimination or oppression, Shaarey \nZedek has consistently served as a voice of reason, peace, \nunderstanding and equality.\n  So this anniversary is important to the Jewish community, and the \nlarger community. But it also means a lot to me personally. \nCongregation Shaarey Zedek is where my brother and I were bar \nmitzvahed. It is the spiritual home of many who are dear to me, and to \nthe community of which I am a proud member.

In the past 10 years he has proven his commitment to \nkeeping Arkansans safe. I have worked with Sheriff Ferguson and other \ncommunity leaders during the institution of the 287(g) Program with \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement, commonly known as ICE. This local, \nState, and Federal cooperation has played a key role in combating \nillegal immigration in Northwest Arkansas.\n  Keith also helped create a child internet pornography investigation \nunit to help keep our children safe and has championed the use of \ninmate labor to help the county through programs such as Habitat for \nHumanity and the Northwest Arkansas Food Bank.\n  As sheriff of Benton County, he has improved outreach to children and \nthe elderly and efficiency in the office with upgraded technology and \nimproved equipment and employee training.\n  Keith's commitment to safety has been recognized at the State level, \nearning the Arkansas State Police Commendation Award for his heroics in \napprehending a suspect and the Northwest Community Valor Award for his \nrole in capturing three prison escapees.\n  I congratulate Sheriff Keith Ferguson for his outstanding \nachievements and success in law enforcement, and I ask my colleagues to \njoin me in honoring him on his retirement. I wish him continued success \nin his future endeavors. Benton County is a better place to live thanks \nto his years of service and leadership to Arkansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/13/senate-section/article/S6734-3", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6734-S6735]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING THOMPSON-MARKWARD HALL\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \n125th anniversary of Thompson-Markward Hall, formerly known as the \nYoung Women's Christian Home. Thompson-Markward Hall is located on \nCapitol Hill, directly across from the Senate Hart Building, and has \nlong served as a temporary home for young women studying or working in \nour Nation's Capital, including many who have interned or worked in \ncongressional offices.\n  Thompson-Markward Hall was founded in 1833 by Mary G. Wilkinson. \nWilkinson, who was grieving the death of her daughter, recognized the \nneed to create a safe housing option for young women moving to \nWashington seeking employment, and he began housing two young women in \nher Capitol Hill home. The need for additional space soon led to the \nsecuring of a new location at Fifth Street, NW, where the early years \nof the home were funded through the generosity and hard work of \nWilkinson, her friends, benevolent merchants, and other community \nmembers.\n  In 1887, the Young Woman's Christian Home was chartered by Congress \nand incorporated to provide temporary housing for young women coming to\n\n[[Page S6735]]\n\nthe District of Columbia. The assistance Congress provided to this home \nduring its early years stands today as a strong example of ways \nCongress can show support and lend short-term assistance to help an \norganization get its legs. By 1906, the trustees believed the home \ncould manage without Federal assistance, and the congressional \nappropriation was discontinued Today the home remains a self-sustaining \norganization funded through endowments and residents.\n  Today, Thompson-Markward Hall also remains, true to its founding \nprinciples, a safe, comfortable, moderately-priced place for young \nwomen to live when studying or establishing careers in Washington. \nRetaining the spirit of Mary G. Wilkinson's founding intentions, \nThompson-Markward Hall has earned a reputation as a special place for \nits residents, helping equip them with a strong foundation for \ndeveloping lifelong friendships and fostering a deep regard for \nWashington, DC, and the opportunities the city offers.\n  As Thompson-Markward Hall celebrates another important milestone in \nits history, it is important that we recognize and congratulate this \norganization and especially the many talented individuals who have \nworked hard and given of their time and talents to help found this \nresidence and now work to maintain and further its rich legacy. It is \nthe efforts of all of these individuals, and especially Mar G. \nWilkinson, Bessie J. Kibbey, Flora Markward Thompson, and past and \npresent. Board of Trustee members and staff, who have helped make \nThompson-Markward Hall a wonderful housing option for thousands of \nyoung women.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/13/senate-section/article/S6735-1", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6735]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RECOGNIZING TEXAS CENTER FOR SUPERCONDUCTIVITY\n\n Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, today, the Texas Center for \nSuperconductivity at the University of Houston (TCSUH) commemorates 25 \nyears of achievements following the discovery of the High Temperature \nSuperconductor YBCO by Dr. Paul C. W. Chu and colleagues in 1987 and \nthe establishment the Center by the State of Texas.\n  With ongoing support from the State, the Center has continued to grow \nin size and in the breadth of its programs which include basic and \napplied research, technology development and transfer and advanced \neducation and training. TCSUH maintains an infrastructure that supports \nthe interdisciplinary research and education that is necessary to \nadvance new fields and accelerate scientific discovery.\n  I am intensely committed to investing in science and research and \nTexas' place at the top of that ladder. In 2004, I worked to create \nTAMEST The Academy of Medicine, Engineering and Science of Texas a \nvehicle for Texas institutions to share knowledge and research, to know \nwhat others in the scientific fields were working on. Today, with \nbetter information sharing, Texas has gone from sixth to third as a \nrecipient of Federal research funding.\n  Science and technology are critical to the future growth and \nprosperity of our country. America must continue to prioritize \nscientific research and technological development that fuels our \neconomy, creates jobs, improves health care and helps to promote our \nnational security and global leadership.\n  This is incredibly important to both Texas and America. Since World \nWar II, more than half of US economic growth can be attributed to \ntechnological innovation; part of this is a direct result of Federal \ninvestment in science and technology.\n  Texas' world-class research institutions and university-based \ninnovation centers like TCSUH bring new technology and research \ntogether with savvy entrepreneurs, creating new businesses and, most \nimportant, creating jobs.\n  TCSUH contributes to the goals of strengthening the prominence of \nTexas as a national research leader by attracting top quality \nresearchers to the State, educating the next generation of scientists \nand engineers, and building links with industry to commercialize new \ntechnologies and create quality jobs.\n  I congratulate Dr. Chu and his colleagues at TCSUH on this important \noccasion and extend my best wishes to all for many more years of \ncontinued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/13/senate-section/article/S6735-2", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6735]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                25TH ANNIVERSARY OF DAKOTA RURAL ACTION\n\n Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, today I wish to \ncommemorate the 25th anniversary of Dakota Rural Action. I am proud to \nhonor the members and stakeholders involved in Dakota Rural Action and \nextend my congratulations to them on this memorable occasion.\n  Dakota Rural Action is a local, grassroots organization that exhibits \nleadership through community organizing. They strive to give South \nDakotans a strong voice by working with local, State, and Federal \nGovernment officials on issues and decisions involving family \nagriculture, conservation, and overall quality of life. The members of \nDRA were also early vocal advocates of my Country-of-Origin Labeling, \nCOOL, law, which has enabled consumers to access information about \nwhere their food is coming from and enabled producers to get a better \nprice for their products.\n  The Dakota Rural Action organization started in 1985 as a steering \ncommittee called the South Dakota Rural Organizing Project. The \ncommittee was tasked with finding substantive and effective ways to \norganize citizens on a grassroots level, largely due to the farm crisis \nof the late 1980s. When the need for a more sustained, long-term \norganization became evident, Dakota Rural Action was formally created. \nThe founding members wanted to create a nonprofit, nonpartisan, \ncommunity-driven organization that focused on the causes and larger \nissues affecting rural America, rather than just the effects of the \nfarm crisis. On January 10, 1987, Dakota Rural Action held its first \nmeeting in Brookings, SD, to adopt bylaws and an organizational \nstructure, set membership dues, and to establish an issue platform.\n  Today, Dakota Rural Action remains a vibrant, statewide network of \nsix chapters. They celebrated their 25th anniversary at their annual \nmeeting in Brookings, SD on November 9 and 10, 2012. It is a great \nprivilege for me to recognize Dakota Rural Action's 25 years of service \nto South Dakotans, as well as their continuing commitment to the issues \nand causes that affect South Dakota and rural areas across the \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/13/senate-section/article/S6735-3", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6735]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MIKE MODRICK\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I recognize Mike Modrick of \nRapid City, SD. Mike, a recognized television personality in western \nSouth Dakota, is celebrating 25 years on October 26, 2012, as a \nmeteorologist at KOTA Territory News and 30 years in weather \nforecasting. Mike is a graduate of Iowa State University with a \nbachelor of science degree in meteorology and a degree in speech. \nShortly after graduating, Mike made his way to the beautiful, yet \nmarkedly unpredictable climate of western South Dakota where he has \nprovided important safety and weather communications to the people of \nSouth Dakota for 25 years.\n  Mike has received the Seal of Approval for Television Weathercasting \nfrom the American Meteorological Society, which is considered the most \nprestigious award in weather broadcasting. His dedication to timely, \nreliable forecasting across western South Dakota is indicative of his \npassion and commitment to the safety of all South Dakotans. As Mike \ncelebrates his silver anniversary with KOTA, it is my pleasure to thank \nhim for his service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/13/senate-section/article/S6735-4", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6735-S6736]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DR. DUANE MEYER\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Dr. Duane \nMeyer, historian, educator, author, former university president and my \nfriend. Fittingly, the Greene County Historical Society honored Dr. \nMeyer in October with its Life Time Achievement Award for his body of \nwork enriching Missouri's educational, historical and cultural life.\n  Dr. Meyer, through his dedication, is recognized as one of Missouri's \nmost distinguished historians. Dr. Meyer served as a teacher for 18 \nyears and as an administrator for 22 years (1971-1983 as president of \nwhat is today Missouri State University). He arrived in Springfield in \n1955 with a Ph.D. from the University of Iowa. Dr. Meyer began his \ncareer as an assistant professor of history and later became a\n\n[[Page S6736]]\n\nfull professor of history. By 1961 he was dean of facilities for what \nwas then Southwest Missouri State College. Ten years later Dr. Meyer \nwas selected as the sixth president of Southwest Missouri State \nCollege, which earned university status in 1972.\n  During his 12 years at the helm of Southwest Missouri State \nUniversity, enrollment increased to an all-time high (62 percent), \nmaking it the second largest 4-year public institution of higher \nlearning in Missouri. Southwest Missouri State University was \ntransformed with the creation of an academic master plan, including a \nnew business school, construction of a student event center and \nelevation of the athletic program to NCAA Division I competition. \nAcademic achievements included new specialist degrees for graduate \nprograms, new associate degrees for undergraduate students and \ncooperative education. Students were also given the opportunity to have \nlearning experiences abroad. Faculty research was encouraged and \nresearch and service centers took form at Southwest Missouri State \nUniversity during Dr. Meyer's tenure as president.\n  As the academic landscape changed, so did the look of the campus. The \ncampus expanded to 125 acres, the first public-private building--\nHammons Student Center--was constructed along with three new classroom \nbuildings and four new residence halls. During that period, Southwest \nMissouri State University added the State Fruit Experiment Station in \nMountain Grove and a new campus in West Plains, Missouri. In \nrecognition of his contributions, Southwest Missouri State University \nhonored Dr. Meyer by naming the school's new library after him.\n  After leaving the president's office, Dr. Meyer continued to teach as \na professor emeritus of history. He also served as a member on the \nMissouri Council of Public Higher Education Board and on the Missouri \nHumanities Council. Dr. Meyer's research has produced two text books, \nincluding The Heritage of Missouri: A History, which serves as a \nvaluable reference for students learning about Missouri history.\n  Dr. Meyer's leadership and dedication to excellence have reshaped one \nof the region's great universities and benefited countless students who \nhave passed through its halls. Congratulations to Dr. Meyer for \nenhancing our understanding of Missouri history and making it available \nfor future generations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/13/senate-section/article/S6736-1", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6736]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/13/senate-section/article/S6736-2", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6736]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/13/senate-section/article/S6736-3", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6736-S6737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n\n               Enrolled Bills and Joint Resolution Signed\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 5, 2011, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on September 25, 2012, during the \nadjournment of the Senate, received a message from the House of \nRepresentatives announcing that the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Lewis of \nCalifornia) has signed the following enrolled bills and joint \nresolution:\n\n       S. 300.
