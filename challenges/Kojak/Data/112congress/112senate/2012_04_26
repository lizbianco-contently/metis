Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of S. 1925, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows.\n\n       A bill (S. 1925) to reauthorize the Violence Against Women \n     Act of 1994.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                       Guest Chaplain Joel Osteen\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. It is my pleasure to be able to introduce our guest \nChaplain, Joel Osteen, pastor of Lakewood Church in Houston. He is a \nnative Texan and attended Oral Roberts University in Tulsa, OK.\n  For 17 years, Pastor Osteen worked behind the scenes for his father \nJohn, who founded Lakewood Church in 1959.\n  In 1999, after his father passed away, Pastor Osteen accepted God's \ncall to service in the church and took over the reins as senior pastor, \ndespite having only preached once in his life.\n  It was soon clear that this new, young preacher had a natural gift \nfor speaking and was able to personally connect with diverse audiences \nwith the inspirational message of God's love. Since that time, he and \nhis wife and copastor Victoria have led Lakewood through extraordinary \ngrowth.\n  In 2005, the Osteens moved Lakewood Church from its original home in \nnortheast Houston to the former home of the Houston Rockets basketball \nteam. With this space, Pastor Osteen now delivers a message of hope and \nencouragement to 38,000 people a week, with millions more across the \ncountry tuning in on their televisions.\n  Pastor Osteen has reached millions more as a best-selling author. His \nfirst book, ``Your Best Life Now,'' was released in 2004 and remained \non the New York Times bestseller list for 2 years.\n  His most recent book, ``Every Day a Friday,'' offers commonsense \nadvice on how to be happy by applying the principles of God's word to \nyour daily life. Pastor Osteen has spoken throughout the world, and \nthat is what brings him to the Capitol today.\n  On Saturday the Osteens will lead thousands in what is billed as ``a \nnight of hope'' at Nationals Park in Washington. That message of hope \nand encouragement is what has attracted me and my family to watch \nPastor Osteen on Sunday morning. I have been to his church. He welcomed \nme and my daughter, Bailey--whose 11th birthday is today--at Lakewood \nChurch 2 years ago, and I got to see this awesome\n\n[[Page S2746]]\n\nplace that he fills every single Sunday--sometimes more than the \nHouston Rockets ever did, I have to say.\n  I do want to say that the Chaplain of the Senate, Dr. Barry Black, \nwho works with us every week in the Senate, with all of our staffs, was \nwonderful to help in assisting to bring Pastor Osteen to the podium to \nopen our Senate this morning. It is a wonderful Senate tradition that \nwe start our day by thanking God for this wonderful world and also \nremembering the mantle of leadership and responsibility that is on our \nshoulders and trying to do the very best we can with that message.\n  Again, I thank Pastor Osteen and his wife Victoria, who are wonderful \npeople whom I have gotten to know through the years. They have inspired \nso many of us in our travails of life.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Majority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senate is now considering S. 1925, with \nthe time until 11:30 for debate only. The Republicans will control the \nfirst 45 minutes and the majority will control the second 45 minutes.\n  At 11:30 today the Senate will proceed to executive session to \nconsider the Costa and Guaderrama nominations, both nominated to be \nU.S. district judges for Texas. At noon there will be two votes on the \nconfirmation of these nominations.\n  Senator McConnell and I are trying to work through a way to proceed \non the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act. I hope to be able to \nhave some announcement around 2 o'clock.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Senate is now debating the Violence \nAgainst Women Act.\n  We began debate on this legislation by consent, and we would like to \ncomplete action on this legislation also by consent. We have been \nworking to enter into an efficient consent agreement with only a couple \nof relevant amendments and with very short time agreements for \nprocessing them.\n  This approach is in keeping with how Republicans have handled VAWA in \nthe past. This approach would also allow us to complete the bill today. \nThese relevant amendments would give the Senate the opportunity to \nstrengthen the law, especially in terms of the punishment for those who \ncommit violence against women.\n  As my friend, the majority leader, noted yesterday, a good way to \nlower the incidence of violent crime is to incarcerate those who commit \nit. We could not agree more. We would like the chance to improve the \nlaw in that respect.\n\n\n                       Honoring our Armed Forces\n\n                        Captain Daniel H. Utley\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise this morning to acknowledge the \nloss of an American hero and patriot. It is my sad duty today to report \nto my colleagues that Kentucky has lost one of our finest heroes in \nuniform. This particular loss is very personal to me, as I knew this \noutstanding young man very well.\n  CPT Daniel H. Utley of the U.S. Army was killed in the North African \ncountry of Mali just a few days ago, on April 20, 2012, while on a \ntraining mission to help the local citizens combat terrorism. Dan was \n33 years old.\n  For his service to our country, Captain Utley received many medals, \nawards, and decorations, including the Bronze Star Medal, the Defense \nMeritorious Service Medal, the Army Commendation Medal, the Joint \nService Achievement Medal, the Army Achievement Medal, the Joint \nMeritorious Unit Award, the National Defense Service Medal, the \nAfghanistan Campaign Medal with Combat Star, the Global War on \nTerrorism Expeditionary Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service \nMedal, the Korean Defense Service Medal, the Army Service Ribbon, the \nOverseas Service Ribbon, and the NATO Medal. Captain Utley also \nreceived the Basic Parachutist Badge and his Thailand Jump Wings.\n  Charley Utley, Dan's Father said:\n\n       He was a great young man; he was a great son. He always put \n     other people ahead of himself. He did an outstanding job \n     while he was there. He loved being in the Army. He enjoyed \n     what he was doing, and he really thought he was making a \n     difference.\n\n  It goes without saying that every man and woman in our Armed Forces \nis an American of special fortitude and character. But I can personally \ntestify to that truth on behalf of Dan Utley. At my alma mater, the \nUniversity of Louisville, I was glad to have begun the McConnell \nScholars Program, a rigorous and prestigious scholarship program for \nthe finest students in Kentucky that prepares them for a lifetime of \nleadership and service. Dan was one of the best McConnell Scholars to \never grace the program.\n  I could not agree more with my good friend, Dr. Gary Gregg, the \ndirector of the McConnell Scholars Program, who said of Dan's loss: \n``America has lost a rising star.''\n  Dan was born in Bowling Green, KY, on April 13, 1979. He was raised \nin Glasgow, KY, and he went to Glasgow High School where he played \nsoccer and was a member of the academic team. He was also a member of \nGlasgow's First Christian Church.\n  Dan had a lot of hobbies, but most of them had one thing in common: \nThey did not take place inside four walls or under a roof. ``He loved \nthe outdoors,'' remembers Dan's father, Charlie. ``He loved camping, \nhiking, biking, jumping out of airplanes, canoeing, kayaking--anything \nto do with the outdoors.''\n\n  Dan graduated from high school in 1997, and he was awarded a \nMcConnell scholarship to attend the University of Louisville.\n  Dr. Gregg said:\n\n       Dan was a workhorse of a McConnell Scholar. There are \n     people who serve for title and glory; Dan was a young man who \n     served in order to serve. When he was an undergraduate, he \n     would volunteer for any cause that came along. He was always \n     trying to help out the underdog. His heart was always bigger \n     than his ego; his compassion for others always outshone his \n     ambition for self. His life was no different in the U.S. \n     Army--what he loved most was serving others in need.\n\n  I got to know Dan very well during his time in college, and I came to \nappreciate what a remarkable young man he was. He was extremely smart. \nHe was also one of the most popular students in the program.\n  Dan spent one semester in college working in the Kentucky State \nLegislature, helping to write bills and assisting State senators and \nrepresentatives with whatever they needed. Dan graduated from the \nUniversity of Louisville in 2001 with a bachelor's degree with honors \nin political science. After college, for a time, he enrolled in law \nschool but soon decided, because of his desire to serve, that his path \nto fulfillment lay in military service.\n  When I first met Dan, a military career was certainly not at all what \nI would have expected him to do. But it just goes to show the growth \nand maturity this young man achieved in such a very short time.\n  ``He was in law school, but after 9/11, he wanted to do something,'' \nsays Charlie Utley. ``He was miserable in law school because he wanted \nto do something for his country.''\n  Dan's friend and fellow McConnell Scholar, Connie Wilkinson-Tobbe, \nagrees and this is what she said:\n\n       Dan was ready to live life, and he was probably smarter \n     than everybody sitting in [law school]. That was not \n     stimulating enough for him, and he was ready to do great \n     things.\n\n  So in 2003, Dan joined the Army and went through OCS. In almost a \ndecade of Army service, Captain Utley served in many posts, all of them \nchallenging and proof of his skill and talent. He was stationed or \ndeployed in South Korea for 24 months, in Kuwait for 12 months, in \nAfghanistan for 13 months, and his final deployment in Mali lasted 7 \nmonths.\n  He served in capacities such as tactical communications platoon \nleader, operations officer while in Kuwait, aide-de-camp for a general \nin the 160th Signal Brigade, and brigade civil affairs officer in the \n101st Airborne. After successfully completing a civil affairs \nqualifications course, Dan was assigned to F Company, 91st Civil \nAffairs Battalion, (Airborne), as a team leader.\n  Let me quote again from Dr. Gregg.\n\n       I particularly remember when he called and told me he was \n     being made an aide-de-camp and was going to get a new \n     shoulder holster as part of his job protecting the general he \n     served. It was a position of great honor and he was humbled \n     to have been chosen, but he wanted to talk most about his \n     cool new side arm!\n\n\n[[Page S2747]]\n\n\n  Earlier this year, the news magazine for the U.S. Agency for \nInternational Development--Frontlines--published an article about \nAmerica's efforts to combat instability in Mali, one of the poorest \ncountries in the world. The article stated:\n\n       ``The presence of the terrorist group al-Qaida in the \n     Islamic Maghreb, which has its roots in the Algerian Civil \n     War, now poses a threat of violent extremism'' in the \n     country.\n\n  That is why the U.S. Army, and specifically Captain Utley, was in \nMali in the first place. As a team member of the Department of \nDefense's Civil Military Support Element, Captain Utley was quoted in \nthis article on the valiant work he and his fellow soldiers were doing \njust a few months before his tragic death.\n  In September 2004, Dan married Katie, also an Army officer. They had \ntheir wedding in Hawaii. Katie was commissioned through the ROTC \nProgram at the University of Georgia, and is now a captain in the Army \nwith the 82nd Airborne, based out of Fort Bragg, NC.\n  We are thinking of CPT Dan Utley's loved ones today, especially his \nwife, CPT Katie M. Utley; his father, Charles L. Utley; his mother, \nLinda H. Utley; his brother and sister-in-law, Charles L. Utley, II, \nand Maria; his brother and sister-in-law, Matthew R. Utley and \nMichelle; his nephews, Matthew Ryan Utley and Mason Robert Utley; his \nniece, Marleigh Rose Utley; his maternal grandmother, Pauline Haynes; \nhis parents-in-law, Chris and Peggy Michael; his brother-in-law, \nMatthew Michael; and many other beloved family members and friends.\n  I also know for a fact many faculty members of the University of \nLouisville, staff members for the McConnell Center, and current and \nformer McConnell scholars will dearly miss Dan. I certainly will.\n  I had the honor of watching Dan grow from a teenager to a brave and \nvirtuous man who willingly sacrificed everything to defend his friends \nand his family and his country. Elaine and I extend our deepest \nsympathies to all who knew and loved him, and I would ask my Senate \ncolleagues to join me in expressing our respect and gratitude to this \nfine young man, CPT Daniel H. Utley. Let our work here today serve to \nensure our country never forgets the duty he fulfilled by putting on \nthe uniform--or the great sacrifice he made in a country many of us \ncould not even find on a map in order to protect our freedoms here at \nhome.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 11:30 a.m. will be for debate only and will be equally divided \nbetween the two leaders or their designees, with the Republicans \ncontrolling the first 45 minutes and the majority controlling the \nsecond 45 minutes.\n  The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I want to express my appreciation to the \nRepublican leader for his remarks about Captain Utley. I have had the \nhonor to talk with McConnell scholars on a number of occasions from \nLouisville. They are such a fine group of people, and I know how deeply \nour leader feels this loss. I certainly will join him in my expressions \nto the family.\n  I recall General Myers, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nwhen someone suggested soldiers who were injured or lost their lives \nwere victims, saying they are not victims, they are heroes. They \ncommitted themselves to serving their country. They believe our country \nis worthy of defense and they are willing to put their lives on the \nline for it, and they are heroes. And certainly this captain was.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to thank my friend from Alabama \nfor his kind remarks about this brave young man.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the leader.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, this Sunday, April 29, in a few days, \nwill mark the third anniversary of the last time the Democratic-led \nSenate has passed a budget. Since that date, our Nation has spent $10.4 \ntrillion while adding $4.5 trillion to the national debt. And that is \nhow it is that we say nearly 40 cents of every dollar we are spending \nnow is borrowed.\n  We have accumulated $10.4 trillion in spending over these years since \nwe have had a budget and we have added $4.5 trillion to the debt. We \nare in our fourth consecutive year of trillion-dollar-plus deficits and \nheading into the fifth year. Prior to these 4 years, the largest \ndeficit we ever had was about $480 billion. We have more than doubled \nthat every year since.\n  It is a systemic problem--and not a little problem. The economy \ncoming back would help, no doubt, but it will not put us on a sound \npath. We have to make some choices. Every person in America now owes, \nas their share of the national debt, $45,000--every American. Every \nman, woman, and child is carrying that amount as their burden as a \nresult of the overspending of this Congress.\n  For perspective--and we need perspective because the numbers are \noften hard to grasp--that per-person number is larger than any of the \nrest of the world, including Greece. Our per-person debt is greater \nthan the per-person debt of Greece. Yet at this time of financial \ncrisis, the majority in the Senate refuses to perform its legally \nrequired duty and moral responsibility to produce a budget plan, which \nis part of the United States Code dating back to 1974 under the \nCongressional Budget Act. And a budget requires, as under that Act, \nonly 51 votes to pass. It cannot be filibustered. It is given a \npriority.\n  In 1974, Congress was obviously disappointed that we were not moving \nforward effectively with budgets, and a budget is crucial to the \nfinancial stability of a nation. That is why they passed the \nCongressional Budget Act and ensured that a budget cannot be \nfilibustered in the Senate. It is guaranteed a right to have a vote. It \nis required to be brought up in committee by April 1 and moved forward \nby April 15. That is what the statute requires. Unfortunately, it \ndoesn't require that Congress go to jail if it doesn't pass a budget. \nOr perhaps, as Senator Heller from Nevada has suggested, maybe Congress \nought not to be paid if they do not pass a budget. Maybe that reform \nwould be good for us.\n  The majority has refused to bring up a budget. They have not even \nattempted to pass a budget this year, and they refused to do so the \nlast 2 years before this. The absence of a budget is not simply a case \nof inaction; the Senate majority has pursued a systemic, deliberate, \nand determined policy--I believe a politically driven policy--to keep a \nbudget off the floor. Why? To attempt to shield its conference from \npublic accountability during this period of financial danger.\n  The worst possible time not to have a budget, not to have a plan, not \nto stand up and tell the American people what our financial vision for \nthe country is, would be in a time of deep financial crisis, when we \nare on an unsustainable path. Yet they are not even willing to present \na financial plan for the future of America. And when criticized about \nit, the White House says one thing, Speaker Pelosi another, the \nDemocratic leader here has another explanation, but none of reasons are \ncoherent or make real sense.\n  Why? I guess there is no explanation. There can be no justifiable \nreason why this responsibility is not fulfilled. They say, maybe one \nday. Maybe it wouldn't pass ultimately. Maybe we wouldn't agree. But \nthe Republican House felt its responsibility to comply with the law, \nand it has for the last 2 years. They laid out a long-term plan for \nAmerica that changes our debt course and puts us on a financial path to \nstability. That is our responsibility. Oh, yes, the Senate called it up \nhere. For what reason? So they could attack it and bring it down, but \nnot to lay out any plan of their own.\n  When Senator McConnell called up President Obama's budget last year, \nhe said, let's see if you want to vote for that. You voted down the \nHouse budget and attacked Paul Ryan and his colleagues for the historic \nwork they put into drafting their budget. Let's see what you think \nabout your President's budget. It went down 95 to 0. Not a single \nMember voted for it.\n  So while government workers have been throwing lavish parties in Las \nVegas, President Obama has not been roused to impose managerial \ndiscipline on this government. He has yet to call on his party, which \nis running the Senate, to produce a financial plan. His own budget this \nyear was brought up in the House and didn't receive a single vote. Yet \nboth he and the Senate Democrats continue to call for higher\n\n[[Page S2748]]\n\ntaxes. They say we must have higher taxes. How can they ask Americans \nto send more money to Washington when the Senate's majority won't even \nwrite a budget; won't even tell them where they are going to spend the \nmoney? They just say, send us more. We need more. We are not going to \ncut spending. Oh, we can't cut spending--that would be terrible--but \nyou need to send us more money, and maybe one day we will pass a \nbudget; maybe not.\n  The American people shouldn't send one more dime in new taxes to this \ndysfunctional government. They should say to Washington, you lay out a \nplan that puts us on a sound financial path, you bring wasteful \nspending to a conclusion, you quit spending money on Solyndras and hot \ntubs in Las Vegas, then you talk to me about sending more money. That \nis what the American people need to say. That is what they are saying. \nThat is what they said in 2010, I thought pretty clearly, but the \nmessage has not been received.\n  National Review's Rich Lowry recently wrote an article in which he \nrefers to Senator Conrad, our fine Democratic chairman of the Budget \nCommittee. This is what he wrote:\n\n       Senator Conrad said it was too hard to pass a budget in an \n     election year.\n\n       So that was one of the arguments--well, we don't need to \n     bring up a budget because it is an election year and we don't \n     want to be having a vote before we have to be voted on by the \n     American people. They might not like the way we voted. They \n     might vote us out of office. They might be disappointed in us \n     if they see us actually take tough votes on what we are going \n     to have to do about the future of the Republic.\n\n  Mr. Lowry goes on:\n\n       But Senate Democrats hadn't passed one in 2011 or 2010, \n     either. This year is a presidential election, 2011 was an \n     off-year, and 2010 was a midterm election. That covers every \n     kind of year there is in Washington. By this standard, the \n     Senate will have an annual excuse not to pass a budget \n     resolution for the rest of time.\n\n  I think there is a lot of truth to that. So they can't pass a budget \nthis year because it is an election year. Well, last year wasn't.\n  So this Sunday, April 29, we will have gone 3 full years since the \nlast time the Senate Democrats have brought a budget to the floor of \nthe Senate--3 years. They won't produce a plan because they are unable \nto produce a plan. And it is hard, I have to admit. The House has done \nit, but the Senate seems to be unable to do it. They are unable to \nunite behind a financial vision for this country that they are willing \nto go to the American people and advocate for and publicly defend. Now, \nthat is my view of it. Maybe it is unfair, but I don't think so. So \nthey can't put on paper how much they want the government to grow, how \nmuch they want to raise taxes, and how much deficit each year they are \nwilling to accept and whether that deficit is going to be brought under \ncontrol permanently or whether it will continue at the unsustainable \nrate it is.\n  There have been a lot of secret meetings and discussions about what \nmight be involved in an agreement that could or could not occur. There \nhas been a lot of talk about that. But what has been carefully avoided \nis actually letting the American people see the numbers so they can be \ntotaled and we can precisely measure the impact.\n  Last year our colleagues indicated that we would have a Budget \nCommittee markup on a budget, that they had a plan, and it was going to \nbe Monday, and then it was going to be Tuesday. Then the Democratic \nconference met, and they laid out some broad outline for it. Then \napparently they told Senator Conrad not to have a budget markup. So we \ndidn't even have anything brought up in the Budget Committee last year \nas required by the law.\n  But you could take a look at that budget. It would have increased \nspending, not reduced spending. It would have increased taxes \nsignificantly but would have managed to cut the Defense Department $900 \nbillion. That is what the outlines of it appear to be. That is a pretty \ntough budget to go to the American people with--increase spending, \nincrease taxes, and savage the Defense Department. Well, I don't think \nthat was very popular. Maybe politically it was foolish, as Senator \nReid had said, to bring up such a budget to the American people. Maybe \nthey ought to look at the Ryan budget in the House. It is much more \nresponsible. It reduces spending, even simplifies and lowers taxes, \ncreating a growth environment, and it puts us on a financial path for \nthe next 30 years that anybody who looks at America would say: Wow. \nThey have changed. They have a plan that will get them out of this fix \nthey are in. They have gotten off the path to the waterfall, and they \nare on a sound course now.\n  So I would encourage my colleagues who think there is a legitimate \nreason not to lay out a plan, not to fight for the future of America, a \nreason not to advocate for the kinds of changes we all know have to \noccur--if you think those are not important, then I invite you to come \nto the floor and dispute what I have said and explain why we don't need \nto move forward as the law requires us to do.\n  I don't know how things will happen, but as ranking member of the \nBudget Committee and seeing the numbers, I know reality is not going to \nbe easily confronted. It is not going to be easy. We are going to have \nto look at the almost 60 percent of the budget now that is entitlements \nand interest on the debt. I believe interest on the debt last year was \ncalculated by the Congressional Budget Office to go from $240 billion \nto over $900 billion under the President's budget. These are annual \ninterest payments on the trillions of dollars we now owe in debt--that \nis unsustainable.\n  I know it is not going to be easy. I would just say that if we on the \nRepublican side are honored with a majority in the Senate, we will pass \na budget. It will be an absolute duty, as far as I can see, for us to \ndo so. It will be an honest budget. It won't be easy, and the American \npeople may be surprised at what would be required to change the debt \nand deficit course we are on. But our budget would put us on a path to \na financially prosperous America, get us off the road to debt and \ndecline, and put us on a path to growth and prosperity. That is what we \nhave to have.\n  Until the world's financial community and the American people \nunderstand that we are on a good path and not a bad path, we are not \ngoing to see the economic growth we should be seeing. And it is through \ngrowth and prosperity and more jobs that we will pay more taxes. It \nwill be those actions that will put America on the way to meet the \ngreat challenge of our time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wisconsin is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to \nspeak not to exceed 15 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to \nmark an amazing anniversary. And by amazing, I don't mean good. I mean \nunbelievable. I mean sad. On Sunday we will mark the anniversary--April \n29--of the date where it has been 3 years since the Senate has passed a \nbudget. I know a lot of Americans have heard that date, they have heard \nthe talking point that it has been 1,000-and-umpteen days since we \npassed a budget. But it is not a talking point. It is simply \nunbelievable. It is jaw-dropping. The U.S. Government is the largest \nfinancial entity in the world, and it has been operating now for 3 \nyears without a budget. It is a $3.8 trillion-a-year entity.\n  I come from the private sector. I am an accountant. When I tell the \nvoters, the citizens of Wisconsin, that the Federal Government hasn't \npassed a budget, they really are amazed. That is why I call it an \namazing anniversary date.\n  The Senate has not fulfilled a basic responsibility. It is required \nby law to pass a budget by April 15 of every year. It is a reasonable \nrequirement. It is a reasonable responsibility. The House Republicans \nhave fulfilled their responsibility and have put forward a plan. They \nhave shown the American people what they would do to solve our looming \ndebt and deficit problem. The Senate hasn't.\n  Why hasn't the majority in the Senate passed a budget? They have all \nthe votes. They have them in the Budget Committee to refer a budget to \nthe floor. They have the votes and they have the number of Members on \nthe floor of the Senate to pass a budget. Why do they refuse? Is it \nbecause they have no solutions to our problem or is it that they have a \nsolution, and they simply don't want the American people\n\n[[Page S2749]]\n\nto know what it is? ``Trust us. We will take care of us.'' Is it also \nbecause they don't want their fingerprints on that solution? They don't \nwant to be held accountable? I think more likely that is the reason we \nhaven't passed a budget here the Senate for 3 years now.\n  I guess they could claim President Obama's budget is their plan. But \nthe problem with that is President Obama's last two budgets have been \nso unserious--last year his budget lost in this body of the Senate by a \nvote of 0 to 97. Not one member of the President's own party gave it a \nvote. As a matter of fact, not one member of the President's own party \nwas willing to bring that budget to the floor for a vote. Republicans \nhad to do that.\n  Now this year's budget--3 weeks ago, in the House of Representatives \nagain, the President's budget was brought forward to the House--by a \nRepublican, not a Democrat. It lost 0 to 414. Again, I ask the American \npeople to think about that. Think about what a stunning repudiation \nthat is of leadership. What it really represents is a total abdication \nof leadership.\n  The American people deserve better. They deserve far better. They \ndeserve to have a plan. They deserve to have a choice.\n  The President now has put forward four budgets. He has yet to propose \nany solution to save Social Security or to save Medicare. Again, the \nHouse has provided that plan. They have passed a budget. They have been \nresponsible. Republicans have been willing to be held accountable. That \nis our job.\n  It is well past time for the Senate to fulfill its responsibility to \nbring a budget to the floor--not just vote on one but to work on it and \npass one so that we can go to conference and we can reconcile that with \nthe House budget so the United States finally, after 3 years, will \nstart operating under a budget in the next fiscal year.\n  I know the Budget Control Act sets spending caps. I get that. I get \nthat. Washington is going to make sure it can continue to spend money. \nBut spending money is only half the equation. What is this body going \nto do in terms of showing the American people what our plan is to live \nwithin our means, to get our debt and deficit under control? The \nAmerican people are waiting.\n  The result of this embarrassing abdication of responsibility and \nleadership can be clearly described by a few charts. Let me start going \nthrough a couple.\n  I think most people have seen all kinds of different debt charts. I \nlike this one because it starts in 1987, when our total Federal debt \nwas $2.3 trillion. If we were to pass President Obama's budget and live \nby it, in 10 years our total Federal debt would be $25.9 trillion.\n  In the Budget Control Act, this body--Congress--gave President Obama \nthe authority to increase our debt limit by $2.1 trillion. It took us \n200 years to incur $2.3 trillion. We will have blown through that $2.1 \ntrillion debt ceiling increase in less than 2 years.\n  Just in case anybody is still confused, we have a spending problem in \nthis Nation. It is not that we take too little from the American \npeople, it is because we spend too much.\n  I know the American people are frequently subjected to phrases such \nas ``Draconian cuts.'' I think this proves we are not cutting anything. \nIn 2002 the Federal Government spent $2 trillion. Last year, or the \ncurrent fiscal year, it is projected that we will spend $3.8 trillion. \nWe have virtually doubled spending in just 10 years. And the argument \nmoving forward is, according to President Obama, he would like to spend \n$5.8 trillion in the year 2022. The House budget would spend $4.9 \ntrillion.\n  Another way of looking at that is 10-year spending. In the 10-year \nperiod from 1992 to 2001, the Federal Government spent a total of $16 \ntrillion. From 2002 to 2011, the Federal Government spent $28 trillion. \nAgain, the argument moving forward is that President Obama's budget in \n10 years would spend $47 trillion. The House budget proposes spending \n$40 trillion. You don't have to be a math major or an engineer to do \nthat math. Both $40 trillion and $47 trillion are greater than $28 \ntrillion. We are not cutting spending, we are just trying to reduce the \nrate of growth. That is an incredibly important distinction. Don't be \nmisled. We are trying to get our debt and deficit under control.\n  A couple months ago, President Obama said he had the solution. His \nBuffett rule was going to stabilize the debt and deficit. Here is a \nlittle history. I hope the American people look at this.\n  President Bush, in his first 4 years in office, ran a total deficit \nof $0.8 trillion--$800 billion. Now, back in Oshkosh, WI, I wasn't \nhappy with that result. I didn't like seeing that deficit spending. His \nsecond 4 years didn't improve. He had a total deficit of $1.2 trillion \nbetween the years of 2005 and 2008. Again, I don't think there are very \nmany fiscal conservatives who were happy with that result.\n  Now President Obama has increased that dramatically. During the 4 \nyears of his administration, the total deficit will be $5.3 trillion. \nThat is on total spending of about $14.4 trillion. We are borrowing 37 \ncents of every $1 we spend and our debt now exceeds the size of our \neconomy. Again, President Obama's solution? I realize this is hard to \nsee, but he has proposed the Buffett tax. If we were to actually enact \nthat tax over 4 years, it would raise some $20 billion. I know you \ncannot see it, but there is a line there. It does not even fill in the \nmarker lines here. It is $20 billion to solve a $5,300 billion problem. \nI am sorry, that is not a serious proposal. It is just class warfare.\n  Let me show one of the problems President Obama refuses to address: \nthe looming bankruptcy of our Social Security Program, the program \nmillions of seniors rely on, that Americans plan their retirement \naround. We hear all too frequently that Social Security is solvent to \nthe year 2035. No, it is not. It is solvent because of an accounting \nfiction called the trust fund, which is simply government bonds held by \nthe Government. The analogy I use, it is akin to you had $20 and you \nspend the $20 and you write yourself a note and put it in your pocket \nand say I have $20. No, you do not, nor does the Federal Government. It \nhas bonds which, by the way, it can print any day of the week, but it \nhas to sell those bonds.\n  Social Security went cash negative, which means it paid out more in \ncash benefits than it took in, in cash receipts by 2010--by about $51 \nbillion. Last year, it was $46 billion in deficit. Through the year \n2035, all this red ink represents $6 trillion in additional deficit \nspending in the Social Security fund. It is insolvent. It is bankrupt. \nIt needs to be addressed. This President refuses to address it.\n  When we project out and we see another $10 trillion to $11 trillion \nin increased spending and debt according to President Obama's budget, I \nam concerned we are not even fully realizing the other risks involved.\n  Before I get to this chart, let me mention the first one. If we fail \nto meet the growth targets President Obama is projecting in his budget \nby just 1 percent, we add $3.1 trillion to that 10-year deficit figure. \nThat is a 30-percent increase. I know when they passed the health care \nlaw the American people were told--they were hoodwinked into believing \nit would actually reduce our deficit. It will not. The way they were \ngoing to pay for 6 years' worth of spending is with 10 years' worth of \nreceipts and reductions in Medicare. The receipts come in taxes, fees \nand penalties on, by the way, drug manufacturers, medical device \nmanufacturers, health care plans. I don't know what economics course \nmembers of this administration took, but we do not bend down the cost \ncurve by increasing the costs to providers. That is what they were \ndoing for about $590 billion of that revenue stream to pay for \nObamaCare.\n  The other $665 billion was going to come out of cuts to Medicare, \nMedicare Advantage, and Medicaid.\n  We have not imposed the provider reductions under the SGR fix, the \ndoc fix--about $208 billion. What makes anybody believe we will \nactually impose the $665 billion in savings in Medicare? If we move the \n10-year window forward to when ObamaCare kicks in, when the full \nspending occurs starting about 2016, the total cost of the health care \nlaw will not be $1.1 trillion, it will be $2.4 trillion, and that is a \nconservative estimate, not even taking into account millions of \nemployees who will lose their employer-sponsored care and get put into \nthe exchanges at highly subsidized rates. But using a conservative cost \nfigure of $2.4 trillion and\n\n[[Page S2750]]\n\ngrowth in taxes, fees, and penalties by a reasonable amount, $816 \nbillion, that leaves a $1.6 trillion what I am calling deficit risk. \nHow is that going to be filled? Are we going to borrow it or are we \ngoing to take it out of Medicare? Somehow I do not think we will be \ntaking it out of Medicare. Somehow I think we will have to borrow it, \nif we can.\n  That brings me to our last chart, interest rate risk. I was never \nconcerned, not even for a moment last year during the debt ceiling \ndebate, that the Federal Government was going to default on any of its \nobligations. We were going to pay Social Security recipients. We were \ngoing to pay our soldiers. We were going to meet every obligation of \nthe Federal Government. The day I fear is the true day of reckoning, \nthe day when creditors around the world take a look at the United \nStates and say: You know what, I am not going to loan you any more \nmoney or what is more likely to occur is they will say: I will loan you \nsome money but not at these rates.\n  If we take a look at the history of the borrowing costs of the United \nStates, from 1970 to the year 2000, our average borrowing cost for the \nFederal Government was 5.3 percent. Over the last 3 years, from 2010 to \n2012, our average borrowing costs were about 1.5 percent. That is a \ndifference of 3.8 percent between these two figures. If we just revert \nto that average--and by the way, back then the United States was a far \nmore creditworthy borrower--our debt-to-GDP ratio ranged somewhere \nbetween 45 percent and 67 percent. Currently, our debt-to-GDP ratio \nexceeds 100 percent. If we revert to that average borrowing cost, that \nwould cost the Federal Government $600 billion in added interest \nexpense per year. That is 60 percent of the discretionary spending \nlevel of $1.47 trillion this year.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has consumed 15 \nminutes.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I ask unanimous consent for 2 more minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. This is the problem. This is a huge problem. It is one \nthat is being ignored because we simply refuse to address it. This body \nrefuses to pass a budget to lay out a plan to fix it; to stabilize one \nof our primary metrics, a key one--that debt-to-GDP ratio, stabilize \nthat and start bringing it down. The other is the percentage of \ngovernment in relation to the size of our economy. One hundred years \nago that was 2 percent. Last year, it was about 24 percent, which means \n24 cents of every $1 filters through some form of government. I do not \nfind the Federal Government particularly effective or efficient. That \nis what the private sector does. It is the private sector that creates \nlong-term self-sustaining jobs. It is the private sector we need to \nrely on to grow our economy and create jobs.\n  As to the vision for America, we are going to have a very clear \nchoice on the vision for America, between what this administration \nwants to do with a government-centered society and what Republicans \nwant to do in terms of an opportunity society led by free people, free \nenterprise, led by freedom. That is our choice. But until the majority \nparty in the Senate lays out their plan, the American people will not \nhave a plan. They will not understand what the plan is for the other \nside.\n  Again, let me close by saying it is well past time for the Senate to \nfulfill its responsibility and pass a budget.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Close to 14 minutes, approximately \n14 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the Violence Against \nWomen Act and the policies that impact the lives of women. Since its \noriginal enactment in 1994, the Violence Against Women Act has been \nreauthorized twice by unanimous consent, under both Democratic and \nRepublican leadership. The legislation originated out of a necessity \nfor us to respond to the prevalence of domestic violence, sexual \nviolence, and the impact those crimes have on the lives of women.\n  By and large, the legislation has worked, even though there are \noutstanding issues, such as spending inefficiencies and needed \nimprovements to oversight. As with most large pieces of legislation, \nincluding the Violence Against Women Act Reauthorization, there are \ndebates and philosophical differences about elements of various \nprovisions in the bill. While the Senate should be allowed to debate \nand ideally resolve these differences, I don't think any of the points \nof controversy we will discuss are important enough to prevent passage \nof the legislation. The Violence Against Women Act represents a \nnational commitment to reversing the legacy of laws and social norms \nthat once served to shamefully excuse violence toward women, a \ncommitment that should be maintained.\n  Whatever differences we might have over particular provisions in the \nbill, surely we are united in our concern for the victims of violence \nand our determination to do all we can to prevent violence against the \ninnocent, regardless of gender. I recognize women suffer \ndisproportionately from particular forms of violence and other abuse, \nwhich this legislation is intended to address. I believe it does \naddress it, and that is why I support it. But our motivation to act on \ntheir behalf resides in our respect for the rights all human beings \npossess, male and female, all races, creeds, and ages: to be secure in \ntheir persons and property; to be protected by their government from \nviolent harm at the hands of another; to live without threat or fear in \nthe exercise of their God-given rights.\n  Similarly, whatever our political differences in this body, I trust \nwe all believe we are doing what we think best serves the interests and \nvalues of the American people--all the American people. I don't think \neither party is entitled to speak or act exclusively for one \ndemographic of our population, one class, one race or one gender. The \nsecurity and prosperity of all Americans is a shared responsibility and \neach of us discharges it to the best of our ability. We do not have \nmale and female political parties and we do not need to accuse each \nother of caring less for the concerns of one-half the population than \nwe do for the other half. The truth is, both parties have presided over \nachievements and increases in opportunity for women. Both parties have \nnominated women to the Supreme Court. Both parties have had excellent \nfemale Secretaries of State. Both parties have had female Presidential \nand Vice Presidential candidates. Both parties have reauthorized the \nViolence Against Women Act. Both parties have made progress toward \nensuring Americans, male and female, have an equal opportunity to \nsucceed as far as their talents and industry can take them.\n  That progress has come in the form of many policies, from changes to \nour Tax Code to changes in education policy, to improvements in \nworkplace environment as well as from changes in cultural attitudes in \nboth the public and the private sector. Do we always agree? Do we \nalways get it right? No, we do not. But I do think there is much for \nall of us to be proud.\n  Regrettably--and there is always something to regret in politics--we \nhave seen too many attempts to resolve inequities in our society and \nensure all Americans are afforded the same respect for their rights and \naspirations misappropriated for the purpose of partisan advantage, \nwhich has the perverse effect, of course, of dividing the country in \nthe name of greater fairness and unity.\n  My friends, this supposed war on women or the use of similarly \noutlandish rhetoric by partisan operatives has two purposes, and both \nare purely political in their purpose and effect. The first is to \ndistract citizens from real issues that matter, and the second is to \ngive talking heads something to sputter about when they appear on cable \ntelevision. Neither purpose does anything to advance the well-being of \nany American.\n  I have been fortunate to be influenced throughout my life by the \nexample of strong, independent, aspiring,\n\n[[Page S2751]]\n\nand caring women. As a son, brother, husband, father, and grandfather, \nI think I can claim some familiarity with the contributions women make \nto the health and progress of our society. I can certainly speak to \ntheir beneficial impact on my life and character. But I would never \nclaim to speak for all the women in my family, much less all the women \nin our country any more than I would venture the same presumption for \nall men.\n  To suggest that one group of us or one party speaks for all women or \nthat one group has an agenda to harm women and another to help them is \nridiculous, if for no other reason than it assumes a unity of interest, \nbeliefs, concerns, experiences, and ambition among all women that \ndoesn't exist among men or among any race or class. It would be absurd \nfor me to speak for all veterans and wrong of me to suggest that if a \ncolleague who is not a veteran disagrees with my opinion on some issue, \nhe or she must be against all our veterans.\n  In America, all we can fairly claim to have in common with each other \nat all times--no matter what gender we are or what demographic we fit--\nare our rights. As a son, brother, husband, father, and grandfather, I \nhave the same dreams and concerns for all the people in my life. As a \npublic servant, I have the same respect for their rights and the same \nresponsibility to protect them, and I try to do so to the best of my \nability.\n  Thankfully, I believe women and men in our country are smart enough \nto recognize when a politician or political party resorts to dividing \nus in the name of bringing us together, it usually means they are \neither out of ideas or short on resolve to address the challenges of \nour time. At this time in our Nation's history we face an abundance of \nhard choices. Divisive slogans and the declaring of phony wars are \nintended to avoid those hard choices and to escape paying a political \nprice for doing so.\n  For 38 straight months our unemployment rate has been over 8 percent. \nMillions of Americans--men and women--cannot find a job. Many have quit \nlooking. Americans don't need another hollow slogan or another call to \ndivision and partisanship. They need real solutions to their problems. \nThey are desperate for them.\n  Americans of both genders are concerned about finding and keeping a \ngood job. Americans of both genders are concerned about the direction \nof our economy. Women and men are concerned about mounting debt--their \nown and the Nation's. Women and men are hurt by high gas prices, by the \nhousing crisis, shrinking wages, and the cost of health care. Women and \nmen are concerned about their children's security, their education, \ntheir prospects for inheriting an America that offers every mother and \nfather's child a decent chance at reaching their full potential. \nLeaving these problems unaddressed indefinitely and resorting to \nprovoking greater divisions among us at a time when we most need unity \nmight not be a war against this or that group of Americans, but it is \nsurely a surrender, a surrender of our responsibilities to the country \nand a surrender of decency.\n  Within the tired suggestions that women are singularly focused on one \nor two issues are the echoes of stale arguments from the past. Women \nare as variable in their opinions and concerns as men. Those false \nassertions are rooted in the past stereotypes that prevented women from \nbecoming whatever they wanted to become, slowed our progress, and hurt \nour country in many ways. The argument is as wrong now as it was then \nand we ought not to repeat it.\n  We have only these in common: our equal right to the pursuit of \nhappiness and our shared responsibility to making America an even \ngreater place than we found it. Women and men are no different in their \nrights and responsibilities. I believe this legislation recognizes \nthat. I don't believe the ludicrous partisan posturing that has \nconjured up this imaginary war.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, a group of women Senators is here to \ntalk about the Violence Against Women bill, and as my colleague from \nArizona was referencing, this is a bill where there has been unity for \nwell over a decade. We have a number of Republican sponsors. We are up \nto 61 sponsors, men and women, who have come together to say that \nviolence against women is not okay.\n  The first speaker is the Senator from Maryland, Senator Mikulski.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I thank the gentlelady from Minnesota \nfor her well-known advocacy on this issue. Her advocacy was well known \nin Minnesota. Her work as a prosecutor brought her in contact with many \nof these women and making sure they got a fair shake in the system was \nwell known and well appreciated.\n  I am here to be a strong supporter for the Violence Against Women \nAct, and I hope this bill passes and that this bill passes today. It is \nbecause Senator Leahy has worked on a bipartisan basis in his committee \nthat we were able to bring out this bill.\n  This bill was first passed in 1994 under the leadership of our Vice \nPresident, then-Senator Joe Biden, who is well known for his strong, \nmuscular, robust approach to law enforcement. What he saw was that so \nmany of the victims of crime were women and that they were victims both \nin streets and neighborhoods. They were also terrible victims in their \nown home where they were battered and abused. They found that when they \ncame to the judicial system, they were battered again because they were \nignored and had no one to stick up for them and were always told: Oh, \nit is your fault. What are you doing? Joe Biden changed the law, and we \nworked on a bipartisan basis.\n  Ever since 1994 we have continually reauthorized this legislation, \nlooking at new needs and new technology and new creative ways of \nresponding to these needs for prevention, intervention, and even \nprosecution. What we want to do today is pass this legislation that has \nbeen refreshed, reformed, and also brings some new approaches.\n  The chairman of the committee has done an outstanding job and is to \nbe commended. The Violence Against Women Act authorizes two Federal \nprograms for domestic and sexual violence in our communities, the \nDepartment of Justice and the Department of Human Resources. The STOP \ngrant is the largest national grant program in the Justice Department. \nRoughly half of all violence-against-women funds goes to these STOP \ngrants, and they go to every community.\n  What is it they do? They coordinate community approaches to end \nviolence and sexual assault. They fund victim services such as shelters \nand the toll-free crisis hotline and fund legal assistance to victims \nto get court orders to be able to protect themselves from the abuser or \nfrom the stalker. They also have training for police officers, \nprosecutors, and judges so they know how to do a good job. It also \nhelps with grants for victims of child abuse, something I am very \nfamiliar with, having been a child abuse social worker, and also \nimportant services in terms of rape prevention programs. This is a \ngreat bill and it meets a compelling human need.\n  Since the original Biden legislation, over 1 million women who have \ncalled that hotline were desperate, who were fearful for their lives. \nAnd when they called that number, they didn't get a busy signal, nobody \nhung up on them; they got help, and I know that it saved lives. One in \nfour women will be a victim of domestic violence during her lifetime. \nSixteen million children are exposed to domestic violence, and also one \nin six women has experienced attempted or completed rape, and now even \nmen are the subject of rape.\n  Twenty-five percent of rape crisis centers have waiting lists for \nadvocacy groups. I want to talk about that in more detail. There are 2 \nmillion victims of physical and sexual violence each year; 20,000 in \nMaryland. On average, 1,000 female victims are killed by their abusers \nand one-third of all female homicides are domestic violence. These are \nnumbers and statistics, but they also represent real people.\n  We help over 70,000 victims every day through hotlines and services \nand shelters, but regrettably there is a waiting list. So we need to \npass this legislation because it gives us the authorization to be able \nto help those in need. It meets\n\n[[Page S2752]]\n\nthese compelling human needs to protect people, and in my own State it \nhas had enormous, positive consequences.\n  There is something that was developed through the Department of \nJustice called the lethal index. It means when a police officer goes \ninto a home, he or she has to assess how dangerous it is. Should they \nyank the kids out? Should they take the abuser and put them in jail or \ndo they call in a social worker to try and intervene? Should they give \nthe family more time, give them family counseling so they can get \npeople off the ledge and out of a violent situation so they are able to \nwork on the long path toward family stability?\n  Well, my local law enforcement police officers tell me this lethal \nchecklist has been a tremendous tool to being able to assess the level \nof violence when they are in that home and to know when people are in \ndanger and they have to get them out right that minute. Again, they \nalso know when there is the opportunity for other interventions to be \nable to help the family. This helps families, it helps police officers, \nand it helps our community. We need to empower victims to be able to \nhelp themselves by providing help in these abusive relationships.\n  Studies show that victims who use community-based domestic violence \nservices--when they are available--are almost never victims of murder \nor attempted murder. That is a powerful line that if we had this \nintervention and prevention we can not only reduce violence but we can \nreduce homicides as well.\n  We need to pass this bill because it is crucial to our families, to \nour communities, and it also shows the country that we are serious \nabout governing and keeping this legislation going.\n  I want to also comment on some of the other important programs. As I \nsaid, I want to talk a little bit about my role. I am an appropriator--\nand in fact, I will leave shortly to go to a markup. But I have moved \nthe Commerce, Justice, Science spending bill. I worked so closely with \nthe gentlelady from Texas, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, also a very \nstrong advocate in the interest of women and protecting women here and \naround the world. We worked on a bipartisan basis in this year's bill \nand put money in the Federal checkbook for those STOP grants, for those \nsexual assault services, for transitional housing grants, and also for \nother help in our communities. We also took a serious look at the whole \nissue of forensics.\n  Forensics is a subject of much debate and unfortunately much backlog. \nIn my bill, in the Commerce, Justice, Science bill, we funded overall \nin the Department of Justice money to deal with forensic backlogs, but \nwe also paid particular attention to something called the Debbie Smith \nAct. Let me say this: There are two different bills. There is the \nViolence Against Women Act and there is the Debbie Smith Act. The \nDebbie Smith Act was passed because of a woman named Debbie Smith who \nwas subjected to the most violent, repugnant, despicable acts of \nviolence against her. Working together, what we have done is actually \nput money in the Federal checkbook to reduce the backlog of DNA \nevidence. We have ensured that a high percentage of funds also go to \nlabs to be able to deal with samples from crime scenes, databases, and \nother areas.\n\n  Assuming we will debate this rape kit issue at a later time, I wish \nto thank Senator Leahy for his advocacy and Senator Cornyn for his \nsensitivity in wanting to solve the problem. I believe if we can take a \nminute and keep in our minds as our legislative goal to work together--\nnot who gets credit but who gets help--it is not about who gets credit, \nit is about who gets help. We want to be able to help those rape \nvictims have the solace and the consolation that their government is on \ntheir side, using the best of scientific evidence to make sure we have \nthe right person to ensure the right prosecution to get the right \nconviction.\n  Right now, there is a backlog. When Justice gives out their money for \nforensics, it doesn't always go toward these issues. We can direct it. \nWe can do a good job. Let's come together. Let's iron out our \nparliamentary differences so we can pass this very important Violence \nAgainst Women Act.\n  I can take what I have done to put money in the Federal checkbook. \nLet's refresh the Federal law book and, most of all, let's keep our \neyes on what we want to do. We want to be able to prevent domestic \nviolence and violence against women, whether it is the stranger who \nperpetrates danger and commits despicable acts or against women in \ntheir own homes. We aim for prevention, intervention, the training of \npolice officers, judges, and courts, and the right prosecutions.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I wish to thank so much the Senator \nfrom Maryland for showing such a succinct way of describing such an \nincredibly complex but important bill.\n  We have also been joined by the Senator from California who has been \na long-time leader on this issue. She was here in Congress, as was the \nSenator from Maryland, when the initial Violence Against Women Act \npassed in 1994.\n  I yield to the Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. If the Chair would \ntell me when I have used 5 minutes and then I will conclude.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator will be notified.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to thank Senator Klobuchar for her \nleadership and Senator Feinstein as well. These are the two Democratic \nwomen on the Judiciary Committee who have been such leaders on this \nissue, as well as Senator Murray.\n  I am proud to stand here today to call for the passage of the \nViolence Against Women Act. This is not a new bill, as has been \npainstakingly described to all of my colleagues. I can remember so well \nwhen then-Senator Joe Biden wrote the Violence Against Women Act, and \nhe came to me when I was in the House and asked me to carry it in the \nHouse. I was as honored as I am right now.\n  Yes, it took us a while to pass it, but ever since it has been \nnoncontroversial. For some reason our Republican friends, although we \nhave 61 people as cosponsors, are slowing it down, and it seems to me \nvery clear if they didn't have objections we could pass this by voice \nvote.\n  Three women are killed by their abusive partners every single day. I \nwill repeat that: Three women today will be killed by their abusive \nhusbands. For every woman who is killed, there are nine more who are \nbeaten or injured every single day. In the name of those people--in the \nname of the three women who will be killed today--we should pass this \nunanimously.\n  Has the Violence Against Women Act worked? Yes. Incidents of domestic \nviolence have decreased by 53 percent since we passed this law. Why on \nEarth, when three women are killed every day and nine women are \ninjured, sometimes to the point of almost losing their lives--why on \nEarth, when a bill has brought down domestic violence by 53 percent, \nwould there be objection? There is no reason whatsoever for objection.\n  When we go back to the votes on the bill, there are overwhelming \nvotes in favor every time. This year 47 attorneys general signed a \nbipartisan letter supporting the reauthorization.\n  I have story after story from home, and I am going to read a couple \nto my colleagues. A mother in Alameda County with two children had been \nin a long-term abusive relationship. She separated from her abuser only \nto be stalked and brutally assaulted by him. She called 9 1-1. She hid \nthe phone during the last beating so the police could hear what was \ngoing on. Because of the Violence Against Women Act, she was able to \naccess a Family Justice Center where she received counseling, \nrelocation assistance, and she worked with a deputy DA trained by \nprogram grants. She was pressured not to cooperate with the \nprosecution, but because of the Violence Against Women Act--the \ninvestigators had been trained by that act--she overcame her fear. She \nwas protected as she cooperated and gained a strong conviction of her \nabuser.\n  That is a case that shows the training works, and the training took \nplace because of the Violence Against Women Act.\n  This is a story of an immigrant woman in Los Angeles. This happened 2 \nyears ago. She was stabbed 19 times by her boyfriend while she was 3 \nmonths pregnant. During her ordeal, her boyfriend drove her from one \npart of town\n\n[[Page S2753]]\n\nto the other, refusing to take her to an emergency room even though she \nwas bleeding profusely. She jumped out of the car, screamed for help, \nand the abuser fled. Thankfully, she received medical attention. The \nbaby was not lost, she recovered, and because of the Violence Against \nWomen Act she cooperated with the prosecutors. She got a U-visa, and \nshe and her child could move on.\n  The last case deals with Indian tribes. I know what a fierce advocate \nthe Presiding Officer is in every way for Indian tribes. So I talked to \nmy people back home. According to a 2008 report by the Centers for \nDisease Control, 39 percent of Native American women will face domestic \nviolence--39 percent. Yesterday, Senator Klobuchar, Senator Murray, and \nI stood next to a woman who is the vice-chair of a tribe in Washington. \nShe, for the first time, spoke out about the abuse she received as a \ntoddler. I don't think Senator Klobuchar and I and Senator Murray will \never forget it.\n\n  She said: I know how old I was because I remember I was the size of a \ncouch cushion. This woman spoke out about how later on she saw the gang \nrape of her aunt. Because of the situation with Indian law, if the \nabuser is not from the tribe----\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has consumed 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will complete my statement in a moment. If an abuser is \nnot from the tribe, there is no recourse--no recourse--in a place where \n39 percent of the women will face domestic violence, and we have \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle who want to exclude people.\n  I wish to ask a rhetorical question: If a person is walking down the \nstreet and sees three people bleeding on the street--one just has to \nknow a little bit about being a Good Samaritan--a person doesn't ask \nthem for their papers, they don't ask them who they are, they don't ask \nthem where they live, they help them.\n  Anyone on this floor who attempts to take out various groups from \nthis bill is changing the Violence Against Women Act, which has never \nexcluded any group. So let's be clear. Let's pass the bill. Let's get \nit done.\n  I will say in closing, tribal chairman Stacy Dixon of the Susanville \nIndian Rancheria said the improvements in this bill will ``bring \njustice back to Indian country and will equip tribal governments with \nthe needed authority and resources to protect our residents and restore \nfaith in the justice system.''\n  Let's restore faith in the justice system not just for those on \ntribal lands but for those who live in any part of our lands.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I thank very much the Senator from \nCalifornia for those moving remarks and for the very important point \nthat the Violence Against Women Act has never discriminated against \npeople, regardless of who they are, where they live, or how much money \nthey have. I appreciate those remarks, and I think it is at the core of \nwhat some of this debate is about.\n  Overall, I still believe when we are ready to have a number of \ncolleagues from across the aisle on this bill, we will get this done. \nThat is why it is so important that with the work of Senator Reid and \nSenator Leahy, the chairman of our Judiciary Committee, and Senator \nCrapo, who is the leading Republican on this bill, and Senator \nMikulski, who came and spoke earlier, as well as Senator Murkowski, who \njoined us the last time we had the group of women Senators--and we have \nbeen working diligently on it late into the evening--I am very positive \nwe are going to get this done and get this vote done.\n  I see we have been joined by the Senator from Washington, Ms. \nCantwell, who has long been a leader on women's issues and has fought \nfor this bill and has been a Member of Congress in the past when it has \nbeen reauthorized. So she knows very well that in the past this has not \nbeen a partisan bill; that people have come together and worked out \nwhatever differences they have had, and they have been able to pass \nthis important Violence Against Women Act.\n  So I thank her for being here, and I yield to Senator Cantwell.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota for \nher leadership on this issue and for her great service on the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. I know she, as a former prosecutor, has provided a \ngreat deal of leadership on many issues, but having her voice on this \nSenate Judiciary Committee has been very important for our country.\n  I come to the floor to stand with my colleagues who are here, the \nwomen of the Senate, to say we are standing up for women across \nAmerica. We want the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. \nToday we wish to tell victims of domestic violence that they are not \nalone. We have to make sure we are giving to local governments and to \nlaw enforcement the tools they need to protect victims of domestic \nviolence.\n  Today we are here with a clear message to victims of domestic \nviolence which is that we will stand with them. We haven't forgotten, \nand we are not going to let this bill be bogged down in political \nfighting. We are going to make sure we continue to move ahead. We \nalready have the support of 61 Senators, 47 State attorneys general, \nand countless law enforcement individuals who are working across the \nNation to make sure these victims have an advocate. However, we know \nthere is still opposition that remains, so I want to make sure we \naddress those concerns today.\n  For those who oppose the bill, I ask them to look at my State of \nWashington and the threat of domestic violence. In Washington State, \nlaw enforcement receives 30,000 domestic violence calls a year, on \naverage, and on any given day in 2011, domestic violence programs \nserved 1,884 people in Washington State. That is why the Violence \nAgainst Women Act is so important. In Washington, it really does save \nlives.\n  People such as Carissa, one of my constituents, who was in an abusive \nrelationship, was allowed to flee with her then 3-year-old daughter in \n1998. She joined me in Seattle recently to highlight the fact that the \nprograms, shelter, and the assistance in starting a new life helped her \nescape that life of abuse.\n  I wish to quote Carissa: ``I am standing here alive today because \nVAWA works.'' Looking into Carissa's eyes, we know this is not about \nstatistics, and it is not about politics. It is about providing a \nlifeline to women who want to have a different life.\n  VAWA also helps crack down on violence against mail order brides. It \nis a story that we all know too well in the Pacific Northwest. \nAnastasia King and Susana Blackwell were mail order brides who came to \nWashington State to start a new life with men they believed loved them. \nTheir lives were brutally cut short when their husbands murdered them. \nThis happened after they had been subject to repeated domestic abuse. \nThat is why, in 2005, I sponsored the International American Broker \nRegulation Act which became part of the Violence Against Women Act. It \nempowered more and more fiances to learn if their spouses had a history \nof violent crime, and it now has become part of the reauthorization \nthat is this bill. It includes enhancements that require marriage \nbroker agencies to provide foreign-born fiances with a record of any \ndomestic violence their potential spouses might have engaged in. That \nway we can stop the abuse before it begins.\n  Opponents who say the Violence Against Women Act would create \nimmigration fraud and give funds to those who don't need it should \nconsider the story of Anastasia King and Susana Blackwell. Anastasia's \nand Susana's lives could have been saved had these provisions and \nprotections been in place. We should not deny immigrant women or \ntrafficking victims resources they need to prevent abuse nor should we \ncreate barriers for them to get the safety they need. That is why we \nneed to pass the Violence Against Woman Act.\n\n  We also need to make it clear that Native American women will receive \nprotection. Deborah Parker of the Tulalip Tribes came to the Capitol \nthis week to explain why this is so important. Deborah is a tireless \nchampion\n\n[[Page S2754]]\n\nfor the victims of domestic abuse, and she was here to tell her brave \nstory. She spoke eloquently as to why women need to make sure their \nperpetrators will be charged.\n  Consider that 39 percent of American Indian women will endure \ndomestic violence in their lifetimes. Compare that with figures that \nestimate that 24 percent of all women in the United States will \nexperience domestic violence in their lifetimes. So we need a Violence \nAgainst Women Act that will crack down on the domestic violence in \ntribal communities. This bill gives the tools so we can make sure we go \nafter those offenders.\n  Some have warned this will trample on the rights of individuals to \nhave due process and full protection. That is not the case. What we are \ndoing is making sure there will be an investigation on reservations of \nthe suspected abuse. I think it is time we address this epidemic that \nis happening in Indian Country before it escalates more. That is why we \nneed to make sure every woman in America has the rights under the \nViolence Against Women Act to be protected.\n  We have a long way to go to root out domestic abuse and violence. But \nwithout these tools, such as VAWA, we are not going to achieve our \ngoals. It is time we pass this legislation for people such as Deborah, \nfor people such as Carissa, and to remember the lives of people such as \nSusana Blackwell and Anastasia King.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington \nvery much. Deborah Parker, whom she referenced, did a beautiful job \nyesterday of explaining exactly what it meant to be a Native American \nwoman and a victim of domestic violence.\n  As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I can tell you, we have \nlooked hard at all the issues in reauthorizing this bill. We have had a \nseries of hearings and looked at the fact that domestic violence and \nsexual assault still remain in America, and many of us have worked to \nbuild upon the many important improvements the past two VAWA \nreauthorizations have made in reducing violence.\n  I would note many things were added--including one of the issues \nmentioned here today: the U visas--on a bipartisan basis in the 2000 \nreauthorization. Many of the issues regarding American Indian women \nwere considered in the past. But we are simply building on the past \nbills. We have worked with our Republican cosponsors to make sure there \nwas a general agreement on any additions that were made to the bill, \nand they were all made for very good reasons--as we have heard today--\nto help women who need the help.\n  But despite these improvements we have seen in the numbers, make no \nmistake about it, violence against women is still a problem. A recent \nsurvey by the National Network to End Domestic Violence helps to \nillustrate both the progress we have made as well as the work that is \nstill left to be done.\n  On just 1 day last year--look at this as a benchmark; 1 day last \nyear: September 15--in the State of Minnesota, 44 Minnesota domestic \nviolence programs reported serving 735 victims in emergency shelters or \ntransitional housing and 670 adults and children through individual \ncounseling, legal advocacy or children's support groups. That is a \ntotal of 1,405 victims in 1 day in one State.\n  On that same day, there were 807 calls to domestic violence hotlines, \nwhich provide emergency support, information, safety planning, and \nresources for victims in danger. That works out to 33 calls per hour in \na 24-hour period, and that is in 1 State of the 50 States.\n  Because of the Violence Against Women Act, on just 1 day last year, \nall these victims were able to get access to services they may not have \nbeen able to get before VAWA. But one other number from that survey \ncaught my eye. In just 1 day, 315 requests for services were unmet. Mr. \nPresident, 83 percent of those unmet requests were for housing.\n  What is the reason for those unmet requests? The Minnesota \norganizations reported they did not have enough things such as staff, \nbeds, translators or other specialized services. Think about that: In \njust 1 day, in 1 State, 315 people were unable to get the help they \nneeded. That means we still have work to do.\n  As I have worked on the reauthorization of VAWA, I have been reminded \nof how many of my experiences as Hennepin County attorney--that is \nMinnesota's largest county--are relevant still today. While I was \ncounty attorney, I made it a priority of my office to focus on \nprevention and prosecution of domestic violence cases.\n  As a prosecutor, I saw upfront how devastating these cases can be.\n  One case, a woman in Maple Grove, a suburb of the Twin Cities, told \nher mother and a friend she planned to end her relationship with her \nabusive boyfriend. She was finally going to break it off, and if \nsomething were to happen to her--she said this; she actually said these \nwords to her mom and to her friend--she said: If something happens to \nme, ``he did it.'' That was the last day anyone saw her alive.\n  A fisherman discovered the woman's body months later in the Minnesota \nRiver. It was a tragic end to a story of escalating abuse that this \nyoung woman had to live through, as she tried to break it off, to a \ntragic end.\n  The woman had earlier filed assault charges against her boyfriend, \nclaiming he had put her in a chokehold and pushed her into a coffee \ntable. Her 3-year-old son told his grandmother he found his mother on \nthe floor and that she was sleeping and he could not wake her.\n  The boyfriend had actually been convicted years earlier for attempted \nmurder in another case with a pattern of domestic abuse. After he got \nout, he met his new girlfriend--the one who ended up dead in the \nMinnesota River. In the end, he pleaded guilty to the murder and \nreceived a maximum sentence.\n  I remember another case with a woman who was shot to death by her \nboyfriend who then killed himself. The man's 12-year-old daughter tried \nto get into the bedroom, and when she could not get in, she went to a \nneighbor's house for help. His 19-year-old son was also in the house. \nThe police were called to that residence at least five times in the 2 \nyears before the tragedy.\n  These stories are horrifying, and as a prosecutor one never forgets \nthem. For survivors, they stay with them for the rest of their lives. \nIt is stories such as these that make it so obvious that we have more \nwork to do. We need to pass this reauthorization bill and we need to \ncontinue to build on the improvements we have made in \npast reauthorizations. One of the important improvements this \nreauthorization bill has made comes in the area of stalking. The bill \nincludes a provision I added, along with my cosponsor, Senator Kay \nBailey Hutchison of Texas, that will help law enforcement more \neffectively target high-tech predators because stalking, similar to any \nof the other crimes recognized in the Violence Against Women Act, is \ncrime that affects victims of every race, age, culture, gender, sexual \norientation, and economic status.\n\n  The numbers are truly alarming. In just 1 year, 3.4 million people in \nthe United States reported they had been victims of stalking, and 75 \npercent of those victims reported they had been stalked by someone they \nknew.\n  Overall, around 19 million women in the United States have at some \npoint during their lifetime been stalked. The National Center for \nVictims of Crime estimates that one out of every four stalking victims \nis stalked through some form of technology.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, this is a change. That is why Senator \nHutchison and I drafted this amendment that basically says the laws \nhave to be updated because law enforcement has to be as sophisticated \nas the people who are breaking the laws--as the people who were spying \non ESPN reporters, as a recent case showed, through little peepholes in \ntheir hotel rooms, while they were undressing. That happened, and that \ncase would have been a lot easier if this bill had been changed and \nupdated with the provisions Senator Hutchison and I are adding. That \nvictim, that reporter, came forward and asked that this be included in \nthe law, and it is. It is another reason why we have to pass the \nViolence Against Women Act.\n  The bill also includes a number of improvements, as was noted by \nSenator Cantwell, with respect to a particularly underserved \ncommunity--\n\n[[Page S2755]]\n\nwomen living in tribal areas. It is a heartbreaking reality that Native \nAmerican women experience rates of domestic violence and sexual assault \nthat are much higher than the national average. All the bill does in \nthis area--as the Chair knows, representing a State with a high \npopulation of Native Americans--is that it simply allows a tribal court \nto have jurisdiction concurrent with the other courts, with the Federal \nand State courts. I know changes have been made in the managers' \namendment to address the particular concerns of Alaska. This is an \nincredibly important part of the bill, and I am glad we were able to \nwork with the Republican cosponsors to get this part of the bill \nupdated.\n  The Violence Against Women Act is an important tool for ending \nviolence against women, but this is not just about women.\n  I often mention the case of a very sad situation where a man murdered \nhis wife. They were Russian immigrants. They knew no one in town. He \nmurders his wife, takes her body parts in a bag, dumps them off in a \nriver in Missouri, with his 4-year-old kid in the car the entire time.\n  When they got back to the Twin Cities, he actually confessed to the \ncrime. When they had the funeral for this woman, there were only five \npeople in that Russian church. There was the family who had come over \nfrom Russia--the parents and the sister--and there was myself and our \ndomestic violence advocate. That little girl was there too.\n  The story the family told me was this: The sister of the victim--the \nsister of the woman who was killed--was her identical twin. The little \ngirl had never met her aunt because she lived in Russia. When they got \noff that plane from Russia, the little girl ran up to her aunt--who was \nthe identical twin of her dead mother--she ran up to her and hugged her \nand said, ``Mommy, mommy, mommy,'' because she thought it was her \nmother.\n  It reminds all of us that domestic violence is not just about one \nvictim, it is about a family and it is about a community and it is \nabout a country. That is why we have the opportunity to get this bill \ndone, to put it up for a vote, and reauthorize the Violence Against \nWomen Act--something we have done time and time again on a bipartisan \nbasis. So let's do it again.\n  Mr. President, I see we have been joined by the Senator from New \nYork, a member of the Judiciary Committee, who has worked so hard on \nthis bill, Senator Schumer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I congratulate my colleague from \nMinnesota who has the dual experience of being both a prosecutor and a \nwoman who understands how important these issues are. We men try to \njoin in, but women know this so well and so strongly, whether from \ntheir own personal experiences, friends they know or--as in the case of \nthe Senator from Minnesota who has done a great job on this--from their \nprofessional experience as well.\n  I care a lot about this issue. I carried the Violence Against Women \nAct, the first bill, in 1994. Then-Senator Biden put it together in \n1992. Senator Boxer carried it when she was elected to the Senate. They \nasked me to carry it, and we got it passed.\n  It has changed the world. VAWA has changed the world. It used to be, \nbefore VAWA, a woman would show up bloodied and bruised at a police \nstation, and the police officer--who had no training and no knowledge \nof what to do, not his or her fault--would say: Go home. It is a family \nmatter.\n  Now, of course, we have laws, we have training, we have shelters, and \nwomen are far more protected.\n  We were much too close, in 1994, to the old rule of thumb that a \nhusband could beat his wife with a stick, provided it was no thicker \nthan his thumb. We are much further away from that because of this law, \nand it makes a great deal of sense.\n  But similar to any good and important law that has changed the world, \nwe have to keep updating it. We have to keep learning from what has \nhappened and make it better and stronger and tougher and covering more \nground. We need it.\n  Still, despite VAWA's good acts, in my home State, on Long Island \nalone, during 2009 and 2010, there were 19,417 cases in which local, \ncounty or State police officers were called to the scene of a domestic \nviolence complaint. That is just in two counties in one State in this \ncountry.\n  That is why I am so glad to see Members on both sides of the aisle \nhave finally seen that saving the lives of women is, once again, above \npolitics.\n  It has been a pleasure, over the years, to work with my colleagues, \nand I wish to thank Chairman Leahy and Senator Crapo for their great \nleadership. It is truly a bipartisan effort, with 61 cosponsors, and \nthat is how it has been in the past. It has always been bipartisan. It \nis a tribute not only to Chairman Leahy but to my female colleagues, \nmany of whom have spoken out this morning and have been constant \nchampions of the Violence Against Women Act.\n  So this bill should be an easy one. The Violence Against Women Act \nshould be low-hanging fruit. Even in a disputatious Congress, this \nshould pass easily. It passed unanimously--Democrats and Republicans--\nin 2000 and 2005. Recognizing today's tougher times, as well as the \nsuccesses with which our past efforts have already been met, Chairman \nLeahy and Senator Crapo cut spending by 20 percent and reduced \nduplicative programs. So you would not think there would be opposition, \nbut, unfortunately, there has been.\n  So this fact is clear: It would be unacceptable to show less support \nnow in 2012 for our national commitment to stop violence and abuse and \nto protect women against this plague than we have over the last 20 \nyears. We should not step backward. We should not halt progress. \n``Replace'' is the operative word. What has been offered is not a \nsubstitute or an improvement for the Violence Against Women Act. The \nso-called alternative would take violence against women and replace it \nwith a different program.\n  This program has worked. It needs improvements. That is why we are \nhere. But it is has worked. You do not start over for ideological or \npolitical reasons. Most notably in the act from my colleagues across \nthe aisle, the word ``women'' has been taken out of the program that \nforms the cornerstone of the Violence Against Women Act and the word \nhas been replaced with ``victim.'' No one here would argue against the \nprinciple that all violent crimes, all domestic crimes are tragic and \nserious. But this so-called substitute negates centuries of women's \nexperience that proves that violence against women, especially violence \ncaused by spouses and partners and family members, is a uniquely \npernicious and entrenched practice, one that has not even always been \nillegal. There was never a rule of thumb that governed the size of a \nstick that wives would use to beat their husbands. That sums it up in a \nnutshell. Men were never banned from juries. Men were never banned from \npolice forces and prosecutors' offices. It is this horrific and \nshameful history to which we responded in 1994 when we first crafted \nthe Violence Against Women Act.\n  There is another point to be made. Anyone who respects the proper \nrole of the Federal Government in fighting crime should recognize that \nit is entirely rational for us to limit our police powers and funding \nin this area to a particular type of crime, one that has civil rights \nimplications, one that has been hard for States and localities to \nprosecute without special support and training. That is why there is no \nsubstitute for the Violence Against Women Act.\n  There are a number of priorities that have been included in the bill \nthat I have cared a lot about.\n  First is making sure that sexual assault victims do not have to pay \nfor their own forensic exams. While the last reauthorization took some \nsteps to fix this problem, we go further.\n  Second, VAWA, having contributed immensely to our understanding and \nprevention of domestic violence, has been reinvigorated and retargeted \nat sexual assault crimes. Many aspects of the new bill will improve the \nreporting, law enforcement training, and victim support.\n  Third, it expands programs that are available to victims and law \nenforcement in rural and underserved areas. This is extremely important \nto upstate New York, which has one of the largest rural populations in \nthe country.\n\n[[Page S2756]]\n\n  Fourth, as I mentioned, Senator Leahy and Senator Crapo should be \napplauded for including more oversight and accountability for programs \nin this bill and finding a way to trim the authorization by 20 percent \nby consolidating programs where it makes sense.\n  To make the continued need for this bill concrete personal, I would \nlike to point out one massive success story in New York that has been \nmade possible by VAWA. There are many others, but I want to point out \none.\n  On Long Island, thousands of women each year seek help from the \nNassau County Coalition Against Domestic Violence. The coalition offers \nconfidential, specialized services for victims of domestic and dating \nviolence, elder abuse, children who witness domestic violence, and \nsexual assault survivors. They have a 24-hour hotline, group and \nindividual counseling, legal advocacy, Safe Home emergency housing, and \nvarious other outreach programs. Without VAWA, these services would be \ndrastically cut back.\n  Specifically, the coalition receives $650,000 over 2\\1/2\\ years \nthrough a VAWA legal assistance to victims grant, $38,000 through a \nVAWA crisis intervention grant, and $12,000 through a rape advocacy \ngrant. These last two may not sound like large sums of money, but they \ngo a long way toward helping prevent domestic violence and dealing with \nit when it, unfortunately, happens.\n  The reauthorization of VAWA is more important than ever. In today's \neconomy, local municipalities, as we know, in New York and throughout \nthe country are slashing their social service budgets and contracts \nright and left. Without VAWA, many groups such as the Nassau County \ncoalition would be left bereft and all of the good work they have done \nover the years would no longer be there. Without agencies such as this \none, where will a sexually assaulted Levittown woman turn for help? \nWell, I do not want to find out. I, for one, will do everything in my \npower to ensure that day never comes by supporting this VAWA, not some \nnew law that has not been tested.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, we are going to be joined here shortly \nby the Senator from New Hampshire, Mrs. Shaheen, but I do want to \nmention one other aspect.\n  Many of my colleagues have mentioned the incredibly important role \nthat then-Senator Biden, now-Vice President Biden played in drafting \nthis first bill in 1994. Well, there was another Senator who played an \nimportant role, and he is someone from Minnesota; that is, the late \nSenator Paul Wellstone, always with his wife Sheila with him at his \nside working on this important issue. When we lost Paul and Sheila in \n2002, Minnesotans lost a tireless champion in Congress; Americans lost \nwhat was always called--Paul was called ``the conscience of the \nSenate''; and women everywhere lost two powerful voices on domestic \nviolence issues.\n  I went back through the transcripts and looked at some of the \nspeeches Senator Wellstone gave, before his tragic plane crash, about \ndomestic violence and some of the things he said. Here are some. Of \ncourse, I would never do justice to him as he stood on the floor, but \nhe said things like this. He said:\n\n       We can no longer stand by and say that it is someone else's \n     problem. What are we waiting for? Too many have spoken with \n     their voices and with their lives, and this violence must \n     end.\n\n  He also said this:\n\n       Once upon a time we used to say it is nobody's business. We \n     do not believe that any longer.\n\n  Paul and Sheila passionately believed that domestic violence was not \njust a law enforcement issue, it was an issue about civil rights, \njustice, and human dignity. Paul often talked about his brother \nStephen, who struggled with mental illness his entire life, and he took \nup that cause because he knew no one was there for Stephen, no one else \nwould speak for him. And he felt the same way about domestic violence.\n  We honor their memory--Paul and Sheila--by carrying on their work \ntoday.\n  I wish to highlight some of the more remarkable efforts to bring this \nissue out of the shadows which the Wellstones made.\n  Senator Wellstone began work on issues of domestic violence when he \nwas elected to the Senate in 1990. As one can tell from the whole \ncourse of his political career, violence against women was always an \nissue close to his heart. In fact, Senator Wellstone dedicated his own \nsalary increases each year to battered women's shelters in Minnesota \nand introduced a number of bills strengthening protections for women.\n  To Senator Wellstone, family violence could no longer be dismissed as \na ``family issue.'' That is why he made a commitment to read into the \nCongressional Record the names and stories of all Minnesota women and \nchildren killed at the hands of spouses, boyfriends, and fathers. In \none 1995 floor speech, he had six stories to tell, some so horrifying \nthat he refused to share the full details in the Chamber.\n  In 1993 Paul and Sheila found an especially impactful way to bring \ntheir message to Washington. In collaboration with the Silent Witness \nInitiative, Paul and Sheila brought 27 life-size silhouettes to the \nrotunda of the Russell Office Building. Each one of the silhouettes \nrepresented one Minnesota woman murdered in an act of domestic \nviolence. You think about this now, and you might be used to seeing \nthese things. You might be used to seeing quilts that have been made \nwith each square to a victim of domestic violence or silhouettes or \nother things that go around the country. But at that time, back in \n1993, that was unique. It was something people were not talking about. \nThe Wellstones felt it was their duty to bring that forward, as did \nthen-Senator Biden and Senator Leahy and other people who were involved \nin this issue.\n  So many of the women Senators who spoke today--Senator Mikulski, \nSenator Hutchison, who I see has joined us on the floor--on a \nbipartisan basis, they all came together and said that we must get this \ndone.\n  Again, Senator Wellstone understood as well as anybody that this was \nan issue that had too long been ignored and found a way to bring the \nstory to his colleagues in the Senate. Paul and Sheila may no longer be \nwith us, but their legacy lives on. The Sheila Wellstone Institute \ncontinues its work by promoting awareness of violence against women and \nensuring that ending this problem remains a national priority.\n  The Wellstones' sons Mark and David have also continued the work \ntheir parents began through their nonprofit Wellstone Alliance. Among \nmany other things, Wellstone Action and Mark Wellstone in particular \nworked hard to ensure that the Violence Against Women Act was \nreauthorized in 2006.\n  As we look today for a potential vote on the Violence Against Women \nAct, I would like my fellow Senators to remember these words Senator \nWellstone spoke many years ago.\n  He said:\n\n       We can no longer stand by and say it is someone else's \n     problem. What are we waiting for? Too many have spoken with \n     their voices and their lives, and this violence must end.\n\n  We all know we can no longer stand by and say it is someone else's \nproblem. We cannot let our own differences, minor though they be, on \nvarious provisions get in the way of the fact that this has always been \na bipartisan bill, that this bill has 60 cosponsors, that this bill was \nled by Senator Leahy and Senator Crapo from the very beginning, a \nDemocrat and a Republican working together.\n  This is the time to pass this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I came to the floor yesterday to talk \nabout the important work on this bill that has been done by Senators on \nboth sides. Republicans and Democrats agree that we should reauthorize \nthe Violence Against Women Act and that we should have the very best \nlegislative product possible. This should be done with input from both \nparties. That is what our Chamber does. We deliberate and then we \nproduce legislation.\n  Yesterday I was talking to the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \ntalking about what his bill does, and I want to say clearly today that \nthe amendment I am producing with Senator\n\n[[Page S2757]]\n\nGrassley and many other cosponsors builds on the sentiments the \nchairman expressed yesterday.\n  It seems very simple to me that what the Republicans are asking is \nthat our substitute, which has many cosponsors--we believe it improves \non the underlying bill. And one amendment by Senator Cornyn adds much \nto the bill, helping to get the backlog of these rape kits put forward \nso that we can stop people who are perpetrating these crimes from being \nout loose doing it again, when we have the proof that has not yet been \ntested because of the backlog.\n  There are some things that can be done to improve this bill. Senator \nMikulski and I worked together on funding the Justice Department. In \nour bill, we do add to the capability for the Justice department to \ngive the grants that would make that backlog smaller. Senator Cornyn's \namendment even improves upon that. So what is not to like about two \nother approaches that would add to this bill so that we can get this \nbill passed--or one version of it--go to conference with the House, and \nreally address the issues?\n  No one is arguing that we should not pass a Violence Against Women \nAct. The question is, Can we make it even better? And if so, why not? \nWhy not have the kind of debate that we have on this floor that does \nthat? So I think it is important that we produce the best possible \nproduct.\n  Yesterday the chairman spoke repeatedly about a victim is a victim is \na victim. He spoke about how the police never ask if the victim is a \nRepublican or a Democrat, is the victim gay or straight, but that a \nvictim is a victim. And I have--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will suspend. We have a previous \norder we need to read.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/26/senate-section/article/S2757-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2757-S2761]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 F_____\n                                 \n\n NOMINATION OF GREGG JEFFREY COSTA TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n                   FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  NOMINATION OF DAVID CAMPOS GUADERRAMA TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT \n                JUDGE FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

But I \nunderstand the Senator from Texas needs more time; is that right?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Yes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. We are not on VAWA now; we are on the nominations.

The Senator from Texas was \nactually speaking on their time.\n  The Senator from Vermont is recognized under the order.\n  Mr. LEAHY. How much time does the Senator need?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I would like to have up to 5 minutes to finish the \ndebate on the VAWA bill, and then I do have remarks in support of the \ntwo judgeships that will be voted on at noon.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Texas be given 5 minutes out of the Republicans' time now to \nfinish the VAWA statement, and that we then go back to my time on the \njudges. I assume that the Republican side would be glad to have the \nrest of the time on the judges.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to make sure everyone knows \nthat the Republicans have an addition to the Violence Against Women Act \nthat we think will strengthen it.\n  For instance, there are a couple of additions from what we talked \nabout yesterday. We got a letter today from the National Center for \nMissing and Exploited Children. I ask unanimous consent that it be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               National Center for\n\n\n                                 Missing & Exploited Children,\n\n                                   Alexandria, VA, April 26, 2012.\n     Hon. Kay Bailey Hutchison,\n     Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hutchison: As you know, the National Center \n     for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) addressed the issue \n     of sentencing for federal child pornography crimes in our \n     testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in March \n     2011. The 1.4 million reports to NCMEC's CyberTipline, the \n     Congressionally-authorized reporting mechanism for online \n     crimes against children, indicate the scope of the problem. \n     These child sex abuse images are crime scene photos that \n     memorialize the sexual abuse of a child. Those who possess \n     them create a demand for new images, which drives their \n     production and, hence, the sexual abuse of more child victims \n     to create the images.\n       Despite the heinous nature of this crime, the federal \n     statute criminalizing the possession of child pornography has \n     no mandatory minimum sentence. This, combined with the \n     advisory nature of the federal sentencing guidelines, allows \n     judges to impose light sentences for possession. Congress \n     passed mandatory minimum sentences for the crimes of receipt, \n     distribution, and production of child pornography. We don't \n     believe that Congress intended to imply that possession of \n     child pornography is less serious than these other offenses. \n     NCMEC feels strongly that possession of child pornography is \n     a serious crime that deserves a serious sentence. Therefore, \n     we support a reasonable mandatory minimum sentence for this \n     offense.\n       As we have previously testified, child protection measures \n     must also include the ability to locate non-compliant \n     registered sex offenders--offenders who have been convicted \n     of crimes against children yet fail to comply with their \n     registration duties. The U.S. Marshals Service is the lead \n     federal law enforcement agency for tracking these fugitives. \n     Their efforts would be greatly enhanced if they had the \n     authority to serve administrative subpoenas in order to \n     obtain Internet subscriber information to help determine the \n     fugitives' physical location and apprehend them.\n       Thank you for your efforts to protect our nation's \n     children.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Ernie Allen,\n                                                President and CEO.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, this letter says that they strongly \nsupport two provisions in our substitute bill. It says we have a \nmandatory minimum for protection of child pornography, and they feel \nstrongly that possession of child pornography is a serious crime that \ndeserves a serious sentence. Therefore, a reasonable mandatory minimum \nfor this offense would be in order.\n  I stated yesterday, about a situation where a judge gave a 1-day \nsentence to an individual who was in possession of hundreds of images \nand videos of 8- to 10-year-old girls being raped. Really, 1 day? Mr. \nPresident, this is America. I can't even imagine that would be the \ncase.\n  Our amendment strengthens the underlying bill by saying we would have \na mandatory minimum of 1 year. My goodness, I think that is a minimum \nthis body would want to adopt.\n  We also want to make sure we can locate registered sex offenders who \nabscond. The letter we have put into the Record says law enforcement's \nefforts would be greatly enhanced if they had the authority to \ndetermine the fugitives' physical location and apprehend them. Here are \ntwo stories, and our bill would strengthen the ability to help these \nsituations.\n  Johnny Burgos was convicted in New York for rape and assault of a \nminor. Following his release from prison, he registered as a sex \noffender in New\n\n[[Page S2758]]\n\nYork, but he left. Although he seemed to be constantly on the move, the \nU.S. Marshals in the New York/New Jersey Regional Fugitive Task Force \nbelieved he was living in Pennsylvania. They attempted to obtain the \nrecords from cell phone companies, insurance companies, and the New \nYork and Pennsylvania Departments of Motor Vehicles. But because it was \nnecessary to get grand jury subpoenas for these records, the process \ntook too long and the investigation suffered. In the interim, he is \nbelieved to have committed another sexual assault in Maryland. Our bill \nwould strengthen the capabilities for the U.S. Marshals Service to get \nthat information on a timely basis.\n  This story is even worse, Mr. President. Joseph Duncan, shortly after \nhis release from custody in 2005, absconded from Minnesota and traveled \nacross country to Idaho, where he kidnapped Dylan and Shasta Groene \nfrom their home in the middle of the night. In the course of the \nkidnapping, he murdered the children's mother, brother, and the \nmother's boyfriend by beating them to death with a hammer. He then took \nthe children to remote campgrounds across State lines into Montana, \nwhere he brutally abused them and later killed Dylan--a child. He was \nessentially lost by three States, and no one even knew where he was to \nlook for him.\n  Our bill strengthens the U.S. Marshals Service's capabilities to \nattach to wherever these thugs might be who are doing these heinous \ncrimes. I also add that our bill has a strengthening of the rape kit \nissue that Senator Cornyn is trying to get to be able to offer as an \namendment to Senator Leahy's bill, the majority's bill. Senator Cornyn \nhas been trying for a long time to strengthen the ability to stop this \nbacklog and get the rape kit issue addressed so we can have the \nevidence to get the perpetrators so they will not commit these crimes \nagainst other innocent people such as Dylan and Shasta Groene.\n  I hope we will be able to have a modest one amendment, and my \nsubstitute, so we will be able to go to conference with a strong \nstrengthening of the underlying bill, which I intend to support. I am \ngoing to support the Violence Against Women Act, even if it falls short \nin these areas. But why not strengthen it in these areas so that all of \nus know we have done the best we can to send a bill to the House for \nits consideration, and then a conference committee where we can pass \nthis bill without further delay.\n  When the regular order comes back, I want to speak in favor of the \ntwo Texas judges on whom we are going to vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will speak further about the Violence \nAgainst Women Act because I believe the Leahy-Crapo, et al, bill has \nthe best balance possible to protect the most people possible.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today we are finally going to vote on the \nnominations of Gregg Costa and David Guaderrama to fill judicial \nemergency vacancies on the U.S. District Courts for the Southern and \nWestern Districts of Texas. Both of these nominees to fill judicial \nemergency vacancies have the support of their home state Republican \nSenators. Their nominations were reported unanimously by the Judiciary \nCommittee over four and a half months ago. Senator Cornyn, who is on \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee, strongly supports both of these \nnominees. The senior Senator from Texas, Senator Hutchison, supports \nthese nominees. There was a unanimous vote in the Judiciary Committee. \nStill it has taken another four and one-half months to get them before \nthe Senate for final consideration.\n  These are judicial emergency vacancies. I mention that because these \nare more examples of what I have been concerned about for the last few \nyears. Senate Republicans have refused to move promptly to confirm \nconsensus nominees. These are not ideologically driven nominees. These \nare nominees, like so many of President Obama's nominees, who are \nhighly qualified. They enjoy bipartisan support, but they are made to \nwait and wait before finally being able to be confirmed.\n  This is a destructive development. It is a new practice in the \nSenate. I can say this as one who has served here during the \nPresidencies of Presidents Ford, Carter, Reagan, George H.W. Bush, \nClinton, George W. Bush, and now President Obama. This new practice has \nkept the Senate behind the curve. It has kept Federal judicial \nvacancies unfilled. It has overburdened the Federal courts and has kept \nAmericans from getting prompt justice.\n  It should not have taken this long for these two nominees to receive \na vote. They could and should have been confirmed last year. It is \nnearly May, and the Senate is still only considering judicial \nnominations that should have been confirmed last year. There are 24 \njudicial nominees ready for final Senate consideration. Several are \nstill pending from last year. That means 150 million Americans affected \nby more than 80 judicial vacancies would see a vacancy in their \ndistrict or circuit court filled if the Senate would only be allowed to \nvote on those 24 nominees.\n  The lack of real progress during the last three and one-third years \nis in stark contrast to the way in which we moved to reduce judicial \nvacancies during the last Republican presidency. During President \nBush's first term we reduced the number of judicial vacancies by almost \n75 percent. When I became Chairman in the summer of 2001, there were \n110 vacancies. As Chairman, I worked with Senate Republicans to confirm \n100 judicial nominees of a conservative Republican President in 17 \nmonths. We expedited consideration of consensus nominees and ended the \nvacancies crisis. In contrast, despite his selecting qualified nominees \nand working with Senators from both sides of the aisle, President Obama \nhas seen judicial vacancies remain above 80 for nearly three years.\n  At this same point in the Bush administration, we had reduced \njudicial vacancies around the country to 45. Today they stand at 81. \nAnd by August 2004, we reduced judicial vacancies to just 28 vacancies. \nDespite 2004 being an election year, we were able to reduce vacancies \nto the lowest level in the last 20 years. At a time of great turmoil \nand political confrontation, despite the attack on 9/11, the anthrax \nletters shutting down Senate offices, and the ideologically driven \njudicial selections of President Bush, we worked together to promptly \nconfirm consensus nominees and significantly reduce judicial vacancies.\n\n  In October 2008, another presidential election year, we again worked \nto reduce judicial vacancies and were able to get back down to 34 \nvacancies. I accommodated Senate Republicans and continued holding \nexpedited hearings and votes on judicial nominations into September \n2008.\n  We lowered vacancy rates more than twice as quickly as Senate \nRepublicans have allowed during President Obama's first term. The \nvacancy rate remains nearly twice what it was at this point in the \nfirst term of President Bush.\n  The Senate is 32 behind the number of circuit and district court \nconfirmations at this point in President Bush's fourth year in office. \nWe are 65 confirmations from the total of 205 that we reached by the \nend of President Bush's fourth year.\n  I wish to share with the Senate and the American people a chart. This \ncompares vacancies during the terms of President Bush and President \nObama. I mention this because, look at where the vacancies were when \nPresident Bush came in. For a short time, I was chairman of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee when President Bush was President. Even though 60 \nnominees had been pocket-filibustered of President Clinton's, I said we \nwere going to change this routine. Look how quickly I brought the \nvacancies way down under President Bush. I then worked with Republicans \nto bring them down further, even though they didn't move as fast on \nPresident Bush's nominees as I had. When I was chairman, I continued to \nbring it down.\n  Then what happened when President Obama came in? All of a sudden they \nsaid: This was great that you brought down the vacancies under \nPresident Bush. We are glad to have the vacancies under President Bush \ncome down, but now the vacancies are going to come back with President \nObama.\n  This is another way to demonstrate what I have been saying. See how \nsharply the line slopes as we reduced vacancies in 2001 and 2002, when \nI was Chairman of the Judiciary Committee. See where we were in April \n2004 having reduced judicial vacancies to 45 on the\n\n[[Page S2759]]\n\nway to 28 in August. By comparison, see how long vacancies have \nremained above 80 and how little comparative progress we have made. \nAgain, if we would just be allowed to vote on the 24 judicial nominees \nready for final action we could reduce vacancies to under 60 and make \ninstant progress.\n  The American people deserve better. Our courts need qualified Federal \njudges, not vacancies, if they are to reduce the excessive wait times \nthat burden litigants seeking their day in court. It is unacceptable \nfor hardworking Americans who turn to their courts for justice to \nsuffer unnecessary delays. When an injured plaintiff sues to help cover \nthe cost of his or her medical expenses, that plaintiff should not have \nto wait three years before a judge hears the case. When two small \nbusiness owners disagree over a contract, they should not have to wait \nyears for a court to resolve their dispute.\n  Some Senate Republicans seek to divert attention by suggesting that \nthese longstanding vacancies are the President's fault for not sending \nus nominees. Let me remind my colleagues that of the 81 current \nvacancies that exist, several of them are without a nomination because \nthis President is trying to work with home state Senators, including 27 \nvacancies involving a Republican home state Senator who has refused to \neither recommend a candidate or agree to a judicial nominee. There are \nseven nominations on which the Senate Judiciary Committee cannot \nproceed because Republican Senators have not returned blue slips.\n  More importantly, there are 24 outstanding judicial nominees that can \nbe confirmed right now who are being stalled. Let us act on them. Let \nus vote them up or down. When my grandchildren say they want more food \nbefore they finish what is on their plate, my answer is to urge them to \nfinish the food already on their plate before asking for seconds or \ndessert. To those Republicans that contend it is the White House's \nfault for not sending us more nominees, I say let us complete Senate \naction on these 24 judicial nominees ready for final action. If we \ncould vote on the 24 judicial nominees ready for final action there are \nmore nominees working their way through Committee, and the Senate can \nact responsibly to help fill more of the vacancies plaguing some of our \nbusiest courts.\n  Today, we can finally fill two emergency vacancies with superbly \nqualified nominees. Gregg Costa is nominated to fill a judicial \nemergency vacancy on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District \nof Texas, where he is already well-known and well-respected for his \nservice as a Federal prosecutor. Prior to becoming a Federal prosecutor \nin 2005, Mr. Costa worked in private practice in Houston, Texas, was a \nBristow Fellow in the Office of the Solicitor General, and clerked for \nChief Justice William Rehnquist on the United States Supreme Court. The \nABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated Mr. \nCosta ``well qualified'' to serve, its highest possible rating.\n  Judge David Guaderrama is nominated to fill a judicial emergency \nvacancy on the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, \nwhere he has served as a Magistrate Judge since 2010. He previously \nserved four terms as a state court judge in El Paso, Texas, and for \nseven years as the Chief Public Defender in El Paso County. While on \nthe state bench, Judge Guaderrama implemented the first adult criminal \nDrug Court and the first Access to Recovery program in El Paso County. \nJudge Guaderrama began his legal career in 1979 as a solo practitioner \nand from 1980 to 1986 was a partner with the firm of Guaderrama and \nGuaderrama.\n\n  These are two qualified nominees from Texas. They were passed out of \nour committee last year. They should have been confirmed before we \nrecessed last year. Even typical consensus, noncontroversial nominees \nlike these two have been delayed for no good reason. In fact, we have \n24 judicial nominations currently before the Senate.\n  I have heard them say the President has to send up more nominees. Why \ndon't we confirm the 24 who are on the calendar? Then we have others \nworking through the committee process. In fact, 10 of those nominations \nthat have been pending the longest are all to fill judicial emergency \nvacancies. Every single Democrat in this body has signed off on them.\n  Again, I show this chart to show how quickly Democrats moved, while \nRepublicans did not move as quickly as they did for President Bush's \nnominees. We did that with President Ford. We did that with President \nCarter. We did that with President Reagan. We did that with the first \nPresident Bush and also with President Clinton--except for the 60 who \nwere pocket-filibustered by the Republicans. And we did that, as I have \nshown here, with President Bush. Why does it have to be a different \nsituation for President Obama? Why can't we treat President Obama the \nway we did all these other Presidents I have mentioned, since I have \nbeen here--the way we did President Ford's nominations and all the \nothers?\n  I cannot understand what it is or why President Obama has to be \ntreated differently. It is not fair to him. More important, Mr. \nPresident, it is not fair to the Federal judiciary. These vacancies \nmean there are millions of Americans--150 million Americans who are in \ndistricts or States with judicial vacancies. That means justice \ndelayed. If justice is delayed, justice is denied.\n  We can and should do better. Maybe some believe there is an advantage \nto taking partisan shots at President Obama. I disagree. They should do \nas we have done in the past and help the Federal judiciary. That should \nbe kept out of partisan politics. It is to all of our advantage. When \npeople go before a court in this country, they are not asked whether \nthey are a Republican or Democrat. They are coming to seek justice. \nThey should be allowed to have that. Let's speed up.\n  I will vote for these two judges. The Senator from Texas will vote \nfor these two judges. But they were ready to be voted on way last year. \nIt is time to get moving.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of Gregg \nCosta and David Guaderrama for their nominations to the Federal \ndistrict bench.\n  I want to say that Mr. Costa--and I will mention this again--asked \nnot to be confirmed until after the case that he was working on was \nfinished. His case was the prosecution of Robert Allen Stanford, who \nswindled so many Texans and other Americans out of money they had \ninvested. Frankly, he was all over the country in his representation.\n  Mr. Costa asked not to be confirmed until he could finish that case \nbecause it was complicated and he was the lead on it.\n  So there has been no delay on our part at all on his nomination. As I \nunderstand it, we have confirmed the same--roughly the same--number of \ndistrict judges as President George Bush and President Clinton did in \ntheir first terms. To my knowledge, we are not holding up nominations \nat all.\n  In fact, of course, Senator Cornyn and I both highly recommended Mr. \nCosta and Mr. Guaderrama to the President for his nomination because we \nhave a process that assures we nominate to the President the most \nqualified people to fill these spots. We have a bipartisan legal \ncommittee that vets them comprised of people who know the legal \ncommunity in Texas, and so, therefore, they know the reputations of \nthese lawyers, and our committee system has worked very well. I have \nserved on it with Senator Gramm, as I have with Senator Cornyn, and we \nagree on the quality of these nominees. So I don't think there is a \ndelay, and I am very pleased to be able to have nominated these two \nfine lawyers to the President.\n  I would like to talk first about Mr. Costa, who did ask to wait for \nhis confirmation, but now he is ready because the case he was working \non was decided. Mr. Costa will be serving in the Southern District in \nGalveston, TX, where I was born. Mr. Costa was born in Baltimore, MD, \nand grew up in Richardson, TX. He attended Dartmouth College, where he \ngraduated with a bachelor of arts degree in government and then \ncontinued his studies at the University of Texas School of Law where he \nserved as editor-in-chief of the Texas Law Review and received his \njuris doctorate with highest honors in 1996.\n  Mr. Costa's professional career includes being a law clerk for \nSupreme\n\n[[Page S2760]]\n\nCourt Chief Justice William Rehnquist in 2001, as well as his current \nposition serving as an assistant U.S. attorney in Houston. As the co-\nlead counsel for the United States in the prosecution of Robert Allen \nStanford, Mr. Costa secured a conviction of 13 charges of conspiracy, \nwire, and mail fraud. Mr. Costa has been credited by his colleagues as \nthe glue that held the case together. His dedication to this case and \nthese victims shows the core of his character. The fact he asked for a \ndelay in his confirmation because he wanted to finish this case and \nassure that convictions would be obtained makes me proud and pleased to \nsupport his nomination to the Federal bench.\n  I am also pleased to support the nomination of Judge David Campos \nGuaderrama to the Western District of Texas in El Paso. Judge \nGuaderrama is originally from New Mexico and moved to El Paso, TX, at a \nyoung age. He attained two bachelor degrees from New Mexico State \nUniversity in political science and psychology, then earned his juris \ndoctorate degree from the University of Notre Dame Law School in 1979.\n  In 1987, Judge Guaderrama was appointed as the first chief public \ndefender of El Paso County and continued in that service until he was \nelected to the 243rd Judicial District Court in 1995. As a testament to \nhis service to the El Paso community, Judge Guaderrama has served as a \nU.S. magistrate judge for the U.S. District Court for the Western \nDistrict for the last 2 years.\n  During his three decades serving in the Texas legal system, Judge \nGuaderrama has earned many accolades for his help and leadership in \ninitiating and enacting several successful judicial programs in west \nTexas. He has demonstrated a strong commitment to the El Paso \ncommunity, and I am confident he will serve on the Federal bench well \nand I support his nomination.\n  I would also say Senator Cornyn also supports these two judges. Of \ncourse, Senator Cornyn sits on the Judiciary Committee. Our judicial \nevaluation committee, which is bipartisan, has served so well to give \nus the highest quality nominees on the bench, and our committee did \nselect both these nominees as their first choices after their \ninterviews and input from the legal community in both El Paso and \nHouston, which includes the Galveston part of the district.\n  These nominations have been well vetted. They have been supported by \nboth sides of the aisle, and we are very pleased to put forward these \ntwo quality nominees. Senator Cornyn as well is very strongly in \nsupport of them.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n           Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2011\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I know we are about to vote on these \njudges, but I wish to make a few remarks about the VAWA reauthorization \nbefore we do so.\n  There are few tools more important in the fight to end domestic and \nsexual violence than the Violence Against Women Act. This landmark \nlegislation has fundamentally changed the way society views these \nhorrible crimes, and it has resulted in a more than 60 percent decrease \nin domestic violence offenses. We have been successful because we have \nlearned from experience and adapted our efforts to better meet the \nneeds of victims.\n  Each reauthorization of VAWA has played a critical role in this \nprocess. As we learn more about the needs of victims, VAWA has been \ncarefully modified to meet those needs. The bipartisan bill that \nSenator Crapo and I introduced last year continues that important \nprocess. The Republican substitute amendment does not.\n  The Leahy-Crapo bill is based on months of work with survivors, \nadvocates, and law enforcement officers from all across the country. We \nlistened when they told us what was working and what could be improved. \nWe took their input seriously, and we carefully drafted our legislation \nto respond to those needs. We made additional modifications and reached \ncarefully crafted compromises through what was an open process. We also \nshared our draft with Senators from both sides of the aisle and \nproceeded openly to introduce the bill so that it could be reviewed and \nimproved as the Judiciary Committee considered and voted on it.\n  Senator Crapo and I purposely avoided proposals that were extreme or \ndivisive and selected only those proposals that law enforcement and \nsurvivors and the professionals who work with crime victims every day \ntold us were essential. Our reauthorization bill is supported by more \nthan 1,000 Federal, State, and local organizations. They include \nservice providers, law enforcement, religious organizations, and many, \nmany more. There is one purpose and one purpose only for the bill that \nSenator Crapo and I introduced, and that is to help and protect victims \nof domestic and sexual violence. Our legislation represents the voices \nof millions of survivors and their advocates all over the country.\n  The same cannot be said for the Republican proposal brought forward \nin these last couple of days. That is why the Republican proposal is \nopposed by so many and such a wide spectrum of people and \norganizations.\n  The National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence Against \nWomen, which represents dozens of organizations from across the country \nsays:\n\n       The Grassley-Hutchison substitute was drafted without input \n     or consultation from the thousands of professionals engaged \n     in this work every day. The substitute includes damaging and \n     unworkable provisions that will harm victims, increase costs, \n     and create unnecessary inefficiencies.\n\n  Although well-intentioned by its lead sponsors, the Republican \nproposal is no substitute for the months of work we have done in a \nbipartisan way with victims and advocates from all over the country.\n  I regret to say the Republican proposal undermines core principles of \nthe Violence Against Women Act. It would result in abandoning some of \nthe most vulnerable victims and strips out key provisions that are \ncritically necessary to protect all victims--including battered \nimmigrants, Native women, and victims in same sex relationships. The \nimprovements in the bipartisan Leahy-Crapo Violence Against Women \nReauthorization Act are gone from the Republican proposal. It is no \nsubstitute and does nothing to meet the unmet needs of victims.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this afternoon we are considering two \nnominations for U.S. district judge positions in Texas. Gregg Jeffrey \nCosta is nominated to serve in the Southern District of Texas, while \nDavid Campos Guaderrama is nominated to serve in the Western District \nof Texas. Again, we are moving forward under the regular order and \nprocedures of the Senate. With today's nomination, we will have \nconfirmed 80 judicial nominees during this Congress. With the \nconfirmations today, the Senate will have confirmed more than 75 \npercent of President Obama's judicial nominations.\n  While we are making progress in the Senate, we continue to hear \ncomplaints about the vacancy rate. I will again remind my colleagues \nthat of the 81 vacancies, more than 58 percent of these vacancies have \nno nominee.\n  These nominations came to the committee with the support of home \nState Senators. They were reported out of committee by voice vote. \nThese nominees have exceptional records and demonstrate the type of \nconsensus nominations that can be confirmed, even in a Presidential \nelection year.\n  Mr. Costa received his B.A. degree in 1994 from Dartmouth College. He \ngraduated from the University of Texas School of Law in 1999. After law \nschool, Mr. Costa clerked for the Honorable A. Raymond Randolph on the \nDC Court of Appeals from August 1999 to July of 2000 and then for Chief \nJustice Rehnquist from July 2001 to July 2002. Between his two \nclerkships, he worked as a Bristol Fellow in the United States \nDepartment of Justice, Office of the Solicitor General.\n  In 2002, Mr. Costa joined the law firm Weil Gotshal & Manges as an \nassociate. During his time at the firm, Mr. Costa\n\n[[Page S2761]]\n\nhandled civil litigation matters including intellectual property, class \nactions, international arbitration, bankruptcy, and general commercial \ndisputes. Mr. Costa also worked on appellate matters and a few pro bono \ncases as well.\n  In 2005, he joined the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern \nDistrict of Texas, Houston office, as an assistant U.S. attorney. Mr. \nCosta has worked in the criminal division of the office in the major \noffenders and major fraud sections, investigating and prosecuting \nmatters in the areas of mortgage fraud, investment fraud, securities \nfraud, public corruption, Internet fraud, human trafficking, child \npornography, and narcotics and firearms violations. As an AUSA, Mr. \nCosta also has handled numerous appellate matters before the U.S. Court \nof Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.\n  In addition to prosecuting cases for the office, Mr. Costa serves as \nthe deputy international affairs coordinator for the U.S. Attorney's \nOffice. In this capacity, he helps coordinate incoming and outgoing \nrequests on behalf of the Governments of Malaysia, Turkey, Columbia, \nGreece, France, and the United Kingdom. Mr. Costa also helps and \nprovides guidance to other AUSAs on extradition matters. And in 2005, \nafter Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, Mr. Costa served as the hurricane \nfraud coordinator for his office that investigated fraud cases relating \nto the Hurricanes. Mr. Costa's office prosecuted more than 100 \nindividuals for crimes such as government-benefit fraud, identify theft \noffenses, charitable fraud, and investment fraud.\n  The ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary gave him a \nunanimous rating of ``well qualified.''\n  We are also considering the nomination of David Campos Guaderrama, \nnominated to be U.S. district judge for the Western District of Texas. \nAfter graduation from Notre Dame Law School, Judge Guaderrama worked as \na solo practitioner from December 1979 to August 1980. He then formed a \npartnership practice with his then wife. His practice focused on \ndefending individuals in criminal cases, but he also handled some \ngeneral civil, probate, and workers' compensation cases during this \ntime. In 1987, he was appointed to serve as El Paso County's first \npublic defender and was charged with starting up and developing an \noffice that would be capable of handling at least 50 percent of all \nindigent felony cases.\n  In November 1994, Judge Guaderrama was elected judge of the 243rd \nJudicial District Court of Texas. He was elected for a 4-year term and \nsubsequently reelected on four occasions. During his term as a Texas \nDistrict Court judge, he was instrumental in establishing the 243rd \nDrug Court Program and Access to Recovery Program. Both programs are \naimed at helping rehabilitate defendants guilty of minor drug offenses \nthrough counseling and supervision, rather than incarceration. Also \nwhile on the 243rd Judicial District he served as chairman of a \nsubcommittee that oversaw reform of the jury selection process that \nimplemented mailing jury qualification questionnaires to potential \njurors. He also piloted a program to use video conference technology to \nconduct arraignments.\n  In 2008, Judge Guaderrama was an unsuccessful candidate for justice, \nEighth Court of Appeals of Texas. In 2010, he was appointed by the U.S. \nDistrict Court of the Western District of Texas to serve an 8-year term \nas a U.S. magistrate judge. He has an ABA rating of majority ``well \nqualified'', minority ``qualified.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I rise today to speak on an issue that is profoundly \nimportant and meaningful to this body at this moment in history. We \nface a critical juncture in our Nation's history, and we absolutely \nmust renew and strengthen the Violence Against Women Act, not only for \nthe sake of women but also our families around Connecticut and this \ncountry.\n  I thank my colleagues for voting to proceed to consideration of S. \n1925, the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act. VAWA is \ncritically important. It is bipartisan legislation that gives victims \nof domestic violence and sexual assault access to the services they so \ndesperately need. This crucial law supports both the organizations that \nprovide these services and the law enforcement agencies that assist the \nvictims as they pursue justice.\n  As a law enforcement official, I saw firsthand in my duties as State \nattorney general for Connecticut how important and practical and \nmeaningful this law is. We have a responsibility to not only authorize \nbut also to strengthen VAWA right away.\n  Some 17 years have passed since the original Violence Against Women \nAct. We have made great strides, but we cannot be complacent in our \nefforts to protect our Nation's children and women. At a time when the \nwomen of our great Nation face relentless attacks on their rights, we \ncannot afford to lose the ground we have gained over the last 17 years. \nWe must address the grave concerns of domestic violence and sexual \nassault which are in no way partisan. As Chairman Leahy so eloquently \nand powerfully stated, there is nothing Republican or Democratic about \na victim who suffers from this grave ill.\n\n[[Page S2762]]\n\n  S. 1925 is a bipartisan bill written over months of negotiations and \nconsultations with critical law enforcement and victims advocacy \ngroups, and it supports a number of organizations in my home State of \nConnecticut with a mission to protect women who experience violence in \nall forms. This bill provides resources to help a number of \norganizations in Connecticut fulfill their vital mission to protect \nmore than 54,000--I am going to repeat that because that is a \nstaggering number--54,000 domestic violence victims in Connecticut \nalone.\n  Organizations in Connecticut received nearly $5 million in fiscal \nyear 2011 from the Violence Against Women Act. But many domestic \nprograms in Connecticut and around the country are reporting huge staff \nand resource shortages that are necessary to respond to the hundreds of \nthousands of women in need. It is truly an epidemic in this country \nthat we must counter and fight just as we would an epidemic of \ninfectious bacteria or other kinds of insidious sources. VAWA would \ngive these service providers the resources they need to protect women, \nmen, and children who are victims of domestic and sexual violence. We \nhave the opportunity to renew and commit to end domestic violence with \nupdates and stronger measures in this act.\n  I am pleased that S. 1925 builds on the accountability provisions in \nthe current law so we can make sure VAWA grant money is used \neffectively and efficiently to support victims. There is a new frontier \nin the fight against domestic violence and sexual assault. We must \nstrengthen provisions dealing with Internet abuse to protect women and \nothers from those kinds of threats, intimidation, harassment, even \nphysical assaults facilitated by the Internet. Domestic violence, \nsexual assault, and stalking can be even more dangerous and threatening \nin the Internet age, requiring broader and stronger protection. We must \nprotect the thousands of women who fall victim every year to violent \ncrimes facilitated by cyber stalking and impersonation with \nconsequences that are truly horrific and reprehensible.\n  I am proud to introduce a companion bill to the Violence Against \nWomen Act that enhances current law for the Internet age. This \nlegislation, the Internet Abuse Act, expands the ability of law \nenforcement to prosecute criminals who use the Internet to intimidate, \nthreaten, harass, and facilitate acts of sexual violence against women, \nchildren, and others.\n  The VAWA proposal before us includes key concepts from the Internet \nAbuse Act. One of the key provisions strengthens existing criminal \nprovisions against cyber stalking. We must take this act to the new \nfrontier of Internet abuse and make it real against the very pernicious \nand reprehensible cyber stalking, cyber harassment, and cyber assault \nthat is as much a fact of life as the older forms of domestic abuse. \nThis provision gives law enforcement the ability to go after more real \ninstances of criminal harassment and abuse online, and I want to stress \nat the same time the provision dramatically strengthens free speech \nprotections.\n  Currently, the government can prosecute individuals for merely \nannoying online communications as well as communications that may be \ngenerally offensive but not directed at a specific person. This \nprovision removes those authorities from the law so that prosecutors \nwill spend their limited resources focusing on real causes of harassing \nand abusive conduct online.\n  The law also focuses on vulnerable populations. As we strengthen \nVAWA, we must ensure that all victims of domestic violence are \nprotected and have access to the services they need.\n  Although VAWA has been strengthened and updated in every past \nreauthorization, the needs of some of our most vulnerable communities \nstill have not been fully addressed. One example is elder abuse. \nAlthough the VAWA reauthorization in 2000 included provisions to deal \nwith domestic abuse in later life, our Nation's elders continue to be \nvictims of domestic violence. I am pleased that the provisions I \ndrafted with my distinguished colleague, Senator Kohl, which improve \nthe protections for elder victims of domestic abuse, have been included \nin this reauthorization of VAWA.\n  There are LGBT protections. It would simply be unconscionable to deny \nany victim of domestic violence the support he or she needs. For that \nreason, I strongly support the provisions that ensure all victims of \ndomestic violence, regardless of gender or sexual orientation, have \naccess to lifesaving services, and we are talking about lifesaving \nservices.\n  In my experience nobody ever asked what the sexual orientation of a \nvictim was when that person was, in fact, battered and brutalized. \nThere is no such question that gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender \nindividuals experience domestic violence at the same rate as the \ngeneral population. Yet these individuals face discrimination as they \nattempt to access victims services. That should not be acceptable in \nthis country.\n  In fact, the survey found 45 percent of LGBT victims were turned away \nwhen they sought help from a domestic violence shelter. Clearly, there \nis a real need to improve the access and availability of services for \nthis vulnerable population, and I support measures in the act that \nensure victims of domestic and sexual violence, regardless of their \nsexual orientation or gender identification, can access the services \nthey need.\n  In addition, there are broader protections for Native American \ncommunities. S. 1925 makes great improvements to the law enforcement \ntools available to Native American populations. Members of the Tribal \nCouncil of the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation, a great tribal nation \nin Connecticut, have appealed to me to protect the tribal provisions in \nS. 1925 and to make sure any amendments are barred if they weaken those \nprotections.\n\n  In short, all victims of domestic violence deserve access to the \nservices they need and many of my colleagues I know agree. In fact, 61 \nfrom both sides of the aisle have signed on to the Violence Against \nWomen Reauthorization Act, and I thank every single one of them for \nstepping forward and speaking out on this profoundly meaningful and \nimportant issue. We have the opportunity to work to eliminate domestic \nand sexual violence, which is a scourge in our society, costly in \nsuffering as well as dollars, and I encourage my colleagues to keep \nfaith with the hundreds of thousands of victims who look to us for the \nsupport they need. We must vote as soon as possible--hopefully today--\nto reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I have seen the good the law called \nthe Violence Against Women Act has done in providing victim services in \nmy State of Iowa. We all recognize the harm that flows from domestic \nviolence. It is harmful to the victims as well as the families of \nvictims.\n  I have supported reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act \neach time it has come up. The Violence Against Women Reauthorization on \neach of these occasions has been highly bipartisan. We have passed \nconsensus bills and we have not played politics with reauthorizing the \nlaw; that is, until now. This time it seems to be different. I don't \nknow why it should be. The majority turned this issue into a partisan \nissue.\n  In the Judiciary Committee, the majority gave no notice it would \ninject new matters into the Violence Against Women Act. When the \ncommittee held a hearing on this issue, these ideas were not discussed. \nTheir need has not been demonstrated. We do not know exactly how they \nwill work. It was clear committee Republicans would not be able to \nagree to this new added material. Of course, the majority refused \nduring negotiations when we asked they be removed.\n  Republicans will be offering a substitute amendment to the Leahy \nbill. Probably 80 to 85 percent of the substitute we are offering is \nthe same as the Leahy bill. This includes whole titles of the bill. We \ncould have again reached a near consensus bill to reauthorize the \nViolence Against Women Act, but the majority intentionally decided not \nto change the bill. They didn't want it to pass with an overwhelming \nbipartisan majority.\n  Now the media has reported this was a deliberate strategy of the \nmajority. A recent Politico article quoted a prominent Democratic \nSenator. The article\n\n[[Page S2763]]\n\nsaid he ``wants to fast track the bill to the floor, let the GOP block \nit, then allow Democrats to accuse Republicans of waging a war against \nwomen.'' This is the cynical, partisan game-playing Americans are sick \nof. At every town meeting people say to me: When are you going to get \ntogether and stop the partisanship? This is especially the case on this \nbill.\n  Republicans aren't even blocking the bill. We have called for the \nbill to be brought up. Instead, the majority has taken 6 months to \nreauthorize this program that expired last October. That says something \nabout the priorities of the other party.\n  For instance, last week, we wasted time on political votes. That \nseems to be the case in the Senate most of this year. The Senate can \npass a bill to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act by an \noverwhelming margin, but it seems as though the other party doesn't \nwant that to happen. When they say unfavorable things about Republicans \nand women, they aren't being forthright. A few weeks ago, the \nDemocratic Congressional Campaign Committee sent out a fundraising e-\nmail. The e-mail stated, in part:\n\n       Now, there are news reports that Republicans in Congress \n     will oppose re-authorizing the Violence Against Women Act. \n     Enough is enough! The Republican War on Women must stop NOW . \n     . . Will you chip in $3 by midnight tonight to hold \n     Republicans accountable for their War on Women?\n\n  The majority had a decision between raising money for campaigns or \ntrying to get the Violence Against Women Act reauthorization bill that \nwould actually help these victims. I say to my colleagues, there is no \nwar on women except the political one. It is a figment of the \nimagination of Democratic strategists who don't want to remember health \ncare reform, unemployment or high gas prices. Instead of talking about \nthose issues--particularly high gas prices--they would rather make up a \nwar against women. All evidence points to the other side being more \ninterested in raising money.\n  The media has also reported the bill is coming out now because the \nDemocrats' desire to gin up a Republican so-called war on women was \nderailed last week, I suppose by other issues. It should be clear at \nthe outset Republicans are not blocking, have not blocked, and never \nthreatened to block the Senate's consideration of this bill. The \nJudiciary Committee only reported the bill to the Senate 2 months ago. \nIt was March before the committee filed its usual committee report to \nthe entire Senate. Democrats immediately came to the floor and urged \nthe bill to come up right now. It was up to the majority leader to \ndecide when the bill should be debated. He finally decided--not right \nafter the bill was reported out of committee or not right after the \ncommittee report was filed--to do it now. Why not back then?\n  As long as there is a fair process for offering amendments, including \nour alternative bill and pointing out the flaws in the majority's bill, \nthis should be a relatively short process. As the previous speaker \nsaid, I hope we can get it done this very day.\n  There are several other important points I wish to establish. First, \nI hope a consensus version of the Violence Against Women Act will be \nreauthorized. If a consensus bill doesn't pass, no rights of women or \nanyone else will be affected if the bill does not pass because, \ncontrary to the statements made, there would be no cutbacks of \nservices.\n  The Violence Against Women Act--the bill before us--is an \nauthorization bill only, not an appropriations bill. This bill does not \nallow the expenditure of one dime because that result occurs through \nthe appropriations process. Appropriators can and will fund the \nViolence Against Women Act programs regardless of whether this bill is \nreauthorized. This is exactly what happened over the past year. We \nthink new issues have arisen since the last Violence Against Women Act \nreauthorization. These issues should be addressed in a consensus \nreauthorization. That can happen. We should give guidance to the \nappropriators. That is what authorization committees, such as in this \ncase, the Judiciary Committee, is all about.\n\n  I support the appropriators continuing to fund the Violence Against \nWomen Act while we are trying to put together a consensus bill. The \nViolence Against Women Act is being funded despite the expiration of \nits previous authorization. No existing rights of anyone are affected \nif the Violence Against Women Act is not reauthorized. No existing \nrights of anyone are affected if we pass a consensus bill rather than \nthis partisan bill--I should say the majority's bill, not the partisan \nbill.\n  Second, the majority controls how bills move in the Senate. As I \nsaid, the current Violence Against Women Act reauthorization expired 6 \nmonths ago. If reauthorization was so important, I think the majority \nparty could have moved to reauthorize this bill months ago. They didn't \nmove a bill because no one's substantive rights or funding are at \nstake. This is true, even though the prior reauthorization has expired \nand a new reauthorization bill has not yet passed.\n  Third, nothing like the majority's bill, where it does not reflect \nconsensus, will become law. It is a political exercise. The other body, \nmeaning the House of Representatives, doesn't seem as though it is \ngoing to pass it the way the majority party here wants it to pass. If \nwe want to pass a consensus violence against women reauthorization \nbill, we ought to start with the alternative Senator Hutchison and I \nare going to present to the Senate.\n  Fourth, the majority's bill, as reported out of committee, was and is \nfiscally irresponsible. According to the Congressional Budget Office, \nthe majority's bill would have added more than $100 million in new \ndirect spending. That will increase the deficit by that same amount. \nThe reason is the immigration provisions that we said previously were \nnonstarters. These were some of the provisions the majority refused to \ntake out. Those provisions are bad immigration policy. Nonetheless, I \nam glad the majority has now found an offset for this spending.\n  The Republican alternative does more to protect the rights of victims \nof domestic violence and sex crimes than does, in fact, the majority \nbill. There are many ways in which this substitute does that. Under the \nsubstitute amendment, more money goes to victims and less to \nbureaucrats. It requires that 10 percent of the grantees be audited \nevery year. This is to ensure taxpayer funds are actually being used \nfor the purpose of the legislation--to combat domestic violence.\n  This is a very important point. The Justice Department inspector \ngeneral conducted a review of 22 grantees under this law between 1998 \nand 2010. Of these 22 audits, 21 were found to have some form of \nviolation of grant requirements. The violations range from unauthorized \nand unallowable expenditures to sloppy recordkeeping and failure to \nreport in a timely manner. When this happens, the money is not getting \nto the victims and the taxpayers' money is being wasted.\n  Let me give some examples. In 2010, one grantee was found by the \ninspector general to have questionable costs for 93 percent of the \nnearly $900,000 they received from the Justice Department. A 2009 audit \nfound that nearly $500,000 of a $680,000 grant was questionable.\n  The fiscal irregularities continue. An inspector general audit from \njust this year found that this law's grant recipients in the Virgin \nIslands engaged in almost $850,000 in questionable spending. Also, a \ngrant to an Indian tribe in Idaho found about $250,000 in improperly \nspent funds. This included--can my colleagues believe it--$171,000 in \nsalary for an unapproved position.\n  In Michigan this year, a woman, at a VAWA grant recipient facility, \nused grant funds to purchase goods and services for personal use.\n  We should make sure then that Violence Against Women Act money goes \nto victims and not to waste such as this. That hasn't been the case, \nobviously, under the current situation. So our Republican substitute \ndeals with this spending problem.\n  The substitute also prevents grantees from using taxpayer funds to \nlobby for more taxpayer funds. That will ensure that more money is \navailable for victims' services. Money that goes to grantees and is \nsquandered helps no woman or other victims.\n\n  In addition, the Republican alternative limits the amount of Violence \nAgainst Women Act funds that can go to administrative fees and salaries \nto 7.5 percent. That means money that now is over the 7.5-percent \nsuggested\n\n[[Page S2764]]\n\nlimit is going to bureaucrats and not to victims. Of course, the \nunderlying bill, the Leahy bill, contains no such limit. If you want \nthe money to go to victims and not bureaucrats, those overhead expenses \nshould be capped at this 7.5-percent level.\n  The Republican substitute amendment requires that 30 percent of the \nSTOP grants and grants for arrest policies and protective orders are \ntargeted to sexual assault. The Leahy-Crapo bill sets aside only 20 \npercent instead of that 30 percent to fight sexual assault.\n  The substitute Senator Hutchison and I offer--hopefully this \nafternoon--requires that training materials be approved by an outside \naccredited organization. This ensures that those who address domestic \nviolence help victims based on knowledge and not ideology. This will \nresult in more effective assistance to victims. The Leahy-Crapo bill \ncontains no such requirement.\n  The Hutchison-Grassley substitute protects due process rights that \nthe majority bill threatens. I will give you an instance. The majority \nbill said that college campuses must provide for ``prompt and equitable \ninvestigation and resolution'' of charges of violence or stalking. This \nwould have codified a proposed rule of the Department of Education that \nwould have required imposition of a civil standard or preponderance of \nthe evidence for what is essentially a criminal charge, one that, if \nproved, rightly should harm reputation. But if established on a barely \n``more probable than not'' standard, reputations can be ruined unfairly \nand very quickly. The substitute eliminates this provision.\n  The majority has changed their own bill's language. I thank them for \nthat. I take that as an implicit recognition of the injustice of the \noriginal language.\n  The substitute also eliminates a provision that allowed the victim \nwho could not prove such a charge to appeal if she lost, creating \ndouble jeopardy.\n  The majority bill also would give Indian tribal courts the ability to \nissue protection orders and full civil jurisdiction over non-Indians \nbased on actions allegedly taking place in Indian country.\n  Noting that the due process clause requires that courts exercise \njurisdiction over only those persons who have ``minimum contacts'' with \nthe forum, the Congressional Research Service has raised constitutional \nquestions about this provision. The administration and its supporters \nin this body pursue their policy agendas headlong without bothering to \nconsider the Constitution. The substitute contains provisions that \nwould benefit tribal women and would not run afoul of the Constitution.\n  We have heard a lot of talk about how important the rape kit \nprovisions in the Judiciary Committee bill are. I strongly support \nfunds to reduce the backlog of testing rape kits. But that bill \nprovides that only 40 percent of the rape kit money actually be used to \nreduce the backlog. The substitute requires that 70 percent of the \nfunding would go for that purpose and get rid of the backlog sooner.\n  It requires that 1 percent of the Debbie Smith Act funds be used to \ncreate a national database to track the rape kit backlog. It also \nmandates that 7 percent of the existing Debbie Smith Act funds be used \nto pay for State and local audits of the backlog.\n  Debbie Smith herself has endorsed these provisions. The majority bill \nhas no such provisions. Making sure that money that is claimed to \nreduce the rape kit backlog actually does so is provictim. True reform \nin the Violence Against Women Act reauthorization should further that \ngoal.\n  Combating violence against women also means tougher penalties for \nthose who commit these terrible crimes. The Hutchison-Grassley \nsubstitute creates a 10-year mandatory minimum sentence for Federal \nconvictions for forcible rape. The majority bill establishes a 5-year \nmandatory minimum sentence. That provision is only in there because \nRepublicans offered it and we won that point in our committee.\n  Child pornography is an actual record of a crime scene of violence \nagainst women. Our alternative establishes a 1-year mandatory minimum \nsentence for possession of child pornography where the victim depicted \nis under 12 years of age.\n  I believe the mandatory minimum for this crime should be higher. In \nlight of the lenient sentences many Federal judges hand out, there \nshould be a mandatory minimum sentence for all child pornography \npossession convictions. But the substitute is at least a start. This is \nespecially true because the majority bill takes no action against child \npornography.\n  The alternative also imposes a 5-year mandatory minimum sentence for \nthe crime of aggravated sexual assault. This crime involves sexual \nassault through the use of drugs or by otherwise rendering the victim \nunconscious. The Leahy bill does nothing about aggravated sexual \nassault. The status quo appears to be fine for the people who are going \nto vote for the underlying bill if the Hutchison-Grassley amendment is \nnot adopted.\n  Instead, the Hutchison-Grassley amendment establishes a 10-year \nmandatory minimum sentence for the crime of interstate domestic \nviolence that results in the death of the victim.\n  It increases from 20 to 25 years the statutory maximum sentence for a \ncrime where it results in life-threatening bodily injury to, or the \npermanent disfigurement of, the victim.\n  It increases from 10 to 15 years the statutory maximum sentence for \nthis crime when serious bodily injury to the victim results.\n  The Leahy bill contains none of these important protections for \ndomestic violence victims.\n  The substitute grants administrative subpoena power to the U.S. \nMarshals Service to help them discharge their duty of tracking and \napprehending unregistered sex offenders. The Leahy bill does nothing to \nhelp locate and apprehend unregistered sex offenders.\n  And the substitute cracks down on abuse in the award of U visas for \nillegal aliens and the fraud in the Violence Against Women Act self-\npetitioning process. The majority bill does not include any reforms of \nthese benefits, despite actual evidence of fraud in the program.\n  One of the Senators who recently came to the floor complained that \nthere had never been controversy in reauthorizing the Violence Against \nWomen Act. But in the past there were no deliberate efforts to create \npartisan divisions. We always proceeded in the past in a consensus \nfashion.\n\n  Domestic violence is an important issue, serious problem. We all \nrecognize that. In the past, we put victims ahead of politics in \naddressing it. When the other side says this should not be about \npolitics and partisanship, why, heavens, we obviously agree. It is the \nmajority that has now decided they want to score political points above \nassisting victims. They want to portray a phony war on women because \nthis is an election year. They are raising campaign money by trying to \nexploit this issue, and I demonstrated that in one of the e-mails that \ncame to our attention.\n  There could have been a consensus bill before us today, as in the \npast. There is controversy now because that is what the majority seems \nto want. We look forward to a fair debate on this bill and the chance \nto offer and vote on our substitute amendment. That amendment contains \nmuch that is in agreement with the Leahy bill. The substitute also is \nmuch closer to what can actually be enacted into law to protect victims \nof domestic violence.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, I rise today in support of S. 1925, the \nViolence Against Women Act reauthorization of 2011.\n  Since its enactment in 1994, VAWA has enhanced the investigation and \nprosecution of incidents of domestic and sexual violence and provided \ncritical services to victims and their advocates in court. It has truly \nbeen a lifeline for women across the country, regardless of location, \nrace, or socioeconomic status.\n  For these reasons, VAWA's two prior reauthorizations were \noverwhelmingly bipartisan. This year, however, a number of my \ncolleagues are opposing the Violence Against Women Act reauthorization \nbecause they object to, among other things, the authority that it \nrestores to Native American tribes to prosecute those who commit \nviolent crimes against Native women.\n  This bill's tribal provisions address the epidemic rates of violence \nagainst Native women by enabling VAWA programs to more directly and \npromptly\n\n[[Page S2765]]\n\nrespond to their concerns and needs. These tribal provisions are \ncritical to the lives of Native women and doubly important to me as \nchairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs and a Native \nHawaiian.\n  Native women are 2\\1/2\\ times more likely than other U.S. women to be \nbattered or raped. These are extremely disturbing statistics: 34 \npercent of Native women will be raped in their lifetimes and 39 percent \nwill suffer domestic violence. That is more than one out of every three \nNative women. We must come together to put a stop to this.\n  Last summer I chaired an oversight hearing entitled ``Native Women--\nProtecting, Shielding, and Safeguarding Our Sisters, Mothers, and \nDaughters.'' I heard the heartbreaking stories that lie behind the grim \nand troubling statistics on violence against American Indian, Alaska \nNative, and Native Hawaiian women.\n  My committee heard from the chief of the Catawba Nation, who gave a \nmoving account of his experience growing up with domestic violence and \nthe impact it had on the women and children in his community. He also \nspoke of the importance of reauthorizing VAWA.\n  We heard from officials who described how existing laws are failing \nNative women. We heard, for example, that women in tribal communities \nlive in a confusing and dangerous jurisdictional maze, in which the \nabsence of clear lines of authority often leads to offenders, many of \nwhom are non-Native men, escaping investigation and prosecution, to say \nnothing of punishment. This outrageous and unacceptable situation has \nled to repeated offenses against Native women that too often spiral \ninto violence with tragic consequences for the women, their children, \nand their communities.\n  My committee also heard that Native women are being increasingly \ntargeted by the sex-trafficking industry and that many have, according \nto police reports in tribal communities across the country, simply \nvanished into this terrible underworld. The draft bill to address \nviolence against Native women was circulated to a wide range of \nstakeholders for feedback. This led to strengthened provisions in the \ndraft bill which I introduced as S. 1763, the Stand Against Violence \nand Empower Native Women Act.\n  The Senate Committee on Indian Affairs held a legislative hearing on \nmy bill the following month and then reported it out of the committee \nin December.\n  Since then, I have worked closely with my good friend and colleague \nSenator Leahy, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, as we developed S. \n1925, which now includes the SAVE Native American Women Act. S. 1925's \ntribal provisions empower tribal courts to prosecute crimes of domestic \nviolence, dating violence, or violations of protection orders \nregardless of the race of the alleged abuser. This bill also \nstrengthens research and programs to address sex trafficking. Since \nVAWA was enacted 18 years ago and reauthorized twice since then, a \nhallmark of the law is that it has expanded its protections to classes \nof once neglected victims. Accordingly, S. 1925's tribal provisions are \nconsistent with VAWA's history as well as its intent and purpose, which \npast Congresses have embraced.\n  Last week 50 law professors from leading institutions across the \ncountry sent a letter to Congress expressing their ``full confidence in \nthe constitutionality of the legislation and in its necessity to \nprotect the safety of Native women.'' Just this week the White House \nreleased a Statement of Administration Policy stating that it strongly \nsupports these provisions, which will ``bring justice to Native \nAmerican victims.''\n  I commend Chairman Leahy for his dedicated leadership in developing \nthis bill. He has truly worked in the spirit of aloha by partnering \nwith the Indian Affairs Committee and other offices to craft a VAWA \nreauthorization bill that reasserts VAWA's intent, purpose, and \nhistory.\n  I would also like to say mahalo--thank you--to each of this bill's \nother bipartisan cosponsors. As we all know, domestic and sexual \nviolence continues to occur, and far too many women across the country \nare victims of these horrible acts. We have heard from victims, from \nservice providers, and from law enforcement that these crimes can leave \nvictims with lasting emotional and physical scars, while endangering \ntheir security, their families, and their lives.\n  This bill will strengthen the Violence Against Women Act and extend \nits protections to include Native women who are underserved in the \ncurrent system.\n  This is not an issue that should divide us along partisan lines. On \nthe contrary, it should unite us to take a stand against these awful \ncrimes. So I urge you to join me and the rest of S. 1925's cosponsors \nto protect our sisters, mothers, and daughters and pass this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, I rise to speak about our Constitution's \nFederalist structure and the real danger of the Federal Government \nunduly interfering with the ability of States and localities to address \nactivities and concerns in their communities.\n  Everyone agrees that violence against women is reprehensible. The \nViolence Against Women Act reauthorization had the honorable goal of \nassisting victims of domestic violence, but it oversteps the \nConstitution's rightful limits on Federal power. It interferes with the \nflexibility of States and localities that they should have in tailoring \nprograms to meet particular needs of individual communities, and it \nfails to address problems of duplication and inefficiency.\n  First, violent crimes are regulated and enforced almost exclusively \nby State governments. In fact, domestic violence is one of the few \nactivities that the Supreme Court of the United States has specifically \nsaid Congress may not regulate under the commerce clause. As a matter \nof constitutional policy, Congress should not seek to impose rules and \nstandards as conditions for Federal funding in areas where the Federal \nGovernment lacks constitutional authority to regulate directly.\n  Second, the strings Congress attaches to Federal funding in the VAWA \nreauthorization restrict each State's ability to govern itself. Rather \nthan interfering with State and local programs under the guise of \nspending Federal tax dollars, Congress should allow States and \nlocalities to exercise their rightful responsibility over domestic \nviolence. State and local leaders should have flexibility in enforcing \nState law and tailoring victim services to the individualized needs of \ntheir communities, rather than having to comply with one-size-fits-all \nFederal requirements.\n  Third, even if the Federal Government had a legitimate role in \nadministering VAWA grant programs, the current reauthorization fails to \naddress many instances of duplication and overlap among VAWA and other \nprograms operated by the Department of Justice and by the Department of \nHealth and Human Services, nor does it address the grant management \nfailings by the Government Accountability Office.\n  My opposition to the current VAWA reauthorization is a vote against \nbig government and inefficient spending and a vote in favor of State \nautonomy and local control. We must not allow a desire by some to score \npolitical points and an appetite for Federal spending to prevent States \nand localities from efficiently and effectively serving women and other \nvictims of domestic violence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, when my wife Frannie and I decided that \nI should run for the Senate, we were greatly influenced by the example \nset by Senator Paul Wellstone and his wife Sheila. The Wellstone \nexample serves as a constant reminder of what public service is all be \nabout. It is about helping others. It is about giving a voice to those \nwho otherwise might go unheard. It is about making the law more just \nand more fair, especially for those who need its protections the most.\n  Frannie and I have a personal responsibility to carry on the \nWellstones' legacy. We all do. And you know what, I think Paul and \nSheila would be proud of what we are doing here today. We are on the \nverge of reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act.\n  Paul and Sheila were extraordinary people. An unlikely couple, Sheila \nwas born in Kentucky to Southern Baptist\n\n[[Page S2766]]\n\nparents. Paul was born here in Washington, the son of Russian-Jewish \nimmigrants. But love and fate--they work in mysterious ways--brought \nPaul and Sheila together.\n  Sheila's family moved to Washington, where she and Paul became high \nschool sweethearts. Paul went to North Carolina for college, and Sheila \nwent back to Kentucky. But a freshman year apart was more than they \ncould bear. Sheila moved to North Carolina to be with Paul. They got \nmarried. A year later they were proud parents. They eventually would \nhave two more children. The Wellstones were a big happy family.\n\n  After Paul earned his Ph.D. in political science, the Wellstones \nmoved to Minnesota, where Paul had a successful teaching career at \nCarleton College. Sheila, meanwhile, worked two jobs: She was a full-\ntime mother and a part-time library aide.\n  A happy family life in Minnesota would have been enough for most \npeople but not for Paul and Sheila. Their compassion knew no limits. \nThey wanted to make the world a better place for others, and they set \nout to do just that. Paul ran for public office. He and Sheila worked \nas a team during Paul's Senate campaign, as they did in all aspects of \ntheir lives. Paul's opponent outspent him by a large margin, but what \nPaul and Sheila lacked in resources they made up for in grassroots \nsupport, a tireless work ethic, and an unparalleled commitment to the \npeople of Minnesota, and also quite a bit of charm. Improbable as it \nmust have seemed at the outset, Paul won. He was elected to the Senate \nin 1990. So the Wellstones went to Washington, the city where they \nfirst fell in love.\n  At the time, Sheila was not really a public figure--at least she did \nnot view herself as such. In fact, Sheila was a bit shy, and she \navoided public speaking when she could. But Sheila started spending \ntime at women's shelters in Minnesota and elsewhere, listening to \npainful stories about domestic violence and assault. She realized there \nwere a lot of women across the country who needed a voice, who needed \nsomeone to speak up for them. Sheila set out to become that person.\n  Here is what she said:\n\n       I have chosen to focus on domestic violence because I find \n     it appalling that a woman's home can be the most dangerous, \n     the most violent, and, in fact, the most deadly place for \n     her. And if she is a mother, it is dangerous for her \n     children. It is time that we tell the secret. It is time that \n     we all come together to work toward ending the violence.\n\n  Sheila matched her words with action. She became a champion for \nsurvivors of domestic violence in Minnesota and throughout the country. \nEach year, she hosted an event in the Capitol to raise awareness about \nthat issue. That annual event continues to this day. And as I said, \nSheila and Paul were a team, so Sheila worked very closely with Paul to \nchampion the Violence Against Women Act, a landmark Federal law that \naffirmed our Nation's commitment to women's safety.\n  Signed into law in 1994, VAWA increased the number of beds and \nshelters that were available to women who needed refuge. It provided \ncritical support to law enforcement officers and prosecutors so they \ncould respond more effectively to incidents of domestic violence. It \nfunded support services and crisis centers for victims. And perhaps \nmost importantly, VAWA sent a message: Domestic violence no longer will \nbe tolerated in America. Since VAWA was enacted, incidents of domestic \nviolence have been reduced significantly. VAWA has improved lives. It \nhas saved lives. It is part of the Wellstones' proud legacy.\n  VAWA is part of this institution's legacy too. When it comes to \nviolence against women, Members of the Senate always have been able to \ncome together. VAWA has been reauthorized twice. Both times it had \nunanimous support in the Senate--unanimous support. The VAWA \nreauthorization bill we are considering today is in keeping with VAWA's \nbipartisan tradition. Its 61 cosponsors come from across the country \nand across the aisle.\n  I am grateful to Senators Leahy and Crapo for their leadership on \nthis bill.\n  The VAWA Reauthorization Act renews our national commitment to \nprevent responsive incidents of sexual assault, a heinous crime that \nremains all too common in America, even while domestic violence is \nbecoming less common.\n  The VAWA Reauthorization Act addresses the alarming rates of violence \nagainst women in Indian Country by giving tribes jurisdiction to \nprosecute acts of domestic violence in their communities. The VAWA \nReauthorization Act cuts redtape and spending by consolidating grant \nprograms and improving accountability measures.\n  This is a good bill, and I am proud to support it. I am also proud to \nhave written two of its provisions. I thank Chairman Leahy for inviting \nme to do so and for including those provisions in the final bill.\n  First, the VAWA reauthorization bill includes the provision from the \nJustice for Survivors of Sexual Assault Act, one of the first bills I \nwrote after being sworn into the Senate. When this bill becomes law, \nsurvivors of sexual assault never again will suffer the indignity of \npaying for forensic medical exams. VAWA provides State and local \ngovernments with funding to administer these exams, which also are \nknown as rape kits, and are used to collect evidence in sexual assault \ncases. The problem is that under current law, grant recipients can \ncharge the survivor for the upfront cost of administering the exam, \nleaving the survivor to seek reimbursement later. Too often survivors \nare not reimbursed. They get lost in the maze of paperwork or are left \nhigh and dry when funds run out.\n  Can you imagine if we required crime victims to pay for the police to \ngather evidence such as fingerprints from a crime scene? Of course not. \nWe should not require victims of sexual assault to pay for rape kits. \nThis isn't a partisan issue; it is common sense.\n  I am grateful to Senator Charles Grassley, the Judiciary Committee's \nranking member, for his ongoing support for this bill. He was an \noriginal cosponsor when I introduced it in 2009 and when I reintroduced \nit last year.\n  Survivors of sexual violence have endured enough already. They should \nnot have to pay for rape kits. They will not have to once this bill \nbecomes law.\n  The VAWA reauthorization bill also includes the Housing Rights for \nVictims of Domestic and Sexual Violence Act, legislation that I \nintroduced with Senators Collins and Mikulski last fall. This bill will \nhelp women stay in their homes when they are most vulnerable, when they \nneed a roof over their heads the most.\n  The link between violence and homelessness is undeniable. By one \naccount, nearly 40 percent of women who experience domestic violence \nwill become homeless at some point in their lives--nearly 40 percent. \nOnce a woman becomes homeless, she becomes even more vulnerable to \nphysical or sexual abuse.\n  In my State nearly one in three homeless women is fleeing domestic \nviolence, and half of those women have children with them. That is not \nthe world that Sheila Wellstone envisioned. Nobody should have to \nchoose between safety and shelter. While the link between violence and \nhomelessness is undeniable, it is not unbreakable. We need shelters and \ntransitional housing programs for women who are fleeing danger. The \nVAWA reauthorization bill provides continued support for those \nprograms.\n  There is also much we can do to prevent women from becoming homeless \nin the first place, such as housing rights legislation, which will make \nit unlawful to evict from federally subsidized housing a woman just \nbecause she is a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual \nassault, or stalking. This bill is for every woman who has hesitated to \ncall the police to enforce a protective order because she was afraid \nshe would be evicted from her home if she did so.\n  I am grateful to the many wonderful organizations that have worked \nwith me on this bill. They include women's victims advocacy groups such \nas the Minnesota Coalition Against Sexual Assault, the MNCASA, and the \nMinnesota Domestic Abuse Project. They include tenant advocacy groups \nsuch as the National Low-Income Housing Coalition. They include the \nLegal Aid Society, Minnesota Legal Assistance, and they include leaders \nof the housing industry too. In fact, I recently received a letter from \nthe National Association of Realtors, the Institute for Real Estate \nManagement, and other housing industry representatives expressing their \nsupport for this bill.\n\n[[Page S2767]]\n\n  They wrote that they ``believe that preserving housing for victims of \ndomestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking is \ncritically important.''\n  I could not agree more. That is exactly what this bill does.\n  Sheila Wellstone isn't with us today. Sheila and Paul and their \ndaughter Marcia were tragically taken from us too soon. But Sheila's \nexample is with us, her legacy is with us, and her words are with us. I \nwould like to close with those. Here is what Sheila said:\n\n       We really have to look at the values that guide us. We have \n     to work toward the ethic that expects every individual to be \n     physically and emotionally safe. No one, regardless of age, \n     color, gender, background, any other factor, deserves to be \n     physically or emotionally unsafe. In a just society, we \n     pledge to act together to ensure that each individual is safe \n     from harm. In a just society, I think we have to say this \n     over and over and over: We are not going to tolerate the \n     violence.\n\n  Madam President, the VAWA reauthorization bill is another step toward \na more just society, as Sheila was describing. I look forward to it \nbecoming law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I rise today with the surest conviction \nthat this body--united as a group of Democrats and Republicans--can and \nwill vote to ensure the women and children of this country are free \nfrom domestic abuse. I believe that opposing the bill before us would \ndefy every ounce of common sense I have in my body.\n  I am a proud sponsor of the Violence Against Women Act, as are most \nof my colleagues in this body, because it is unfathomable that any \nindividual could oppose efforts to ensure women and children are free \nfrom violence.\n  The bill we are currently considering would reauthorize several \nessential grant programs that have made a tremendous difference in my \nState of West Virginia and across this Nation. Here is what I have \nheard from the West Virginia Coalition Against Domestic Violence Team \nCoordinators Sue Julian and Tonia Thomas:\n\n       The Violence Against Women Act is the most critical piece \n     of federal legislation affecting the safety of survivors of \n     domestic violence and their children in every county of West \n     Virginia. [The law] supports cost-effective responses to the \n     pervasive and insidious crimes of domestic violence. VAWA \n     funds innovative, successful programs that are at the core of \n     our nation's response to domestic violence, sexual assault, \n     dating violence and stalking. Action taken at the \n     congressional level to end violence against women, \n     children, and men echoes through the hills and hollows of \n     the most remote communities in this state. Without VAWA, \n     the collaborative efforts of law enforcement, prosecution, \n     victim advocates, and judicial personnel would be \n     fragmented, compartmentalized, and at worse \n     counterproductive to each other. VAWA saves lives, changes \n     communities, offers safety and creates channels of hope.\n\n  We know since it first passed in 1994, the Violence Against Women Act \nhas reduced domestic violence by more than 50 percent through the \ncritical programs it funds. Still, violence against women and children \nis a terrifying reality in this country.\n  Let me share with you some startling statistics that illustrate the \nscope of the problem.\n  According to the West Virginia Foundation for Rape Information and \nServices--our State's sexual assault coalition--one in six women in \nWest Virginia will be a victim of attempted or completed rape.\n  According to the West Virginia Coalition Against Domestic Violence, \non any given day, licensed domestic violence programs in West Virginia \nprovide services to nearly 600 women, children, and men.\n  Every 7 minutes a call is made to a domestic violence hotline in West \nVirginia. One-third of homicides in West Virginia are related to \ndomestic violence. More than two-thirds of women murdered in West \nVirginia are killed by a member of their family or their household.\n  In 2010, there were 11,174 investigations into domestic violence \nallegations in West Virginia, which required 272,450 hours of law \nenforcement involvement. This legislation is a fight on behalf of the \nwomen whose stories are contained in those numbers but whose lives are \ninvaluable and more important than any statistic could ever hope to \nportray. No one can better speak to the importance of the Violence \nAgainst Women Act than the groups whose work each and every day is \nimproved because of the programs supported by the law.\n  Growing up in a small community, as I did in Farmington, WV, in a \nloving family, violence against women and children was unfathomable. I \nwould not even have thought it. The most beautiful people in my life \nwere my mother, my grandmother, my sister, my aunts, and my cousins. \nThey were the most beautiful people I could have hoped to grow up with. \nMy grandmother--we call her Mama Kay--had been the glue to our family \nand kept it together, and she really kept the community together. She \nwas a symbol of strength to whom others would turn for a place to stay \nor a hot meal in times of trouble.\n  We celebrated and admired the women who raised us and those around \nus. We thanked them and loved them and showed them appreciation and \nrespect. So it is incomprehensible to me how anybody could make a \ndecision to inflict physical pain on a woman or a child or even a man. \nTruly, life is tough enough without involving violence.\n  Once again, for each and every Member of the Senate who will cast a \nvote on this bill, the question comes down to this: What is it that we \ntruly value? What are our priorities?\n  Ensuring that women and children have adequate protection against \nviolence just makes common sense. To the people of West Virginia, I \nknow this is the highest of priorities. Of course, these atrocities are \nnot unique to my State. Nationally, domestic violence accounts for 22 \npercent of the violent crimes experienced by women and 3 percent of the \nviolent crimes against men.\n  Approximately 37 percent of the women seeking injury-related \ntreatment in hospital emergency rooms were there because of injuries \ninflicted by a current or former spouse or partner. In tough economic \ntimes--like those we are experiencing now--women are more likely to \nbecome a victim of domestic violence.\n  According to the National Network to End Domestic Violence, domestic \nviolence is more than three times as likely to occur when couples are \nexperiencing high levels of financial strain as when they are \nexperiencing low levels of financial strain. Women whose male partners \nexperienced two or more periods of unemployment over a 5-year study \nwere almost three times as likely to be victims of intimate violence as \nwere women whose partners had stable jobs.\n  Seventy-three percent of shelters attributed the rise in abuse to \n``financial issues.'' ``Stress'' and ``job loss'' were also frequently \ncited as causing the increase of victims seeking shelter. It goes on \nand on.\n  All we are asking for is to make this a nonpartisan issue--come \ntogether as Americans, as Senators, not worrying about political \ndifferences. This is one bill that brings us all together for a common \ncause--a most decent cause--and something that is needed in America.\n  I urge the support of all of my colleagues. Please support this. \nLet's come back together as Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Madam President, I rise to join my colleagues in calling \nfor passage of the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act. I am \ndisheartened that in the last several months petty, partisan \ngamesmanship has held up this legislation.\n  Since VAWA originally passed on a bipartisan basis in 1994, the \nannual incidence of domestic violence has decreased by 53 percent. Many \nvictims are now reporting incidents of abuse rather than hiding in \nfear. Reports of abuse have increased by 51 percent. This law has \ntransformed our criminal justice system and victim support services. \nThe law has worked well because it encourages collaboration among law \nenforcement, health and housing professionals, and community \norganizations to help prevent and respond to intimate partner violence.\n  In one recent instance in my State, a man was on pretrial release \nafter being charged with stalking his wife. Thanks to the STOP grants \nfunding--which provide services and training for our officers and \nprosecutors--he was being\n\n[[Page S2768]]\n\nmonitored. This individual was being electronically monitored and was \ncaught violating the conditions of his release when he went to his \nestranged wife's home. The supervising officer was immediately notified \nof this violation and police officers found the man with the help of \nthe GPS and arrested him in his estranged wife's driveway.\n  Thank goodness this woman was protected and this incident did not add \nanother victim to the 73 deaths caused by domestic violence each year \nin North Carolina.\n  Unfortunately, though, the well-being of women in North Carolina and \naround the country hangs in the balance until we in Congress take \naction on this act.\n  Domestic violence also hurts our economy. It costs our health care \nsystem $8.3 billion each year. The reauthorization of this act \nstreamlines crucial existing programs that protect women while \nrecognizing the difficult fiscal decisions facing the Federal \nGovernment today. Thirteen existing programs would be consolidated to \nfour, which will reduce administrative costs and avoid duplication. New \naccountability provisions will also require strict audits and \nenforcement mechanisms aimed at ensuring these funds are used wisely \nand efficiently.\n  In fact, title V of this bill includes one of my bills--the Violence \nAgainst Women Health Initiative. My bill provides vital training and \neducation to help health care providers better identify the signs of \ndomestic violence and sexual assault. It helps medical professionals \nassess violence and then refer patients to the appropriate victim \nservices.\n  This training would have helped Yolanda Haywood, a woman who, as a \nyoung mother of three, found herself in an abusive marriage. Her \nhusband abused her regularly and one night punched her in the face and \nsplit her lip, which sent her to the emergency room. She obviously \nneeded stitches. As she sat on the examination table, the physician who \nwas sewing her lip back asked: Who did this to you? Yolanda quietly \nsaid: My husband. The physician responded by telling her she needs to \nlearn how to duck better.\n  Yolanda spent the next several years learning how to duck before \nfinally leaving that abusive relationship. Empowered by her experience, \nshe went to medical school and now teaches students at a prestigious \nuniversity the importance of identifying and treating domestic violence \nand sexual assault, as well as working in an ER.\n  In a recent visit to a woman's domestic shelter in Charlotte, I met a \ncounselor who shared this story with me. A young boy had just spent his \nfirst night at the shelter. The next morning the counselor was talking \nto him and he said he slept with both eyes shut last night. The \ncounselor asked the young boy: Well, how do you usually sleep? He said: \nI usually sleep with one eye open and one eye closed because the last \ntime I slept with both eyes closed my mommy and I both got hurt.\n  This is the kind of experience this bill will help with. It will \nprotect women and children. For all the progress we have made combating \nviolence against women, this must continue to be a priority. I urge \neach of my colleagues to support the reauthorization of the Violence \nAgainst Women Act because it literally saves lives in North Carolina \nand around the country, while ensuring a better future for our \nchildren.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                    National Flood Insurance Program\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I rise to talk about another vital \nprogram we must reauthorize and continue before it expires; that is, \nthe National Flood Insurance Program. Right now, that is due to \ncompletely expire at the end of May. So I wanted to bring this to \neveryone's attention, particularly that of the majority leader, so we \ntake this up in time--as soon as possible--and put it in line \nabsolutely as soon as possible so this can be extended and there will \nbe no interruption.\n  This is an important program for the country. It provides vital flood \ninsurance for millions of Americans. Many properties cannot have a real \nestate closing on them. They cannot be transferred without that \nimportant flood insurance. It is particularly important in my home \nState of Louisiana, where the risks of flooding--coastal and \notherwise--are even greater than the national average.\n  Unfortunately, we have been on a path the last few years of just \nbarely hobbling along, using a bandaid approach to extend this \nnecessary program just a little bit at a time. This got to its worst \nstate in 2010, when we not only extended it just a little bit at a \ntime, but we actually allowed it to lapse, to expire, for several days \nat a time on four different occasions, for a total of 53 days. What \nhappened? Each of those times the program expired, many real estate \nclosings--tens of thousands of real estate closings around the \ncountry--came to a screeching halt. They were cancelled. They were put \noff.\n  So here we are, in a very soft economy and trying to eke out of a \nreal estate-led recession. Yet for no good reason--because of our \ninability to, frankly, get our act together and organize ourselves and \nextend this noncontroversial program--we had lapses in the program so \nthat thousands of real estate closings were put off. That lapse \noccurred, as I said, in 2010, four different times, for a total of 53 \ndays.\n  Since then, we have improved a little bit. We have extended the \nprogram for 6 months at a time under legislation I have introduced. But \nnow we need to take the next step and not just continue to hobble along \nbut have a full reauthorization, with important bipartisan reforms, of \nthis National Flood Insurance Program.\n  There has been a lot of work done in that regard. The House of \nRepresentatives has done a complete reauthorization bill, and they \nadopted that bill by an overwhelming vote of 406 to 22 last July 2. So \nthey have acted. They have done their part going back going almost 1 \nyear ago--about 9 months ago. On the Senate side, we have made \nimportant bipartisan progress in the Banking Committee, which is the \ncommittee of jurisdiction. We have worked hard to put together a full \n5-year reauthorization bill with reforms on a bipartisan process.\n\n  As ranking member of the relevant subcommittee, I have put a lot of \nwork into this with many others, including my subcommittee chairman Jon \nTester. We reported that bill through the entire committee. It got a \nstrong report out of committee and is ready for action on the Senate \nfloor. So now we need to take that next step. We need to get it on the \nSenate floor, pass it through, and reconcile it with the House bill.\n  There are no major substantive obstacles. This is a true bipartisan \neffort. We have worked well together and through a number of issues. \nThe only issue is getting time on the Senate floor and moving this \nforward so we can do this full-scale, 5-year reauthorization before the \nprogram expires this May 31.\n  Again, I just come to the floor to urge all of us, and in particular \nthe majority leader who sets the schedule, to schedule this, to find \nthat time, to put it in line as soon as possible. We are now on the \nViolence Against Women Act, which we support being on. I believe next \nwe are moving to student loans. I have no problem with that. But let's \nput this important measure in line right after that, as soon as \npossible, so we can take it up and accomplish this task well before the \nMay 31 deadline.\n  We can get this done. As I said, there are few, if any, substantive \nhurdles. We can get this done. We can produce a long-term \nreauthorization, we can produce good reforms in that bill, as we have \nin the Senate committee bill and as the House has. We just need to move \nit through the process. I certainly commit to everyone, starting with \nthe majority leader, that if we get that minimal amount of time on the \nSenate floor, we will certainly work to have that process run as \nsmoothly and as quickly as possible. I have worked with Senator Tester \nin that regard, toward that end, and we will continue to work through \nthe remaining Senate proceedings.\n  Finally, in support of this plea, I have a letter, dated February 13 \nof this year, addressed to the majority and minority leaders from a \nlong list of Senators, both parties, urging that we take this action, \nurging that we schedule this for the Senate floor absolutely as soon as \npossible so we can get this job\n\n[[Page S2769]]\n\ndone. As I said, this letter was dated February 13. Obviously, a few \nmonths have passed since then and the clock is ticking and that clock \nruns out on May 31.\n  Again, I urge us, particularly the majority leader, to please put \nthis necessary and important and bipartisan legislation in line for \nfloor consideration as soon as possible. We can get this done. We can \nget this done by the current deadline. We can get this done for the \ngood of the American people and on a bipartisan basis and I urge us all \nto work toward that end, as Jon Tester and I have been doing and as the \ncommittee chair and ranking member have been doing. I certainly know \nthe ranking member of the committee, Senator Shelby, strongly supports \nthis plea.\n  At this time, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe letter to which I have just referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 13, 2012.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Leaders Reid and McConnell: As we begin the Second \n     Session of the 112th Congress, we the undersigned urge you to \n     bring legislation to the floor to provide for a long-term \n     reauthorization and meaningful reform of the National Flood \n     Insurance Program (NFIP) as expeditiously as possible in \n     February or very soon thereafter.\n       The National Flood Insurance Program was first established \n     in 1968, and has since that time been instrumental in \n     protecting America's families, homes and businesses from \n     financial ruin when flooding occurs. The program was last \n     reauthorized in 2004. That reauthorization expired in 2008, \n     and since then the program has been extended through a series \n     of short-term measures. In fact, the program expired four \n     times in 2010 resulting in lapses totaling 53 days. It has \n     been estimated that those program lapses resulted in the \n     delay or cancellation of more than 1,400 home closings per \n     day, further damaging an already fragile housing market.\n       As you know, the House of Representatives passed its \n     version of a long-term reauthorization on July 12, by an \n     overwhelming vote of 406 22. The Senate Banking Committee has \n     reported a committee print with overwhelming bipartisan \n     support which is currently awaiting floor action. This bill \n     makes essential changes to the program in an attempt to \n     protect taxpayers and restore its solvency. We sincerely \n     believe that, with a concerted effort on the part of Senate \n     and Banking Committee leadership, as well as interested \n     Senators, the bill can be brought to the floor of the Senate, \n     debated and passed as soon as possible in order to ensure \n     this process is completed before the NFIP expires at the end \n     of May.\n       The Senate should take this opportunity to capitalize on \n     the bipartisan efforts by both the Senate Banking Committee \n     and the House of Representatives thus far to make major \n     improvements to this important program. We believe that \n     passage of a comprehensive, bipartisan flood reauthorization \n     bill is within reach, and we respectfully urge you to \n     schedule such a debate.\n           Sincerely,\n       Senator Jon Tester, Senator David Vitter, Senator Ben \n     Nelson, Senator Kay Hagan, Senator Daniel Akaka, Senator \n     Michael Bennet, Senator Thomas Carper, Senator Amy Klobuchar, \n     Senator Jeff Merkley, Senator Mark Warner, Senator Herb Kohl, \n     Senator Mike Crapo, Senator Scott Brown, Senator Johnny \n     Isakson, Senator Mike Johanns, Senator John Boozman, Senator \n     Bob Corker, Senator Saxby Chambliss, Senator Pat Roberts, \n     Senator Susan Collins.\n       Senator Joseph Lieberman, Senator Robert Menendez, Senator \n     Richard Blumenthal, Senator John Kerry, Senator Daniel \n     Inouye, Senator Bernard Sanders, Senator Jeanne Shaheen, \n     Senator Sherrod Brown, Senator Al Franken, Senator \n     Christopher Coons, Senator Daniel Coats, Senator Jerry Moran, \n     Senator Lamar Alexander, Senator Olympia Snowe, Senator James \n     Inhofe, Senator Jack Reed, Senator Claire McCaskill, Senator \n     Patrick Leahy, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Senator Mark \n     Begich, Senator Richard Burr.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Again, I hope we all come together in plenty of time to \ntake care of this important business. I bring it up now, well before \nthe deadline, because the clock is ticking. A Senate bill would have to \nbe reconciled with the House. We need to get floor time absolutely as \nsoon as possible and I look forward to that happening and I look \nforward to working with Senator Tester and others on the Senate floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise, as do my Democratic \ncolleagues and quite a few of my Republican colleagues, in support of \nthe Violence Against Women Act.\n  My remarks will extend beyond the time we have left, so I will ask \nthe Chair to advise me when 2 minutes have passed, and I will try to \nconclude over a 3-minute timeframe so other colleagues can speak on \nthis very important piece of legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will so advise.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, the Violence Against Women \nAct--known as VAWA--has been in effect for 18 years and it has saved \nlives and strengthened families all over the country. I speak as a \nColoradoan, and I will cite statistics that will point to the concrete \neffects the Violence Against Women Act has had in my State.\n  This was a landmark piece of legislation and it changed the way we \nthink about and respond to domestic violence. It has made a difference \nin the lives of literally millions of women all over the country by \nbringing the perpetrators of domestic violence, sexual assault, and \nchild abuse to justice. It has made a difference by providing safe and \nsecure support services to victims of crimes. It has established a \nNational Domestic Violence Hotline and so much more. It is little \nwonder such a commonsense and far-reaching concept in legislation has \nfound support from Members of both sides of the aisle.\n  I mentioned Colorado. Let me cite some numbers. In 2010 alone, 60,000 \nvictims of domestic violence contacted State crisis hotlines seeking \nhelp. The funding that VAWA provides not only gives our law enforcement \nbeefed up resources and tools for catching and then prosecuting \nperpetrators, but it also supports critical services for victims and \nsurvivors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 2 minutes.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. I thank the Chair.\n  These resources have literally saved the lives of women from Durango \nto Craig and from Pueblo to Denver, and I wish to commend all the \nimportant organizations in my State that make it all possible.\n  The great news is that today--right now--we have the opportunity to \nmake this an even better piece of legislation.\n  This reauthorization builds upon and strengthens the current act, \nexpanding access to the resources so many victims desperately need. It \nalso contains important reforms that will increase accountability in \nthe use of VAWA resources, ensuring these federal dollars are going to \nserve the victims who need them most. Taxpayers demand that we spend \ntheir monies wisely especially during tough economic times and this \nVAWA bill meets that high standard they expect of us.\n  Moreover, it is worth noting this bill makes college campuses safer \nby requiring that schools develop comprehensive plans to combat and \nprevent crimes against women.\n  It also takes the imperative step of strengthening the Federal \nGovernment's response to domestic and dating violence on tribal lands, \nwhich has climbed to near epidemic levels across the country.\n  Furthermore, it increases protections and outreach for LGBT victims, \nbecause the right to live free from domestic violence should not depend \non gender identity or sexual orientation.\n  The most recent reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act \nexpired in September of last year. The bottom line is that it is past \ntime to get this done. The legislation before us today has 61 \ncosponsors, is broadly bipartisan, and has the support of countless \nwomen and men around the country.\n  I believe there is an alternative version of this bill that may come \nbefore us for a vote as well. I know this is an election year, and the \nincreasingly partisan climate in Congress has made it tempting to take \ntruly bipartisan legislation such as this and inject division into the \ndebate. But the issues addressed by VAWA are not partisan to the people \nback in Colorado and around the country. So let is resist that path.\n  The bipartisan legislation drafted by Senator Leahy and Senator Crapo \nis the only bill that truly provides the resources necessary in the \nmost effective way to help end violence against women.\n  I know my colleagues in the Senate share my commitment to reaching \nthis goal, so I am glad this bipartisan bill is finally receiving a \nvote.\n\n[[Page S2770]]\n\n  When I served in the House of Representatives, I worked with a \nbipartisan group of colleagues to reauthorize VAWA both in 2000 and \n2006, so I know we can come together and pass this reauthorization as \nwell.\n  We all agree that violence against women is unacceptable. This is a \nnecessary and carefully constructed bill that will protect the lives of \nwomen in Colorado and throughout the country.\n  In concluding, we all agree violence against women is flatout \nunacceptable, and this is a necessary and carefully constructed bill \nthat will protect the lives of women in Colorado and throughout the \ncountry. So let's come together in the Senate, put aside our \ndifferences, and pass what is a strong and important bipartisan bill. \nThe families and the communities of my State and our country are \ncounting on us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I too rise today to discuss the incredible \nimportance of the Violence Against Women Act.\n  For nearly 18 years, the Violence Against Women Act has been the \ncenterpiece of our Nation's commitment to end domestic violence, dating \nviolence, and sexual violence. Congress authorized the Violence Against \nWomen Act in 2000 and again in 2005 with overwhelming bipartisan \nsupport.\n  I am a longtime champion of the prevention of domestic violence \nbecause I have seen the impact of this abuse firsthand in Idaho. The \nact provides critical services to victims of violent crime as well as \nagencies and organizations that provide important aid to those victims.\n  The Violence Against Women Act has been called by the American Bar \nAssociation ``the single most effective federal effort to respond to \nthe epidemic of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and \nstalking in our country.''\n  This legislation provides access to legal and social services for \nsurvivors. It provides training to law enforcement, prosecutors, \njudges, attorneys, and advocates to address these crimes in our \nNation's communities. It provides intervention for those who have \nwitnessed abuse and are more likely to be involved in this type of \nviolence. It provides shelter and resources for victims who have \nnowhere else to turn, who are literally victims in their own homes.\n  There is significant evidence that these programs are working. In \nIdaho, the number of high school students reporting that they have \nexperienced violence by a dating partner has dropped since the Center \nfor Healthy Teen Relationships began its work in 2006. The U.S. \nDepartment of Justice reported that the number of women killed by an \nintimate partner decreased by 35 percent between 1993 and 2008.\n  The legislation is working and our collective efforts across this \ncountry to respond to this epidemic are working, but our fight against \ndomestic violence is far from over. Last year in my State 22 people \nwere killed by a domestic partner. Approximately one in three \nadolescent girls in the United States is a victim of physical, \nemotional, or verbal abuse from a dating partner. Nearly 1 in 10 high \nschool students Nationwide was hit, slapped, or physically hurt on \npurpose by their boyfriend or girlfriend.\n  Future tragedies of the kinds we have seen in Idaho and across this \ncountry have to be prevented. And while we may not all agree on the \nspecifics of this reauthorization, all of us agree on one very \nimportant aspect; that is, we must end domestic violence, dating \nviolence, sexual assault, and stalking in the United States.\n  No bill is ever perfect. As we go through the process of working \nthrough this bill on the floor, we will see amendments brought seeking \nto perfect and improve it. I will support some of those amendments, \nothers will support some of those amendments, and the bill will be \naddressed, as all bills should be, on the floor of the Senate. But when \nwe are done and the debate is over and the voting on the amendments is \nconcluded, I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting the \nreauthorization of this critical program. We must continue the life-\nchanging work this legislation helps us accomplish.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, as we speak, the Alaska Network on \nDomestic Violence and Sexual Assault's 24-hour hotline that allows \nfolks to seek assistance--their numbers are ringing. This evening, 363 \nAlaskans will spend the night in an emergency domestic violence shelter \nor in transitional housing provided by an Alaskan domestic violence \nprogram, programs such as the Lee Shore Center in Kenai, the Safe \nShelter in Dillingham, the WISH shelter in Ketchikan, and the AWAIC \nshelter in Anchorage. The number of Alaskans seeking shelter is rising \non the order of over 5 percent per year. These programs and the \nAlaskans who benefit from them are all supported by the Violence \nAgainst Women Act.\n  As we debate and deliberate on the reauthorization of VAWA, the \nViolence Against Women Act, we express our respect for the volunteers \nand the professionals who support and who constantly advocate on behalf \nof these victims. These are Alaskans such as Peggy Brown and Katie \nTePas, who lead the effort across my State, and others like them \nthroughout Alaskan communities. It is important that as we again \nreauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, we do so as a tangible \ndisplay of our support for their very important work.\n  Let me share some statistics with you, as others have shared from \ntheir respective States. In Alaska, somewhere between 25 and 40 percent \nof all domestic violence assaults are witnessed by children. On a \nnational scale, more than 90 percent of abusers are people whom \nchildren know, love, and trust.\n  I come to the floor today to express my support for the Leahy bill, \nS. 1925. I have proudly cosponsored this effort and came on very early \nin the effort. It is the product of literally thousands of hours of \nwork by domestic violence advocates and dedicated Senate staff members. \nI do believe it represents a real improvement in the services that are \noffered to victims even in a difficult budget environment. I would like \nto give a few illustrations.\n  Back in 2010, there were more than 800 Alaskans who sought pro bono \nlegal assistance from the Alaska Legal Services Corporation and the \nAlaska Network on Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault. A little over \n500 of these victims could be served. Another 300 had to be turned away \ndue to the lack of resources--turning people away who are victims \nbecause we don't have the resources to provide the help. This bill \nestablishes a new pro bono legal program within VAWA to ensure that \nvictims of domestic violence have access to lawyers.\n  Back in 2011, 12 percent of Alaska high school students reported they \nwere hit, slapped, or physically hurt on purpose by their boyfriend or \ntheir girlfriend, and 9 percent reported they had been physically \nforced to have sexual intercourse when they did not want it. This bill \nfocuses resources on the protection of our young people--and rightfully \nso--because 70 percent of all reported sexual crimes in the United \nStates involve children. This legislation devotes needed resources to \nprotect our children, and it also devotes increasing resources to \nprotect our elders, who are increasingly victims of sexual assault and \ndomestic violence--again, a side that most people don't want to \nacknowledge or talk about, but our statistics cannot be denied.\n  In addition, S. 1925 sends a strong message to offenders that they \nwill be held accountable. In the remote Native villages of Alaska, \nwhere the victims of domestic violence literally have no place to hide, \nreauthorization of VAWA will mean there will be more funds to hire \nvillage public safety officers who are first responders in the last \nfrontier.\n  I would like to express my appreciation to the Judiciary Committee \nfor including a provision I have requested concerning the Alaska Rural \nJustice and Law Enforcement Commission. The Rural Justice Commission is \na joint Federal, State, and tribal planning body that was created by \nthe late Senator Ted Stevens back in 2004 to coordinate the public \nsafety efforts in our remote rural villages. It is in danger of \nshutting its doors at this point in time, and the legislation before us \nestablishes the framework for the Rural Justice Commission to continue \nits very important work.\n\n[[Page S2771]]\n\n  Last weekend there was a great deal of concern that arose \nparticularly amongst Alaska tribes that the version of S. 1925 that \ncame out of the Judiciary Committee diminished the ability of the \nAlaska tribes to issue domestic violence protection orders that would \nenjoy full faith and credit from the State of Alaska. The concern we \nhad was the result of an inadvertent technical drafting error that \nexpanded certain tribal powers within Indian Country, but it appeared \nto repeal other existing tribal powers that are currently held by \nAlaska tribes. Our State has very little Indian Country. We do not have \nreservations, with the small exception of one reservation down in \nsoutheastern Alaska. So for the past couple days, I have been working, \nalong with Senator Begich, to address this issue and have worked on a \ntechnical correction to address the concern in a way that ensures that \nAlaska tribes lose none of the jurisdiction or the authority they \npresently have to issue and to enforce their domestic violence \nprotection orders.\n  It was just this morning that I received a copy of a letter from Ed \nThomas, who is president of the Central Council Tlingit and Haida \nTribes of the State, and he has come out clearly endorsing the \namendment.\n  I would note that Senator Leahy has included these technical \ncorrections in the substitute amendment he intends to bring forward, \nand I would certainly urge that it be adopted.\n  As my colleague from Idaho just mentioned, there is a divergence of \nviews within this Chamber on what the reauthorization of VAWA should \nsay. It is important to point out that we are in agreement on the vast \nmajority--well over 80 percent--of the provisions in S. 1925. The \ndisagreement is in a few smaller areas. There are Senators whose ideas \nwere not incorporated in the Leahy bill and who wish to be heard, and I \nthink it is appropriate that they be heard.\n  Again, I would concur with my colleague, the Senator from Idaho, in \nstating that when the Violence Against Women Act was first initiated \nback in 1994, it was a bipartisan effort. It was a collaborative \neffort. The effort this year with the reauthorization should be no \nless. I have every confidence that this body will once again act in a \nbipartisan fashion to reauthorize this very critical piece of \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, 35 years ago I was a very young \nassistant prosecutor. There weren't any other women who were assistant \nprosecutors in Kansas City, and I got assigned a lot of cases that the \nmen in the office used to jokingly call women's work, which meant that \nI got a lot of cases on welfare fraud and food stamp fraud. And then, \nas I spent more time in the office, I got sexual assaults and I got \ndomestic violence.\n  I remember as if it were yesterday the feeling of helplessness as I \nsat across the desk from a woman who had been beaten to within an inch \nof her life, and I remember calling the police department and asking \nfor help and them saying: You know, hon, let it go. Tell her to go \nhome.\n  I remember her asking me: What do I do about my children? I have no \nmoney. I don't really want to prosecute him--I don't think he will \nleave me alone.\n  I remember not being able to sleep at night because I was so worried \nabout the women who had really no place to go, no one to guide them \nthrough the terrifying journey the criminal justice system can be, much \nless the terrifying journey their lives were. That was 35 years ago.\n  When I ran for prosecutor in 1992, I said: I am going to start a \ndomestic violence unit, because since then I had spent time working on \nthe laws in Jefferson City, and I had also spent time on the board of a \ndomestic violence shelter--one of the first in Kansas City--and then I \nbecame prosecutor, and we started a domestic violence unit.\n  The police department still pushed back and said: These aren't real \ncrimes. If the victim doesn't want to testify, we have no evidence to \ngo forward.\n  And I said to them: Wait a minute. We go forward on homicides when \nthe victims can't testify. We should build these cases around the facts \nand circumstances regardless of the mental state of the victim.\n  I remember feeling so helpless that we had no resources. And then I \nremember, as the Jackson County prosecutor in Kansas City, when the \nViolence Against Women Act passed. I remember reviewing our grant \napplication for the victim advocate in our office, and I remember all \nof a sudden thinking, you know, we are going to turn the corner.\n  Is it still a huge problem? Yes. But if you were there 35 years ago \non the front lines and you knew the progress we have made to date, you \nwouldn't be voting no in the Judiciary Committee on the reauthorization \nof the Violence Against Women Act. You wouldn't be doing that.\n  So let's move forward. Let's make sure the victim advocates who \narrive on the scene as a result of this important piece of \nlegislation--let's make sure they stay on the job. Let's make sure \nthere are not any young prosecutors today who are going home sleepless, \nmuch less victims who look at someone who claims they love them, claims \nthey are their protector, but at the same time knowing that person is \ncapable of taking their life. Let's make sure those women have \nsomeplace to turn to, their children have someplace to turn to. Let's \nreauthorize this act today and make sure all the women out there have \nthat help and assistance they need in their time of need.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, it is a shame it has taken so long to get \nto this point, but I am very glad to see we are close to having this \nbody move forward on this legislation.\n  The Violence Against Women Act has helped provide lifesaving \nassistance to hundreds and thousands of women and families, and it was \ncertainly a no-brainer to make sure that all women had access to that \nassistance. I was proud to have been here serving in the Senate in 1994 \nwhen we first passed VAWA. Along with its bipartisan support, it \nreceived praise from law enforcement officers, prosecutors, judges, \nvictims, service providers, faith leaders, health professionals, \nadvocates, and survivors. It obtained that broad support because it has \nworked.\n  Since it became law 18 years ago, domestic violence has decreased by \n53 percent. We have made a lot of progress since 1994, and I am glad we \nare continuing on that path today on behalf of all women. In fact, \nDeborah, is here with us today.\n  Deborah is the Vice Chairwoman of the Tulalip Tribe in my home State \nof Washington.\n  Yesterday she joined Senators Boxer, Klobuchar and me to tell her \nemotional story about the devastating effects violence can have on \nwomen--especially Native women.\n  Deborah was repeatedly abused, starting at a very young age, by a \nnon-tribal man who lived on her reservation. Not until after the abuse \nstopped around the 4th grade did Deborah realize she wasn't the only \nchild suffering at the hands of her assailant--at least a dozen other \nyoung girls had fallen victim to this man.\n  This is a man who was never arrested for these crimes; never brought \nto justice; and still walks free today. All because he committed these \nheinous acts on the reservation--and as someone who is not a member of \na tribe, it is an unfortunate reality that he is unlikely to be held \nliable for his crimes.\n  The debate we had over the provisions in this legislation was a \nmatter of fairness.\n  Deborah's experience--and the experience of the other victims of this \nman--does not represent an isolated incident.\n  In fact 34 percent of Native Women will be raped; 39 percent of \nNative Women will be subjected to domestic violence; and 56 percent of \nNative Women will marry a non-Indian who most likely would not be held \nliable for any violent crimes committed if these protections hadn't \nbeen included in this legislation.\n  Where people live and who they marry should not determine whether or \nnot perpetrators of domestic violence are brought to justice.\n  With this bill today, we are taking a major step to uphold our \ngovernment's promise to protect its citizens.\n\n[[Page S2772]]\n\n  This bill builds on what works in the current law, improves what \ndoesn't, and it continues on the path of reducing violence toward \nwomen.\n  It certainly should not have been controversial.\n  It is time for us to come together and support this bill so women and \nfamilies across America can get the resources and support they need.\n  I particularly want to thank the courageous work of this wonderful \ntribal woman to help explain to all of us why the bill we have put \nbefore the Senate is so critical today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent the committee-reported substitute \nbe withdrawn, that a Leahy substitute amendment which is at the desk be \nmade pending, and the only amendments in order to the Leahy substitute \nor the underlying bill be the following: Klobuchar No. 2094, Cornyn No. \n2086, and Hutchison No. 2095; that there be 60 minutes of debate \nequally divided between the two leaders or their designees for \nconsideration of the amendments and the bill; that there be no \namendment in order to any of these amendments; that there be no motions \nor points of order to the amendments or the bill other than budget \npoints of order or the applicable motions to waive; that the amendments \nbe subject to a 60-affirmative vote threshold; that upon disposition of \nthe three amendments, the Leahy substitute amendment, as amended, if \namended, be agreed to and the Senate proceed to vote on passage of the \nbill, as amended; that all after the first vote be 10-minute votes and \nthere be 2 minutes equally divided between the two votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will briefly say--I know everyone is \nanxious to get to work--we have had some pretty good work in recent \ndays. The postal bill was extremely difficult to get done. We had the \nhighway bill; that was difficult to get done. Those are bipartisan in \nnature. It took a while to get through this matter that is before us, \nbut now we are there. It is an effort on everyone's behalf. On my side, \nI am grateful for the work done by Senators Patty Murray and Pat Leahy \nand many others, but I am glad we are at the point where we are today.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I add I agree entirely with the remarks \nof the majority leader. This is the way the Senate ought to operate--on \nboth these bills, both the postal bill, which was challenging for \neveryone to get through, and the Violence Against Women Act, on which \nthere is broad, probably unanimous agreement. In fact, the last time it \npassed the Senate it did pass on a voice vote. We are proceeding to \nhandle it in a way entirely consistent with the Senate's past and \nprocedures, with some amendments but limited debate time on each of \nthem. We will be able to finish this bill today.\n  I commend Senator Hutchison and others on our side who have been \ndeeply involved in this--Senator Cornyn--in bringing us to the place we \nare now.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2093\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the substitute.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for Mr. Leahy, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 2093.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text \nof amendments.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I note my colleague from New Jersey was also \nstanding. I have about 5 minutes of remarks. Did the Senator from New \nJersey wish also to speak?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I plan to, but I will defer, if the Senator is in a \nrush.\n  Mr. KYL. I appreciate that very much and I perhaps will ask unanimous \nconsent the Senator from New Jersey follow my remarks?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--I will not \nobject--and I know we will be getting back onto this matter and I will \nbe seeking time, I certainly do not object to my two friends taking \ntime now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I support reauthorization of the Violence \nAgainst Women Act. Throughout my career, I have worked on a number of \ncrime victims' rights measures that, taken together, provide the mosaic \nof protections for all crime victims.\n  As a member of the House of Representatives, I cosponsored the Sexual \nAssault Prevention Act--SAPA--which was incorporated into the Omnibus \nCrime Control Act signed into law by President Clinton in 1994. Among a \nnumber of reforms, SAPA increased penalties for stalking and sexual \nassault, and it changed the Federal Rules of Evidence to allow \nadmission of prior sexual offenses in sexual assault cases. In 1997, I \nsuccessfully petitioned the Arizona Supreme Court to adopt this change \nto Arizona's rules of evidence.\n  In 2004, I co-authored the Crime Victims' Rights Act with Senator \nFeinstein. This legislation included a bill of rights for victims of \nFederal crimes, including the right to be informed, present, and heard \nat critical stages of the proceedings. That bill was signed into law by \nPresident Bush.\n  I also supported the 2005 reauthorization of the Violence Against \nWomen Act, which included a section Senator Cornyn and I wrote that \nexpanded the Federal DNA collection program.\n  Today, I am pleased to support the Hutchison/Grassley bill \nreauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act. I regret that there are \ncompeting versions of reauthorization, especially since I believe that \nvirtually all of us support the current law.\n  I cannot, however, vote for the Leahy version for a number of \nreasons. First, a new section, 904, is blatantly unconstitutional. This \nnew section would give Indian tribes criminal jurisdiction to arrest, \nprosecute, and imprison non-Indians under tribal law for certain \ndomestic-violence offenses.\n  Adding this language to the existing law violates basic principles of \nequal protection and due process. All tribes require either Indian \nancestry or a specific quantum of Indian blood in order to be a tribal \nmember. Even a person who has lived his entire life on the reservation \ncannot be a tribal member if he does not have Indian blood. Such a \nperson, no matter how long he has lived in the area, cannot vote in \ntribal elections and would have no say in crafting the laws that would \nbe applied against him by section 904.\n  Section 904 breaks with 200 years of American legal tradition that \ntribes cannot exercise criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians. By doing \nso, it creates a clear violation of the Constitution's equal protection \nand due process guarantees.\n  I also take issue with the new Section 905 of the Leahy bill, which \nwould allow Indian tribes to issue ``exclusion orders'' barring non-\nIndians from lands within the tribes' ``Indian country.'' ``Indian \ncountry'' is a term of art in Federal Indian law. It is meant to \ninclude lands that were allotted and sold to non-Indians, or allotted \nto Indians who later sold the land to non-Indians, but that are within \nthe exterior boundaries of a historic Indian reservation. Many non-\nIndian families have lived on such lands for generations. Other such \nresidents include people with Indian blood, but who have been expelled \nfrom membership in the tribe for various reasons. Section 905 would \nliterally allow the tribes to issue orders that bar these individuals \nfrom entering their own land, land which they own in fee simple \nabsolute.\n  The primary rationale for these proposed additions to VAWA was to \nprovide protection for tribal members. The Hutchison/Grassley \nalternative does that by replacing the unconstitutional provisions of \nthe Leahy bill with an authorization for tribes to seek protection \norders to prevent domestic violence, issued directly by a Federal \ncourt, upon a showing that the target of the order has assaulted an \nIndian spouse or girlfriend, or a child in the custody or care of such \nperson, and that a protection order is reasonably necessary to protect \nthe well-being of the victim. Violations of the order would be subject \nto criminal prosecution in Federal court.\n  While punishing an offender for any underlying crime is important, \npreventing harm is critical; and it is often easier to prosecute \nviolations of the terms of a protection order. For example, parties who \nare not in a romantic relationship with the defendant typically will be \navailable to testify that the defendant entered areas from which\n\n[[Page S2773]]\n\nhe is excluded under the order. Protection orders, thus, tend to \nprovide an effective means for preventing acts of domestic violence. \nAnd because orders would be issued by a Federal court, we can be \nreasonably certain that such orders will comply with basic principles \nof due process and will be enforced.\n  The Hutchison/Grassley reauthorization of the Violence Against Women \nAct contains other improvements on the Leahy version, and I urge its \nadoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, on this floor we talk a lot about the \ncritical importance of family. I frequently speak about my family, my \n10 grandchildren and 4 children, who are the foundation and inspiration \nfor everything I do. But for some Americans, the family is instead a \nsource of fear.\n  Domestic violence wreaks havoc in our homes and our communities \nacross the country. The statistics are shocking. Every year 12 million \nwomen and men in our country are victims of rape, physical violence, \nand stalking. The numbers are shocking. They represent a national \ntragedy. But these are not just numbers, they are lives. In 2010, 38 of \nNew Jersey's domestic violence incidents ended in death. I have visited \nwomen's shelters in New Jersey, and I have seen fear in the faces of \nwomen holding their children. It takes a lot of courage for a woman to \nstand up and leave her abuser. As a society, we have to be able to tell \nthese women they will have a safe place to go, they will have resources \nto help them, and they will see justice for their abuser.\n  Today we are debating legislation to reauthorize the Violence Against \nWomen Act, which for almost 18 years has provided women with support \nprograms they need to escape abusive situations. Make no mistake, VAWA \nis working for women. Since its passage, occurrences of domestic \nviolence have decreased by more than 50 percent. But despite this \nincredible progress, these horrible acts continue.\n  In fact, our progress should inspire us to work harder. Domestic \nviolence programs in our communities are on the front line, and they \nare starved for resources. More than one-third of New Jersey's domestic \nviolence programs report not having enough funding to provide needed \nservices, and approximately one-quarter report not having enough beds \navailable for women and children trying to escape violent situations. \nSince 2006, more than 40 programs in New Jersey alone have received \nalmost $30 million in funding through the Violence Against Women Act.\n  Let me be clear. It would be tragic to turn our backs on victims and \nthe people who dedicate their lives to supporting them. While we cannot \nstop all malicious acts, we can do more to keep women and their \nfamilies safe.\n  In 1996, I wrote the domestic violence gun ban, which forbids anyone \nconvicted of domestic violence from getting a gun. Since the law's \ninception, we have kept guns from falling into violent hands on over \n200,000 occasions. For instance, our gun laws allow domestic abusers to \nsidestep the ban on getting a gun. The loophole allows a convicted \nabuser to walk into a gun show and walk out with a gun, no questions \nasked. That is because background checks are not required for private \nsellers at gun shows.\n  Since 1999, I have introduced legislation to close the gun show \nloophole and keep guns from falling into the wrong hands, and it passed \nin the Senate with the vote of the Vice President to break the tie. \nThirteen years later, this gap in our law remains in place, and people \ncan go to the gun show, walk up to an unlicensed dealer, put the money \ndown, and walk out with a gun. It is an outrage. If we want to protect \nvictims from domestic abuse, we ought to commit ourselves to closing \nthe gun show loophole for the safety of women, their families, and \nother victims of abuse. Saving the lives of women should be above \npolitics.\n  The Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act passed the Senate \nunanimously in 2000 and 2005, and it is incomprehensible that we would \nturn our back on those who are so abused. I ask those who would vote \nagainst passing this bill to think about their own families, think \nabout their spouses, think about their daughters, think about their \nchildren.\n  Every Republican in the committee voted against reauthorizing the \nVAWA in committee. Every one of them voted against the bill that \nprimarily protects women. They walked away.\n  Today they have taken a different approach. They presented an \namendment, and it is a sham. It actually removes the word ``women'' \nfrom a key part of the bill. It also fails to protect some of our most \nvulnerable victims. Apparently, some of our colleagues would vote \nagainst protecting women if it means they also have to protect \nimmigrants and people in the gay and lesbian community.\n  I call on our colleagues on the other side of the aisle to join us \nand our families. We know they care. Show it. Show it in this vote we \nare about to take. Send a clear message that this country does not \ntolerate brutality against anyone, and show it with a little bit of \ncourage. Stand and say: No, I want to protect my family, I want to \nprotect those who are abused routinely in our society. That is the \nplea. I just hope each one of them will look at a picture of their kids \nand their families and say: I owe you that protection.\n  We worked hard here with the premise that we are protecting people, \nso let's show it.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I am here today to speak in \nsupport of S. 1925, the Reauthorization of the Violence Against Women \nAct, and I want to thank Senator Leahy and Senator Crapo for their \nleadership on this important issue.\n  Originally passed in 1994, the Violence Against Women Act has \nimproved the criminal justice system's ability to hold perpetrators \naccountable and protect victims of domestic violence. The Violence \nAgainst Women Act also provides important services to women who have \nbeen victims of domestic violence to help them get their lives back on \ntrack.\n  Now, the data tells us that the Violence Against Women's Act has been \neffective and is needed: In my State of Florida in 2010, according to \nthe Florida Department of Law Enforcement, there were 113,378 reported \ndomestic violence offenses. This includes domestic violence crimes of \nstalking, threats and intimidations, assaults, rapes, and murders. \n(SOURCE: Florida Department of Law Enforcement. (2011). Crime in \nFlorida, 2010 Florida Uniform Crime Report. Tallahassee, FL: DLE.) \nThose reports resulted in 67,810 arrests. That's about 60%. \nUnfortunately, we may not ever fully know the full extent of domestic \nviolence. Many victims do not report the abuse that they experience to \nthe police or request domestic violence services out of fear and \nembarrassment.\n  Since 1994, studies estimate that reporting of domestic violence has \nincreased as much as 51%. Across the Nation we are seeing more victims \nof domestic violence step out of the shadows, and come forward to ask \nfor help. And we are seeing more prosecution of domestic violence \nperpetrators. And, this is a trend that we want to see continue.\n  So, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to swiftly pass this \nimportant legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to add my voice in support of the \nreauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, of which I am proud \nto say I am a cosponsor.\n  In Virginia, this act has doubled the resources available for \nprevention and intervention of sexual violence in communities and on \ncampus. The funding provides crisis services in nearly every locality \nin Virginia. Funds have helped develop State databases like the \nprotective order registry in the Virginia Criminal Information Network, \nVCIN, and the I-CAN system housed with the Virginia Supreme Court. \nThese databases have helped improve responses across the Commonwealth \nto sexual and domestic violence.\n  Some startling Virginia domestic and sexual violence incidence \nstatistics highlight just how critical this legislation is to anyone in \nmy State and across the country who may find themselves in need of \nhelp.\n  Virginia has seen a 12 percent increase over the past 2 years in the \nnumber of men, women and children staying in domestic violence \nemergency shelters on an average night.\n  Nearly 1 million women and more than 600,000 men in Virginia have \nexperienced rape, physical violence, and/or stalking by an intimate \npartner.\n\n[[Page S2774]]\n\n  According to the State's medical examiner, one in three homicides in \nVirginia is due to family or intimate partner violence.\n  As these statistics show, the services authorized through VAWA \ncontinue to be a necessity. It is important that we continue to support \naccess to these vital services that will provide significant benefits \nto those most in need of assistance.\n  For the Violence Against Women Act to truly work as intended, we must \nhave effective accountability. Particularly in times of tight budgets, \nit is important to ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent wisely. It is \ncritically important that we continue to advance effective, \ncomprehensive policies that will provide appropriate preventive and \nsupportive services that many in my State, as well as across the \ncountry, will benefit from.\n  The accountability measures included in this bill are patterned after \nproposals offered by my Republican colleagues for other grant programs, \nand these accountability measures have been tailored to VAWA to make \nsure that funds are efficiently spent and effectively monitored.\n  The bill authorizes the Department of Justice's inspector general to \naudit grantees to prevent waste, fraud and abuse. It gives grantees a \nreasonable amount of time to correct any problems that were not solved \nduring the audit process, but imposes severe penalties on grantees that \nrefuse to address the problems identified by the inspector general.\n  Rather than Congress mandating a set number of audits, the Office of \nInspector General will have the ability to set the appropriate number. \nThis will give the experts in the inspector general's office the \nability to more effectively perform important oversight. The Department \nof Justice has also taken significant steps to improve monitoring of \nVAWA grant awards by updating grant monitoring policies and \nincorporating accounting training for all grantees.\n  The bill has taken the important step of holding the Department of \nJustice accountable when using Federal funds to host or support \nconferences. These new accountability provisions are an integral piece \nin this process and a meaningful additional check to ensure the \nappropriate use of taxpayer dollars for these important programs.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me in support of the \nreauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I am proud to rise today in support of the \nbipartisan Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act. I cosponsored \nthe Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) when it was originally enacted in \n1994, and have cosponsored every reauthorization since then. The \nViolence Against Women Act continues to be as important today as it was \nin 1994. The programs VAWA supports have gone a long way to help stop \nbatterers in their tracks and provide victims with the support they \nneed to recover and rebuild their lives. This reauthorizing legislation \nbuilds upon proven prevention and support strategies and includes new \nprovisions to address the changing and still unmet needs of victims.\n  VAWA has been a success story over the past 18 years because it \nencourages communities to more effectively and efficiently respond to \ndomestic violence. Working together, law enforcement, judges, domestic \nviolence shelters, victim advocates, healthcare providers, and faith-\nbased advocates are able to better prosecute abusers and protect and \naid the women, men and children who find themselves in dangerous and \npotentially life threatening domestic relationships. Programs \nauthorized by VAWA also provide victims with critical services, \nincluding transitional housing and legal assistance, and address the \nunique issues faced by elderly, rural, and disabled victims. No one \nshould have to choose between staying in a harmful relationship and \nlosing their home or job.\n  Yet, the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2011 makes \nneeded reforms and changes that will strengthen and streamline existing \nprograms, while also consolidating programs and reducing authorizations \nto recognize the difficult fiscal situation we face. The bill also \nincorporates new accountability provisions, to ensure that VAWA funds \nare used effectively and efficiently. Our bill implements cuts that \nwill save $135 million each year.\n  As Chairman of the Subcommittee on Retirement and Aging, we have seen \nfar too many instances of physical, mental, and financial abuse of our \nnation's seniors. So I thank Senator Leahy for including provisions \nfrom my End Abuse in Later Life Act. Those provisions ensure that \nappropriate enforcement tools are available to combat sexual assault \nand domestic violence against the elderly, and that older victims \nreceive victim services.\n  We commend Senator Leahy for his work on this important, bipartisan \nbill. VAWA reauthorizations passed the Senate unanimously in 2000 and \n2005, and I look forward to the long overdue passage of S. 1925 today.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I wish to speak in favor of the \nViolence Against Women Reauthorization Act, which I am proud to \ncosponsor. As attorney general of Rhode Island, I saw firsthand the \ngood work that the Violence Against Women Act has done to protect \nvictims of domestic violence, to provide crucial services to those who \nhave been harmed, and to hold batterers accountable for their crimes. \nIt is vital that we reauthorize this important law.\n  In Rhode Island and across the country, the Violence Against Women \nAct continues to support essential tools for preventing and responding \nto domestic violence. The Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic \nViolence reports, for example, that we now have 23 transitional housing \nunits in our State, helping victims of violence become safe and self-\nsufficient as they escape a batterer. VAWA's law enforcement and legal \nassistance programs have also proven essential, especially in light of \ndifficult State and local budgets. VAWA supports seven law enforcement \nadvocates in Rhode Island, who work in local police departments to \nprovide immediate assistance to victims of domestic violence, sexual \nassault, and stalking. These and other VAWA programs have improved the \ncriminal justice response to violence against women and ensured victims \nand their families the services they need.\n  The Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act builds on that record \nof success. It makes important updates to strengthen the law, while \nremaining cognizant of the challenging budget circumstances we face. \nThe bill includes an increased focus on sexual assault prevention, \nenforcement, and services. It provides new measures to prevent \nhomicides through programs to manage high-risk offenders. It also \nconsolidates programs to reduce administrative costs and add \nefficiency. And it incorporates new accountability provisions to ensure \nthat VAWA funds are used effectively and efficiently.\n  Senators Leahy and Crapo led a fair and open process in crafting this \nbill. They have carefully studied these issues, consulted with a great \nnumber of experts and stakeholders, and as a result have achieved a \nbill with 60 cosponsors in this body.\n  I would particularly like to thank Senators Leahy and Crapo for \nincluding in this bill a measure I authored to help prevent teen dating \nviolence. Far too many teens suffer abuse at the hands of a dating \npartner. The Centers for Disease Control report that one in ten \nteenagers was hit or physically hurt on purpose by a boyfriend or \ngirlfriend in the past year. The Saving Money and Reducing Tragedies \nthrough Prevention, or SMART Prevention Act, which I introduced last \nyear and is included in this bill, will support innovative and \neffective programs to prevent this dangerous abuse.\n  At a subcommittee field hearing I chaired last year on strategies for \nprotecting teens from dating violence, each of the expert witnesses \ntestified that prevention programs can help address this serious \nproblem. Ann Burke, a leading national advocate, explained that school-\nbased teen dating violence prevention programs have proven effective in \nchanging behaviors. For example, in 2 years following the passage of \nRhode Island's Lindsay Ann Burke Act, named in memory of Ann's \ndaughter, a victim of dating violence, the number of teenagers \nphysically abused by a dating partner in our State decreased from 14 \npercent to 10.8 percent.\n  Prevention programs are most effective when part of a community \napproach. Kate Reilly, the executive director of the Start Strong Rhode \nIsland\n\n[[Page S2775]]\n\nProject, testified that effective prevention programming should ``meet \nkids where they live and play.'' That requires involving parents, \ncoaches, mentors, and community leaders--men and women--as well as \ninnovative uses of technology and social media.\n  One group of children needs particular attention: those who have \nwitnessed abuse in their home. Deborah DeBare, executive director of \nthe Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence, explained at our \nhearing that ``growing up in a violent home may lead to higher risks of \nrepeating the cycle of abuse as teens and young adults.'' By supporting \nrobust services for children exposed to domestic violence, we can help \nto lift the emotional burden on children who witness their parents' \nviolence and break the intergenerational cycle of violence.\n  The VAWA Reauthorization Act's SMART Prevention provisions build on \nAnn and Kate and Deb's insights. The bill supports educational programs \nwarning young people about dating violence, as well as programs to \ntrain those with influence on youth. To save costs, the new program is \nconsolidated with existing grant programs, including a program directed \nat children who have witnessed violence and abuse. Coordinating and \nfocusing prevention resources will save money, and abuse that is \nprevented reduces the strain on our overburdened health, education, and \ncriminal justice systems.\n  I again congratulate Senators Leahy and Crapo for their strong \nbipartisan leadership in helping us extend our longstanding bipartisan \ncommitment to preventing domestic violence. I urge all of my colleagues \nto support reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act, so that we can \nkeep working toward a country that is free of this scourge.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of The \nViolence Against Women Act. This consequential measure reauthorizes a \nlandmark federal law and, once the Senate has finished a free and open \ndebate including a full range of amendments, we should pass this bill \nwith a strong, bipartisan majority. Approving this measure offers the \nSenate an opportunity to demonstrate to the American people that we \nstill have the capacity to meet the challenge of forging effective \nsolutions to monumental matters affecting Americans in their daily \nlives.\n  For far too long, domestic violence has been an extremely serious and \ncommon crime that devastated families and silently took a great toll on \nour society. Decades ago, domestic violence went largely unreported, in \npart because the victim viewed the violence as personal, or because of \nthey were afraid of retribution, or they were embarrassed and did not \nwant family members, friends, or neighbors to know.\n  I well recall in 1990, when I was serving as the co-chair of the \nHouse Congressional Caucus on Women's Issues with Pat Schroeder, and \nCongress started to focus greater attention on these kinds of heinous \ntransgressions and those who perpetrate them. Just as we fought \nvigorously for women's health equity, as well as economic security for \nwomen, the Caucus was a driving force for change in combating domestic \nviolence, with then-Congresswoman Boxer taking a leadership role in \nauthoring legislation, along with Connie Morella. As we were building \nlegislative momentum in the House, then-Senator Joe Biden was \nshepherding this initiative through the Senate.\n  This culminated in the original Violence Against Women Act, enacted \nin 1994, a truly landmark piece of legislation. For the first time, \nCongress enacted legislation that sought to comprehensively address the \nproblem of violence against women. We provided assistance to States to \nimprove law enforcement and prosecution efforts, and funded shelters \nand services to help women and their families extricate themselves out \nof these violent and abusive situations and into safety.\n  Here we are, 18 years later, and yes, we can feel fortunate for the \nprogress we have made on this critical issue. The evidence clearly \nbears this out.\n  According to the National Network to End Domestic Violence, reporting \nof domestic violence has increased as much as 51 percent. Reporting is \nan instrumental first step to ensuring that women receive the support \nthey want, need, and deserve. As a result, hundreds of thousands of \nwomen have been helped through VAWA-supported programs such as \nhotlines, individual and court advocacy, emergency shelters, \ntransitional housing and housing assistance. Furthermore, the annual \nincidence of domestic violence has fallen by more than 50 percent.\n  While women are the most frequent targets of domestic violence, \nchildren are also too often victims in these tragedies as well. For \nthis reason, the best approach must be comprehensive in scope and the \nurgent necessity for action, such as early intervention, is paramount.\n  Earlier this month, researchers at Boston Children's Hospital and the \nInstitute of Child Development at the University of Minnesota released \na study--the first of its kind--that prospectively examined the effects \nof interpersonal trauma on children--particularly young children. On \naverage, children exposed to such trauma had cognitive scores that were \nthe equivalent of 7 IQ points fewer, with the most significant and \nenduring cognitive deficits appearing in children exposed to trauma \nbetween birth and 2 years of age. As study leader Dr. Michelle Bosquet \nEnlow observed, ``If we wait until children are identified by the \nschool . . . a lot of the damage will have already been done.''\n  Well, I could not agree more, and that is why along with early \nintervention, we must also increase access to quality early childhood \nhealth and education programs. The challenge in 2012 is to understand \nand act upon the systemic, reverberative consequences of this violence.\n  Consider the reality that domestic violence does not merely occur at \nhome. In fact, the one place where an abuser can be confident to find \nhis victim is at work. In a survey conducted by the Maine Department of \nLabor, 74 percent of abusers had easy access to their partner's \nworkplace, with 21 percent of offenders reporting that they contacted \nthe victim at the workplace in violation of a no contact order.\n  At the same time, among female employees who experienced domestic \nviolence, 87 percent received harassing phone calls at work; 78 percent \nreported being late to work because of abuse; and, incredibly, 60 \npercent lost their jobs due to domestic abuse. As Ranking Member of the \nSenate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I find these \nfacts chilling, because not only do these alarming invasions of privacy \nthreaten women's financial independence, they can also erode elements \nof a woman's critical support system that can often be found in the \nworkplace as well.\n  Turning now to my own State of Maine where approximately half of all \nhomicides each year stem from domestic violence, I want to begin with \nthe tragic case of Amy Lake. A kindergarten teacher from Dexter, ME, \nAmy, and her two children, Coty and Monica, were killed last year by \nher abusive husband before he killed himself.\n  Domestic violence experts and law enforcement authorities contend \nthat Amy did everything possible to protect herself and her two \nchildren. Amy and her children lived in seven different places the year \nbefore their deaths. Amy sought and received a protective order, which \nher husband proceeded to violate five times. This wrenching incident \nhas galvanized the local community and the entire state of Maine at \nlarge to redouble our efforts to end domestic violence. And frankly it \nis cases like Amy's that tell us in no uncertain terms our work is far \nfrom finished. Our job is NOT completed. And our task remains for us \nall to strive to solve.\n  In fighting domestic violence, engaging men is a fundamental part of \nthe answer. I salute the efforts of Maine's Governor, Paul LePage, who \nhimself has overcome tragedy as a child and has courageously and \naggressively pursued changes aimed at protecting victims, such as \nreforming bail rules, and strengthening notification requirements. \nAdditionally, Black Bears Against Domestic Violence--an initiative \ninvolving male athletes from all of the sports teams from the \nUniversity of Maine--has done an outstanding job in speaking out \nagainst dating violence both on campus and at local high schools.\n  This bill before us today, which I am pleased to cosponsor, \nsuccessfully\n\n[[Page S2776]]\n\nbuilds upon past strides at both the State and Federal levels. We \ninclude a number of judicial improvements, such as encouraging the use \nof best practices among law enforcement and court personnel to better \nassess the risk of domestic violence homicide and to provide immediate, \ncrisis intervention services for those at risk of escalating violence. \nMaine is already moving in that direction in light of the tragedy that \nbefell Amy Lake, which is vividly emblematic of the imperative to get \nthe right information to the right people at the right time.\n  Our legislation also reauthorizes grants to encourage arrest policies \nand enforce protection orders. At the same time, it explicitly calls on \nlaw enforcement to identify and inventory backlogs of sexual assault \nevidence collection kits and to develop protocols for responding to and \naddressing such backlogs in the purpose area of Services -Training--\nOfficers--Prosecutors, STOP, grants and Grants to Encourage Arrest \nPolicies and Enforce Protection Orders, GTEAP. Human Rights Watch \npoints out two astounding facts--first, that the arrest rate for rape, \nwhich stands at 24 percent, has not changed since the late 1970s. \nSecond, it estimates that the number of untested rape kits reaches the \nhundreds of thousands. Indeed, a recent Newsweek article profiled \nDetroit prosecutor Kym Worthy, who was attacked at law school while on \na run but never reported it, is spearheading an effort to ensure that \nmore than 11,000 police rape kits are tested in Detroit. As she \nrightfully surmises, ``when victims go through a 3-hour plus rape kit \nexam, they expect the police to use the evidence to catch the rapist.''\n  Now, I am cognizant that some of my colleagues--especially those who \nhave enthusiastically supported the original law and past \nreauthorizations--are fully committed to fighting violence against \nwomen but have concerns about the version before us. I hope we can \ncooperatively work through these issues in an effort to ensure that at \nthe end of the day the overall passage of a significant reauthorization \nis NOT jeopardized.\n  Let me be clear, quelling domestic violence is too vital, too urgent, \nand too necessary a challenge to countenance division along party \nlines. Our answer must be to counter the impulse to create a political \nwedge with a desire to legislate in good faith. What is effective \nfodder for campaign vitriol has no place in a measure like this \nendeavor to reauthorize The Violence Against Women Act.\n  Time is of the essence when it comes to legislation with life and \ndeath ramifications. Politically, this law has a strong bipartisan \npedigree, which has been crucial to its success and enduring legacy. In \ndeference to that tradition, rather than focusing on how to parlay our \ndifferences into political advantage, I urge my colleagues try to \nbridge the divide first.\n  As someone who has dedicated her life in public service to empowering \nwomen, I know this much to be true we can adopt measures that promote \nand enhance women's health, but if we achieve those noble goals, yet \nfail to ensure women's security, the victory is pyrrhic at best. If we \nmake strides in education and economic opportunity, but jettison \nefforts to protect women from abuse, the gains we make will have come \nat a steep price.\n  The opportunities to rally around a common cause have been \nregrettably rare in this chamber so far this Congress. Let us seize \nthis moment and send the strongest signal possible to the nation that \non our watch women will receive the protections they require and \ndeserve.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, every single American should be able to \ncount on the law to protect them from domestic violence and sexual \nassault, regardless of who they are, where they live, or whom they \nlove. That means giving law enforcement the tools they need to \ninvestigate and prosecute these crimes while investing in a community-\nbased approach, like we have in Delaware. In reauthorizing the Violence \nAgainst Women Act today, the Senate is taking an important step in the \nongoing effort to rid domestic abuse from our communities and our \nNation.\n  The Violence Against Women Act has been an unqualified success at \nreducing domestic violence and bringing this once-hidden crime into the \nlight. Yet there is no question that the need for this legislation \npersists.\n  Just last month, a 26-year-old male was placed under arrest in New \nCastle County, DE, after assaulting his ex-girlfriend in front of her \nfive children. The assault involved dragging the victim by her hair \ninto the kitchen, where the violence continued. The victim's teenage \nson was forced to make the call to 9 1-1--another stark and horrifying \nexample of how not all victims of domestic violence have bruises.\n  Like many aspects of modern law enforcement, the best strategies for \nfighting domestic violence and sexual assault change over time. What \nCongress and experts understood to be effective in 1994 may not be the \nbest or most comprehensive approach today. That is why the original \nauthors of this act provided for reauthorization every 5 years. Twice \neach decade, we must take a hard look at where we are failing and where \nwe are succeeding in this important fight.\n  In this year's reauthorization, we made changes that generally fall \ninto two categories: reducing bureaucracy and strengthening \naccountability to ensure taxpayer dollars are spent wisely; and \nensuring that every victim of abuse in this country is able to count on \nthe law to protect them, regardless of who they are, where they live or \nwhom they love.\n  Sometimes it takes an extra step on our part to make sure underserved \ncommunities, like those in the LGBTQ community, receive the same \nprotection under the law as everyone else. I believe it is a step worth \ntaking.\n  The reauthorization we are considering today takes that step, moving \nus forward by adding protections for victims of domestic violence \nregardless of their sexual orientation. Lesbian, gay, bisexual and \ntransgendered Americans experience domestic violence in the same \npercentage of relationships as the general population--a shocking 25 35 \npercent--yet these victims often don't have access to the same services \nas their straight friends and neighbors.\n  Nearly half of LGBTQ victims are turned away from domestic violence \nshelters, and a quarter are often unjustly arrested as if they were the \nperpetrators.\n  In Delaware and across this country, our law enforcement officers are \ndoing an incredible job responding to domestic violence cases, due in \npart to the training they receive from VAWA programs. Providing the \nresources necessary to help ensure officers treat all victims equally \nis essential to keeping our communities safe.\n  Today's reauthorization makes plain that discrimination is not the \npolicy of the United States of America. It says no program funded by \nFederal VAWA dollars can turn away a domestic violence victim because \nof their sexual orientation or gender identity.\n  That is it. That is all this part of the bill does, and I can't \nbelieve any of my distinguished colleagues would want to let \ndiscrimination persist in the laws of this country.\n  Every single American should be able to count on the law to protect \nthem from domestic violence and sexual assault. Whether the victim is \ngay or straight, American Indian, white, black or Latino, they deserve \nprotection from abuse and justice for their abusers. The amendment \noffered by Senator Hutchison removes these key provisions and would \nallow the denial of VAWA assistance to victims solely because of their \nLGBT status.\n  I opposed the Hutchison amendment for this reason, and because it \neliminates improvements that will help law enforcement conduct \ninvestigations of the crimes targeted by VAWA.\n  As cochair of the Senate Law Enforcement Caucus, I convened a \nroundtable discussion in New Castle, DE, earlier this year to hear from \nleaders across the spectrum of law enforcement, the nonprofit sector, \nand the judiciary.\n  One thing the roundtable made absolutely clear is that law \nenforcement agencies use VAWA funding to hold training and share \ninformation they can't get anywhere else.\n  Chief Jeffrey Horvath of the Lewes Police Department explained that \nin a small police unit such as the one he leads, marshaling the funds \nto provide officer training on domestic violence would be impossible \nwithout VAWA assistance.\n\n[[Page S2777]]\n\n  These local experts also stressed the critical need for ongoing and \ncontinued training. MAJ Nathaniel McQueen of the Delaware State Police \nnoted that because the research continues to evolve, trainings must be \ngiven every year.\n  Patricia Dailey Lewis, representing the Family Division of the \nDelaware Attorney General's Office, explained that VAWA provides the \nsocial workers that are critical to ushering victims through the \ncriminal justice system. Without a social worker as a guide, the \ncomplications and frustrations of the justice system can be \noverwhelming--ultimately deterring victims from coming forward and \npushing domestic violence back into the shadows.\n  VAWA funds the Victims Advocate Office in the Delaware State Police \nDepartment, which LT Teresa Williams reported has served over 6,000 \nDelawareans in 2 years. As that number suggests, the prevalence of \ndomestic and sexual violence cases remains a huge concern. Chief James \nHosfelt of the Dover Police Department estimated that one-third of his \ncase files relate to incidents of domestic violence.\n  Once law enforcement and prosecutors have secured a court order, VAWA \nplays a pivotal role in reducing recidivism. As Leann Summa, director \nof Legal Affairs of the Family Court in Delaware, explained to me, VAWA \nfunds through STOP grants provide the only method by which the Delaware \nFamily Court can ensure that individuals comply with court orders of \ntreatment and counseling. For victims, VAWA also provides the support \ngroups that reach those who might otherwise fall back into dangerous \nconditions. Maria Matos, executive director of the Latin American \nCommunity Center, explained to me that, while members of the Latino \ncommunity do not often join in support groups, VAWA has helped create \none that has worked successfully in Delaware.\n  So if we are to tackle a problem this large, this pervasive, and this \ndangerous, we need well-trained, dedicated law enforcement officers but \nwe also need support from a whole community providing a broad range of \nservices. And in Delaware, that is exactly what we have. VAWA has \nfostered a community of those dedicated to reducing violence, allowing \neach group to serve as a force multiplier for others and adding value \nthat individual programs alone would not create.\n  Another participant in our roundtable, Bridget Poulle, executive \ndirector of the Domestic Violence Coordinating Council, told me that \neven though the council she represented receives no VAWA funds, that, \n``VAWA has allowed all systems to work at a higher level.''\n  Tim Brandau, executive director of CHILD, Inc., agreed that it is the \nbroad community created by VAWA that is most important to sustain. \nCommissioner Carl Danberg of the Department of Corrections, who also \njoined us at the roundtable, reminded us how, in the early days of \naddressing domestic violence, the typical response was to ``lock them \nboth up,'' revictimizing the innocent party. What seemed an appropriate \nor sufficient response at one time sounds appalling to our ears today--\nreinforcing the need to reevaluate these programs regularly.\n  VAWA makes the whole system better by bringing together the necessary \npieces of a fully functioning justice system. At the roundtable, \nPatricia Dailey Lewis, representing the Family Division of the Delaware \nAttorney General's Office, explained that VAWA provides the social \nworkers that are critical to ushering victims through the criminal \njustice system. Without a social worker as a guide, the complications \nand frustrations of the justice system can be overwhelming--ultimately \ndeterring victims from coming forward and pushing domestic violence \nback into the shadows.\n  The breadth of the VAWA community is key to its success. This was \nemphasized at the roundtable by Carol Post, executive director of the \nDelaware Coalition Against Domestic Violence, and by Deanee Moran, \nDirector of the Sexual Assault Network of Delaware. They reported how \nVAWA touches everything from transitional housing to the national \nhotline, from the safe exchange of children to increased awareness on \ncollege campuses; from STOP grants in rural neighborhoods to SASP \nfunding in urban communities. Not only for women, but also for men, and \nfor children.\n  My colleagues who opposed this reauthorization were willing to put \nall of this progress at risk. Their insistence on excluding some of our \nfriends and neighbors because of their background or sexual orientation \nis unconscionable.\n  I am proud to represent a State that has taken a leadership role in \nthe fight against domestic violence, and I thank Joe Biden, the former \nSenator from Delaware, for his leadership in advancing the first VAWA \nstatute.\n  It is my pleasure, honor, and great responsibility to do all that I \ncan to secure VAWA reauthorization this year--the safety of our \ncommunities depends on it.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I write today to explain my vote in \nopposition to S. 1925, Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act, \nVAWA. I have several outstanding concerns with this legislation, some \nof which were reflected in the amendments I circulated during the \nSenate Judiciary Committee's February 2012 markup of this legislation. \nIn particular, I believe this legislation violates the principles of \nfederalism outlined in the Constitution, fails to completely address \nduplication and overlap both within VAWA programs and with non-VAWA \nprograms administered by both the Department of Justice, DOJ, and the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, HHS, ignores the continuing \nproblem of grant management and waste, fraud and abuse at the Office of \nViolence Against Women, OVW, and disregards our country's fragile \nfinancial condition, which has worsened significantly since the last \nVAWA reauthorization in 2005.\n  First and foremost, I do not think anyone would disagree with the \nfact that violence of any type against women, domestic, dating or \nsexual violence, is reprehensible and should not be tolerated. However, \nregardless of the extent of this or any other problem, we must \ncarefully weigh the proper role of the Federal Government so Congress \ndoes not violate its limited authority under the Constitution. Domestic \nviolence laws, like most other criminal laws, are State laws, and \nnowhere in the Constitution is the Federal Government tasked with \nproviding basic funding to States, localities, and private \norganizations to operate programs aimed at victims of State crimes such \nas domestic violence. Far too often, Congress infringes upon the rights \nof the people and the States by overreaching in its legislative \nefforts.\n  Although many VAWA programs are laudable, they are not the Federal \nGovernment's responsibility. In fact, the entire purpose of this \nlegislation is to provide funding for State, local, non-profit, and \nvictim services grantees to serve victims of State crimes, such as \ndomestic violence, stalking, and sexual violence. These crimes and the \ntreatment of its victims are appropriately in the jurisdiction of the \nStates, not the Federal Government. In light of our current economic \ncrisis, Congress must evaluate each and every program to determine if \nit is constitutional, whether it is a Federal responsibility, and \nwhether it is a priority. Combating violence against women is certainly \na priority, but it is not a Federal responsibility.\n  Second, this legislation fails to completely address the duplication \nand overlap within VAWA programs and with non-VAWA programs operated by \nboth the DOJ and HHS. At the beginning of every Congress, I send to \neach Senator my letter outlining the criteria he will use to evaluate \nlegislation. This Congress, it was also signed by seven other Members. \nThe VAWA reauthorization violates several of those criteria, including \nelimination and consolidation of duplicative programs prior to \nreauthorization.\n  While I recognize the legislation does consolidate some programs, it \nhas not eliminated all duplication. There are several VAWA grant \nprograms that are so broad that they duplicate one another, providing \nmultiple opportunities for grantees to double dip into Federal funds. \nIn addition, the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act, FVPSA, \nwhich predates the original VAWA legislation, authorized several HHS \nprograms aimed at reducing domestic violence and helping victims. \nSeveral of those programs fund the same types of\n\n[[Page S2778]]\n\nservices as those authorized by the VAWA grants in this legislation.\n  Furthermore, in the Government Accountability Office, GAO Duplication \nReport released at the end of February 2012, GAO found the DOJ \nadministers more than 250 grant programs to provide crime prevention, \nlaw enforcement, and victims' services, totaling approximately $30 \nbillion since 2005. Specifically, GAO noted more than 20 percent of the \n253 grants reviewed by GAO are for victims' assistance.\n  In addition, according to GAO, this June that office will be \nreleasing yet another duplication report specifically on the OVW, \nOffice of Justice Programs, OJP, and Community Oriented Policing \nServices, COPS Program. Before moving forward with a VAWA \nreauthorization, Congress should evaluate this report on OVW to \ndetermine how we can streamline the victims' services DOJ already \nprovides. Reauthorizing VAWA programs now, without taking into account \nthe recent and forthcoming work of GAO, is premature.\n  As a result, I am very disappointed the Democrats refused to allow a \nvote on the amendment No. 2085 I filed to eliminate unnecessary \nduplication within DOJ, especially since the savings would have been \nlargely directed to helping bring justice to rape cases. This amendment \nwould have provided at least $600 million in additional funds to \nsupport efforts to use DNA to solve crimes.\n  This amendment would have required the Department of Justice to \nidentify every program its administers, consolidate unnecessary \nduplication, and apply savings towards resolving rape cases and \nreducing the deficit.\n  Specifically, the amendment directed the Attorney General to develop \na plan that would result in financial cost savings of at least 20 \npercent of the nearly $3.9 billion in duplicative grant programs \nidentified by the Government Accountability Office.\n  According to GAO, since 2005, Congress has spent $30 billion in \noverlapping Department of Justice grants for crime prevention police \nand victims services from more than 250 DOJ grant programs, and $3.9 \nbillion in grants just in 2010.\n  As much as 75 percent of the savings, nearly $600 million, may be \ndirected towards alleviating any backlogs of analysis and placement of \nDNA samples from rape, sexual assault, homicide, kidnapping and other \ncriminal cases, including casework sample and convicted offender \nbacklogs, into the Combined DNA Index System. The remainder of the \nsavings will be returned to the Treasury for the purpose of deficit \nreduction.\n  By requiring the consolidation and elimination of duplication at DOJ, \nCongress will free Federal funding which can be more appropriately \ndedicated to bringing justice to rape victims, while also reducing the \ndeficit.\n  DNA testing provides a powerful criminal justice tool to convicting \nrapists and exonerating the innocent--DNA, deoxyribonucleic acid, \ntesting has become a powerful criminal justice tool in recent years. \n``DNA can be used to identify criminals with incredible accuracy when \nbiological evidence exists. By the same token, DNA can be used to clear \nsuspects and exonerate persons mistakenly accused or convicted of \ncrimes. In all, DNA technology is increasingly vital to ensuring \naccuracy and fairness in the criminal justice system,'' according to \nthe Department of Justice.\n  ``Each person's DNA is unique (with the exception of identical \ntwins). Therefore, DNA evidence collected from a crime scene can \nimplicate or eliminate a suspect, similar to the use of fingerprints. \nIt also can analyze unidentified remains through comparisons with DNA \nfrom relatives. Additionally, when evidence from one crime scene is \ncompared with evidence from another using the Combined DNA Index \nSystem, those crime scenes can be linked to the same perpetrator \nlocally, statewide, and nationally.''\n  ``When biological evidence from crime scenes is collected and stored \nproperly, forensically valuable DNA can be found on evidence that may \nbe decades old. Therefore, old cases that were previously thought \nunsolvable may contain valuable DNA evidence capable of identifying the \nperpetrator.''\n  In New York authorities used DNA evidence to link a man to at least \n22 sexual assaults and robberies. Authorities in Philadelphia, PA, and \nFort Collins, CO, used DNA evidence to link and then solve a series of \ncrimes--rapes and a murder--perpetrated by the same individual.\n  DNA is generally used to solve crimes in one of two ways. First, in \ncases where a suspect is identified, a sample of that person's DNA can \nbe compared to evidence from the crime scene. The results of this \ncomparison may help establish whether the suspect committed the crime. \nSecond, in cases where a suspect has not yet been identified, \nbiological evidence from the crime scene can be analyzed and compared \nto offender profiles in DNA databases to help identify the perpetrator. \nCrime scene evidence can also be linked to other crime scenes through \nthe use of DNA databases.\n  DNA evidence is generally linked to DNA offender profiles through DNA \ndatabases. In the late 1980s, the Federal Government laid the \ngroundwork for a system of national, State, and local DNA databases for \nthe storage and exchange of DNA profiles. This system, called the \nCombined DNA Index System, CODIS, maintains DNA profiles obtained under \nthe Federal, State, and local systems in a set of databases that are \navailable to law enforcement agencies across the country for law \nenforcement purposes. CODIS can compare crime scene evidence to a \ndatabase of DNA profiles obtained from convicted offenders. CODIS can \nalso link DNA evidence obtained from different crime scenes, thereby \nidentifying serial criminals.\n  In order to take advantage of the investigative potential of CODIS, \nin the late 1980s and early 1990s, States began passing laws requiring \noffenders convicted of certain offenses to provide DNA samples. \nCurrently all 50 states and the Federal Government have laws requiring \nthat DNA samples be collected from some categories of offenders.\n  When used to its full potential, DNA evidence will help solve and may \neven prevent some of the Nation's most serious violent crimes. However, \nthe current Federal and State DNA collection and analysis system needs \nimprovement, according to the Department of Justice: In many instances, \npublic crime labs are overwhelmed by backlogs of unanalyzed DNA \nsamples. In addition, these labs may be ill-equipped to handle the \nincreasing influx of DNA samples and evidence. The problems of backlogs \nand lack of up-to-date technology result in significant delays in the \nadministration of justice. More research is needed to develop faster \nmethods for analyzing DNA evidence. Professionals working in the \ncriminal justice system need additional training and assistance in \norder to ensure the optimal use of DNA evidence to solve crimes and \nassist victims.\n  Thousands of sexual assault DNA kits are still not tested--``The \ndemand for DNA testing continues to outstrip the capacity of crime \nlaboratories to process these cases,'' according to a National \nInstitute of Justice report. ``The bottom line: crime laboratories are \nprocessing more cases than ever before, but their expanded capacity has \nnot been able to meet the increased demand.''\n  The DNA casework backlog, consisting of forensic evidence collected--\nfrom crime scenes, victims and suspects in criminal cases--has more \nthan doubled from less than 50,000 in 2005 to more than 100,000 in \n2009.\n  There are thousands of rape kits ``sitting waiting to be tested'' in \nHouston, TX alone. The Houston Police Department may have up to 7,000 \nsexual assault kits that have not been tested. Houston recently \naccepted an $821,000 Federal grant to study the backlog of untested \nkits, but ``the bulk of the money has to be spent on figuring out the \nreasons rape kits have gone untested'' and less than half of the money \n``will go towards dealing with the actual backlog.''\n  This amendment provides roughly $600 million to help resolve more \nthan 340,000 rape and other criminal cases with DNA testing--This \namendment would have provided at least $600 million in additional funds \nto support efforts to use DNA to solve crimes.\n  The amendment would have directed the Attorney General to develop a \nplan that would result in financial cost savings of at least 20 percent \nof the nearly $3.9 billion in duplicative grant programs identified by \nthe Government\n\n[[Page S2779]]\n\nAccountability Office. As much as 75 percent of the savings, nearly \n$600 million, may be directed towards alleviating any backlogs of \nanalysis and placement of DNA samples from rape, sexual assault, \nhomicide, kidnapping, and other criminal cases, including casework \nsample and convicted offender backlogs, into the Combined DNA Index \nSystem. The remainder of the savings will be returned to the Treasury \nfor the purpose of deficit reduction.\n  In 2010, National Institute of Justice's DNA Backlog Reduction \nProgram provided more than $64.8 million which allowed more than 37,000 \ncases to be tested. The $600 million provided by this amendment could \ntherefore be enough to provide testing for over 342,000 cases.\n  No list of Justice Department programs exists, yet GAO found more \nthan 250 overlapping DOJ grant programs--As with many other agencies, \nthe Justice Department cannot fully account for each program in its \npurview. In fact, in its review of DOJ programs for their annual report \non duplication, even the GAO could not fully account for every program \nat the agency.\n  The number of Justice programs detailed by GAO, 253, may actually be \nan understatement. The report explains Justice grant programs can \ncontinue for up to 5 years, and as such, ``the total number of active \njustice grant programs can be higher than what is presented,'' which is \nonly a one year snapshot of the Department's programs.\n  This amendment would require the Department to provide a full listing \nof every single program administered under their jurisdiction, which \nwill assist in Congress's work to address this extensive overlap when \nmaking funding decisions.\n  In their duplication report, GAO revealed that ``overlap and \nfragmentation among government programs or activities can be harbingers \nof unnecessary duplication. Reducing or eliminating duplication, \noverlap, or fragmentation could potentially save billions of taxpayer \ndollars annually and help agencies provide more efficient and effective \nservices.''\n  This amendment would have addressed this overlap and unnecessary \nduplication at the Department of Justice by also requiring the \nfollowing: a listing of other programs within the Federal Government \nwith duplicative or overlapping missions and services; the latest \nperformance reviews for the program, including the metrics used to \nreview the program; the latest improper payment rate for the program, \nincluding fraudulent payments; and the total amount of unspent and \nunobligated program funds held by the agency and grant recipients.\n  This information would be updated annually and posted on-line, along \nwith recommendations from the agency to consolidate duplicative and \noverlapping programs, eliminate waste and inefficiency, and terminate \nlower priority, outdated and unnecessary programs.\n  According to GAO, since 2005 Congress has spent $30 billion in \noverlapping Department of Justice grants for crime prevention, police, \nand victims services through more than 250 programs, and $3.9 billion \nin grants in 2010.--In February, the Government Accountability Office, \nGAO, released its second annual report addressing duplication and areas \nfor cost savings throughout the Federal Government. The report, \n``Opportunities to Reduce Duplication, Overlap and Fragmentation, \nAchieve Savings, and Enhance Revenue,'' exposed 51 specific examples of \ngovernment duplication and areas of Federal spending with potential for \nsignificant cost savings.\n  Included in this year's report are some very troubling findings of \nextensive duplication in a large portion of Department of Justice, DOJ, \nprograms. GAO found the Justice Department administers more than 250 \nduplicative programs to provide ``crime prevention, law enforcement, \nand crime victim services,'' costing taxpayers roughly $30 billion in \nthe last 6 years.\n  Their report details the widespread duplication in the Department, \nenumerating at least 56 victims' assistance programs, 33 juvenile \njustice efforts, more than 40 technology and forensics grant \nsolicitations, and 16 community crime prevention strategy programs, to \nname a handful of the many identified.\n  In 1 year alone, three primary offices--the Office of Justice \nPrograms, the Office on Violence Against Women, and the Community \nOriented Policing Services Office--awarded $3.9 billion through 11,000 \ngrants, many of which the GAO found to be duplicative and in need of \nreview and coordination.\n  GAO attributes much of the duplication among these 253 grant programs \nto the fact Justice officials do not conduct a full cross reference \ncheck to ensure applicants have not applied for or received overlapping \ngrants from the Department.\n  In fact, Justice employees contend they simply do not have enough \ntime before providing a grant to ensure recipients have not already \nreceived funding. GAO observed, ``Justice officials stated that the \ntimeline for reviewing applications, making recommendations on their \nmerit, and processing awards each year is compressed and that it would \nbe difficult to build in the extra time and level of coordination \nrequired to complete an intradepartmental review for potentially \nunnecessary duplication of funding prior to making awards.''\n  This amendment would direct DOJ to use their own authority to \neliminate and consolidate overlapping programs as identified by GAO and \ndevelop a plan that would result in financial cost savings of no less \nthan 20 percent of the nearly $3.9 billion in duplicative grant \nprograms identified by the Government Accountability Office.\n  Addressing duplication at GAO is one step in addressing our nearly \n$16 trillion debt--With the release of the GAO report, combined with \nlast year's recommendations, Congress and the administration have been \ngiven extensive details in 132 areas of government duplication and \nopportunities for significant cost savings, with dozens of \nrecommendations for how to address the duplication and find these \nsavings.\n  The problem in Congress today is not an issue of ignorance--it is one \nof indifference and incompetence. We know we have a problem. We know we \nhave cancer. Yet we refuse to stop making it worse, we refuse to apply \nthe treatment, and we refuse to take the pain of the medication for the \nlong-term benefit of a cure.\n  The report provides a clear listing of dozens of areas ripe for \nreform and in need of collaboration from members on both sides of the \naisle, to find solutions to address these issues.\n  We are looking into a future of trillion dollar deficits and a \nnational debt quickly headed toward $20 trillion. Our Nation is not on \nthe verge of bankruptcy, it is already bankrupt. Over the last 2 years, \nthere have been countless discussions and bipartisan talks about how to \naddress our debt and deficit. Yet there has been little agreement, and \nat the end of this year we will be faced with another tax extenders \npackage and another increase in the debt limit, all while sequestration \nwill be poised to kick in and achieve the savings Congress has been \nunable to muster the courage to pass.\n  But, before us, we have part of the answer. GAO's work presents \nWashington with literally hundreds of options for areas in which we \ncould make a decision now to start finding savings, potentially \nhundreds of billions of dollars. If we are unable to agree on \neliminating even one small duplicative program or tax credit when \nclearly we know there are hundreds, we have little hope of ever coming \nto a comprehensive compromise for fixing our floundering budget.\n  Congress should require the Department of Justice to provide a full \nlisting of every program in their jurisdiction. Further, the Department \ncan find savings from consolidating the overlap outlined by the GAO, \nfreeing up Federal funding to dedicate toward solving unresolved rape \ncases, while also reducing the deficit.\n  As a Nation, we simply cannot afford to reauthorize programs that \nwaste taxpayer dollars by duplicating programs operated by other \nFederal agencies for the same purposes. To be clear, addressing \nduplication and overlap is not a matter of refusing to provide services \nto victims of domestic violence but, rather, it is to ensure they are \nproperly served by programs that are efficient, effective and not \nbogged down in Federal Government bureaucracy.\n  Third, both the Government Accountability Office, GAO, and the DOJ\n\n[[Page S2780]]\n\nOffice of the Inspector General, DOJ OIG, have repeatedly documented \nthe failure of OVW to manage its grants and monitor its grantees \neffectively. Following this statement, I have included in the Record \nsummaries of both GAO and DOJ OIG reports on OVW and VAWA grants. \nOverall, DOJ has long had problems with its grant management. The DOJ \nOIG has published for more than a decade a list of the Top 10 \nManagement Challenges at the DOJ. Grant management, unfortunately, has \nappeared on that list ever since the inception of this evaluation, with \nOVW being called out as particularly problematic.\n  Since 2001, GAO has noted various problems at OVW and with particular \nVAWA grants. With regard to OVW grant management, GAO noted grants \nawarded by OVW ``often lacked the documentation necessary to ensure \nthat the required monitoring activities occurred.'' As a result OVW \n``was not positioned to systematically determine staff compliance with \nmonitoring requirements and assess overall performance.''\n  Furthermore, since 1998, the DOJ IG has issued audit after audit \nnoting unallowable expenditures, questioned grant costs, weak internal \nreporting, and poor oversight in numerous VAWA grants across the \ncountry. For example, a 2011 DOJ IG audit of a Boston grantee \nquestioned over half $638,298 of its $1.3 million grant. The questioned \ncosts were used for unsupportable conferences, bonus payments, and \nconsultant fees.\n  Even my constituents have directly experienced OVW mismanagement. For \nexample, the Oklahoma District Attorneys Council, OK DAC, which is the \nOklahoma State administrative agency for many Federal grants, has had \nspecific, documented problems with the poor job OVW has been doing in \nits grant management and oversight. OVW does not answer or return phone \ncalls in a timely manner and has consistently been unavailable to \nanswer grantees' questions in the middle of the work week. Moreover, \naccording to the OK DAC, in the last 4 years that Oklahoma has received \none particular VAWA grant, OVW has failed to perform even one site \nvisit to check on the implementation of the grant and the grantee's use \nof Federal funds.\n  After more than a decade of significant challenges, it is my hope the \nDOJ OIG will be able to remove grant management from DOJ's top 10 \nmanagement challenges. However, until that occurs, it is the job of \nCongress to ensure we are not turning a blind eye to DOJ's failure to \nproperly administer taxpayer funds through Federal grant programs, \nincluding those authorized by VAWA.\n  Fourth, the fiscal condition of our country has worsened dramatically \nsince the original passage of this bill in 1994 and the last \nreauthorization in 2005. In fact, at the end of 2005, our national debt \nwas approximately $8.1 trillion. It is now over $15.6 trillion--a \ngrowth of over $7.5 trillion, or 92.6 percent, in just over 6 years. \nThe Federal Government is in no position to spend more money on any \ngrant programs without offsets. We simply cannot afford it.\n  Although Chairman Leahy recognized the inordinately high \nauthorization levels in the last VAWA reauthorization by reducing some \nof those amounts, S. 1925 continues to inflate the actual funding we \nknow Congress will provide to VAWA grantees. The bill authorizes \napproximately $660 million in grants each year for 5 years, totaling \n$3.3 billion. None of these funds are offset. The 2005 VAWA \nreauthorization provided approximately $779 million per year for 5 \nyears, totaling $3.89 billion. Thus, while S. 1925 reauthorizes a total \nof $590 million less than the 2005 VAWA reauthorization, this total is \nstill much higher than actual past appropriations.\n  In fact, from 2007 to 2011, Congress appropriated a total of $2.71 \nbillion for VAWA grant programs, which is $590 million less than this \nbill's authorized funding. From 2007 to 2011, although Congress \nauthorized a total of $3.89 billion, it actually appropriated $1.18 \nbillion less than that figure, 2.71 billion. Thus, while S. 1925 may \nreduce authorizations, it still provides a total authorization that is \nsignificantly higher than total VAWA appropriations over the past 5 \nyears. If we know, based on past funding history, it is highly unlikely \nCongress will ever provide to VAWA grantees the level of funding \nauthorized in this legislation, why would we send a false message to \ngrantees by retaining such inflated estimates in VAWA?\n  Fifth, I also have concerns about a section of this bill that allows \na tribal court to have jurisdiction over non-Indians who commit a \ndomestic violence crime in Indian country or against an Indian. The \nlanguage explicitly provides that the self-governance of a tribe \nincludes the right ``to exercise special domestic violence criminal \njurisdiction over all persons.'' To my knowledge, this is the first \ntime the Federal Government has given Indian courts jurisdiction over \n``all persons.'' While I recognize domestic violence is a serious \nproblem in Indian Country, this change could cause particular problems \nwith tribes in Oklahoma. Oklahoma has no reservations, but it does have \n39 separate Indian governments. The individual allotment lands and \ntrust lands are small and dispersed within Oklahoma communities and \ncounties. The tribes do not have large continuous land bases, and \nbecause of its unique history, many Oklahomans claim Indian enrollment \nbut have no relationship to the tribe or a tribal community.\n  Further, the Bill of Rights does not apply in Indian courts. Instead, \nmost of the protections are preserved because of the Indian Civil \nRights Act, but it does not preserve all rights. For example, the \nIndian Civil Rights Act only guarantees right to counsel at an \nindividual's own expense. If the ``all persons'' language is as \nabsolute as it appears, it could allow a non-Indian to be tried in \ntribal court without the full protection of the Constitution. S. 1925 \nincludes language that says: ``In a criminal proceeding in which a \nparticipating tribe exercises special domestic violence criminal \njurisdiction, the participating tribe shall provide to the defendant . \n. . all other rights whose protection is necessary under the \nConstitution of the United States in order for Congress to recognize \nand affirm the inherent power of the participating tribe to exercise \nspecial domestic violence criminal jurisdiction over the defendant.'' \nStill, I am not certain this is enough and am afraid it will be subject \nto future court challenges.\n  Proponents of this provision argue that such allowances to tribal \ncourts are necessary because no one is prosecuting non-Indian \noffenders, and that may be true in some cases. But, instead of creating \na conflict between Indian country and the Federal Government's \njurisdiction over American citizens who commit crimes, we believe we \nshould deal with the bigger problem by holding the Department of \nJustice and local U.S. attorneys accountable for not prosecuting these \ncases.\n  Finally, while I applaud and support Senator Grassley's effort to \nincrease accountability at the DOJ and to address problematic \ndefinitions, immigration provisions, and criminal statutes in his \nsubstitute amendment, for many of the same reasons I outline above, I \nmust also oppose his substitute. Although Senator Grassley's \nalternative is, in several areas, likely a better alternative than S. \n1925, it fails to reduce authorizations or offset those amounts, does \nnot fully address grant management problems at OVW or program \nduplication, and still runs counter to my basic constitutional concerns \nwith VAWA programs.\n  As a result, I cannot support S. 1925 or Senator Grassley's \nsubstitute.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the attached documents supporting my \nstatement on the Violence Against Women Act of 2011 in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Summary of Government Accountability Office (GAO) Reports Addressing \nViolence Against Women Act (VAWA) Grants and/or the Office of Violence \n                             Against Women\n\n\n ``Justice Impact Evaluations: One Byrne Evaluation Was Rigorous; All \nReviewed Violence Against Women Office Evaluations Were Problematic,'' \n United States Government Accountability Office, GA0 02 309, March 2002\n\n       The title of this report summarizes the VAWA program well--\n     ``all reviewed Violence Against Women Office evaluations were \n     problematic.''\n       From 1995 2001, NIJ awarded $6 million for five Byrne grant \n     evaluations and five VAWA grant evaluations. VAWA funds \n     provided all\n\n[[Page S2781]]\n\n     of the funding for NIJ's evaluation of its grants ($4 \n     million). GAO reviewed in depth three of the VAWA \n     evaluations, ``all of which . . . had methodological problems \n     that raise concerns about whether the evaluations will \n     produce definitive results.''\n       ``With more up-front attention to design and implementation \n     issues, there is a greater likelihood that NIJ evaluations \n     provide meaningful results for policymakers.''\n       While OVW provides grantees flexibility to develop projects \n     to fit their communities, ``the resulting project variation \n     makes it more difficult to design and implement definitive \n     impact evaluations of the program. Instead of assessing a \n     single, homogeneous program with multiple grantees, the \n     evaluation must assess multiple configurations of a program, \n     thereby making it difficult to generalize about the entire \n     program.''\n       All three VAWA evaluations were designed ``without \n     comparison groups [which] hinders the evaluator's ability to \n     isolate and minimize external factors that could influence \n     the results of the study.'' As a result, ``lack of comparison \n     groups . . . makes it difficult to conclude that a reduction \n     in violence against women and children . . . can be \n     attributed entirely, or in part, to the . . . program. Other \n     external factors may be operating.''\n\n\nStatement of Laurie Ekstrand, Director of Justice Issues, United States \nGovernment Accountability Office, Testimony Before the Subcommittee on \n  Crime and Drugs, Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate, \n``Leading the Fight: The Violence Against Women Office,'' GAO 02 641T, \n                             April 16, 2002\n\n       The primary conclusion of Ms. Ekstrand's testimony was the \n     following: ``Our recent work has shown a need for improvement \n     in [OVW] grant monitoring and in the evaluations that are \n     intended to assess the impacts of [OVW] programs.''\n       VAWA programs have grown significantly since its 1995 \n     inception. Between 1995 and 2000, the number of VAWA \n     discretionary grants ``increased about 362%--from 92 in FY \n     1996 . . . to 425 in FY 2000.'' During the same time period, \n     the dollar amount of all VAWA discretionary grants \n     ``increased about 940%--from just over $12 million in FY 1996 \n     . . . to about $125 million in FY 2000.''\n       Ms. Ekstrand referenced the March 2002 report by stating \n     ``grant files for discretionary grants awarded by [OVW] often \n     lacked the documentation necessary to ensure that the \n     required monitoring activities occurred.'' As a result OVW \n     ``was not positioned to systematically determine staff \n     compliance with monitoring requirements and assess overall \n     performance.''\n\n\n        Report to The Honorable Eleanor Holmes Norton, House of \nRepresentatives, ``Violence Against Women: Data on Pregnant Victims and \n  Effectiveness of Prevention Strategies Are Limited,'' United States \n         Government Accountability Office, GA0 02 530, May 2002\n\n       This report was requested by Eleanor Holmes Norton due to \n     her concern about pregnant women being victims of homicide \n     and other types of violence.\n       GAO concluded the data was incomplete on the number of \n     pregnant women who are victims of violence and that data \n     ``lacks comparability.''\n       ``Research findings on whether women are at increased risk \n     for violence during pregnancy are inconclusive.'' A report by \n     the CDC noted, ``the risk of physical violence does not seem \n     to increase during pregnancy.''\n       Little information is available on the effectiveness of \n     strategies to prevent and reduce violence against women . . \n     .''\n\n\n``Prevalence of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, and \nStalking,'' United States Government Accountability Office, in Response \n      to a Report Mandated by the Violence Against Women and DOJ \n        Reauthorization Act of 2005, GAO 07 148R, November 2006\n\n       VAWA advocates attempt to highlight how many (incidence) of \n     these crimes occur and how many people are victimized \n     (prevalence) as evidence of why we need to pay for additional \n     services to victims of domestic violence. However, this GAO \n     report notes there is not an accurate nationwide estimate of \n     the prevalence of domestic violence, sexual assault, dating \n     violence, and stalking.\n       That is not to say it does not occur. Rather, that is to \n     note, as policymakers, we really do not have adequate \n     information to make decisions on what grants are necessary, \n     if any, to address this problem because we do not know its \n     scope. GAO notes ``no single, comprehensive effort currently \n     exists that provides nationwide statistics on the prevalence \n     of these four categories of crime [domestic violence, sexual \n     assault, dating violence, and stalking].'' In fact, ``since \n     2001, the amount of national research that has been conducted \n     on the prevalence of domestic violence and sexual assault has \n     been limited, and even less research has been conducted on \n     dating violence and stalking.'' Yet, in the 2000 \n     reauthorization of VAWA, language was added to put greater \n     emphasis on dating violence.\n       While it could be costly to design a single, nationwide \n     effort, DOJ has not even performed a cost-benefit analysis to \n     determine if such a national effort should move forward.\n       In addition, while there have been some analysis by \n     individual subdivisions of agencies (approximately 11 \n     collection efforts focusing on various aspects of domestic \n     violence), even their work has not produced results that can \n     be extrapolated nationally. For example, the CDC and OJP have \n     taken some steps at providing consistency in some of their \n     data collection and definitions of terms such as ``dating \n     violence'' or ``domestic violence,'' however, GAO notes even \n     agencies like these ``encourage but do not require grantees \n     to use these definitions as part of their research efforts \n     and cannot always use these definitions in their own work.''\n       GAO concludes, ``the absence of comprehensive nationwide \n     prevalence information somewhat limits the ability to make \n     informed policy and resource allocation decisions about the \n     statutory requirements and programs create to help address \n     these four categories of crime and victims.''\n\n\n ``Services Provided to Victims of Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault, \n       Dating Violence, and Stalking,'' United States Government \nAccountability Office, in Response to a Report Mandated by the Violence \n Against Women and DOJ Reauthorization Act of 2005, GAO 07 846R, July \n                                  2007\n\n       This is the second part of the mandate to GAO from the 2005 \n     VAWA Reauthorization. The first part was completed in the \n     November 2006 report mentioned above.\n       This report focused on eleven federal grant programs and \n     how each collected and reported data to the respective \n     agencies (OVW/OVC/HHS ACF) on the services they provide. \n     While information is reported, ``data are not available on \n     the extent to which men, women, youth, and children receive \n     each type of service for all services.'' GAO notes this \n     ``occurs primarily because the statutes governing these \n     programs do not require the collection of such data.''\n       Even if such data were available, GAO notes, among several \n     concerns, the data may not be reliable because ``recipients \n     of grants administered by all three agencies use varying data \n     collection practices.''\n       While I understand concerns for victims' confidentiality \n     and safety, there are clearly improvements that can be made \n     in improving the uniformity and reliability of data \n     collection.\n       In addition, due to Congress placing different requirements \n     on different grants and having a complicated maze of grant \n     programs we cannot keep track of, we have not provided the \n     appropriate consistency to grantees to make data collection \n     requirements easy to understand and perform. Better drafting \n     on our part could also improve the data we receive, which, in \n     turn, would greatly improve and inform our policymaking \n     efforts.\n\n\nStatement of Eileen Larence, Director of Homeland Security and Justice, \n United States Government Accountability Office, Testimony Before the \n   Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate, ``The Violence \n Against Women Act: Building on 17 Years of Accomplishments,'' GAO 11 \n                          833T, July 13, 2011\n\n       This testimony focused on a review of the 2006 and 2007 \n     reports above and updates to those recommendations conducted \n     in July 2011.\n       Of the eleven national data collection efforts mentioned in \n     the 2006 report, four only focused on incidence (the number \n     of times a crime is committed), not the prevalence (how many \n     individuals are actually victimized).\n       GAO reports DOJ's OJJDP completed a nationwide survey in \n     2009 of incidence and prevalence of children's exposure to \n     violence. This should help in the area of teen dating \n     violence. While CDC has begun a teen dating violence \n     prevention initiative, it just began implementing the first \n     phase in four high risk areas in September 2011, and results \n     are not expected until 2016. Thus, GAO says ``it is too early \n     to tell the extent to which this effort will fully address \n     the information gap related to prevalence of stalking victims \n     under the age of 18.''\n       In 2006, GAO reported different agencies used different \n     definitions related to different types of domestic violence, \n     which led to problems collecting accurate national \n     statistics. This report notes HHS still continues to \n     encourage the use of uniform definitions, but it does not \n     require grantees to do so. In 2010, CDC convened a panel to \n     update and revise its definitions. CDC is reviewing those \n     results and plans another panel in 2012.\n       DOJ has reported its juvenile justice division created \n     common definitions for use in a national survey of children's \n     exposure to violence. This is encouraging, but clearly \n     significant divisions of DOJ, such as OVW, which are \n     responsible for a large portion of VAWA grants, have not \n     reported advances in developing common definitions.\n       A CDC/NIJ Report on the prevalence of domestic violence was \n     released mid-December 2011.\n       As a result of the 2007 report, HHS and DOJ stated ``they \n     modified their grant recipient forms to improve the quality \n     of the recipient data collected and to reflect statutory \n     changes to the programs and reporting requirements.'' \n     Officials stated this resulted in an increase in the quality \n     of data received.\n       Overall, GAO's testimony concluded ``having better and more \n     complete data on the prevalence of domestic violence, sexual \n     assault, dating violence and stalking as well as related \n     services provided to victims . . . can without doubt better \n     inform and shape the federal programs intended to meet the \n     needs of these victims.''\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express support for \nthe reauthorization of the Violence Against\n\n[[Page S2782]]\n\nWomen Act--VAWA. VAWA is a critical piece of legislation that protects \nAmerican women from the plague of domestic violence, stalking, dating \nviolence and sexual assault. The Violence Against Women Act is the \ncenterpiece of the federal government's efforts to combat domestic \nviolence and sexual assault and has transformed the response to these \ncrimes at the local, State and federal levels.\n  As my colleagues know, VAWA was signed into law in 1994. This body \nreauthorized it in 2000 and again in 2005 on an overwhelming bipartisan \nbasis. And it is my hope that we can repeat this bipartisan cooperation \nwith the current reauthorization bill. I applaud those on both sides of \nthe aisle for coming together to support this legislation. The measure \ntoday has a total of 61 cosponsors, including eight Republicans. VAWA \nhas always been bipartisan, is bipartisan today, and needs to come to a \nvote.\n  During my days as the mayor of San Francisco, law enforcement \nofficers most worried about responding to domestic abuse calls. That is \nwhere things got really rough. Tragically, I saw it happen over and \nover again. It was a big problem then, and it remains a big problem \ntoday.\n  To address these problems, the bill reauthorizes a number of grant \nprograms administered by the Departments of Justice and Health and \nHuman Services to provide funding for emergency shelter, counseling, \nand legal services for victims of domestic violence, sexual assault and \nstalking. It also provides support for State agencies, rape crisis \ncenters, and organizations that provide services to vulnerable women. \nAnd American women are safer because we took action.\n  Today, more victims report incidents of domestic violence to the \npolice, and the rate of non-fatal partner violence against women has \ndecreased by 53 percent since 1994, according to the Department of \nJustice. Because of VAWA, States have the funding to implement \n``evidence-based'' anti-domestic violence programs, including \n``lethality screens,'' which law enforcement uses to predict when a \nperson is at risk of becoming the victim of deadly abuse.\n  In my home state of California, with the help of VAWA funds, we \nreduced the number of domestic violence homicides committed annually by \n30% between 1994, the year in which VAWA was enacted, and 2010. Simply \nput, VAWA funding saves lives.\n  An extremely noteworthy example of VAWA's success came to my office \nfrom the Alameda County District Attorney.\n  In 1997, Alameda County, CA reported 27 deaths as a result of \ndomestic violence. That was about the normal rate at that time. But by \nlast year, 2011, the district attorney reported just three deaths. The \ndistrict attorney credits VAWA for reducing the number of domestic \nviolence homicides in Alameda County. This is a clear example of why we \nneed to reauthorize VAWA.\n  Through the use of VAWA funding, Alameda County created the Family \nJustice Center in 2005 to provide comprehensive services to adults and \nchildren who experience domestic violence or sexual assault. Today, the \ncenter is a national model of how communities can bring service \nprofessionals together to serve crime victims.\n  During these tough economic times, the demand for the Family Justice \nCenter's services has grown--as has its need for VAWA funding. In the \ncenter's first year, they treated approximately 8,000 clients, \nincluding an estimated 1,000 children. In 2010, the center treated \n12,000 clients. Last year, the center treated more than 18,000 women, \nmen, children and teens who were victims of interpersonal violent \ncrimes.\n  During a recent visit to my office, the Alameda County District \nAttorney noted that without VAWA funding it would not be possible for \nthe Family Justice Center to continue to serve this growing population \nof crime victims.\n  The vital need for domestic violence prevention services was \nhighlighted in a recent survey by the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention--CDC--which found that on average, 24 people per minute are \nvictims of rape, physical violence, or stalking by an intimate partner \nin the United States. Over the course of a year, that equals more than \n12 million women and men.\n  In California, about 30,000 people accessed crisis intervention \nservices from one of California's 63 rape crisis centers in 2010 and \n2011. These centers primarily rely on federal VAWA funding--not State \nfunding--to provide services to victims in their communities.\n  In 2009 alone, there were more than 167,000 cases in California in \nwhich local county or State police officers were called to the scene of \na domestic violence complaint according to the California Department of \nJustice.\n  The bill we are are considering today gives increased attention to \nvictims of sexual violence. This form of violence is particularly \ndestructive because, for many years, our society viewed sexual violence \nas the fault of the victim, not the perpetrator.\n  Although VAWA has always addressed the crime of sexual assault, a \nsmaller percentage of the bill's grant funding goes to sexual assault \nvictims than is proportional to their rates of victimization. The bill \ndoes three things to address this imbalance: No. 1, it provides an \nincreased focus on training for law enforcement and prosecutors to \naddress the ongoing needs of sexual assault victims; No. 2, the bill \nextends VAWA's housing protections to these victims; No. 3, and the \nbill ensures that those who are living with, but not married to, an \nabuser qualify for housing assistance available under VAWA.\n  The bill also updates the federal criminal code to clarify that \ncyberstalking is a crime. With increasing frequency, victims are being \nstalked over the Internet through e-mail, blogs, and Facebook. When \nstalking is done online, the message sent by the perpetrator is \nmemorialized forever, making it more difficult for victims to put the \npainful experience in the past and move forward in their lives.\n  Despite the fact that the underlying bill has 61 cosponsors from both \nparties, not a single Republican member of the Judiciary Committee--of \nwhich I am a longtime member--voted to advance the legislation.\n  The bill considered in the Judiciary Committee includes several \nchanges that I believe improve the underlying bill.\n  For example: It creates one very modest new grant program, \nconsolidates 13 existing programs, and reduces authorization levels for \nall other programs by 17 percent. The new bill would decrease the total \nauthorization level of $795 million in fiscal year 2011 to $659 million \nin fiscal year 2012. And it places emphasis on preventing domestic \nhomicides and reduces the national backlog of untested rape kits.\n  Yet, there are some who refuse to support it because it now includes \nexpanded protections for victims. Specifically, VAWA was expanded to \ninclude additional protections for gay and lesbian individuals, \nundocumented immigrants who are victims of domestic abuse, and \nauthority for Native American tribes to prosecute crimes.\n  In my view, these are improvements. Domestic violence is domestic \nviolence. I ask those who oppose the bill: If the victim is in a same-\nsex relationship, is the violence and danger any less real? If a family \ncomes to this country and the husband beats his wife to a bloody pulp, \ndo we say, well, you are illegal; I am sorry, you don't deserve any \nprotection?\n  911 operators and police officers don't refuse to help a victim \nbecause of their sexual orientation or the country where they were \nborn. When you call the police in America, they come.\n  VAWA will help ensure that all victims have access to life-saving \nservices, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. Lesbian, \ngay, bisexual and transgendered victims experience domestic violence in \n25 percent to 35 percent of relationships--the same rate as \nheterosexual couples. Yet, these victims are often turned away when \nthey seek help from shelters and professional service providers and \nthey do not receive the help they need.\n  VAWA would improve the LGBT community's ability to access services by \nexplicitly prohibiting grant recipients from discriminating based on \nsexual orientation or gender identity and by clarifying that gay and \nlesbian victims are included in the definition of underserved \npopulations.\n  Domestic and sexual violence in Tribal communities is a problem of \nepidemic proportions. Studies indicate that nearly three out of five \nNative\n\n[[Page S2783]]\n\nAmerican women have been assaulted by their spouses or intimate \npartners. The VAWA Reauthorization bill provides law enforcement with \nadditional tools to take on the plague of violence affecting Native \nwomen. The bill adds new Federal crimes--including a 10-year offense \nfor assaulting a spouse or intimate partner by strangling or \nsuffocation--the two types of assault that are frequently committed \nagainst women in Indian Country. And it closes loopholes to ensure that \nthose who commit domestic violence in Indian Country do not escape \njustice.\n  The Chairman of the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians in Highland, \nCA recently wrote to me to emphasize the importance of closing the \njurisdictional loophole. According to the chairman, the rampant \nviolence against Native women can in part be attributed to the absence \nof tribal criminal jurisdiction over non-Indian perpetrators.\n  Crimes of domestic violence or dating violence that would typically \nlead to convictions and sentences of anywhere between 6 months and 5 \nyears in U.S. courts are too often falling through the cracks in the \nlegal system when identical crimes occur in Indian Country.\n  The Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2011 is supported \nby over 50 national religious organizations including the Presbyterian \nChurch, the Episcopal Church, the Evangelical Lutheran Church, the \nNational Council of Jewish Women, National Council of Catholic Women, \nthe United Church of Christ and the United Methodist Church.\n  As I mentioned earlier, law enforcement officers are at particular \nrisk when they respond to domestic violence incidents. According to the \nLaw Enforcement Officer Deaths Memorial Fund, in 2009, 23 percent of \nfirearms-related deaths involved domestic disturbance calls. In 2010, \neight officers were killed responding to domestic violence calls.\n  VAWA provides needed training to decrease the risk to law enforcement \nwhen responding to domestic violence calls. The legislation includes \ngrants to develop and strengthen policies and training for law \nenforcement to recognize and effectively respond to instances of \ndomestic abuse.\n  To me, this bill is a no-brainer. To stand in the way of this bill is \nalmost to say we don't consider violence against women an important \nissue.\n  Let me repeat: this bill protects American women. It has support on \nboth sides of the aisle. It saves lives. It is a lifeline for women and \nchildren who are in distress.\n  We need to show our commitment to end domestic violence and sexual \nviolence. I hope that all senators will support this important effort \nto reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act with strong bipartisan \nsupport as we always have. This has always been a bipartisan effort. \nLet's vote and let's get it done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, in 1994 and again in 2000 and 2005, the \nSenate took a strong, bipartisan stance against acts of domestic and \nsexual violence that alter the lives of far too many American families \nand especially American women. With the passage and later \nreauthorizations of the Violence Against Women Act, Congress provided \ninvaluable aid--sometimes lifesaving aid--to hundreds of thousands of \nAmericans. There is no reason we cannot reauthorize this legislation \nagain this year with overwhelming bipartisan support, and I urge my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle and in both chambers of Congress \nto support this bill.\n  Since its passage, the Violence Against Women Act has provided \ncomprehensive support to survivors of domestic and sexual violence and \nto the Federal, State, and local agencies that confront this scourge \nevery day. The original legislation passed in 1994 laid a strong \nfoundation that helped establish a coordinated response to violence \nagainst women. Reauthorizations in 2000 and 2005 strengthened that \nfoundation. Today, through violence prevention grants, services to \nsurvivors of sexual assault, legal assistance, transitional housing \ngrants, assistance to law enforcement agencies and prosecutors, and \nother efforts, VAWA has made an enormous difference.\n  Deaths due to violent acts by intimate partners have decreased \nsignificantly. And according to a cost-benefit analysis, VAWA saved \nnearly $15 billion in its first 6 years of existence by avoiding the \nhigh social costs violence against women exacts on our Nation. William \nT. Robinson, the president of the American Bar Association, calls VAWA \n``the single most effective federal effort to respond to the epidemic \nof domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and stalking in \nthis country.''\n  For all its successes, VAWA has not ended our responsibility to act \nagainst violence. Domestic and sexual violence remain far too common \nfor us to abandon our efforts. And just as we have in past \nauthorizations, the legislation before us would strengthen our ability \nto confront violence in new ways.\n  Now, some of these new efforts have become controversial. Some of our \nRepublican colleagues have questioned provisions that extend VAWA's \nantidiscrimination protections. Some have questioned extending the \numbrella of this Nation's protections to immigrants. And some have \nquestioned provisions designed to protect Native American women from \nsexual and domestic violence. In fact, some of my colleagues have \ndenied that these provisions are necessary, and some have criticized \nthem as ``political.''\n  I certainly do not consider extending the successful protections of \nthis legislation to all Americans as ``political.'' I consider it \ncommon sense. I consider it our duty to help these survivors get the \nassistance they need. I strongly support these important extensions of \nthe act's protections, and I encourage my colleagues to support them as \nwell.\n  This is not a partisan issue. I hope the Senate can, as it has in the \npast, send a strong bipartisan message of support to survivors of \ndomestic or sexual violence. And I hope our colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives will quickly take up and approve legislation that will \nmake an enormous positive difference in the lives of so many.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I want to briefly comment on an issue \nthat has been raised by some with respect to the stalking provisions in \nthe bill.\n  Some outside observers have questioned whether the language in the \nbill would chill free speech or even criminalize constitutionally \nprotected speech. Obviously, that was not the intent of the language \nand I do not believe that would be the impact.\n  In fact, a statute cannot criminalize constitutionally protected \nspeech. If it is protected under the Constitution, then it is \nprotected, plain and simple.\n  The stalking provision is intended to make our anti-stalking laws \nmore effective. The problem with current law is that we require a \nvictim to actually suffer from substantial emotional distress in order \nfor the perpetrator to be prosecuted.\n  But sometimes victims are not even aware that they are being stalked, \nespecially if the stalker is using electronic surveillance, video \nsurveillance, or other technology that is specifically designed for \nspying.\n  So a stalker who is using technology to stalk his victim can escape \nprosecution simply because he goes undetected by the victim. That does \nnot make sense to me.\n  With the provision in the bill, we allow law enforcement and \nprosecutors to focus on the stalker's actions, and not just the \nvictim's emotions.\n  This will allow prosecutions if the perpetrator is caught before the \nvictim has suffered the necessary level of emotional distress. Under \ncurrent law, law enforcement has to wait until that harm has occurred, \neven though the stalker has already committed terrible invasions of the \nvictim's privacy.\n  But I understand the concerns of those who are worried about free \nspeech. I am willing to work with them to address their concerns as we \nmove forward.\n  I have no desire to inhibit free speech. This is not about speech, it \nis about video surveillance, tracking devices, and other secretive \nmethods of stalking. It is about truly dangerous and despicable \nbehavior.\n  Mr. DURBIN. According to a recent survey, 24 people every minute \nbecome victims of rape, physical violence, or stalking by an intimate \npartner in the United States. That means that just in the time it takes \nme to finish this statement, dozens will have been victimized.\n\n[[Page S2784]]\n\n  Since it was passed by Congress in 1994, the Violence Against Women \nAct has provided valuable, even life-saving, assistance to these \nhundreds of thousands of individuals. The impact of this bipartisan \nlegislation has been profound. According to the Bureau of Justice \nStatistics, the rate of domestic violence against women has dropped by \n53 percent since VAWA's passage. This legislation is critical.\n  There is no question that we are making tremendous progress. But \nthere are so many who urgently need help. Let's look at incidence of \nphysical violence: The Centers for Disease Control tell us that nearly \none in four women reports experiencing severe physical violence by an \nintimate partner. And the consequences can be severe. For example, \naccording to one report, in 2007, 45 percent of the women killed in the \nUnited States died at the hands of an intimate partner.\n  Sexual assault statistics are just as alarming: The CDC tells us that \nnearly one in five women in the United States has been raped. And more \nthan half of female rape victims report being raped by an intimate \npartner. One in six women in the United States has experienced \nstalking. Each one of these statistics, and every person who has \nsuffered domestic and sexual violence, shows us that we need to \nreauthorize this legislation, and we need to do it now.\n  This legislation is supported by victims, experts, and advocates. It \nis supported by service providers, faith leaders, and health care \nprofessionals. And it is supported by prosecutors, judges, and law \nenforcement officials. It should be supported by all of us here in \nCongress.\n  The last two VAWA reauthorizations have appropriately--and \ncarefully--expanded the scope of the law and improved it. This \nreauthorization is no exception. It applies the important lessons we \nhave learned from those working in the field and renews our commitment \nto reducing domestic and sexual violence. Here is what the \nreauthorization does:\n  It ensures that funding will continue to go to the organizations and \nindividuals who need help most. It places increased emphasis on \nresponding to sexual assault, in addition to domestic violence. It does \nthings like encourage jurisdictions to evaluate their rape kit \ninventories and reduce existing backlogs.\n  The reauthorization incorporates important accountability mechanisms. \nIt consolidates programs to reduce duplication and unnecessary \nbureaucracy. And it reduces spending. Total annual authorization has \nbeen cut by 17 percent. The reauthorization also helps meet the needs \nof victims from communities that have had difficulty accessing \ntraditional services, for example, because of their religion, sexual \norientation, or gender identity. It helps tribal communities. It helps \nabused immigrants.\n  The reauthorization helps ensure that law enforcement officials have \naccess to the tools they need by allowing for the ``recapture'' of a \nmodest number of U visas. U Visas, for victims of crimes, are an \nimportant law enforcement tool. They may be granted only after law \nenforcement certification and only if a non-citizen is the victim of \nenumerated--and serious--crimes. Law enforcement officials across the \ncountry have advocated for increased accessibility to U Visas: In my \nhome State of Illinois, Cook County State's Attorney Anita Alvarez \nsaid: ``Increasing the accessibility to U Visas will provide to \nprosecutors like me an important tool in protecting public safety.'' \nThe Fraternal Order of Police wrote: ``The expansion of the U Visa \nprogram will provide incalculable benefits to our citizens and our \ncommunities at a negligible cost.''\n  I want to take a moment to discuss an important provision in this \nreauthorization that I authored, working with Senator Leahy, to address \nan appalling situation taking place in our immigration detention \nfacilities. We have heard about truly horrific instances of sexual \nassault occurring in immigration detention facilities.\n  A troubling episode of Frontline, the PBS program, detailed one \nwoman's story in great detail recently. But that was hardly an isolated \nincident. As the National Prison Rape Elimination Commission has said: \n``[A]ccounts of abuse by staff and by detainees have been coming to \nlight for more than 20 years. As a group, immigration detainees are \nespecially vulnerable to sexual abuse and its effects while detained . \n. . .''\n  The Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003--``PREA''--aimed to eliminate \nthe sexual abuse of those in custody. This was legislation, championed \nby Senator Sessions, that I cosponsored. Our goal, together, was to \ncreate a ``zero-tolerance'' policy for this intolerable behavior. \nNobody behind bars should have to fear abuse from others in detention \nor from those meant to protect them. Simply put: sexual abuse is not, \nand cannot be, part of the punishment for those accused of violating \nour laws.\n  We are waiting on the Department of Justice's final National \nStandards to Prevent, Detect, and Respond to Prison Rape. But it is \nunclear to what extent those standards will be interpreted to apply to \nimmigration detention facilities--as opposed to, say, facilities under \nthe Bureau of Prisons. When we drafted and passed PREA, it was always \nour intent that it would apply to all those in detention--including \nimmigration detainees.\n  It was important to me to have a provision that clarifies that \nstandards to prevent prison rape must apply to immigration detainees. \nThis provision requires that, in the absence of other steps, the \nDepartment of Homeland Security and the Department of Health and Human \nServices quickly adopt standards for the prevention and punishment of \nsexual assault in all facilities with immigration detainees.\n  Custodial sexual assault is just one of the many issues addressed by \nthe Violence Against Women Act. I urge my colleagues to work with me to \nreauthorize this legislation. Previous VAWA reauthorizations have \nalways had broad bipartisan support. This legislation is not Democratic \nor Republican. It is about protecting our communities from abuse and \nviolence. This reauthorization that we are passing is an impressive \nproduct that carefully incorporates the expert feedback from those in \nthe field.\n  The dozens of individuals who have been victimized since I stood up \nhere today need our help now. Let's give it to them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I appreciate the work the leadership has \ndone, and I know Senator Murray has been very involved with that too, \nand I appreciate her help in getting us to a point where we now have a \nunanimous consent to get to votes and we can finally pass this bill.\n  I think sometimes a bill like this is an abstract matter. It is not \nan abstract matter to the women's organizations that support it. It is \nnot abstract to law enforcement who support it. And if I might speak \npersonally for a moment, it is not an abstract matter to me.\n  The distinguished Presiding Officer and I come from probably the \nsafest, lowest crime State in the country, but we both know that crimes \ndo happen. We also know that in a rural State, oftentimes domestic \nviolence is not reported. We don't talk about this outside the family. \nAnd I know that in some of those instances, when I had the privilege of \nserving as a prosecutor in Vermont, they didn't talk about it. I first \nheard about it usually in the morgue or at the great Fletcher Hospital. \nI learned about it because when the body was picked up, either the \nundertaker or the police or the ambulance driver realized this was not \na natural cause, and then we would sort of roll the clock back. In \nrolling the clock back, we found that all these warning signals were \nthere. There was nowhere for the victim to go. The things we now have \nwere not there then.\n  I was able to prosecute a number of these people. In fact, I probably \nbrought some of the first successful domestic violence prosecutions we \nhad. But police and prosecutors will say that those are always after \nthe fact.\n  So how do we stop this from happening in the first place? That is \nwhat the Leahy-Crapo Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act is \nabout. It is there to stop the crime before the crime happens. This \nbill is based on months of work with survivors, advocates, and law \nenforcement officers from all across the country, of all political \npersuasions. I never knew a time\n\n[[Page S2785]]\n\nwhen somebody would come to a crime scene and say: Is this victim a \nDemocrat or Republican, gay or straight, immigrant or not? We would \nsay: How do we catch the person who did this?\n  We listened to what the survivors, advocates, and law enforcement \nofficers told us. They told us what worked, what did not work, and what \ncould be improved. Then we carefully drafted the legislation to fit \nthese needs, and that is why our bill is supported by more than 1,000 \nFederal, State, and local organizations, service providers, law \nenforcement, religious organizations, and many more.\n  There is one purpose, and one purpose only, for the bill Senator \nCrapo and I introduced and others cosponsored: It is to help and \nprotect victims of domestic and sexual violence. Our legislation \nrepresents the voice of millions of survivors and advocates across the \ncountry. The same cannot be said with the Republican proposal brought \nforward in the last couple of days. That is why that proposal is \nopposed by such a wide spectrum of people and organizations.\n  Domestic and sexual violence knows no race, gender, ethnicity, or \nreligion. Its victims can be your next door neighbor, your colleague, a \nfellow church member, or your child's teacher at school. The Violence \nAgainst Women Reauthorization Act seeks to ensure that services to help \nvictims of domestic violence reach all victims, no matter who they are. \nThat is why civil and human rights organizations like the NAACP, the \nLeadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, Human Rights Watch, \nand End Violence Against Women International have urged Congress to act \nto reauthorize VAWA. I ask consent that these letters be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      National Association for the\n\n\n                                Advancement of Colored People,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 25, 2012.\n     Re: NAACP Support for S. 1925, the reauthorization of the \n         Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) and our opposition to \n         weakening amendments\n\n     Members,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the NAACP, our nation's oldest, \n     largest and most widely-recognized grassroots-based civil \n     rights organization, I strongly urge you to support the \n     speedy reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act \n     (VAWA), S. 1925. As you consider this legislation on the \n     Senate floor, I further urge you to oppose any weakening \n     amendments. Since it was first enacted in 1994, this \n     important legislation has sought to improve community-based \n     and criminal justice system responses to domestic violence, \n     dating violence, sexual assault and stalking in the United \n     States.\n       The NAACP strongly supported passage of the original VAWA \n     in 1994, and since that time no other law has done more to \n     stop domestic and sexual violence in our communities. The \n     resources and training provided by VAWA have changed \n     attitudes toward these reprehensible crimes, improved the \n     response of law enforcement and the justice system, and \n     provided essential services for victims struggling to rebuild \n     their lives. It is a law that has saved and improved \n     countless lives, and should clearly be reauthorized and \n     strengthened. Within the United States, domestic violence \n     related homicides have dropped significantly since the \n     passage of VAWA.\n       On Wednesday, November 30, 2011 Senators Patrick Leahy (VT) \n     and Mike Crapo (ID) introduced S. 1925, a bipartisan bill to \n     reauthorize and improve VAWA. The NAACP has, through its \n     Washington Bureau and in collaboration with the National Task \n     Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence Against Women, \n     worked closely with these Senators to ensure that under S. \n     1925 VAWA will continue to fund programs which have proven \n     themselves to be effective and that key changes will be made \n     to streamline VAWA and make sure that even more Americans \n     have access to safety, stability and justice.\n       In addition to supporting enactment of the VAWA in 1994, \n     the NAACP has joined bipartisan supporters in reauthorizing \n     this important legislation in 2000 and 2005. We have seen the \n     VAWA change the landscape for victims in the United States \n     who once suffered in silence. Victims of domestic violence, \n     dating violence, sexual assault and stalking have now been \n     able to access services, and a new generation of families and \n     justice system professionals have come to understand that \n     domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and \n     stalking are crimes that our society will no longer tolerate.\n       I look forward to working with you to pass a strong \n     reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act to honor \n     the memory of the women that have lost their lives and \n     endured these atrocities and for the hope that this bill will \n     continue to protect future generations of women. Thank you in \n     advance for your attention to the NAACP position. Should you \n     have any questions or comments, please do not hesitate to \n     contact me at my office at (202) 463 2940.\n           Sincerely,\n     Hilary O. Shelton,\n       Director, NAACP Washington Bureau & Senior Vice President, \n     Advocacy and Policy.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. These organizations recognize the impact VAWA has in \nreducing incidences of sexual and domestic violence in our country. \nSince its initial passage in 1994, no law has done more to combat \ndomestic violence and sexual assault. Because of VAWA, victims have \naccess to life-saving services. It is time that we ensure that all \nvictims have access to these resources.\n  The National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence Against \nWomen, which represents dozens of organizations across the country, \nsays the substitute was drafted without input or consultation from the \nthousands of professionals engaged in this work every day.\n  The substitute includes damaging, nonworkable provisions that will \nharm victims, increase costs, and create unnecessary inefficiencies. I \nknow it may be well-intentioned, but it is no substitute for the months \nof work we have done in a bipartisan way with the people across the \ncountry to bring this bill that is before us. Unfortunately, it \nundermines the core principles of the Violence Against Women Act. It \nresolves in abandoning some of the most vulnerable victims and strips \nout key provisions that are critically necessary to protect all \nvictims, including immigrants, Native women, and victims in same-sex \nrelationships. Again, a victim is a victim is a victim. We don't say: \nWe can help you if you fit in this category. But sorry, battered woman, \nyou are on your own because you fit in the wrong category. That is not \nthe America I know and love.\n  The improvements in the bipartisan Leahy-Crapo Violence Against Women \nReauthorization Act are taken out, and the Republican proposal is no \nsubstitute. It does nothing to meet the needs of victims. It undermines \nthe focus of protecting women. It literally calls for removing the word \n``women'' from the largest VAWA grant program. They are still \nvictimized at far higher rates and with far greater impact on their \nlives than men. Shifting this focus away from women is unnecessary and \nharmful, and it could send a terrible message. There is no reason to \nturn the Violence Against Women Act inside out, to eliminate the focus \non the victims the bill has always been intended to protect.\n  By contrast, our bipartisan bill does not eliminate the focus against \nwomen but increases our focus to include all victims of domestic \nviolence and sexual assault.\n  I see others on the floor. I have far more I am going to say about \nthis, and I am about to yield the floor in case others wish to speak.\n  Remember, this bill is the Violence Against Women Act. Let's not go \naway from that. It has been carefully put together with the best input \nwe could get from law enforcement, from victims organizations, and, I \nmust say, from some victims themselves. This is to protect those \npeople. I have seen some crime scenes that I still have nightmares \nabout decades later, and I can guarantee my colleagues that every \nprosecutor in this country and every police officer in this country who \ndeals with these matters probably have the same kinds of nightmares.\n\n  Are we going to stop all violence against women with this act? Of \ncourse not. But as a result of having had this legislation in effect \nfor years, the numbers have come down because there is a place to go, \nthere are people to help, and there are people to stop the violence. \nThat is what we want to do--not to be, as I was during those nights in \nthe morgue, saying to the police: Let's find out who did this so we can \ncatch them, but, rather, to stop them before it happens and to protect \nthe people so they live. That is what we are trying to do. That is what \nthis bill does.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I wish to commend my colleague from \nTexas, Senator Hutchison, for offering her substitute amendment to the \nViolence Against Women Act reauthorization bill. I am pleased to \ncosponsor her amendment. This amendment is vitally needed.\n\n[[Page S2786]]\n\n  The Violence Against Women Act has always been reauthorized in the \npast on a bipartisan, consensus basis.\n  It would have been so easy to do so again.\n  All of us who support the amendment of the Senator from Texas are in \nagreement with 80 percent of the bill that is before us.\n  But the majority has decided to place a higher priority on scoring \npolitical points than on passing another consensus reauthorization of \nthe law.\n  Recently, Vice President Biden asked what kind of message it would \nsend to women if VAWA were allowed to expire.\n  He implied that a crisis would be at hand that must be avoided at all \ncosts.\n  But the actual answer to his question is clear.\n  The majority party has already allowed VAWA to expire.\n  VAWA's reauthorization expired last October.\n  There has been no crisis of any kind because the appropriations for \nVAWA programs have kept flowing.\n  It is the majority, not us, that is responsible for the lapse in \nVAWA's authorization.\n  The way that the Judiciary Committee handled reauthorization this \ntime has been very disappointing.\n  The majority insisted on including--and retaining--provisions that \nappear designed to provoke partisan opposition.\n  For instance, the majority insisted on giving Indian tribal courts \ncriminal jurisdiction over non-Indian Americans for the first time in \nour country's history.\n  The committee held one hearing on reauthorizing this bill, and it \ndevoted no attention to exploring how this provision would operate.\n  As a result, the committee described this provision in only four \nsentences in its report on the legislation.\n  We all recognize that domestic violence rates in Indian country are \ntoo high.\n  Both the committee-reported bill and the Hutchison-Grassley \nsubstitute contain provisions to address the problem.\n  But the majority cannot explain why expanding the power of tribal \ncourts would be effective or how this would work.\n  Do the tribes have the resources and expertise and resources to \ncomply with the Constitution?\n  How would the Federal courts' caseload be affected by all the new \nhabeas petitions that would necessarily be filed if this became law?\n  What changes would occur in the existing relationships between \nFederal, State, and tribal law enforcement?\n  The majority has no idea whether this provision would help matters or \nnot because it simply did not give this issue any careful attention.\n  Moreover, the Congressional Research Service has raised several \nconstitutional issues that would be posed by this provision as it was \nreported from the committee.\n  These include due process, equal protection, fifth amendment grand \njury and double jeopardy issues, as well as sixth amendment rights to \ncounsel and a jury trial by one's peers.\n  At the eleventh hour before floor consideration, the majority has \nrecognized the serious constitutional issues that were raised by the \ncommittee language.\n  It has changed the language in an effort to respond to the \nconstitutional questions it had denied existed.\n  If we had had a hearing on these questions, matters could have \nproceeded differently.\n  These changes do not address the constitutional questions CRS posed \nabout congressional power to recognize the inherent power of tribes to \nprosecute non-Indians, nor do they affect the inability of a defendant \nto appeal his conviction.\n  And, of course, they do not address the practical concerns that I \nhave raised all along.\n  CRS also raises constitutional due process concerns regarding another \nsection in the bill that would give tribal courts the authority to \nenforce protective orders. That section remains unchanged.\n  Ironically, the constitutional concerns about the criminal provisions \nare made more severe because the majority refused to eliminate language \nwe asked them to omit.\n  Constitutional problems are made worse because the bill gives tribes \ncriminal jurisdiction as part of their claimed inherent sovereignty.\n  Our substitute strikes the provisions.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe relevant portions of the CRS analysis.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        [From the Congressional Research Service, Apr. 13, 2012]\n\n\n                               MEMORANDUM\n\n     To: Senate Judiciary Committee.\n     From: Jane M. Smith, Legislative Attorney, 7 7202.\n     Subject: State Jurisdiction over Indian country; Public Law \n         280; S. 1925's Provision for Tribal Court Jurisdiction to \n         Issue Protection Orders and Due Process.\n\n       This memorandum is in response to your request for an \n     explanation of state jurisdiction over Indian country; an \n     explanation of how Public Law 280 affects that jurisdiction; \n     and an analysis of whether the provision in S. 1925, the \n     Violence Against Women Act Reauthorization Act (VAWA \n     Reauthorization), concerning the jurisdiction of tribal \n     courts to issue protection orders against ``all persons'' \n     comports with the requirements of due process under the \n     Constitution.\n\n\n                 State Jurisdiction Over Indian Country\n\n       In the absence of congressional authorization, state \n     jurisdiction in Indian country depends on whether the conduct \n     at issue involves non-Indians or Indians only.\n\n\n                  Civil Jurisdiction Over Non-Indians\n\n       Generally, states have civil jurisdiction over non-Indians \n     in Indian country, unless that jurisdiction is preempted by \n     federal law or is incompatible with the right of Indian \n     tribes to govern themselves. In order to determine whether \n     federal law preempts state jurisdiction over non-Indians, \n     courts engage in ``a particularized inquiry into the nature \n     of the state, federal, and tribal interests at stake, an \n     inquiry designed to determine whether, in the specific \n     context, the exercise of state authority would violate \n     federal law.''\n       The courts:\n       examine[] the language of the relevant federal treaties and \n     statutes in terms of both the broad policies that underlie \n     them and the notions of sovereignty that have developed from \n     historical traditions of tribal independence. This inquiry is \n     not dependent on mechanical or absolute conceptions of state \n     or tribal sovereignty, but has called for a particularized \n     inquiry into the nature of the state, federal, and tribal \n     interests at stake, an inquiry designed to determine whether, \n     in the specific context, the exercise of state authority \n     would violate federal law.\n       In order to determine whether state law applies to non-\n     Indian conduct in Indian country, therefore, courts engage in \n     a particularized weighing of the federal, tribal, and state \n     interests at stake.\n       In Bracker, the Court considered whether the state could \n     impose motor vehicle license and fuel taxes on the logging \n     and hauling operations of a non-Indian contractor working for \n     the tribe exclusively within the reservation. Finding that \n     federal control over tribal timber was pervasive (``the \n     Bureau of Indian Affairs exercises literally daily \n     supervision over the harvesting and management of tribal \n     timber''), the Court held that the state taxes were preempted \n     by federal law. Preemption of state law can occur, therefore, \n     not only when the state law violates federal law, but also \n     when federal involvement with the activity is pervasive.\n       There is very little case law on when state jurisdiction \n     interferes with the right of Indians to govern themselves. In \n     Washington v. Confederated Tribes of the Colville Indian \n     Reservation, the Supreme Court rejected the tribes' argument \n     that because the tribal government generated substantial \n     revenues from selling cigarettes without state taxes that \n     imposing the state cigarette tax would infringe on their \n     right to govern themselves. The Court noted the tribes' \n     interest in governing themselves was strongest when the \n     conduct at issue involved tribal members only and determined \n     that the tribes did not have a legitimate interest in \n     marketing an exception to state taxation. Because there is so \n     little case law, it is not clear under what circumstances \n     application of state law to non-Indians would interfere with \n     a tribe's ability to govern itself.\n\n\n                 Criminal Jurisdiction Over Non-Indians\n\n       Most states only have criminal jurisdiction over non-\n     Indians committing crimes against other non-Indians in Indian \n     country. The federal government has exclusive jurisdiction \n     over non-Indians who commit crimes against Indians.\n\n\n The Effect of Public Law 280 on State Jurisdiction Over Indian Country\n\n       Public Law 280 gave to certain states criminal jurisdiction \n     and civil adjudicatory jurisdiction over Indian country. \n     ``[W]hen a State seeks to enforce a law within an Indian \n     reservation under the authority of Pub. L. 280, it must be \n     determined whether the law is criminal in nature, and thus \n     fully applicable to the reservation . . ., or civil in nature \n     and applicable only as it may be relevant to private civil \n     litigation in state court.''\n       Whether a law is criminal or civil does not depend on \n     whether the law carries criminal penalties. Rather, a law is \n     criminal in nature if it prohibits an activity outright, and \n     it is civil in nature if it allows the activity but regulates \n     it. Thus, in California v. Cabazon\n\n[[Page S2787]]\n\n     Band of Mission Indians, the Supreme Court held that even \n     though California's gaming laws carried criminal penalties, \n     they were civil in nature because they allowed certain kinds \n     of gaming, but regulated them. Thus, states that have \n     criminal jurisdiction over Indian country under Public Law \n     280 have criminal jurisdiction over all conduct by Indians \n     and non-Indians which violates a state law that is \n     prohibitory.\n\n\n  Tribal Court Jurisdiction to Issue Civil Protection Orders Under S. \n                          1925 and Due Process\n\n       Section 905 of S. 1925 provides: ``a court of an Indian \n     tribe shall have full civil jurisdiction to issue and enforce \n     protection orders involving any person . . . in matters \n     arising anywhere in the Indian country of the Indian tribe \n     (as defined in section 1151) or otherwise within the \n     authority of the Indian tribe.'' According to the Senate \n     Report, this section is intended to make clear that tribal \n     court jurisdiction covers all persons within the tribe's \n     jurisdiction, including non-Indians.\n\n\n                     The Intent Behind Section 905\n\n       Under current law, the general rule is that ``the inherent \n     sovereign powers of an Indian tribe do not extend to the \n     activities of nonmembers of the tribe.'' However, there are \n     two exceptions to this rule. First ``[a] tribe may regulate, \n     through taxation, licensing, or other means, the activities \n     of nonmembers who enter consensual relationships with the \n     tribe or its members through commercial dealing, contracts, \n     leases, other arrangements.'' Second, ``[a] tribe may also \n     retain inherent power to exercise civil authority over the \n     conduct of non-Indians on fee lands within its reservation \n     when that conduct threatens or has some direct effect on the \n     political integrity, the economic security, or the health or \n     welfare of the tribe.''\n       It appears that section 905 would expand a tribe's civil \n     authority over non-Indians to enter protective orders. \n     According to the Senate Report, section 905 is intended to \n     ensure that the result in Martinez v. Martinez is not \n     repeated. In Martinez, Mrs. Martinez, an Alaska Native who \n     was not a member of the Suquamish Tribe, obtained from the \n     Suquamish tribal court a protection order against her \n     husband, a non-Indian. The Martinez family lived on non-\n     Indian fee land located within the tribe's reservation. Mr. \n     Martinez objected to the court's jurisdiction and sought an \n     injunction against the tribal court in federal district \n     court. The district court granted the injunction, finding the \n     tribal court lacked jurisdiction over Mr. Martinez.\n       The federal court rejected the tribe's and Mrs. Martinez's \n     argument that Congress had granted the tribal court \n     jurisdiction to issue protection orders against non-Indians \n     in 18 U.S.C. 2265(e). That section, which was in the Violence \n     Against Women Act (VAWA), provides: ``Tribal court \n     jurisdiction.--. . . a tribal court shall have full civil \n     jurisdiction to enforce protection orders . . . in matters \n     arising within the authority of the tribe.'' The court wrote:\n       The Court does not construe the provisions of the VAWA as a \n     grant of jurisdiction to the Suquamish Tribe to enter \n     domestic violence protection orders as between two non-\n     members of the Tribe that reside on fee land within the \n     reservation. There is nothing in this language that \n     explicitly confers upon the Tribe jurisdiction to regulate \n     non-tribal member domestic relations. The grant of authority \n     simply provides jurisdiction ``in matters arising within the \n     authority of the tribe.''\n       Tribal jurisdiction over non-members is highly disfavored \n     and there exists a presumption against tribal jurisdiction. \n     There must exist ``express authorization'' by federal statute \n     of tribal jurisdiction over the conduct of non-members. For \n     there to be an express delegation of jurisdiction over non-\n     members there must be a ``clear statement'' of express \n     delegation of jurisdiction.\n       Section 905, therefore, is apparently intended to provide \n     such a delegation of authority to tribal courts to issue \n     protection orders over non-members within the tribes' \n     reservations or jurisdictions.\n\n\n                 Due Process and Personal Jurisdiction\n\n       The Supreme Court has held that due process requires that a \n     defendant have ``minimum contacts'' with a jurisdiction \n     ``such that the maintenance of the suit [in the jurisdiction] \n     does not offend traditional notions of fair play and \n     substantial justice.'' There may be an issue with section 905 \n     in that it would delegate to tribal courts jurisdiction over \n     ``all persons,'' regardless of their contacts with the Indian \n     tribe.\n       Taking section 905 literally, it does not appear to require \n     that a person have minimum contacts with the tribe in order \n     for the tribe to exercise jurisdiction over him or her to \n     issue protection orders. Under section 905, the outcome of \n     the Martinez case arguably would have been different: the \n     tribal court would have had jurisdiction over Martinez, a \n     non-Indian, even though he appears to lack contacts with the \n     tribe--he was not married to a member of the tribe, did not \n     work for the tribe, and lived on non-Indian fee land. There \n     is an argument that the tribal court's exercise of \n     jurisdiction over Mr. Martinez would ``offend traditional \n     notions of fair play and substantial justice,'' because he \n     may not have minimum connections to the tribe, and thus \n     violate the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.\n       Advocates of tribal jurisdiction would probably argue that \n     because Mr. Martinez lived within the tribe's reservation he \n     had sufficient minimum contacts with the tribe. However, Mr. \n     Martinez lived on non-Indian fee land. Under United States v. \n     Montana, as a matter of federal common law, tribes generally \n     do not have jurisdiction over non-Indians on non-Indian fee \n     land within the reservation, subject to the two exceptions. \n     Therefore, it appears that residence by a non-Indian on non-\n     Indian fee land within a tribe's reservation does not connect \n     the resident to the tribe in a way to support tribal \n     jurisdiction under the federal common law. It is not clear \n     whether it would be sufficient to establish minimum contacts \n     for the purposes of due process.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        [From the Congressional Research Service, Apr. 18, 2012]\n\n Tribal Criminal Jurisdiction over Non-Indians in the Violence Against \n     Women Act (VAWA) Reauthorization and the SAVE Native Women Act\n\n   (By Jane M. Smith, Legislative Attorney; Richard M. Thompson II, \n                         Legislative Attorney)\n\n       Domestic and dating violence in Indian country are at \n     epidemic proportions. However, there is a practical \n     jurisdictional issue when the violence involves a non-Indian \n     perpetrator and an Indian victim. Indian tribes only have \n     criminal jurisdiction over crimes involving Indian \n     perpetrators within their jurisdictions. Most states only \n     have jurisdiction over crimes involving a non-Indian \n     perpetrator and a non-Indian victim within Indian country \n     located in the state. Although the federal government has \n     jurisdiction over non-Indian-on-Indian crimes in Indian \n     country, offenses such as domestic and dating violence tend \n     to be prosecuted with less frequency than other crimes. This \n     creates a practical jurisdictional problem.\n       Legislation introduced in the 112th Congress, the Violence \n     Against Women Reauthorization Act (S. 1925 and H.R. 4271) and \n     the SAVE Native Women Act (S. 1763 and H.R. 4154), would \n     recognize and affirm participating tribes' inherent sovereign \n     authority to exercise special domestic violence jurisdiction \n     over domestic violence involving non-Indian perpetrators and \n     Indian victims occurring within the tribe's jurisdiction. It \n     is not clear whether Congress has authority to restore the \n     tribes' inherent sovereignty over non-members, or whether \n     such authority would have to be a delegation of federal \n     authority.\n       In a series of cases, the Supreme Court outlined the \n     contours of tribal criminal jurisdiction. In United States v. \n     Wheeler, the Court held that tribes have inherent sovereign \n     authority to try their own members. In Oliphant v. Suquamish \n     Indian Tribe, the Court held the tribes had lost inherent \n     sovereignty to try non-Indians. The Court in Duro v. Reina \n     determined that the tribes had also lost the inherent \n     authority to try non-member Indians. In response to Duro, \n     Congress passed an amendment to the Indian Civil Rights Act \n     that recognized the inherent tribal power (not federal \n     delegated power) to try non-member Indians. The Violence \n     Against Women Reauthorization and the SAVE Native Women Act, \n     would apparently abrogate the Oliphant ruling and ``recognize \n     and affirm the inherent power'' of the tribes to try non-\n     Indians for domestic violence offenses.\n       The Supreme Court stated in United States v. Lara that \n     Congress has authority to relax the restrictions on a tribe's \n     inherent sovereignty to allow it to exercise inherent \n     authority to try non-member Indians. However, because of \n     changes on the Court and, as Justice Thomas stated, the \n     ``schizophrenic'' nature of Indian policy and the confused \n     state of Indian law, it is not clear that today's Supreme \n     Court would hold that Congress has authority to expand the \n     tribes' inherent sovereignty. It may be that Congress can \n     only delegate federal power to the tribes to try non-Indians.\n       The dichotomy between delegated and inherent power of \n     tribes has important constitutional implications. If Congress \n     is deemed to delegate its own power to the tribes to \n     prosecute crimes, all the protections accorded criminal \n     defendants in the Bill of Rights will apply. If, on the other \n     hand, Congress is permitted to recognize the tribes' inherent \n     sovereignty, the Constitution will not apply. Instead, \n     criminal defendants must rely on statutory protections under \n     the Indian Civil Rights Act. Although the protections found \n     in these statutory and constitutional sources are similar, \n     there are several important distinctions between them. Most \n     importantly, if inherent sovereignty is recognized and only \n     statutory protections are triggered, defendants may be \n     subjected to double jeopardy for the same act; may have no \n     right to counsel in misdemeanor cases if they cannot afford \n     one; may have no right to prosecution by a grand jury \n     indictment; may not have access to a representative jury of \n     their peers; and may have limited federal appellate review of \n     their cases.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, to address the real problems of domestic \nviolence among Native Americans, our substitute would permit tribes to \npetition for protective orders against non-Indians in Federal court.\n  The committee-reported bill did not respect due process in the area \nof accusations against college students.\n  Of course, allegations of sexual assault on campus should be taken as \nseriously as anywhere else.\n\n[[Page S2788]]\n\n  But reputations can be ruined by false charges, so it is important \nthat fairness in adjudications occur.\n  As a practical matter, the committee-reported bill imposed on these \ncampus proceedings the standards of proof issued in a controversial \nproposed regulation by the Department of Education.\n  They were very weak and unfair.\n  Additionally, under the committee-reported bill, if the campus \ndisciplinary authority exonerated the innocent even under the weak \nstandard of proof, the accuser could appeal for another round of \nproceedings.\n  That just is not fair.\n  At the last minute, the majority has changed the first but not the \nsecond of these provisions.\n  Now, the investigation must be fair and impartial.\n  That is progress.\n  This change should have been made much earlier.\n  But the bill still allows a person who has been found innocent after \na fair investigation to be pursued again at the victim's request.\n  Our substitute eliminates that unfairness.\n  The committee bill also mishandles immigration issues.\n  The one hearing the Judiciary Committee held presented testimony that \nfraud exists in the VAWA-self petitioning process.\n  We heard from victims who fell in love with foreign nationals, \nsponsored them for residency in the United States, only to be accused \nof abuse so that the foreign national could get a green card.\n  The chairman promised at the hearing to include language in the bill \nthat would address this immigration fraud, but his bill fails to \ninclude anything of the sort.\n  Our substitute contains language that will reduce fraud and abuse by \nrequiring an in person interview whenever possible with the applicant \nwho alleges abuse.\n  We cannot allow people to misuse the VAWA self-petitioning process to \nobtain a green card.\n  The committee-reported bill also expands the number of U visas by \ntens of thousands without changing the rules by which they are issued.\n  Under current law, an individual may be eligible for a U visa if he \nor she has been or is likely to be helpful to the investigation or \nprosecution of a crime.\n  However, the requirements for a U visa are generous.\n  There is no requirement that an investigation be commenced as a \nresult of the alien reporting the crime; there is no time period within \nwhich an alien has to report the crime; the crime could have occurred \nyears before it is reported and there could be no way to identify the \nperpetrator; the alien seeking the ``U'' visa could even have a \ncriminal record of their own.\n  Our substitute includes commonsense, best practices to ensure that U \nvisas are truly used as a tool to fight crime.\n  The Hutchison-Grassley substitute amendment will better protect \nvictims of domestic violence than does the underlying bill.\n  Hundreds of millions of dollars in grant money for domestic violence \nprograms are distributed every year.\n  For that money to be effective, it must actually reach victims.\n  But too much of the money does not reach victims.\n  Excess amounts are spent on administrative expenses, conferences, and \nlobbying, and some is lost to waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  For example, since 1998, the inspector general has audited 22 \nindividual VAWA grantees.\n  In those random audits, 21 were found to have unallowable costs, \nunsupported expenditures, or other serious deficiencies in how they \nexpended taxpayer dollars.\n  That is millions of dollars that could have helped an untold number \nof victims but instead were lost.\n  Although some good accountability measures were included in the \ncommittee-reported bill, more are necessary.\n  The substitute amendment requires audits and includes mandatory \nexclusions for those who are found to have violated program rules.\n  It limits conference expenditures at the Justice Department and \nHealth and Human Services Department unless there is proper oversight.\n  It prohibits lobbying by grantees, and it limits administrative \nexpenses in the government's management of the grants.\n  Our substitute directs more money to victims of the most serious \ncrimes than the committee bill by requiring 30 percent--not 20 \npercent--of the funds go toward sexual assault.\n  It directs that 70 percent of the funds for reducing rape kit \nbacklogs actually be used for that purpose, not the mere 40 percent in \nthe committee-reported bill.\n  The substitute protects victims in other ways that are not contained \nin the underlying bill.\n  It contains a 10-year mandatory minimum sentence for aggravated \nsexual abuse.\n  It imposes a mandatory minimum sentence of 1 year for possession of \nchild pornography where the child depicted is under 12.\n  That does not go far enough, but it is a step in the right direction.\n  It is a consensus item that has passed the Judiciary Committee in the \npast with a strong bipartisan vote.\n  The alternative also creates a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years \nfor interstate domestic violence that results in death.\n  There are opponents of mandatory minimum sentences.\n  The leniency-industrial complex is active in this area as in others.\n  But we should not take too seriously the claims of opponents of the \nmandatory minimums that they take away judicial discretion.\n  They think that judges should be able to give any sentence they want \non these crimes, even potentially no jail time at all.\n  Contrary to victims' groups, they fear that any requirement of jail \ntime for these crimes will be counterproductive and lead to lower \nsentences.\n  But those same opponents support the grants for arrest in the \ncommittee-reported bill.\n  Unlike sentences, mandatory arrest policies tie the hands of law \nenforcement to take action against people who have not been convicted \nof anything.\n  They may reduce the likelihood that the police may be called in \nactual cases of domestic violence.\n  They may result in calls to the police by one person for leverage \nagainst another.\n  They may cause other negative unintended consequences as well.\n  Our substitute also gives the Marshals Service administrative \nsubpoena authority to pursue unregistered sex offenders.\n  These are individuals who are required by law to register as sex \noffenders but fail to comply.\n  This is another provision that has enjoyed wide bipartisan support in \nthe Judiciary Committee.\n  Victims will also be helped by the substitute's requirement of an \naudit of the Justice Department's use of the Crime Victims Fund.\n  When criminals are convicted and made to pay fines, these fines are \nplaced in a fund for the sole purpose of assisting victims.\n  However, there are questions whether the Justice Department is \nspending these funds only for their one permitted use.\n  An audit is in order.\n  And the bill also includes a bipartisan provision to enable victims \nto receive restitution that is owed to them but has not been paid.\n  The IRS would be permitted to deduct the money from payments it would \notherwise make to the perpetrator.\n  Mr. President, there is broad bipartisan support for reauthorizing \nthe Violence Against Women Act.\n  The Hutchison-Grassley substitute would of the underlying bill \nreauthorize the 80 percent that enjoys that consensus.\n  It eliminates provisions that are not consensus and would not pass \nthe other body and become law.\n  And it adds other provisions that are widely supported and would \nprovide real benefits to victims of domestic violence.\n  I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, may I inquire as to how much time remains \non this side of the aisle?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 24 minutes remaining.\n\n[[Page S2789]]\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent to reserve 15 minutes for my \nremarks out of the 24 available, and if I could get some notice from \nthe chair when we approach that. I may not use that much; I may yield \nit back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Thank you, Mr. President. The Violence Against Women Act \nwill be reauthorized, at least in the Senate, by bipartisan consensus \ntoday. There are some different versions that will be offered. I am \nsure each side thinks theirs is an improvement over the alternative, \nand I will leave to Senator Hutchison and Senator Grassley to address \nthe improvements they have made over the bill that came out of the \nJudiciary Committee and the alternative they have proposed.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2086\n\n       (Purpose: To amend title 18 of the United States Code and \n     other provisions of law to strengthen provisions of the \n     Violence Against Women Act and improve justice for crime \n     victims)\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on an amendment I have \noffered, and I ask unanimous consent at this time to call up amendment \nNo. 2086 and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I do not \nbelieve I will object, is this based on the unanimous consent agreement \nthat was entered into by the two leaders? I ask, through the Chair, the \nSenator from Texas, is this amendment No. 2086?\n  Mr. CORNYN. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I do not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Cornyn], for himself, Mr. Kirk, \n     Mr. Bennet, Mr. McConnell, and Mr. Vitter, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2086.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Wednesday, April 25, 2012, \nunder ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. CORNYN. This amendment I have offered in conjunction with Senator \nVitter, Senator McConnell, Senator Michael Bennet from Colorado, and \nothers is a bipartisan amendment which will make sure that more of the \nmoney contained in the funds the Congress appropriates to the \nDepartment of Justice will be used to test backlogged rape kit evidence \nthat has not been tested. I know the jargon may be a little confusing, \nbut basically what happens is when the law enforcement officials \ninvestigate a sexual assault, they take a rape kit to collect physical \nevidence and bodily fluids for DNA testing, among other types of tests.\n  It is a national scandal that we don't know how many untested rape \nkits there may be. In other words, criminal investigations take place \nwhere this critical evidence is acquired, but it never goes to a \nlaboratory to be tested to identify the perpetrator of that sexual \nassault. It is estimated that there are as many as 400,000 untested \nrape kits across the country sitting either in laboratories or in \npolice lockers, evidence lockers, that have not yet been forwarded for \ntesting at a laboratory--400,000.\n  I heard a chilling statistic this morning from a young woman, Camille \nCooper, who is the legislative director of an organization called \nPROTECT out of Knoxville, TN. This is an organization that commits \nitself to combating child sex crimes and to helping those victims get \njustice.\n  She said this morning in my presence that before law enforcement \nidentifies a child sex crime perpetrator, on average they project as \nmany as 27 children have already been sexually assaulted by this same \nperson before law enforcement gets them on their radar. I mention that \nnumber--I can't vouch for the number, but I do trust her--I mention \nthat because the reason these 400,000 estimated rape kits--critical \nevidence in a child or in an adult sexual assault case--if they are \nuntested, that evidence cannot be used to then match up against the DNA \ndata bank to get a hit to identify the perpetrator of the crime. By the \nnature of the crime, these are not one-time events. These are people \nwho for some unknown reason tend to commit serial assaults against \nchildren and women. So it is even more necessary, more compelling, to \nidentify them early because if we wait too long, we may either run into \na statute of limitations and not be able to prosecute them for that \ncrime but, even worse, in the interim, they are committing additional \nsexual assaults against other victims.\n  So it is absolutely critical that we get these rape kits tested--this \nphysical evidence from sexual assault cases--as soon as we can and \nmatch it up against the DNA in these DNA data banks that are maintained \nby the FBI so we can identify the people who are committing these \nheinous crimes and get them off the streets sooner, so that future \nvictims will be protected from those assaults. It is also important \nthat a person who is suspected of one of these heinous crimes be \nexonerated if, in fact, the physical evidence will rule them out from \nhaving committed the crime.\n  My amendment to the underlying bill is included in the Hutchison-\nGrassley version. But in the event the Hutchison-Grassley version does \nnot prevail today, I offer my amendment that will redirect more of the \nmoney--the $100 million that is appropriated by Congress under the \nDebbie Smith Act--to make sure this critical evidence is tested on a \ntimely basis for the reasons I mentioned.\n  My amendment requires that at least 75 percent of the funds given out \nthrough grant programs by the Department of Justice be used for the \ncore purpose of testing those rape kits. Also, 7 percent of those funds \nwould be used to inventory the backlog.\n  To me, it is a scandal that we don't even know what the backlog \nconsists of because there are actually two kinds of backlog cases: One \nis the case where the kit is already at the laboratory and it is a part \nof the backlog of the laboratory. But the hidden backlog consists of \nthe rape test kits that are maintained in police lockers and have never \nbeen forwarded to the laboratory in the first place. Those are not \ntypically part of this estimate of the backlog. The experts--the people \nwho watch this area closely--estimate that if we count all of the \nuntested kits that are evidence waiting for a laboratory to test them \nto match up with a perpetrator of these crimes, there could be as many \nas 400,000 of them untested by the labs in the backlog.\n\n  I know my colleague, Senator Klobuchar, will be offering an \nalternative to my amendment. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record at the end of my present remarks a letter from the Rape, \nAbuse and Incest National Network on those two competing amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CORNYN. I will not read the whole letter, which is addressed to \nme, but I will read parts of it:\n\n       I am writing to express RAINN's concern with the draft VAWA \n     amendment by Sen. Klobuchar. Unlike the Cornyn amendment, we \n     do not believe this draft amendment will make effective or \n     positive improvements to the Debbie Smith Act.\n\n  Indeed, they conclude later in the letter:\n\n       Overall, we believe this amendment is largely symbolic and \n     will not have the impact in reducing the backlog that we find \n     in the Cornyn amendment.\n\n  Very quickly, there is no requirement in the Klobuchar amendment that \naudits actually have to be conducted. So, to me, that seems like a case \nof willful blindness to the size and scope of the backlogs and the \nproblems.\n  There is no requirement in the Klobuchar alternative for a registry. \nIn other words, there is no way the Department of Justice can make sure \nthe money granted to law enforcement is actually used for the purpose \nfor which the grant was intended, by creating a registry. In fact, the \nKlobuchar amendment actually diverts some of the funds from the core \npurpose of the Debbie Smith Act for the purpose of testing this \ncritical evidence. It takes out a provision for administrative \nsubpoenas to track unregistered sex offenders. It cuts some of the \nsentencing provisions in my amendment for people guilty of interstate \nchild sex trafficking--children under 12 years of age--and it \neliminates the sense-of-the-\n\n[[Page S2790]]\n\nSenate provision that I worked on with Senator Mark Kirk of Illinois \ncondemning a Web site known as backpage.com, which has been identified \nin the New York Times and other places as a source of advertising for \nunderage prostitution--something certainly worthy of our condemnation \nas a Senate.\n  So I will come back to talk about other aspects of this, but I hope \nmy colleagues will look at the letter from RAINN, the largest \nantisexual violence organization in the United States, which says they \nbelieve the Klobuchar amendment is largely symbolic and does not do as \nmuch as the Cornyn amendment would to get at these perpetrators and to \nidentify them for what they are.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                              Rape, Abuse & Incest\n\n\n                                             National Network,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 26, 2012.\n     Hon. John Cornyn,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Sen. Cornyn: I am writing to express RAINN's concern \n     with the draft VAWA amendment by Sen. Klobuchar. Unlike the \n     Cornyn amendment, we do not believe that this draft amendment \n     will make effective or positive improvements to the Debbie \n     Smith Act.\n       The Klobuchar amendment adds an additional purpose area to \n     the Debbie Smith Act promoting inter-agency communication, \n     potentially at the expense of reducing the backlog. Funds \n     used for this section have the potential to be used for \n     radios and other communication tools. While we can't speak to \n     the need for such spending, we do know that this would not \n     have a direct impact on the backlog and would not aid in \n     solving cases. Unlike the Cornyn amendment, which nearly \n     doubles the percentage of Debbie Smith funds that are spent \n     on casework, this provision would divert money from labs and \n     go against the congressional intent of the original bill.\n       In addition, this draft would allow the Justice Department \n     to fund backlog audits, but would not designate funds \n     specifically for that purpose. It would not establish a \n     registry to allow the collection of data; would not establish \n     any process for transparency; and would not provide the kind \n     of comprehensive information that is needed to efficiently \n     target Debbie Smith funds to the areas of greatest need. \n     Finally, it strips out a number of provisions that were \n     included at the request of law enforcement agencies, in order \n     to ensure that their compliance would not be burdensome. The \n     SAFER Act section of the Cornyn amendment has none of these \n     defects, and has safeguards to ensure that funds spent on an \n     audit and registry will not take away from funds spent on \n     testing DNA evidence. Overall, we believe this amendment is \n     largely symbolic and will not have the impact in reducing the \n     backlog that we find in the Cornyn amendment.\n       RAINN is the nation's largest anti-sexual violence \n     organization. RAINN created and operates the National Sexual \n     Assault Hotlines (800.656.HOPE and rainn.org), which have \n     helped more than 1.7 million people since 1994. RAINN also \n     carries out programs to prevent sexual assault, help victims, \n     and ensure that rapists are brought to justice. For more \n     information about RAINN, please visit www.rainn.org.\n       I appreciate your work on this issue, and encourage you to \n     continue to push for adoption of the Cornyn amendment, which \n     will make real, positive changes in the lives of victims.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Scott Berkowitz,\n                                            President and Founder.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. With that, Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my \ntime and yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, what is the time allotment at present?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has 12\\1/2\\ minutes total.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 12 minutes.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be here to join those of \nmy colleagues who are urging that we come together this afternoon, and \nI am pleased we are going to see votes on the Violence Against Women \nAct to reauthorize the legislation as it has passed through the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  As we all know, domestic violence continues to be a serious problem \nacross our country. In New Hampshire, nearly one in four women has been \nsexually assaulted. At least one-third of New Hampshire women have been \nvictims of a physical assault by an intimate partner. More than one-\nhalf of all women in my State have experienced sexual or physical \nassault over the course of their lifetimes.\n  All of us share in an obligation to stop this epidemic, and VAWA is a \nproven tool in this fight. The real importance of this legislation lies \nnot in the statistics but in hearing about those women who have been \nhelped by the services that are provided by the Violence Against Women \nAct.\n  I have had a chance to visit several crisis centers around New \nHampshire in the past few weeks, and I have met with the survivors and \nthe advocates who depend on this funding. I went to a crisis center \ncalled Bridges in Nashua where I spoke with a survivor of domestic \nviolence. She told me: When you are a victim of domestic violence, you \nthink you are worthless. She said: There are so many times that I would \nhave gone back to my abuser, except that I had the ability to call \nBridges crisis line at 2 o'clock in the morning and talk to somebody \nwho could help me so that I knew I was supported.\n  Because of the Violence Against Women Act, the Bridges program can \noperate and have a crisis line for 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. \nBecause of the support she got through the Bridges program, this \nsurvivor is going back to college, she is free from abuse, and she is \ngoing to have a life that is saved because of programs that are \nsupported by the Violence Against Women Act.\n  The law enforcement community has been very supportive of this \nlegislation. They need this bill too. In New Hampshire, half of all \nmurders are domestic violence related. I spoke to the chief of police \nin Nashua, our State's second largest city. He gets just $68,000 from \nthe Violence Against Women Act funding, but that allows him to have a \ndedicated unit within the police department that can respond to \ndomestic violence and sexual assault cases.\n  I heard from retired Henniker police chief Timothy Russell. He is a \n37-year veteran in law enforcement, and he now travels around the State \nteaching police officers how to respond to domestic violence cases. It \nis funds from the Violence Against Women Act that allow him to conduct \nthe specialized training so police officers can identify patterns of \ndomestic abuse and prevent those situations from escalating. Officers \nare taught to maintain good relationships with crisis centers, and \nChief Russell tells them: If you see a victim in trouble, get a \ncounselor on the phone to talk to them. Tell them what their options \nare. Again, thanks to funding from the Violence Against Women Act, he \nhas resources to bring this training throughout New Hampshire to police \nofficers so they can help the victims.\n  I saw just this kind of cooperation and action when I visited the \nFamily Justice Center in Rochester, NH, this week. They have made a \nmultitude of services accessible in one place so victims do not have to \ngo all over town or all over the county to get the help they need. They \ncan see a counselor, get childcare assistance, and fill out an \napplication for a protective order; women can even get their injuries \ntreated and officially documented. They can get free legal help--all in \nthis Family Justice Center, made possible by a Violence Against Women \nAct grant.\n  If we do not support this because it is the right thing to do--and I \nthink it is--we should also support this legislation because it saves \nmoney. It is a cost-effective approach because, in addition to reducing \ncrime, victims are less reliant on emergency rooms. They are less \nlikely to need State assistance when they can connect with resources. \nThey can get help with childcare and housing and get back on their feet \nand become productive citizens. This is the type of help every citizen \ndeserves and ultimately makes us all safer.\n  I am also pleased to see there is particular language in this \nlegislation that requires service providers to help any victim of \ndomestic violence regardless of their race, religion, sexual \norientation, or immigration status.\n  I think Sergeant Jill Rockey, whom I met when I was in Rochester at \nthe Family Justice Center, put it best when she said:\n\n       When someone calls for help in a domestic or sexual \n     violence case, we don't ask if they are an immigrant or gay. \n     We just go.\n\n  Well, hopefully, today we will respond in passing this bill with that \nsame sense of urgency. Let's make sure we do not let victims, first \nresponders, or our communities down. Let's give everyone the help they \nneed and deserve. Let's pass this legislation today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, one of the hallmarks of the Violence \nAgainst\n\n[[Page S2791]]\n\nWomen Act is the success it has had reducing violence against women \nacross the country. Because we have made much progress over the past 18 \nyears on domestic violence but have had less success with combating \nsexual assault, our bipartisan Leahy-Crapo bill takes important steps \nto increase the focus on sexual violence. As we were writing this \nbipartisan legislation, we consulted with the men and women who work \nwith victims every day to develop a consensus bill that will help \nemphasize the need to further reduce the incidence of sexual assault. \nThe administration and law enforcement groups like the National \nAssociation of Attorneys General, the National District Attorneys \nAssociation, the National Sheriffs' Association, and the International \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police understand and support our goals.\n  Unfortunately, while I do not doubt that Senator Cornyn shares our \ngoals, the amendment he is offering can have the perverse affect of \nhindering progress on these issues. That is why there will be an \namendment offering a better approach and a better way forward together. \nThe alternative to the Cornyn amendment will allow us to make progress \non to reduce the backlog in the testing of rape kits and other DNA \nsamples, as I have always supported in the Debbie Smith Act. \nAccordingly, I will urge all Senators to reject the Cornyn amendment \nand support the alternative, which will complement the work we are \ndoing by reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act.\n  I point out that the provisions in the Cornyn amendment are \nduplicative of provisions in the Republican proposal offered by \nSenators Hutchison and Grassley. The Senate is already voting on those \nprovisions.\n  Further, Senator Cornyn, who is a member of the Judiciary Committee, \ndid not offer his current amendment when the VAWA reauthorization was \nconsidered earlier this year. I offered an amendment on his behalf that \nthe committee adopted on another issue.\n  Moreover, the separate issue of the Debbie Smith Act is part of a \nlarger effort on which the Judiciary Committee is considering as we \nmove to reauthorize the Justice for All Act that we passed with \nbipartisan support several years ago. Although we have made reduction \nof rape kit backlogs an additional use for which VAWA STOP grants \nfunding may be used by State and local jurisdictions, this matter is on \na separate legislative track.\n  I am not insisting or formality in this regard and have worked with \nother Senators on the alternative amendment that should be helpful to \nour goal of reducing the rape kit testing backlog. To make sure our \nwork is successful, we will also need to pay careful attention to the \nstandards for testing and the controversies surrounding those matters, \nhowever. Moreover, there is a risk of making money available that \nswamps the capacities for accurate testing. This is not as simply as \nthrowing money at the problem. I have worked and remain hard at work on \nforensic reforms to ensure that our criminal justice system takes \nadvantage of scientific advancements while remaining fair.\n  A concern with the Cornyn amendment is its mandating the diversion of \n7 percent of Debbie Smith Act funding to create an unwieldy national \ndatabase of rape kits. The amendment would also compel jurisdictions to \nundergo a burdensome process of entering information into that database \nwithout procedural safeguards to ensure its accuracy. These \nrequirements would force state and local law enforcement to invest time \nand resources to comply with onerous and illogical reporting \nrequirements and divert their focus from their core law enforcement \nmission of actually responding to calls and investigating sexual \nassault cases. It is no wonder that the National Association of Police \nOrganizations opposes the Cornyn amendment.\n  The amendment also contains a number of criminal sentencing mandates \nthat have no place in our VAWA bill. Victims' advocates like the \nNational Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence Against Women \nsay its provisions ``would have a chilling effect on victim reporting \nand would not help hold perpetrators accountable.'' Victim advocates \ntell us that, particularly in cases where the perpetrator is known to \nthe victim, these kinds of mandated sentences can deter victims from \nreporting the crimes and actually contribute to continuing abuse. \nMandatory minimum sentences such as these also worsen prison \novercrowding and budget crises at the Federal, State, and local level, \nand undermine our effective Federal sentencing system. The National \nNetwork to End Domestic Violence, the National Association to End \nSexual Violence, the National Council Against Domestic Violence, and \nthe National Congress of American Indians Task Force oppose these \nsentencing provisions.\n  There could be an extended Senate debate about whether mandatory \nminimums are good policy and the unintended consequence they may have \nof worsening abuse in domestic violence situations. That would be a \nlong debate with strongly held views. That is not what the Violence \nAgainst Women Act is about. We should not complicate passage of this \nbipartisan measure with such matters beyond the scope and purpose of \nthe bill. Such debates are for another time and other bills.\n  Our VAWA reauthorization bill should not be seen as a catch-all for \nall criminal proposals or sentencing mandates. There are other bills \nand other packages of bills that we are working on and hope to pass \nthis year. Some may come up in the Justice for All Act is we are able \nto get Senate floor time for that measure. Some have come up on \nseparate bills that are awaiting Republican clearance for Senate \npassage. Among those are a package of bills including the Strengthening \nInvestigations of Sex Offenders and Missing Children Act, the \nInvestigative Assistance for Violent Crimes Act, the Dale Long Public \nSafety Officers' Benefits Improvements Act, along with Finding \nFugitives Sex Offenders Act from which the Cornyn Amendment takes its \nadministrative subpoena provisions.\n  Let me turn to the Debbie Smith Act and a woman I admire very much. \nDebbie Smith is a survivor of a terrible crime who had to wait in \nterror for far too long before evidence was tested and the perpetrator \nwas caught. She has worked tirelessly to make sure that other victims \nof sexual assault do not have to endure similar ordeals. I have been a \nproud supporter of the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program since its \ncreation, and I have worked with Senators of both parties, including \nSenators Mikulski and Hutchison on the Appropriations Committee, to see \nthat it receives as much funding as possible each year. As I noted, \nalthough its authorization does not expire until 2014, I included an \nextension of its reauthorization in the Justice For All Reauthorization \nAct I introduced earlier this year. The Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant \nProgram has been very successful in reducing evidence backlogs in crime \nlabs, particularly in sexual assault cases. That is why I am glad that \nthe alternative amendment will allow us to ensure that the program is \nauthorized through 2017 at a level of $151 million a year.\n  Unfortunately, disturbing reports have emerged of continuing \nbacklogs, with some cities finding thousands of untested rape kits on \npolice department shelves. That means that there is more need than ever \nfor the Debbie Smith Act but also that there must be increased emphasis \non reducing law enforcement backlogs, where there has been less \nprogress. That is why it is so important that alternative to the Cornyn \namendment expands the Debbie Smith Act to allow law enforcement to \nobtain funding for the collection and processing of DNA evidence. Law \nenforcement burden is one of the key bottlenecks in the process at \npresent. In contrast to the Cornyn amendment, the alternative calls for \nnew national best practices and protocols for law enforcement handling \nof rape kits and for Justice Department assistance to law enforcement \nin addressing this continuing problem. This will help to make real \nprogress in overcoming the last major hurdles in reducing backlogs of \nrape kits.\n  The amendment takes steps to ensure that more of the Debbie Smith Act \nfunds are used directly for DNA evidence testing to reduce backlogs. \nThat will make this key program even quicker and more effective in \nreducing backlogs. The Debbie Smith program is an important tool in the \nfight against sexual assault, and I hope all Senators will join us in \nreauthorizing and\n\n[[Page S2792]]\n\nstrengthening it by rejecting the Cornyn amendment in favor of the \nalternative.\n  As I have said during this debate, we must do more to reduce sexual \nassault, and the bipartisan Leahy-Crapo bill focuses on that goal. I \nbelieve that Senator Cornyn's amendment will distract from the progress \nthat is most helpful to victims, despite his good intentions. I urge \nSenators to vote against the Cornyn amendment and support the \nalternative to expedite improvements to the Debbie Smith Act to reduce \nthe backlog of untested rape kits and other DNA evidence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2095\n\n       (Purpose: In the nature of a substitute)\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I rise to speak on behalf of my \nsubstitute amendment along with Senator Grassley and other cosponsors, \nand I call up the amendment, No. 2095.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison], for herself, Mr. \n     Grassley, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Alexander, \n     Mr. Moran, and Mr. Corker, proposes an amendment numbered \n     2095.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, the substitute amendment is a bill \nthat takes the good parts and the important parts of the \nreauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act that I think are \nuniversal--the parts that have passed unanimously through Congress in \nrecent years, starting 16 years ago--but the substitute also \nstrengthens the bill. I am glad we are going to get a chance to vote on \nsomething that will strengthen it because there are some areas where \nthe underlying bill is not as strong as our substitute bill, amendment \nNo. 2095, would be, especially in the area of abuse of children and \nchild pornography and child sex trafficking. This is our most \nvulnerable victim: the child who is abused.\n  I want to read from some of the national organizations for victims as \nthey write about this important aspect which is included in our bill \nbut not covered as well in the underlying bill.\n  The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, with whom I \nhave worked to try to get the AMBER Alert system to be relevant across \nState lines--where we have actually saved, we believe, 550 children who \nhave been abducted and taken across State lines--because of the quick \naction of the AMBER Alert system, they have been able to be safely \nbrought back home. The National Center for Missing and Exploited \nChildren says:\n\n       . . . possession of child pornography is a serious crime \n     that deserves a serious sentence. Therefore, we support a \n     reasonable mandatory minimum sentence for this offense.\n       As we have . . . testified, child protection measures must \n     also include the ability to locate non-compliant registered \n     sex offenders. . . . The U.S. Marshals Service is the lead \n     federal law enforcement agency for tracking these fugitives. \n     Their efforts would be greatly enhanced if they had the \n     authority to serve administrative subpoenas. . . .\n\n  Now, that is key because it is covered in our substitute. It is \ncovered in Senator Cornyn's amendment. It is not covered in either the \nunderlying Leahy bill nor in Senator Klobuchar's side-by-side. So this \nis a major area of strengthening that this very important victims' \nrights organization is supporting.\n  Shared Hope International is another children's advocate organization \nthat says:\n\n       Child pornography is one form of child sex trafficking and \n     is too often intertwined with the other forms of sexual \n     exploitation, which include prostitution and sexual \n     performance. Stiffer penalties will bring greater deterrence \n     and justice for the victims.\n\n  Then, RAINN, which is the largest victims' rights organization for \nsexual assault, says:\n\n       Thank you . . . for including the SAFER Act--\n\n  Which is Senator Cornyn's amendment.\n\n       . . . . We are grateful for your leadership in the battle \n     to prevent sexual violence and prosecute its perpetrators.\n\n  Then, PROTECT also says:\n\n       . . . the apologists for child pornography traffickers deny \n     the pain and harm done by possessors of these images.\n\n  They go on further to say:\n\n       . . . ``simple processors''--\n\n  Which would mean people who have this and have it on their computers \nand sell it--\n\n       fuel the market for more and more crime scene recordings of \n     children being raped, tortured and degraded.\n\n  Now, these are people who are for the Cornyn amendment, and they are \nfor the protection we have in the substitute.\n  It is so important we strengthen this area to try to protect our most \nvulnerable victims. That is one area where strengthening can make such \na difference. The Marshals Service being able to have administrative \nsubpoenas will allow them to track even known sexual predators who have \nfled and you have a hard time finding them.\n  I gave an illustration this morning of two children who were abducted \nby a known sexual predator, but they did not have the administrative \nability to find that sexual predator, and he ended up killing one of \nthe children, the children's mother, the mother's boyfriend, and \nanother relative.\n  In the underlying bill, the mandatory sentences are days. We have a \nminimum mandatory 1-year sentence for a crime of having pornography \nthat shows 8- to 10-year-old girls being raped. Now, I would think a 1-\nyear minimum sentence for that kind of promotion of this degradation of \nchildren would be something all of us could support.\n  I heard people on the floor say our substitute does not fully cover \nsome areas, such as Indian women. Well, our bill assures that Indian \nwomen are going to have the protections in a constitutional way so the \nbill is not thrown out. Indian women on reservations are particularly \nvulnerable, and my colleague, Senator Murkowski, has told me that in \nAlaska they do not have reservations to a great extent, but they do \nhave a record of abuse of Indian women, and we need to protect them.\n  We do it in a constitutional way in our substitute, and I think that \nprotection is very important. It has been determined by several \norganizations--criminal justice organizations--that the underlying bill \nis not constitutional and would not work for Indian women.\n  It has been asserted on the Senate floor that we do not protect \nvictims of same-sex sexual violence, but we do. We neutralize in our \nbill any reference or discrimination. In fact, I will read the language \nof our bill:\n\n       No person in the United States shall on the basis of actual \n     or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, sex, or \n     disability be excluded from participation in, be denied the \n     benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any \n     program or activity funded in whole or in part with funds \n     made available under [this act].\n\n  We cover every person who is a victim under this bill. I have been \nmade aware through very sad stories of the need to protect men as well, \nas victims of same-sex domestic violence. Men who have been gang raped \nare less likely to report it because of a shame they feel, and it is a \ndifferent aspect than we have dealt with in previous Violence Against \nWomen Act bills. But it is real and we do need to cover that. We do in \nthe substitute bill, absolutely fully. We cover victims of domestic \nviolence in our bill, and that is what is important to all of us.\n  Immigrant women who are illegal have the same protections they have \nhad in every Violence Against Women Act that has been passed over the \nlast 16 years. So we do not change that. We do not change the \nauthorization levels.\n  So all of these--along with our strengthening of the bill with the \nMarshals Service's ability to get administrative subpoenas, as well as \nthe minimum sentences that are so very important--make our bill the \nright alternative.\n  I have said before that I feel so strongly about this issue that I \nintend to vote for, of course, my amendment, which I think is \nstrengthening; most certainly for Senator Cornyn's amendment, which is \na strengthening amendment to the underlying bill--it is included in our \nsubstitute as well; Senator Cornyn is another cosponsor, as is\n\n[[Page S2793]]\n\nSenator McConnell, of the substitute--but I intend to vote for the \nunderlying bill even with its flaws because I wish to make sure there \nis no cutting off of the aspect of this most important legislation \nbecause of the time limit of our action.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has 3 minutes remaining reserved \nfor the junior Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. If the Senator wishes to speak further, I am happy to \nyield.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I will be glad to yield to Senator Hutchison 2 of these 3 \nminutes remaining.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator. I would just say I have had a \nlong record in this area. When I was a member of the State legislature, \nTexas passed the most far-reaching protection for victims of rape in \nthe whole country. I was the lead sponsor of that bill. When we passed \nit in 1975, it then became the model other States used to strengthen \nthe laws to help these victims.\n  One day, just in this last year, I was at a grocery store in Dallas, \nTX. A woman came up to my truck I was driving, knocked on the window. I \nhad no idea what she was going to say, but I rolled down the window. \nShe said: Senator Hutchison, thank you for the bill you passed in Texas \nin 1975--because I was a victim of rape, and I would not have gone \nforward without your protections. But I did and that man was sent to \nprison.\n  That is what we are here for, and that is why I have this strong \nsubstitute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I have letters in support of the \nlegislation we have talked about, the SAFER amendment, the alternative \nto the Klobuchar amendment, from the National Center for Missing and \nExploited Children, from Arrow Child and Family Ministries, from the \nRape, Abuse and Incest National Network, and from PROTECT. I ask \nunanimous consent that all those letters be printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CORNYN. I wish to talk about one aspect of Senator Hutchison's \nlegislation that is also included in my stand-alone amendment. This is \nthe administrative subpoena authority. Because this has been taken out \nof the Klobuchar alternative, it is not in underlying Leahy bill.\n  What happens is sex offenders are required to register. If they do \nnot register, they are much more likely to commit future acts of sexual \nassault and abuse, particularly against children. As a matter of fact, \none of the biggest indicators that someone is likely to reoffend is \nwhen they do not register. So what the Hutchison bill does, what my \nbill does, is give U.S. marshals the administrative subpoenas to \ncollect records and information to help identify these unregistered sex \noffenders and to protect future victims from their sexual assault.\n  Because if they are registered, if they are identified, they are much \nless likely to reoffend and commit further acts of sexual abuse. We all \nwant to see this legislation pass. But I would just reiterate for my \ncolleagues' benefit, the letter we received from the Rape, Abuse and \nIncest National Network that said the alternative to my amendment that \nwill be offered--that the alternative is largely symbolic and will not \nhave the impact of reducing the impact we find in the Cornyn amendment.\n  I would ask my colleagues to support the amendment and to support \ncertainly Senator Hutchison's amendment. I commend her for her great \nwork on this subject.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n         National Center for Missing\n\n\n                                         & Exploited Children,\n\n                                   Alexandria, VA, April 26, 2012.\n     Hon. Kay Bailey Hutchison,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hutchison: As you know, the National Center \n     for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) addressed the issue \n     of sentencing for federal child pornography crimes in our \n     testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in March \n     2011. The 1.4 million reports to NCMEC's CyberTipline, the \n     Congressionally-authorized reporting mechanism for online \n     crimes against children, indicate the scope of the problem. \n     These child sex abuse images are crime scene photos that \n     memorialize the sexual abuse of a child. Those who possess \n     them create a demand for new images, which drives their \n     production and, hence, the sexual abuse of more child victims \n     to create the images.\n       Despite the heinous nature of this crime, the federal \n     statute criminalizing the possession of child pornography has \n     no mandatory minimum sentence. This, combined with the \n     advisory nature of the federal sentencing guidelines, allows \n     judges to impose light sentences for possession. Congress \n     passed mandatory minimum sentences for the crimes of receipt, \n     distribution, and production of child pornography. We don't \n     believe that Congress intended to imply that possession of \n     child pornography is less serious than these other offenses. \n     NCMEC feels strongly that possession of child pornography is \n     a serious crime that deserves a serious sentence. Therefore, \n     we support a reasonable mandatory minimum sentence for this \n     offense.\n       As we have previously testified, child protection measures \n     must also include the ability to locate non-compliant \n     registered sex offenders--offenders who have been convicted \n     of crimes against children yet fail to comply with their \n     registration duties. The U.S. Marshals Service is the lead \n     federal law enforcement agency for tracking these fugitives. \n     Their efforts would be greatly enhanced if the had the \n     authority to serve administrative subpoenas in order to \n     obtain Internet subscriber information to help determine the \n     fugitives' physical location and apprehend them.\n       Thank you for your efforts to protect our nation's \n     children.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Ernie Allen,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              Arrow Child & Family Ministries,\n\n                                                   April 25, 2012.\n       Dear Senator Cornyn: Arrow Child & Family Ministries \n     supports the proposed ``Justice for Victims Amendment'' to S. \n     1925. VAWA Reauthorization is of critical importance to \n     victims of sexual assault, stalking, domestic and dating \n     violence and your proposed amendment will provide additional \n     protections and accountability to victims.\n       As a provider of foster care services in Texas, California, \n     Pennsylvania and Maryland, Arrow sees first-hand the impact \n     domestic and sexual violence has on families and society's \n     youngest victims--children. Arrow is also engaged in helping \n     victims of child sex trafficking with the opening of Freedom \n     Place, a long-term comprehensive care facility located in \n     Texas for underage American girls who have been bought and \n     sold as sex slaves. The average age of these girls is 12 to \n     13 years old. Once they become victims, their life expectancy \n     is only seven years. This is not just an international \n     problem. Thousands of girls and boys from towns and cities \n     across America are victims. In fact, according to the \n     National Incidence Studies of Missing, Abducted, Runaway and \n     Throwaway Children, an estimated 1 out of every 3 children \n     who run away is lured into sex trafficking within 48 hours of \n     leaving home.\n       Our children are in crisis and we thank Senator Cornyn for \n     his willingness to toughen sentencing for some of the worst \n     sex offenders, and call on Backpage.com to remove part of its \n     website that has been linked to child sex trafficking.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                     Mark Tennant,\n     Founder and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              Rape, Abuse & Incest\n\n\n                                             National Network,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 23, 2012.\n     Hon. John Cornyn,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Sen. Cornyn: I am writing to express RAINN's strong \n     support for the Justice for Victims Amendment, which will \n     strengthen the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act and \n     have a tremendously positive impact on how our nation's \n     criminal justice system responds to--and prevents--sexual \n     violence.\n       One out of every six women and one in 33 men are victims of \n     sexual assault--20 million Americans in all, according to the \n     Department of Justice. Rapists tend to be serial criminals, \n     often committing many crimes before they are finally caught; \n     and only about 3% of rapists will ever spend a single day in \n     prison.\n       First, this amendment will help eliminate the DNA evidence \n     backlog by ensuring that 75% of DNA spending goes directly to \n     solve cases, a big improvement over current practice. It will \n     also establish the Sexual Assault Forensic Evidence Registry, \n     which will bring transparency, efficiency and accountability \n     to the DNA backlog problem and allow policymakers to closely \n     track local backlogs and prioritize testing. The amendment \n     will also ensure that criminals convicted of severe crimes of \n     violence against women receive a just punishment, and ensure \n     that fugitive sex offenders are swiftly identified and \n     located. If enacted, these provisions will lead to more \n     successful prosecutions, more violent criminals behind bars, \n     and safer communities.\n       RAINN is the nation's largest anti-sexual violence \n     organization. RAINN created and operates the National Sexual \n     Assault Hotlines (800.656.HOPE and rainn.org), which have \n     helped more than 1.6 million people since 1994. RAINN also \n     carries out programs\n\n[[Page S2794]]\n\n     to prevent sexual assault, help victims, and ensure that \n     rapists are brought to justice. For more information about \n     RAINN, please visit www.rainn.org.\n       Thank you for introducing the Justice for Victims \n     Amendment. We believe this amendment will greatly enhance \n     VAWA and result in a stronger, more effective bill. We are \n     grateful for your unflagging leadership in the battle to \n     prevent sexual violence and prosecute its perpetrators, and \n     we look forward to working with you to encourage passage of \n     this important amendment and to reauthorize VAWA.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Scott Berkowitz,\n     President and Founder.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                          Protect,\n                                    Knoxville, TN, April 16, 2012.\n     Hon. John Cornyn,\n     517 Hart Senate Office Bldg.,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cornyn: I am writing to express PROTECT's \n     strong support for the Justice for Victims Amendment.\n       This amendment to the Violence Against Women Act will \n     create needed penalty enhancements for several crimes, \n     including child trafficking and domestic violence. It would \n     also begin to address the nation's outrageous and \n     unacceptable backlog of rape kits, by reforming how the \n     Justice Department allocates existing resources.\n       PROTECT has members in all 50 states and around the world. \n     As you know, we have focused on addressing the magnitude of \n     online child exploitation. The PROTECT our Children Act of \n     2008, which we initiated (and which had 61 Senate sponsors) \n     exposed the magnitude of this problem both domestically and \n     abroad and mandated increased transparency and accountability \n     by the U.S. Department of Justice and the agencies it funds.\n       We also want to thank you for including an important \n     provision granting the US Marshals Service administrative \n     subpoena power to track unregistered sex offenders. Since \n     1993, the national trend to use public registration in lieu \n     of meaningful containment and supervision has threatened \n     community safety. Aggressively pursuing those who fail to \n     comply is thus an especially valuable public safety strategy. \n     PROTECT is intimately familiar with the work of the Service \n     and can attest to the hard work and success that office has \n     tracking and apprehending child predators.\n       We thank you for continued leadership in the battle to \n     protect American Children. The Justice for Victims Amendment \n     is a much-needed advance in this battle. We look forward to \n     working with you to secure passage of this amendment to \n     champion the re-authorization of VAWA.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Grier Weeks,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, how much time is remaining on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 6 minutes 20 seconds for the \nmajority.\n  Mr. LEAHY. How much on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Zero.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Leahy-Crapo Violence Against Women \nReauthorization Act is based on months of work with survivors, \nadvocates, and law enforcement officers from all across the country.\n  We listened when they told us what was working and what could be \nimproved. We took their input seriously, and we carefully drafted our \nlegislation to respond to those needs.\n  Our bill is supported by more than 1,000 Federal, State, and local \norganizations. They include service providers, law enforcement, \nreligious organizations, and many, many more.\n  There is one purpose and one purpose only for the bill that Senator \nCrapo and I introduced, and that is to help and protect victims of \ndomestic and sexual violence. Our legislation represents the voices of \nmillions of survivors and their advocates all over the country.\n  The same cannot be said for the Republican proposal brought forward \nin these last couple of days. That is why the Republican proposal is \nopposed by so many and such a wide spectrum of people and \norganizations.\n  The National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence Against \nWomen, which represents dozens of organizations from across the country \nsays: ``The Grassley-Hutchison substitute was drafted without input or \nconsultation from the thousands of professionals engaged in this work \nevery day.\n  The substitute includes damaging and unworkable provisions that will \nharm victims, increase costs, and create unnecessary inefficiencies.'' \nAlthough well-intentioned, the Republican proposal is no substitute for \nthe months of work we have done in a bipartisan way with victims and \nadvocates from all over the country.\n  I regret to say that the Republican proposal undermines core \nprinciples of the Violence Against Women Act. It would result in \nabandoning some of the most vulnerable victims and strips out key \nprovisions that are critically necessary to protect all victims--\nincluding battered immigrants, Native women, and victims in same sex \nrelationships.\n  The improvements in the bipartisan Leahy-Crapo Violence Against Women \nReauthorization Act are gone from the Republican proposal. It is no \nsubstitute and does nothing to meet the unmet needs of victims.\n  The Republican proposal fundamentally undermines VAWA's historic \nfocus on protecting women. It literally calls for removing the word \n``women'' from the largest VAWA grant program. Women are still \nvictimized at far higher rates, and with a far greater impact on their \nlives, than men. Shifting VAWA's focus away from women is unnecessary \nand harmful.\n  The Republican proposal would send a terrible message. There is no \nreason to turn the Violence Against Women Act inside out and eliminate \nthe focus on the victims the bill has always been intended to protect.\n  Our Leahy-Crapo bipartisan bill, by contrast, does not eliminate the \nfocus on violence against women, but increases our focus to include all \nvictims of domestic violence and sexual assault.\n  The Republican proposal strips out critical protections for gay and \nlesbian victims. The rate of violence in same sex relationships is the \nsame as the general population, and we know that victims in that \ncommunity are having difficulty accessing services.\n  To strip out these critical provisions is to turn our backs on \nvictims of violence. That is not the spirit of VAWA. We understand that \na victim is a victim is a victim, and none of them should be excluded \nor discriminated against.\n  The Republican proposal would extend and institutionalize that \ndiscrimination. The Republican proposal should be rejected.\n  The Republican proposal also fails to adequately protect Tribal \nvictims. Domestic violence in tribal communities is an epidemic. Four \nout of five perpetrators of domestic or sexual violence on Tribal lands \nare non-Indian and currently cannot be prosecuted by tribal \ngovernments.\n  If you need more convincing of this problem, listen to the senior \nSenator from Washington and the Senators from New Mexico, Montana, \nAlaska and Hawaii who have spoken so compellingly to the Senate about \nthese concerns and who strongly support the provisions in the \nbipartisan Leahy-Crapo bill.\n  The Republican proposal is no real alternative to fix the \njurisdictional loophole that is allowing the domestic and sexual \nviolence against Native women to go undeterred and unremedied. Its \nproposal offers a false hope, a provision that purports to allow a \ntribe to petition a Federal court for a protective order to exclude \nindividuals from tribal land. It does not even allow the victim herself \nto request the order, and it does nothing to ensure that a violent \noffender is held accountable.\n  This is a false alternative. It is not what the Justice Department \nhas suggested. It is not what the Indian Affairs Committee has \nsupported. It will do next to nothing and is no answer to the epidemic \nof violence against Native women.\n  The Republican proposal also abandons immigrant victims and \ndisregards law enforcement requests for additional U visas, a law \nenforcement tool that encourages immigrants to report and help \nprosecute crime. To the contrary, the Republican proposal would add \ndangerous restrictions on current U visa requirements that could result \nin that tool being less effective.\n  The U visa process already has fraud protections. For law enforcement \nto employ U visas, law enforcement officers must personally certify \nthat the victim is cooperating with a criminal investigation. The new \nrestrictions the Republican proposal seeks to add will discourage \nvictims from coming forward and will hinder law enforcement's ability \nto take violent criminals off the street.\n  I will be offering an amendment to offset the minimal additional \ncosts associated with our increasing the number of U visas that can be \nused. With\n\n[[Page S2795]]\n\nthat amendment the bipartisan Leahy-Crapo bill will not ``score'' and \nwill be deficit neutral.\n  The Republican proposal also would add burdensome, unnecessary and \ncounterproductive requirements that would compromise the ability of \nservice providers to maximize their ability to reach victims. In \ncontrast, the bipartisan Leahy-Crapo accountability provisions ensure \nthe appropriate use of taxpayer dollars without unnecessary regulatory \nburdens.\n  It is all the more ironic that the Republican proposal would add \nmassive, new bureaucratic requirements to service providers who are \nunderstaffed and operating on shoestring budgets like most small \nbusinesses and nonprofits. These requirements are unnecessary and would \nadd significant costs to victim service providers, undercutting their \nability to help victims.\n  It is easy to call for audits, but without proper resources and \nfocus, such demands could be counterproductive and lead to decreased \naccountability. The bipartisan Leahy-Crapo bill, by contrast, includes \ntargeted accountability provisions.\n  While I have been willing to accommodate improvements to this \nlegislation from day one, I have also been clear that I will not \nabandon core principles of fairness. Regrettably, that is what the \nRepublican proposal would result in doing. It would undermine the core \nprinciple of VAWA to protect victims--all victims--the best way we know \nhow. Our bill is focused on VAWA and improvements to meet the unmet \nneeds of victims.\n  It is not a catch-all for all proposals for criminal law reform, for \nsentencing modifications. There are other bills and other packages of \nbills that we are working on and hope to pass this year. We should not \ncomplicate passage of this bipartisan measure with such matters beyond \nthe scope and purpose of the bill. Such debates are for another time \nand other bills.\n  I urge all Senators to join together to protect the most vulnerable \nvictims of violence, including battered immigrant women assisting law \nenforcement, Native American women who suffer in record numbers, and \nthose who have traditionally had trouble accessing services.\n  A victim is a victim is a victim. They all deserve our attention and \nthe protection and access to services the bipartisan Leahy-Crapo bill \nprovides.\n  The path forward is to reject the Republican proposal, which is no \nalternative to the bipartisan Leahy-Crapo bill. Let us move forward \ntogether to meet the unmet needs of victims.\n  I would just say that the Leahy-Crapo bill does not eliminate the \nfocus on violence against women; it protects women, unlike the \nRepublican proposal which strips out so many aspects.\n  Our bill is inclusive. Theirs is exclusive. A victim is a victim is a \nvictim. We do not exclude anybody. As the distinguished Senator from \nNew Hampshire said earlier today: They do not ask who the victim is \nwhen there is a victim.\n  With my remaining time, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from New \nJersey and the remaining time to the Senator from Minnesota, Ms. \nKlobuchar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I wish to salute the distinguished \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee for the incredible work he has done \nto bring us to this moment.\n  I held a roundtable in New Jersey with about 35 organizations that \ndeal with the challenge of violence against women. They unequivocally \nexpressed their support for what we are doing here today and the \nimportance in the lives of women whom they deal with every day.\n  I know my friends on the other side of the aisle are trying to strip \nprovisions that protect women from discrimination and abuse in certain \ncategories. In my view, violence against any woman is still violence. \nThe Nation has been outraged about violence against women for almost \ntwo decades. We have seen the violence. We continue to fight against \nit. We have tried to end it. In my mind, there is no doubt--and I would \nfind it very hard to understand why anyone would stand in the way of \ndenouncing violence against any woman, no matter who they are, no \nmatter what their class is.\n  I am hard-pressed to understand why anyone would choose to exclude \nviolence against certain women; turn back the clock to a time when such \nviolence was not recognized, was not a national disgrace, and make a \ndistinction when and against whom such violence meets our threshold of \noutrage. In my mind, there can be no such threshold, no such \ndistinction. Violence against any woman is an outrage, plain and \nsimple.\n  The reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act does not just \naffect those who are here or might become victims of sexual violence or \ndomestic violence; it affects all of us. Nearly one in five women \nreport being the victim of a rape or an attempted rape. One in six \nreport being stalked. One in four women report having been beaten by \ntheir partner. Of those who report being raped, 80 percent report being \nraped before the age of 25.\n  The short-term physical and emotional trauma of such an event cannot \nbe overstated. That is why it is critical we pass VAWA as the committee \nhas moved forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2094 to Amendment No. 2093\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 2094.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Ms. Klobuchar] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2094 to amendment No. 2093.\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide Debbie Smith grants for auditing sexual assault \n                           evidence backlogs)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

and\n       ``(B) which may include different criteria or thresholds \n     for the different stages.''.\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I thank Senator Cornyn and Senator Hutchison for their \nwords and their work. I rise to discuss my amendment that would respond \nto the problems we are seeing with rape kit backlogs, which Senator \nCornyn has identified, while also reforming what we know is working \nwell on this issue.\n  This amendment would amend the Debbie Smith Act, which, similar to \nthe Violence Against Women Act, has a history of bipartisan support. \nThe Debbie Smith Act, as you know, was enacted in 2004. It was named \nafter a courageous survivor of sexual assault.\n  What this amendment does is to basically increase the percentage of \nDebbie Smith grant funds that are available for use in testing the \nbacklog of rape kits. We raise the current percentage of 40 percent up \nto 70 percent. So it is a significant change.\n  The amendment also asks the National Institute of Justice to develop \nprotocols to help law enforcement with sexual assault cases and to \nprovide technical assistance and training to law enforcement and local \ngovernments. The amendment also allows funds to be used for auditing \nrape kit backlogs, which is one of the important issues Senator \nCornyn's amendment addresses.\n  The difference between Senator Cornyn's amendment and my amendment is \nthat mine does not mandate that a minimum percentage of funds be used \nfor audit. Senator Cornyn's amendment also has provisions such as \nsubpoena authority for U.S. marshals who are tracking fugitive sex \noffenders that I have supported in the past and I will continue to \nsupport in the future. I will be glad to work with Senator Cornyn and \nChairman Leahy and others to get this done and to look for an \nappropriate vehicle to address this issue.\n  But today is about passing VAWA without delay. We have worked on the \nJudiciary Committee for 1 month with every group that wanted to have a \nsay in the reauthorization of VAWA, and we have worked closely with all \non the committee. As you know, Senator Crapo has been the long-time \nRepublican coauthor of this bill. We have a number of Republican \nsupporters. I wish to end with the words of Paul Wellstone, who once \nserved in the Senate on behalf of the State of the Minnesota, who was a \nfierce advocate for the Violence Against Women Act.\n  He said this:\n\n       What are we waiting for? Too many have spoken with their \n     voices and with their lives, and this violence must end.\n\n  Let's get the Violence Against Women Act done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, we are about to vote. This is a time for \nboth Republicans and Democrats to come together and say what we all \nknow in our heart: We oppose violence against women. Let's say it not \njust in our heart, let's say it in legislation--good legislation.\n  Have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, which is the first amendment to be \nconsidered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Klobuchar \namendment, No. 2094.\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Madam President, for those who supported the Klobuchar \namendment, here is your last chance to make sure more money under the \nDebbie Smith Act is appropriated and directed toward solving the \n400,000 untested rape kits backlogged in this country that is nothing \nshort of a national scandal.\n  We know the people who commit these sexual assault crimes are serial \noffenders. If we don't catch them early, more people are going to get \nhurt. The best way to catch them is to collect this DNA, match it \nagainst banked DNA, and take them off the street, and to exonerate \nthose who may be under suspicion but who are innocent.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this amendment. It has the support \nof the Rape Abuse and Incest National Network, and it has \nadministrative subpoenas to track down unregistered sex offenders who \nare more likely to commit crimes against children and other innocent \nvictims. Please vote for this amendment. It will strengthen the \nViolence Against Women Act and you can be proud of your vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, we have been able to get very good \nprogress on the rape kit backlogs in the Leahy-Crapo bill. I wish we \nhad passed the Klobuchar amendment. The Cornyn amendment is well \nintentioned, but it will undermine, rather than enhance, the progress \nwe have made.\n\n[[Page S2797]]\n\n  The Cornyn amendment will divert funding from the Debbie Smith rape \nkit backlog reduction program. Let me repeat: It will divert funding \nfrom the Debbie Smith rape kit backlog reduction program to create an \nunwieldy national database of rape kits. It could force State and local \nlaw enforcement to invest time and resources to comply with onerous and \nillogical reporting requirements instead of actually responding to \ncalls and investigating sexual assault cases.\n  Key victims' groups have opposed it, saying all the things it adds in \nhere--the things we have taken care of to help victims--would actually \nhurt them. It creates new mandatory minimum penalties that victims' \ngroups say will have the opposite effect of what we want by deterring \nabused women from reporting violence and sexual assault crimes. And I \nstrongly oppose it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. CORNYN.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate, equally divided, prior to a vote on amendment No. \n2095, offered by the Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, No. 2095 takes the part of the bill \nthat reauthorizes the Violence Against Women Act and continues those, \nbut it does important things that are not in the underlying bill:\n  No. 1, a mandatory minimum sentence of 5 years for aggravated sexual \nassault through the use of drugs or otherwise rendering the victim \nunconscious is not in the underlying bill. It is in our substitute.\n  No. 2, it grants administrative subpoena power to U.S. Marshals so \nthey can have the ability to quickly find a known sexual predator. This \nhas been cited by the National Center for Missing and Exploited \nChildren as a key part of the need to help get these offenders when \nthey are going to prey on children. It is not in the underlying bill; \nit is in ours.\n  It protects Indian women on reservations in a constitutional way. The \nunderlying bill has been questioned as to constitutionality by the \nCongressional Research Service.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. And it also does what the Cornyn and Klobuchar \namendments attempted to do and assure that we get this backlog of \npeople who have committed rape off the streets.\n  Please support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the reason why so many people across the \npolitical spectrum support the Leahy-Crapo bill and the reason they \noppose this amendment is it is going to remove the historic emphasis of \nwomen in VAWA. The improvements we have made in the bipartisan Leahy-\nCrapo bill are gone from the Republican proposal. There is only one \nreal Violence Against Women Act reauthorization, and this is not it. It \nundermines core principles. It abandons some of the most vulnerable \nvictims. It strips key provisions that are critically necessary to \nprotect all victims, including battered immigrants, Native women, and \nvictims of same-sex relationships.\n  I hope my colleagues will strongly and roundly defeat this \nalternative. It guts the Violence Against Women Act reauthorization.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON.

Mr. President, I wish to commend and thank Senator \nKlobuchar, Senator Mikulski, Senator Boxer, and Senator Cantwell for \ntheir outstanding statements earlier today in support of our bipartisan \nViolence Against Women Reauthorization Act. Their contributions to the \nbill and their leadership have been essential. They have spoken often \nand consistently about this legislative priority. They bring their \nexperiences and years of work on these matters to this effort.\n  I also wish to commend the statements made by Senators from both \nsides of the aisle yesterday as the Senate began consideration of the \nbill. I have always enjoyed working with the senior Senator from Texas \nand recall how we worked together to pass our Amber Alert legislation \nin record time. As I have said, we have included the Klobuchar-\nHutchison provision updating Federal antistalking legislation in our \nbill from the outset. I appreciate her saying that she ``is going to \nsupport'' the Leahy-Crapo bill. Likewise, I\n\n[[Page S2798]]\n\nhave supported giving the Republican proposal a Senate vote, although I \nhave explained why I will vote against it.\n  I thought the statements by the majority leader, Senator Begich, \nSenator Udall of New Mexico, Senator Tester, Senator Gillibrand, \nSenator Schumer, as well as Senator Heller were strong and compelling.\n  We now have the opportunity to consider our amendment to improve upon \nthe bill. Our amendment continues to focus on protecting victims. By \nway of our amendment, we can fix a ``scoring'' problem by adding an \noffset for the measures in the bill that the Congressional Budget \nOffice determined after its technical analysis would result in \naffecting budget. That amendment should keep the measure budget \nneutral. We also are pleased to include provisions suggested by \nSenators Murkowski and Begich to correct the manner in which Alaska is \naffected by the tribal provisions in the bill. We worked with them on \nthe initial language and are pleased to continue that bipartisan \ncooperation. These are additional steps we can take to make sure we \npass the best possible legislation we can.\n  It has been a pleasure to work with Senator Crapo over the last many \nmonths to reauthorize and improve the Violence Against Women Act. We \nhave been committed to an open, bipartisan process for this legislation \nfrom the beginning. This amendment I am offering continues that process \nand incorporates further important suggestions we have received from \nboth sides of the aisle.\n  The substitute makes modest changes to the tribal provisions to \nfurther protect the rights of defendants. These changes are in response \nto concerns raised by Senator Kyl and others, and I am happy to make \nthem. The substitute also responds to concerns raised by Senator \nMurkowski and Senator Begich about the legislation's impact on Alaska \nNative villages. Again, I am pleased to be able to address those \nconcerns. The bill is stronger for it.\n  The substitute also incorporates national security protections at the \nrequest of Senator Feinstein.\n  We also add a small fee for applications for diversity visas that \nwill more than cover the modest costs of protecting additional battered \nimmigrants who assist law enforcement. This addition renders the bill \ndeficit neutral and alleviates budget concerns. It, too, makes the \nlegislation stronger.\n  The amendment strengthens the campus provision of the legislation \nwhile responding to concerns that the bill might have inadvertently \naffected burdens of proof in campus proceedings. I thank Senator Casey \nfor working with us on this aspect of the amendment.\n  These are very modest changes, but every one reflects our continued \ncommitment to listening to those who work with victims of domestic and \nsexual violence every day and to working with Senators of both parties \nto make the legislation stronger. The legislation came to the floor \nwith 61 Senators, including 8 Republicans, as cosponsors. These \nadjustments should make it even more of a consensus bill.\n  I have been heartened by the constructive tone of debate on the floor \nof the Senate and the near universal support for reauthorizing VAWA. \nLet's continue this consensus, bipartisan process by passing this \namendment and then adopting the bill with these improvements. Let's \npass this reauthorization. As Congress faces unrelenting criticism for \ngridlock and dysfunction, our reauthorizing VAWA in a bipartisan way \nthat helps all victims of domestic and sexual violence is an example of \nthe Senate at its best. I hope all Senators will join us in this \neffort.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, amendment No. 2093, \nthe Leahy substitute amendment, is agreed to.\n  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to the vote on S. 1925.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. As we proceed to vote to reauthorize the Violence Against \nWomen Act, I look forward to a strong bipartisan vote. I thank the \nmajority leader and the Republican leader for their work to bring us to \nthis point. I commend the Senators from both sides of the aisle who \nhave worked so hard to bring us to this. In particular I thank my \npartner in this effort, Senator Crapo, and our bipartisan cosponsors. I \nalso commend Senator Murray and Senator Murkowski who have been so \ninstrumental in helping both sides arrive at a fair process for \nconsidering amendments and proceeding without unnecessary delays.\n  The Violence Against Women Act continues to send a powerful message \nthat violence against women is a crime, and it will not be tolerated. \nIt is helping transform the law enforcement response and provide \nservices to victims all across the country. We are right to renew our \ncommitment to the victims who are helped by this critical legislation \nand to extend a hand to those whose needs have remained unmet.\n  As we have done in every VAWA authorization, this bill takes steps to \nimprove the law and meet unmet needs. We recognize those victims who we \nhave not yet reached and find ways to help them. This is what we have \nalways done. As I have said many times the past several weeks, a victim \nis a victim is a victim. We are reaching out to help all victims. I am \nproud that the legislation Senator Crapo and I introduced seeks to \nprotect all victims--women, children, and men, immigrants and native \nborn, gay and straight, Indian and non-Indian. They all deserve our \nattention and the protection and access to services our bill provides.\n  I have said since we started the process of drafting this legislation \nthat the Violence Against Women Act is an example of what the Senate \ncan accomplish when we work together. I have worked hard to make this \nreauthorization process open and democratic. Senator Crapo and I have \nrequested input from both sides of the aisle, and we have incorporated \nmany changes to this legislation suggested by Republican as well as \nDemocratic Senators.\n  Our bill is based on months of work with survivors, advocates, and \nlaw enforcement officers from all across the country and from all \npolitical persuasions. We worked with them to craft a bill that \nresponds to the needs they see in the field. That is why every one of \nthe provisions in the bill has such widespread support. That is why \nmore than 1000 national, State, and local organizations support our \nbill.\n  I appreciate the bipartisan support this bill has had from the \nbeginning, and I want to commend our 61 cosponsors. I commend our eight \nRepublicans for their willingness to work across party lines.\n  I cannot overstate the important role played by Senators Murray, \nMurkowski, Mikulski, Feinstein, Klobuchar, Boxer, Hagan, Shaheen, \nCantwell, Gillibrand, Collins, Snowe, and Ayotte in this process. The \nwork these women Senators have done in shaping the legislation, and \nsupporting it here on the Senate floor, as well as back home in their \nStates, has helped create the urgency needed to get a bill passed. They \nare among the strongest supporters of our bill, and the bill is better \nfor their efforts. I also appreciate the gracious comments Senator \nHutchison made about the Leahy-Crapo bill, and I am encouraged by her \nnow joining with us to pass the bill.\n  I also want to thank the many members of the Judiciary Committee who \nhelped draft various provisions in the bill. Senators Kohl, Durbin, \nSchumer, Franken, Klobuchar, Whitehouse, Coons, and Blumenthal offered \nsignificant contributions.\n  The Senate's action today could not have been accomplished without \nthe hard work of many dedicated staffers. I would like to thank in \nparticular Anya McMurray, Noah Bookbinder, Ed Chung, Erica Chabot, Liz \nAloi, Matt Smith, Kelsey Kobelt, Tara Magner, Ed Pagano, John Dowd and \nBruce Cohen from my staff.\n  I know the staff of Senator Grassley has put in significant time on \nthis legislation as well. I thank Kolan Davis, Fred Ansell, and Kathy \nNeubel for their efforts.\n  I also commend the hardworking Senate floor staff, Tim Mitchell and \nTrish Engle, and the staffs of other Senators who I know have worked \nhard on this legislation, including Erik Stegman, Wendy Helgemo, Josh \nRiley, Ken Flanz, Susan Stoner, Nate Bergerbest, Kristi Williams, Stacy\n\n[[Page S2799]]\n\nRich, Mike Spahn, Serena Hoy, Bill Dauster, and Gary Myrick.\n  Most importantly, I thank the many individuals, organizations, and \ncoalitions that have helped with this effort. I thank the Vermonters \nwho have helped inform me and this legislation, Karen Tronsgard-Scott \nof the Vermont Network to End Domestic and Sexual Violence and Jane Van \nBuren with Women Helping Battered Women. And I thank all those involved \nwith the National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence \nAgainst Women, American Bar Association Commission on Domestic \nViolence, Asian & Pacific Islander Institute on Domestic Violence, \nBreak the Cycle, Casa de Esperanza, Futures Without Violence, Jewish \nWomen International, Legal Momentum, National Alliance to End Sexual \nViolence, National Center for Victims of Crime, National Coalition \nAgainst Domestic Violence, National Coalition of Anti-Violence \nPrograms, National Congress of American Indians Taskforce on Violence \nAgainst Women, National Council of Jewish Women, National Domestic \nViolence Hotline, National Network to End Domestic Violence, National \nOrganization of Sisters of Color Ending Sexual Assault, SCESA, National \nResource Center on Domestic Violence, National Sexual Violence Resource \nCenter, Resource Sharing Project of the Iowa Coalition Against Sexual \nAssault, YWCA USA, Human Rights Campaign, Human Rights Watch, NAACP, \nMayors of Los Angeles, New York, and Chicago, the National Sheriff's \nAssociation, Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, FLEOA, \nNational Center for State Courts, National Association of Attorneys \nGeneral, National Association of Women Judges, Leadership Conference on \nCivil and Human Rights, National Faith Groups, and so many more for \ntheir focus on the victims and their unmet needs.\n  This is an example of what the Senate can do when we put aside \nrhetoric and partisanship. I believe that if Senators, Members of the \nHouse, Americans from across the country take an honest look at the \nprovisions in our bipartisan VAWA reauthorization bill, they will find \nthem to be commonsense measures that we all can support. Sixty-one \nSenators have already reached this conclusion. I hope more will join us \nand the Senate can promptly pass and Congress can promptly enact the \nLeahy-Crapo Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act.\n  I thank the bipartisan coalition that has come together on this. Most \nimportantly, the coalition across the political spectrum that is so \nopposed to violence against women will thank us for passing this bill.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield back all time on our side.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I yield back time on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back.\n  The bill having been read the third time, the question is, Shall the \nbill pass?\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Illinois (Mr. Kirk).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken).

Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, there are a number of us who wish to speak. \nI will cede to the Senator from Montana, my senior. So if I could ask \nunanimous consent that the Senator from Montana speak, then the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, and then--I think the Senator from Louisiana had a \nrequest for 1 minute. So if we could allow the Senator from Louisiana \nto go first, then the Senator from Montana, and then I would follow, \nand then Senator Reed would follow me. So I ask unanimous consent for \nthat order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, today, young women from Louisiana, \nCalifornia, and the Washington area are my special guests for Take Our \nDaughters and Sons to Work Day. We were joined by over 100 young women \nand men here at the Capitol today with their parents, grandparents, and \nguardians to participate in work in the Senate.\n  I want to acknowledge the Ms. Foundation that started the national \nTake Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day program over 20 years ago. I \nwould like to particularly thank Leader Reid and Leader McConnell for \nopening the Senate floor today for these children.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the young women's names, as well as the \nnames of those family members or guardians joining them, be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Dominique Cravins, from Opelousas, LA, accompanied by her \n     parents, Don and Yvette Cravins; Martine Cruz, from Baton \n     Rouge, LA, accompanied by her mother, Dr. Julie\n\n[[Page S2800]]\n\n     Morial; Amiya Dawson, from Monroe, LA, accompanied by her \n     mother, Kinya Dawson; Katya and Anya Fontana, from New \n     Orleans, LA, accompanied by their mother, Karen Fontana; \n     Mariah Jones, from Natchitoches, LA, accompanied by their \n     grandfather, Victor Jones and Deloris Jones; Anna Reilly, \n     from Baton Rouge, LA, accompanied by her mother, Jennifer \n     Reilly; Lawren Scott, from Baton Rouge, LA, accompanied by \n     her mother, Jacqueline Scott; Sarah Sternberg, from Los \n     Angeles, CA, accompanied by Morton Friedkin; Grace Strottman, \n     from Washington, DC, accompanied by her parents, Kathleen and \n     Matt Strottman; Hailey Trahan, from Lafayette, LA, \n     accompanied by her mother, Angela Trahan, Gladys and Clayton \n     Arceneaux, and Monique Thierry; and, Caroline and Bailey \n     Watts, from Hammond, LA, accompanied by their great aunt, \n     Grace Eldridge and, their grandmother, Maggie Watts.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Please join me in welcoming my exceptional guests and \ntheir family members or guardians who have accompanied them to the U.S. \nSenate.\n  So, again, I thank my Senate colleagues for giving me this \nopportunity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I note the Senator from Massachusetts has \na very tight schedule and a close timeline to catch a flight overseas. \nI think it appropriate that I defer to the Senator from Massachusetts. \nHe has a very tight schedule, and I can wait a little longer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                        Tribute to Mary C. Tarr\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am very grateful to my colleague. I was \nhappy to wait, but I am grateful to him. I thank the Senator from \nMontana, my friend Senator Baucus.\n  I am privileged to work with a lot of extraordinary staff members \nhere in the Senate, as we all are. We often say that none of us is any \nbetter than our staff allow us to be. It is rare that I have had \nsomebody on my team who predated my time in the U.S. Senate. I have \nbeen here--oh, this is my 28th year now.\n  Mary Tarr, who I would like to say a few words about, is my office \nmanager, up until today--a veteran staffer of 31 years here in the \nSenate. She is about to retire and looks forward to going into the \ngrandmother business over the course of these next years, after three \ndecades here.\n  I think sometimes people miss or are unaware of the difference that \nan office manager could make in a Senate office. It is hard to quantify \nsometimes. But without any negative inference to the Senate itself in \ndrawing this analogy, which is sort of a prison-and-inmates analogy, a \ngreat manager is a little bit like the character Red in the movie ``The \nShawshank Redemption.'' In that movie, Red is described as the guy who \ncan get stuff, not unlike the sergeant in ``Catch 22.'' There are these \nspecial people who know how to make things appear out of nowhere and \nmake everything work. That is exactly the quality Mary Tarr has brought \nto my office over these years--a mix of relationships, building \nrelationships, institutional memory, and a lot of guile at times. And \nshe gets things done. So since the summer of 1997 when she came aboard \nin my office, Mary has literally been my ``Red'' in my office.\n  Over the course of nearly 15 years, no matter what I needed, no \nmatter what the office needed, no matter what we needed to get done, \nshe managed to make that happen. I must say I was very lucky, because I \ndidn't have the ability to show her any tricks; she taught me the \ntricks. The reason is that she came to me already a master of Senate \nprocedure. I was privileged to be the fifth U.S. Senator for whom she \nworked--and for 15 years, I might add. Before me, she split her \nassignments down the middle between Democrats and Republicans. She \nworked for Patty Murray and Brock Adams, and she worked for \nRepublicans, including Jim Abnor and Charles Percy. She knew this \nplace. She has always loved this place, and she knew pretty much \neverybody who worked here.\n  She did all of the things one needs to do to make the trains run on \ntime: kept the records, maintained the office accounts, prepared the \nbudget, kept the payroll, preaudited expenses, ordered supplies, made \nsure we were in compliance with all the rules, requirements, and \nprocedures, and followed them as they changed, as we tie ourselves in \nvarious knots with various requirements we dump on ourselves. She was \nmy liaison with the Senate Sergeant at Arms Office, the Senate \nDisbursing Office, the Senate Service Department, and the Senate \nComputer Center--an extraordinary amount of work. She performed the \nendless tasks that all of us here understand are critical to enabling \nour offices to be able to work--much more complex than obviously the \naverage citizen ever sees.\n  She wrote the emergency evacuation manual for my staff after 9/11. \nShe trained the staff on emergency procedures, and she restructured and \nran what I think is one of the best intern programs, if not the best \ninternship program, in the U.S. Senate, for which the summer interns at \nthe end of the summer got to have a terrific intern pool party at her \nhome. Office managers all over the Senate constantly consulted her on \nhow to run an effective intern program, and she was always ready to \nhelp because she understood how important it was for young interns to \nhave a positive experience. Part of that belief came out of the fact \nthat she was only 17 when she came to work full time for the U.S. \nSenate--younger, obviously, than some of the interns who come here and \nwork with us.\n  When I said she could do the impossible, what I was referring to is \nthe fact that she helped me move my office not once but twice, which is \nan enormous undertaking here in the Senate.\n  Mary Tarr has worked for the Senate since 1981. In those 31 years, I \nwill tell my colleagues she has become a fixture on Capitol Hill, well-\nknown by everybody, perhaps legendary with some.\n  If you needed a room at the last minute to host a function, people \nwould call Mary Tarr--from outside of our office, I might add.\n  If you needed a desk repaired or a light repaired or air-conditioning \nwork done, mention Mary's name and people would say: Right away.\n  Printing? My legislative director told me a story about how he went \nto get some printing done, and the folks at the Senate Printing Office \nasked: Did Mary OK this?\n  Extra ice cream at the great ice cream party we have in May at the \nDirksen buffet? She would just say: Go in and ask for the ``Mary \nspecial,'' and they made it.\n  Everybody seemed to know Mary, from the hundreds of former interns \nshe mentored over the years, who are now working in government or \npublic service, to Bill Gates, who once conveyed a hello from Mary to a \nformer colleague in Patty Murray's office.\n  Hundreds of American soldiers, I might add, stationed abroad have \nreceived care packages from Mary, the daughter of a wounded Vietnam \nveteran.\n  In my Senate offices, I have a shelf of scrapbooks filled with e-\nmails, letters, and photos from soldiers who have received care \npackages, Christmas stockings, Easter baskets, and Halloween candy--all \nof which Mary has organized and shipped year after year. And the words \nof those soldiers underscore just how important Mary has been to them.\n  Our former intern, Army 2LT Rory McGovern, wrote:\n\n       It always helps to have a piece of home come in the mail.\n\n  Army Private Jacob Adkins:\n\n       I appreciate the fact that someone who I don't even know \n     supports me enough to send a care package. You make me proud \n     to serve.\n\n  From Marine battalion chaplain Capt. Pat Opp:\n\n       Little things go a long way with morale. Send more \n     lemonade--the troops mix it with cold water as the \n     temperature is super hot over here.\n\n  Army MAJ James Maloney, upon receiving clothes, school supplies, and \npersonal grooming items to share with a children's and women's clinic \nin Afghanistan, wrote:\n\n       It has done wonders for our interaction with the local \n     population.\n\n  All of that organized--every time--by Mary Tarr.\n  One of my favorite e-mails in the scrapbooks comes not from a soldier \nbut from a marine's mother, Kathy Lavin, whose son Ryan had received \none of our care packages. Kathy wrote to tell Mary that she can finally \nget a good night's sleep because of the message she just received from \nRyan. Ryan wrote:\n\n       It's almost time to take the candle out of the window, mom. \n     I am coming home. I love and miss you.\n\n  So how did Mary Tarr come to send a care package to Ryan? So typical \nof\n\n[[Page S2801]]\n\nMary, she was in Massachusetts attending the funeral of a friend, and \nwhile there she went into a shop in Hull to buy gifts for her mother \nand father, Carolyn and Tom Corbe. Mary chose a Marine Corps kite for \nher dad, who received a Purple Heart in Vietnam. Ryan's mother was in \nthe shop and asked Mary if she had a marine because of what she was \nbuying. Mary told her she was a Marine Corps brat and the kite was for \nher father. She asked if Kathy had a marine. When Kathy told her about \nRyan, Mary immediately wrote the information down, got his address, and \nthen, seeing her job through--like every single one she has ever \nundertaken--she stayed in touch with Ryan until he came home.\n  I personally know how important those packages are, and I will tell \nyou, one of the things I am proudest of is what Mary has done on behalf \nof her country and certainly those of us who make decisions to send \npeople into combat. And I am proud of her.\n  She may be retiring, but she has enormous plans ahead of her. She and \nher husband Brian are planning to move to Roswell, GA, where her \ndaughter Angela and her husband Daniel live. Mary jokes that Angela and \nDaniel may be the only two Democrats in the whole town of Roswell, so \nthe arrival of Mary and Brian will double our party's strength there. \nBut Angela is going to have a baby in October, so there is hope even \nfor Roswell yet. Her plan is to babysit her new grandson for a few \nyears, and then eventually she and Brian are going to retire to \nFlorida, where her daughters Chrissy and Lindsay are in college.\n  No matter where she goes or how far from Capitol Hill, she is always \ngoing to be a very special part of the family here, the extended Senate \nfamily. She has always represented our Senate well. She is extremely \nhard working, honest, bright, conscientious, and knowledgeable. She has \nhandled her responsibilities with great dedication. I think she has \nviewed every challenge as an opportunity to prove herself, and she did \nthat again and again.\n  So, Mr. President, as she departs my staff today, the principles she \nrepresented in her work and the standards she established are going to \nremain for a long time as a guide to those in our office and here in \nthe Senate, and we say thank you to her for all she has done for our \ncountry, the State of Massachusetts, and for me personally. I wish her \nand Brian and her family the very best as they take on a new chapter in \ntheir lives.\n  Mr. President, again, I thank my colleague from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                        Tribute to Maureen Rice\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from \nMassachusetts for taking so much time to praise a person who clearly \ndeserves praise, who has worked so hard for him and for the people of \nMassachusetts and for her country. Clearly, Mary is an incredible lady.\n  Mr. President, my ``Mary'' is Maureen. Maureen, too, is someone who \nstarted working for me when she was very young--17 years old. In 1974, \n1975--I do not know exactly when--I was hiring people, and this young \ngirl came to my office. I could tell--this young girl knows the meaning \nof work. She is Catholic, Irish Catholic, and this lady knows the \nmeaning of hard work.\n  I hired her on the spot. She is my office manager. She is with me \neven to this date. She is tough. She is smart. She organizes. She is \nthe glue. She is a super lady.\n  We all have our ``Marys.'' We have our ``Maureens.'' And at this \nmoment, I want to praise Mary and Maureen but also all those who work \nso hard for us in so many different capacities.\n\n\n           Reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act\n\n  Mr. President, renowned poet and author Maya Angelou wrote:\n       History with all its unending pain cannot be outlived, but \n     faced with courage need not be lived again.\n\n  I stand here today to once again lend my strong support--I voted for \nit, as a majority of our colleagues did--for the Violence Against Women \nAct.\n  Nearly two decades ago, the Congress underwent an exhaustive \ninvestigation on the extent and severity of domestic violence and \nsexual assault toward women in this country. In hearing after hearing, \nSenators heard from experts, including prosecutors, victim advocates, \nand physicians, and real-life stories of women who were the victims of \nthese crimes.\n  In response, Congress passed the Violence Against Women Act in 1994. \nThis law quite literally changed the culture in our country. It changed \nhow we view and address domestic violence and sexual assault. States \nacross our country began to enact laws to make stalking a crime and \nstrengthened criminal rape statutes. Congress provided States with the \nresources to train law enforcement and coordinate services related to \ndomestic violence and sexual assault.\n  Despite the progress we have made, our work is not done. One in every \nfour women will experience domestic violence during her lifetime. In my \nhome State of Montana, 98 people died from domestic violence between \n2000 and 2010. These are not simply statistics, they are our mothers, \nour sisters, our daughters, our friends--they are people close to us.\n  Since the passage of the Violence Against Women Act, reporting of \ndomestic violence has increased by 51 percent and the rate of nonfatal \nintimate partner violence against women has decreased by 53 percent.\n  Congress renewed this critical legislation in the year 2000 and again \nin 2005. Both measures included improvements, and both of those passed \nthe Senate unanimously.\n  We are here today to reiterate our commitment to addressing violence \nagainst women, including domestic abuse, sexual assault, dating \nviolence, and stalking.\n  I was struck recently by the story in the Billings Gazette of Maria \nMartin. Maria was a victim of partner abuse. In the year 2005, the man \nshe was dating went into a jealous rage. He held her hostage in her own \nhome with a knife to her throat. He also threatened to kill her three \ndaughters. Charges were filed, and this man is now serving a 61-year \nprison term.\n  Maria went on to earn her master's degree in rehabilitation and \nmental health counseling. She now helps others who find themselves in \nthe situation she was in just a few short years ago. Maria told the \nreporter that programs created under the Violence Against Women Act \nprovided her with the resources and support to overcome her situation. \nThe act helped her to find the courage she needed to see that this \npainful experience did not have to be lived again--with its counseling, \nshelter for abused women, and law enforcement counseling for law \nenforcement so they can be more sensitive to women who are victims of \ndomestic violence.\n  The bipartisan reauthorization renews grant programs critical to \nMontana, including those that support law enforcement, victim services, \nand prevention programs.\n  The bill consolidates 13 programs, many of which overlap, into 4. \nThis consolidation reduces administrative costs and adds efficiency. \nAcknowledging the current fiscal realities, the bill, therefore, \nreduces authorization levels by 17 percent overall. It is more \neffective, and it costs less.\n  The bill also makes critical changes to address the pervasive \ndomestic violence occurring in Indian Country.\n  Native Americans represent about 6 percent of Montana's population--\nabout 6 percent. Yet Native women accounted for over 13 percent of \nvictims reporting domestic violence in my State in the year 2008--more \nthan two times the percentage.\n  According to the Department of Justice, Native women are 2\\1/2\\ times \nmore likely to be a victim of rape or sexual assault compared with non-\nNative women. However, it is the Federal courts, not the tribal courts, \nthat have jurisdiction over many of these crimes, including misdemeanor \ncases. With Federal prosecutors stretched thin, especially in large \nrural States such as Montana, many cases go uninvestigated and \ncriminals walk free to continue their violence with no repercussions.\n  Chairman Leahy's bill carefully crafts a measure to extend concurrent \ncriminal tribal jurisdiction to address the issue of domestic violence \nand partner abuse occurring in Indian Country. These provisions will \ngive tribal courts narrow jurisdiction to prosecute domestic violence \nor dating partner violence occurring on tribal land.\n\n[[Page S2802]]\n\n  The bill, however, provides safeguards to those who might be \ndefendants. It provides safeguards to ensure that the defendant \nreceives all rights guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution. This includes \nfourth amendment protections against unreasonable search and seizure, \nfifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination, and sixth \namendment right to effective assistance of counsel--all guaranteed in \nthis statute.\n  Fifty law professors from across the country, including the \nUniversity of Montana, wrote to Chairman Leahy in support of these \nprovisions and Congress's constitutional authority to extend tribal \njurisdiction. These provisions will begin to address the violence \nagainst Native women that ``has reached epidemic proportions.''\n  Maya Angelou is right that we cannot erase the past and what happened \nto Maria and others like her. But Maria's courage is proof that we can \nchange these circumstances for others--to see that no one has to live \nthrough this experience.\n  Maria said--and I will quote her:\n\n       I am alive today because I am a strong, intelligent woman. \n     I need to stand up, step out, and be in front of this issue \n     for others who can't or are not able to--yet.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to support me in making sure that this act \nfollows through in negotiations with the House and that we get this \nreauthorization passed that is so important to so many people in our \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, after months of working to ensure that the \nsubsidized student loan interest rate does not double this summer, I \nthink we finally have reached a consensus--middle-income families in \nAmerica cannot afford a huge increase, a doubling in the interest rate \non student loans.\n  Those who were previously opposed or indifferent to our proposal now \nare in favor of stopping the doubling of the rate. The most prominent, \nof course, is the former Governor of Massachusetts, Mitt Romney, who \nsaid: ``I fully support the effort to extend the low interest rate on \nstudent loans.'' I think that is the consensus. It was hard fought. I \nsubmitted the legislation to keep the rate at 3.4 percent originally in \nJanuary. Now we have reached that consensus.\n  But the debate has now shifted to how do we pay for it. What I have \nproposed, and am joined by many colleagues, is to close a loophole that \nhas allowed a self-selected few to avoid paying their fair share of \npayroll taxes.\n  The alternative proposed on the other side goes to critical health \ncare benefits for lower and middle-income families. It seems to me \nentirely unfair to try to provide help to middle-income families by \ntaking away their access to health care. For families who are \nstruggling, education and health care are not something that can be \ntraded one for the other.\n  Congress should not raise the interest rate on these loans. We have \nreached that agreement. It is a de facto tax on middle-income families. \nWe have put forward a plan that will avoid the doubling of the interest \nrate on student loans and will pay for it in a responsible way. We are \noffering a short-term solution to a long-term problem. But we have to \nbegin. We have to do it quickly. If we do not act before July 1, the \ninterest rate on these loans will double for every loan granted \nthereafter.\n  Our proposal is to close a loophole that the General Accounting \nService has identified as glaring and, frankly, not substantiated by \nany need. This loophole involves Subchapter S corporations or S-corps. \nImmediately, when we say S-corps, we think it must be the local \nmanufacturer or the hardware store and how can we go ahead and impose \nany further taxes, any further costs on these job creators.\n  This is not the situation. What is happening is that a very clever \nand bright group of people have figured out a way to use the S-corp to \navoid payroll taxes. It is a small subset of corporations that are \ndoing this, and our proposal is targeted. It is targeted only to those \nS-corps that derive 75 percent or more of their gross revenue from the \nservices of three or fewer shareholders or where the S-corp is a \npartner in a professional service business.\n  Essentially, this is a small group of people who derive 75 percent or \nmore of their gross revenues from providing professional services. It \nis lawyers, accountants, lobbyists, and folks such as that. The \nproposal only applies to S-corps or partnerships in the field, where \nvirtually all the earnings are attributable to the performance of \nservices. This is not the local manufacturer, not the local hardware \nstore, not the local dry cleaner or gas station. These are people who \nperform essentially professional services.\n  They are avoiding their payroll taxes, and we do not think that \nshould be the case. Furthermore, this proposal exempts S-corp \nshareholders, partners, and partnerships with modified adjusted gross \nincomes below $250,000 for joint filers and $200,000 for individuals. \nSo it is targeted within this small subgroup of S-corps to an even \nsmaller group, those who are making $250,000 and above as joint filers \nor $200,000 and above as sole filers.\n  This proposal prevents professional service income from being mis-\nchar-acterized to avoid employment taxes. However, legitimate passive \nincome--if the S-corp is earning income from rents, from dividends, \nfrom interest, and certain other gains, those will be essentially \ntreated as such and will continue to be exempt from payroll taxes.\n  All we have done is close a glaring loophole, done it in a way in \nwhich we do not impact anyone making under $200,000, anyone, frankly, \nwho is involved in a corporation whose principal activities are not \nprofessional services. I think this is a responsible way to do it. This \nis a way that can, in fact, respond to the need to responsibly fund \nthis provision for maintaining the student loan interest rate.\n  The GAO found that in 2003 and 2004 tax years, individuals used this \nloophole to underreport over $23 billion in wage income. The median \nunreported amount was $20,127. For most students, that would cover \ntuition. Let me say this again. What the GAO found was that using this \ndevice as an S-corp, people were able to transform what normally would \nbe $20,000 in payroll wages or salaries that would be subject to \npayroll taxes into a distribution of an S-corp, avoiding payroll taxes.\n  This is a loophole. There is no other word for it. We are closing it, \nand we are closing it in a way that is responsible and that will have \nvirtually no impact on the businesses on Main Street USA. In fact, I \nthink if we tried to explain to anyone running the local store that \nthere are some folks out there who were using S-corps to avoid their \npayroll taxes, they would be, if not shocked, they would, at least, \nraise objections to that practice, frankly.\n  So closing this loophole will fully offset the $5.9 billion cost of \nthis 1-year extension on the interest rate and would make the Tax Code \nmore fair. It is a win-win proposition. In fact, according to Citizens \nfor Tax Justice, in their words, closing this loophole will actually \nhelp most small businesses, which are currently subsidizing the \nminority who abuse it to avoid payroll taxes. So I think this is not \nonly the right thing to do in terms of the policy of not doubling the \ninterest rate on student loans, this is an appropriate way to do it, an \nappropriate way to pay for it.\n  Even Governor Romney recognizes that at times S-corps have to pay \ntheir fair share. This is a quote from the Boston Herald of January 6, \n2008.\n\n       ``When Mitt Romney became Governor in 2003, Subchapter S \n     corporations that were owned by Massachusetts business trusts \n     were taxed at 5.3 percent. By the time Romney left office, \n     the tax rate on these corporations had climbed to 9.8 \n     percent, with Romney declaring the tax increase to be merely \n     `closing loopholes.' ''\n\n  We are urging that the Governor be consistent both in support for \navoiding the increase in the student interest rate and closing \nloopholes in Subchapter S corporations. Both parties must work to find \na way to do this. The good news is there is now consensus that it must \nbe done. I am prepared, and I hope my colleagues are prepared to work \nfor a way to pay for it which is fair, which does not take from one \nmiddle-class program to offset another middle-class program. We should \nwork together to get this done as soon as we return.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n[[Page S2803]]\n\n                       Tribute to Angela Elsbury\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I have obviously been very fortunate \nto have the opportunity to give remarks from my desk on the floor of \nthe Senate several times since the people of Missouri sent me in 2006. \nI do not think I have ever had a speech that I was going to give that \nwas easier and harder than this speech--easy in that I am talking about \nsomeone I love; hard because this person I love is going on to a \ndifferent place and a brighter future and I am going to miss her \nterribly.\n  This person's name is Angela Elsbury, and she has a job that people \noutside Congress do not fully appreciate. She is called the scheduler. \nBut for anybody who does this work, they appreciate that somehow that \ntitle just does not do it justice. I do not know what the right title \nwould be. I can think of several: In charge of my life, hand holder, \nthe nicest person who has to say no, multitasker, mother to the entire \noffice, disciplinarian, jokester.\n  There are so many things a good scheduler does that make our lives \nwork. Angela came to this work having worked for the Governor in \nMissouri in a similar capacity. She actually joined my campaign and was \none of the first ones through the door. She came from a place that, \nfrankly, had not had a lot of people who were elbow to elbow with \nGovernors and Senators. She came from a small town called Madison, MO. \nI think there are maybe just north of 500 people who live in Madison.\n  So not only did she begin the campaign and do a lot at the beginning \nof the campaign keeping us organized and allowing the schedule to work, \nshe came to Washington and has done remarkable work. Her work is so \nremarkable that everybody kind of thought it was easy. That is the mark \nof a very good scheduler because it is the hardest job--the hardest \njob--in the office.\n  Not only does she have to put up with the frustration of me when the \nhours are long and the meetings are back to back and there is not time \nto get a breath, she has to put up with everyone in Missouri who cannot \nunderstand why I cannot be in five places at one time and why it is not \npossible for me to vote one hour and be in Rolla, MO, the next hour. \nShe does all that with incredible grace and intellect and a smile on \nher face. She is just a very special person.\n  The thing about these jobs is there are days I get worried about our \ndemocracy, and then I look at the resumes of the young people, whether \nit is the great pages who serve us morning, noon, and night in the \nChamber or whether it is the amazing people whom I work with in my \noffice. These are people who could go other places in the private \nsector and make a lot of money. They choose to come here. They are \ndrawn here. They are drawn to their government. They are drawn to \npublic service.\n  So, as a result, I mean, what do I love about my job? Let me count \nthe ways. But one of the things I love most is being surrounded by \npatriotic, intellectual Americans who want to do the right thing and do \nnot care that they have to still live like they are in college, who do \nnot care that the idea of buying a car is a fantasy because it is just \ntoo expensive, who do not care that they have to have an hour commute \nin order to get housing they can afford. They want to be a part of it.\n  I am surrounded by a team like that, but in the driver's seat, kind \nof making the car go where it needs to go, and making sure it does not \nget broken down on the side of the road has been Angela. I am not sure \nexactly how this car is going to navigate without her. I have a feeling \nwe are going to have a few bumps. There may be an out and out \ncollision. There may be some scrapes and some wailing and some \nhollering about people who are upset or it does not work.\n  I do know this, that we always say somebody's shoes are hard to fill. \nThese shoes will be very hard to fill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted \nto give this speech in full.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                 Taxes\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the impending tax hike which, \nif allowed to occur, will raise taxes on practically all Americans come \nJan 1, 2013. That is only eight months from now. Earlier in February, \nThe Washington Post called the approximately $500 billion tax hike \nTaxmageddon, and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke described it as \na massive fiscal cliff when testifying before Congress.\n  This tax hike will affect virtually every single federal income tax \npayer. We must not allow this to happen. America is slowly recovering \nfrom one of the greatest recessions in modern history. We remain in a \nprecarious economic situation, with a fragile recovery. It is beyond \nirresponsible for President Obama to sit idly by and allow this \nscheduled $500 billion tax hike to occur.\n  Congress needs to act now in order to prevent this tax hike on \nAmerica.\n  First we need to focus on tax extenders.\n  Tax Extenders are temporary tax provisions affecting everything from \nindividuals and businesses to charitable giving, energy, and even \ndisaster relief. My colleague from Montana, Senator Baucus, and I held \na hearing in late January to discuss these tax provisions and the fact \nthat Congress year after year continues to extend these provisions \nwithout a thorough review of each provision.\n  Some of these provisions are worthy of being extended, such as the \nResearch and Development tax credit. I have introduced legislation with \nthe Chairman, my friend from Montana, to make this provision permanent. \nBut when it comes to tax extenders, we need to have a real debate, one \nwhere the Senate decides which provisions must be extended and which \nshould be allowed to expire.\n  Second, we need to address the Alternative Minimum Tax, or AMT.\n  The AMT was initially drafted to provide some type of guarantee that \nhigher-income taxpayers, who owed little or no taxes under the regular \nincome tax due to tax preferences, would still pay some taxes. Yet over \ntime, this tax has grown into a monster potentially ensnaring more and \nmore middle income families every year.\n  To avoid the consequences of the AMT on the middle class, year after \nyear Congress has patched the AMT. We have indexed the AMT for \ninflation so that middle income families do not get caught up paying \nthis tax. Not only must we patch the AMT for 2012, we must eliminate \nthe AMT in the long term.\n  Third, we must focus on death tax reform.\n  Taxing people's assets upon their death is just plain wrong. The \ndeath tax affects thousands of small businesses owners every year. This \nyear alone, it is estimated that 3,600 estates will be affected. In 10 \nyears, approximately 83,200 estates will be hit with this tax according \nto the Joint Committee on Taxation.\n  The President likes to talk about how his policies will help small \nbusinesses. Well, if current law expires, the number of small business \nowners who will face the death tax will rise by 900 percent. The number \nof farmers who will face the death tax will rise by 2,200 percent. \nThat's right--two thousand two hundred percent.\n  Many individuals work their entire lives to build a business, and \nthey reasonably want to pass that business along to their families. \nInstead of being rewarded for their work, and the work of their \nfamilies, this is what they face come January 1, 2013. Uncle Sam will \ntake over 50 percent of their assets--55 percent to be exact.\n  The survivors of the deceased will be forced to sell land or assets \nof the business to meet this liability. Let me be clear. Nobody should \nbe forced to sell a single asset in order to meet this arbitrary tax \ndue date. Company assets should not have to be sold to pay taxes. The \nmarket should determine when things are bought and sold. That is the \nbest measurement--when a willing Buyer meets a willing Seller and they \nagree on a price and a time when a company should be sold.\n  Currently, the law states that there is an exemption equivalent of $5 \nmillion and a tax rate of 35 percent on the remaining estate. In 2013 \nthe exemption equivalent will drop to $1 million and the top tax rate \nwill be the full 55 percent.\n  That's a 57 percent increase.\n  The truth is that we ought to repeal the death tax in its entirety. \nThe whole\n\n[[Page S2804]]\n\nthing must go. And I am working hard to make that a reality. \nUnfortunately, with the current composition of the Senate, that is \ngoing to be an uphill climb. Yet at a minimum we must extend the \ncurrent provisions and keep a tax hike from occurring on these job \ncreators.\n  Fourth and most importantly, we must extend the tax relief signed \ninto law by President Bush and extended by President Obama.\n  This may be the most crucial piece of legislation Congress passes \nthis year, if not during the entire 112th Congress. If we allow these \ncuts to expire as scheduled at the end of the year, almost every \nfederal income tax payer in America will see an increase in their \nrates. Some will see a rate increase of 9 percent, while others will \nsee a rate increase of 87 percent.\n  Let's take the average American family of four earning $50,000. This \nfamily will owe an additional tax of $2,183.\n  Democrats insist that that is fair.\n  That is just more people paying more of their fair share.\n  But to whom? And for what?\n  What this means in reality is that instead of taxpayers using their \n$2,183 to pay for their children's education, save for retirement, buy \na new home, or invest in a new business, they will be forking that \n$2,183 over to the federal government. And after winding its way \nthrough the federal bureaucracy, some pittance of that $2,183 will be \nspent on a federal program that too often has zero demonstrated \nsuccess.\n  Let's not sugarcoat this.\n  In the supposed interest of fairness, families will have an \nadditional $2,183 taken from their wallets in order to serve bigger \ngovernment.\n  That is the impact on families and businesses of President Obama's \nredistributionist agenda.\n  Looking at this problem more broadly, economists estimate that if \nthese current policies are allowed to expire, the economy could \ncontract by approximately 3 percentage points. That would be a large \nhit to an economy that is still weak and recovering from the fiscal \ncrisis of 2008. Adding another fiscal crisis by not extending these tax \npolicies definitely won't help and will likely do further damage.\n  Preventing this tax hike is what we must focus on. Congress should \nhave a laser focus on preventing this looming disaster.\n  Yet at a time when we should be working to prevent a massive tax \nincrease, President Obama and his Democrat allies are spinning their \nwheels trying to raise taxes on politically unpopular groups.\n  These tax hikes are already scheduled to go into effect. Congress \ndoesn't have to do anything and everyone will pay more in taxes come \n2013.\n  That's not a good sign given that some people have called this a do-\nnothing Senate.\n  I am sure that some people are tired of the mantra among \nconservatives that Democrats want to raise your taxes and Republican's \ndon't.\n  But we say it because it is true.\n  At liberal think tanks, their employees go to work every morning and \nthink about how they can raise taxes.\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle, knowing that their \nconstituents already feel overtaxed, spend countless hours devising \nways to raise taxes in a way that only hits politically unpopular \ngroups.\n  And the President is devoting his entire reelection campaign toward \ntax hiking in the interest of fairness.\n  Here in the Senate, we have already voted twice on my colleague from \nNew Jersey's proposal to raise taxes on oil and gas companies.\n  First we had hearings in the Senate Finance Committee last year. As I \nsaid then, that was nothing more than a dog and pony show. Then \nleadership brought the bill directly to the floor skipping the process \nof a markup.\n  Last week we voted for the silly Buffett Tax.\n  This is not serious tax policy. The Buffett Tax is a statutory \ntalking point. And not a very good one at that.\n  First, the President said it was about deficit reduction.\n  When we pointed out to him that it raised only $47 billion in revenue \nover 10-years, a drop in the bucket given the President's trillions in \ndeficit spending, the White House shifted gears.\n  Now it was about fairness.\n  But when we pointed out that his redistributionist scheme, if \nredirected to a lower tax bracket, would only yield an $11 per family \ntax rebate, he criticized Republicans for demonizing him as a class \nwarrior.\n  The President needs to come clean about what the Buffett tax really \nis.\n  It is nothing less than a second and even more damaging AMT, one that \nwould force many small business owners and job creators to pay a \nminimum of 30 percent of their income in tax.\n  As the Wall Street Journal said on April 10, ``The U.S. already has a \nBuffett rule. The Alternative Minimum Tax that first became law in 1969 \n. . . The surest prediction in politics is that any tax that starts by \nhitting the rich ends up hitting the middle class because that is where \nthe real money is.''\n  And what is really rich about the Buffett rule, is that Mr. Buffett \nwould be able to avoid his own Buffett tax.\n  So what is the President doing? Why, with Taxmageddon around the \ncorner, are President Obama and his liberal allies dithering with these \nharmful tax increases?\n  The answer is politics.\n  President Obama has read the polls. He knows he's in trouble. His \napproval rating is declining and he does not have a single positive \naccomplishment to run on for a second term.\n  The $800 billion stimulus? A failed policy that hasn't kept the \nemployment rate under 8 percent.\n  Obamacare? Rejected soundly by the American people as evidenced by \nthe 2010 midterm elections, it might now be rejected by the Supreme \nCourt as one of the biggest unconstitutional boondoggles in our \nnation's history.\n  What else does he have?\n  Absolutely nothing.\n  His fawning admirers might not know it yet, but Mitt Romney is in the \ncatbird seat.\n  President Obama long ago lost independents. So he is appealing to all \nhe has left, core left wing supporters, one step from an Occupy Wall \nStreet encampment, who love class warfare.\n  Before the Buffett rule, Democrats proposed six different pieces of \nlegislation that in one form or another raise taxes on millionaires.\n  Here they are.\n  And every one of these bills was focused on raising taxes to pay for \nmore government spending.\n  Let's not pretend that all of these redistributionist tax plans \ncomprise serious policy.\n  And let's not forget that every minute Democrats spend goofing around \nwith these plans, is a minute that we do not spend preventing the \nlargest tax increase in American history.\n  Mr. President, Senate Democrats are fiddling while Rome burns. They \nhave failed to address the deficit. Spending surged 24 percent under \nPresident Obama when he took office. All of the tax hikes he and his \nallies have proposed do little, if anything, to pay down his deficits \nand debt.\n  It is time for the Senate leadership to get serious and to focus on \nmaking the lives of middle class families easier, not more difficult. \nThe policies from the other side do nothing of the sort. If anything \nthey make them more difficult.\n  Taxmageddon is coming. The only good news is that Congress can \nprevent it and extend tax relief for the middle class.\n  That is where my focus will be for the next 8 months, and I hope that \nmy colleagues will join me in securing the benefits of tax relief for \nall Americans.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I came to the floor today to talk about \nthe actions we took here this week in the Senate to make sure the \npostal service has a good chance to return to solvency and be relevant \nin the 21st century and continue to provide a valuable role in \nproviding 7 to 8 million jobs in the United States of America. But I \nthink I will put that on hold for a moment and recall the words of a \nformer President, Harry Truman, who left office not very popular, but \nin retrospect is regarded as one of the best Presidents of the last \ncentury. Harry Truman used to say, the only thing new in the world is \nthe history we forgot or never learned.\n  I want to go back to a few years in our history and reflect on the \nwords of\n\n[[Page S2805]]\n\nthe preceding speaker and ask, what can we learn from history? Well, \none of the things we can learn from is the last time we actually had a \nbalanced budget in this country, and we had three of them in the last 3 \nyears of the Clinton administration. He became President in the middle \nof a recession and left our country with the strongest economy of any \nNation on Earth, with the most productive workforce, the most revered \nNation on Earth. He turned the reins over to a new President, George W. \nBush, and gave to him balanced budgets and a strong economy. Eight \nyears later, we had accumulated more debt in those 8 years--from 2001 \nto 2009--I think than we had in the previous 208 years combined.\n  President Bush then turned over to President-elect Obama a $1 \ntrillion deficit and an economy that was in free fall, with the worst \nrecession since the Great Depression. That is where President Obama and \nVice President Biden--a former colleague and Senator from Delaware--\nstarted off in January of 2009. Keep in mind, the last 6 months of \n2008, this country lost 2\\1/2\\ million jobs. The first 6 months of \n2009, this country lost 2\\1/2\\ million jobs. That is sort of like where \nthey took the handoff.\n  I am not trying, and have never attempted, to characterize the \ncomments made by my colleague a few minutes ago, but I think a little \nhistory is not a bad thing. Interestingly enough, the balanced budget \nagreement was negotiated by President Clinton's Chief of Staff Erskine \nBowles. That is a name we have heard a lot of in the past year and a \nhalf, because he was asked by this President to do a similar kind of \nthing, to try to negotiate a deficit reduction deal, along with a \nformer Republican Senator from Wyoming, Alan Simpson. The two were \nasked to head up a commission, with 16 other very smart people. And 11 \nout of the 18, after working at this for a year, came back and said, \nhere is what we think you should do to take a good $4 trillion or $5 \ntrillion out of the deficit over the next 10 years.\n  The deficit commission, headed by Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson, \nsimply recommended we do that by working on the spending side and on \nthe revenue side. For every $3 of deficit reduction on the spending \nside, they said there would be $1 of new revenues--not by raising taxes \nbut actually by lowering somewhat the personal income tax rate, the \ncorporate income tax rate, and broadening the base of the income which \ncan be taxed.\n  That was seen by a lot of people as being a grand compromise. \nDemocrats agreed to compromise on entitlement program reform in an \neffort to make sure we have Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid 50, \n60, 70, or 100 years from now; and Republicans agreed to compromise on \ntax reform that actually lowers the rate but allows us to generate new \nrevenue--$1 of new revenue for every $3 of spending reductions to \nachieve deficit reduction.\n  I think that is a smart plan. Other people have come forward with \ntheir plans since, but I think that is the smartest deficit reduction \nplan, and I think it is a good jobs bill. I hope by the end of the \nyear, when the smoke clears and the elections are over, we will come \nback to that and use that as maybe our north star to get us back to \nfiscal responsibility in this Nation.\n  That is not why I came here tonight, but I thought maybe it was \nappropriate, on the heels of my friend and colleague, to set the record \nstraight a little bit.\n\n\n                         Postal Service Reform\n\n  Ironically, yesterday 62 Senators voted for postal reform \nlegislation. I appreciate the support of the Presiding Officer and \nother colleagues, Democrat and Republican. But that legislation was \nalmost immediately attacked by some of our Republican friends over in \nthe House of Representatives. Our Presiding Officer knows I am not a \nreal partisan guy; never have been, not while I was Governor or in the \nmany roles I have been privileged to play in Delaware. But our bill was \nattacked almost immediately by our Republican friends over in the House \nbecause it doesn't do this or doesn't do that or whatever the sin might \nbe.\n  Ironically, we asked, where is your bill? How about let's compare our \nbill to your bill. They haven't passed a bill. Yet they feel at liberty \nto take all kinds of shots--and I don't think they are entirely fair \nshots--at our bill. I had a conversation this afternoon with the chair \nof the relevant committee in the House and urged him to make sure they \nactually move a bill and not just criticize what we have done.\n  There are provisions in our bill I am frankly not happy with, and I \nam sure there will be provisions in whatever bill the House passes he \nwon't be comfortable with. But at the end of the day, they have to move \na bill. They have to say this is what we are for, because we have said \nthis is what we want to have as our negotiating point in conference \ngoing forward. So we need the House to do the same thing, sooner rather \nthan later. I am encouraged to hear the House is going to take \nsomething up by the middle of May. If they can do it before that, God \nbless them.\n  I want to take 5, 6, or 7 minutes to talk a little about what we are \ntrying to do with respect to postal reform. We are trying to rightsize \nthe enterprise, much as the auto industry rightsized itself 3 or 4 \nyears ago coming out of bankruptcy. We are trying to modernize the \npostal industry and we are also trying to help the postal service--\nencourage the postal service--to find new ways to use their existing \nbusiness model--where in every community in America there are 33,000 \npost offices going to every front door and mailbox in America 5 or 6 \ndays a week--to make more money and raise their revenues, some of the \nways they can do that.\n  Our legislation focuses on that, rightsizing the enterprise given the \nreduction in mail, the diversion of mail to the electronic media \nbecause of Facebook, Twitter, the Internet, or all of the above. We \ncommunicate differently than we used to. We have to help them rightsize \ntheir enterprise and modernize and find new ways to generate revenues. \nThat is the heart and soul of what we want to do.\n\n  How do we do that? As it turns out, by luck, the postal service over \nthe years has overpaid its obligation to the Federal Employees \nRetirement System by a lot, it turns out by about $11 billion. There is \nno argument; they have overpaid the money. The postal service is owed \nthat money by the Federal Employees Retirement System. The postal \nservice wishes to take that money and use that money in two ways: one, \nto incentivize about 100,000 postal employees who are eligible to \nretire, to retire; not fire them, not lay them off, but say, look, if \nyou will retire, here is another $25,000 or if you are close to \nretirement, here is some credit, but we want you to retire.\n  Second, the postal service has more mail processing centers than they \nneed. A couple of years ago they had maybe 600 or so. Today they have a \nfew less than 500. They want to get down to about 325 over the next \nyear or two. That would be almost cutting in half the number of mail \nprocessing centers around the country. They do not need them, given the \nvolume of mail today. They need mail processing centers, but not as \nmany as they have.\n  When the postal service closes another 150 or so mail processing \ncenters, some people will not be able to work at those mail processing \ncenters, but the postal service is saying, we will find you other jobs. \nYou can be a letter carrier or work in another part of the postal \nservice. You will not get fired. But we want to encourage those \neligible to retire to retire.\n  The Service also wants to take most of that Federal Employees \nRetirement System money to pay down their debt to the Treasury. Right \nnow, they have gone on a $15 billion line of credit. The postal service \nwants to take most of their Federal Employees Retirement System \nreimbursement and pay off that debt.\n  Another thing they wish to do, that a lot of folks around here are \nreal concerned about, is to close some post offices. There is the fear \nthat maybe as many as 3,000 or 4,000 post offices. In rural places \naround the country, maybe the post office is the center of the town. \nFolks are concerned their post office will be closed and people will be \nleft without postal service. As it turns out, that will not be the \ncase.\n  What the postal service is going to do under our bill is to say to \ncommunities across the country, we want to offer you a menu of options. \nWe want to offer you a menu of options for different communities, and \namong that menu of options we want to offer to those communities are \nthese:\n\n[[Page S2806]]\n\n  No. 1, we are not going to close your post office. We will keep your \npost office open, but in a place where we are paying the people \n$50,000, $60,000, $70,000 a year to run a post office that sells \n$15,000 worth of stamps, that doesn't make sense. So if the postmaster \nis eligible to retire, we want to incentivize that postmaster to \nretire. Let him go off and get his pension, get his benefits, and he \ncould still come back to work on a part-time basis, maybe 2 or 4 or 6 \nhours a day, and run the post office in that community. If that is what \nthe community wants, that is what they would get.\n  Some communities might prefer to put the post office in the \nsupermarket or the local drugstore or a convenience store, where it is \nopen not just a few hours a day but open 24/7, maybe. That would be an \noption for the community. Some communities may have a townhall and some \nother State and local businesses that could collocate those with the \npost office and put them all under one roof and everybody would save \nsome money. So they could share some space.\n  Another option for some places, maybe Minnesota--we have rural letter \ncarriers in the southern part of Delaware--we could offer people the \nopportunity for rural mail delivery. They wouldn't have to come in to \ntown to collect their mail in a post office. It would be delivered to \nwherever they live. The idea is to say to folks in communities that \nmight be adversely affected, you pick from among this menu of options, \nfigure out what works for you. Even vote by mail and pick their \nfavorite choice.\n  So rightsizing the enterprise, reducing the head count, reducing the \nnumber of mail processing centers further by another third, and, \nfinally, ways to provide more cost-effective mail service in \ncommunities across the country, though not the heart and soul of what \nwe are trying to do, they are very important.\n  Let me mention one or two others, if I could. The postal service pays \ntwice for health care for their retirees. I will say that again. The \npostal service pays twice for the health care of their retirees. They \npay under Medicare and they pay under the Federal Employees Health \nBenefit Plan. Twice. The employees don't get the full benefit of that \nmoney, the postal service certainly doesn't get the full benefit of \nthat money. Most companies in this country--big companies and small \nones--when their employees retire, a lot of times will continue to \nprovide health care benefits for them until the age of 65. Then at age \n65, the company will say to the retiree, we want you to get your \nprimary Medicare, your primary source of health care, and we will \nprovide a wraparound, your Medigap program, to fill in the gaps for \nyou. That is how a lot of companies do it. My wife retired from DuPont. \nWhen she turns 65--in about another 30 years, well, maybe a little \nsooner than that--Medicare will be her primary source of health care \nand the company will provide a wraparound for Medigap. What the post \noffice wishes to do is have a similar type of opportunity. In the end, \nI think the retirees will benefit, the postal service will benefit, and \nthe taxpayers, I think, arguably would benefit. Those are a couple of \nthings that are in our legislation.\n  Did we pass a perfect bill? By no means. By no means. As I said \nearlier, there are some things in the bill I don't like. And I hope we \ncan make the bill better in conference. In order to get to conference \nwith the House, the House has to pass a bill. It is not enough for the \nHouse to criticize what we have done. We say, what have you done? As it \nturns out, so far, not much--at least in terms of passing a bill and \nbeing able to appoint conferees and see what we can work out here. My \nhope is they will do that.\n  My hope is they will do that sooner rather than later, so we can stop \nsaying, well, the postal service lost $45 million today. They did that \nyesterday and they are going to do it tomorrow. That is not \nsustainable. That is not sustainable. They need to be put in a position \nwhere they can be successful. We can help them get there. And to the \nextent the postal service becomes vibrant and solvent, they can support \nthe 7 or 8 million jobs that are tied to and interconnected with the \npostal service.\n  With that, Mr. President, I bid you adieu, and I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Tribute to Rudolfo Anaya\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, it is good to see the \nPresiding Officer in the chair today and to know that Alaska is well \nrepresented having the Senator from Alaska in the chair and presiding \nover the Senate. I very much appreciate that.\n  I come to the floor to commend one of New Mexico's most celebrated \nauthors, Rudolfo Anaya. This year marks the 40th anniversary of \nProfessor Anaya's acclaimed novel ``Bless Me, Ultima.''\n  This beloved book is an iconic part of Chicano literary history. It \nhas been read by thousands of high school and college students, as well \nas the general public. It tells the story of a young boy growing up in \na small New Mexico town during World War II. ``Bless Me, Ultima'' is a \nclassic portrait of Chicano culture in a particular time and place, but \nit also resonates with universal themes: the search for identity, the \nconflict between good and evil.\n  Literature expands our horizons. It increases our understanding. As \nPresident Kennedy said, ``Art establishes the basic human truths which \nmust serve as the touchstone of our judgment.''\n  For 40 years, Rudolfo Anaya's work has explored the human condition. \nThe University of New Mexico organized a reading marathon to \ncommemorate the publication of ``Bless Me, Ultima,'' and I was pleased \nto take part.\n  Rudolfo Anaya was born in 1937 in the small New Mexico village of \nPastura. He grew up in Santa Rosa and in Albuquerque. When he was only \n16, he suffered a terrible accident. His injuries required years of \nrehabilitation. He has commented on that painful time in his young life \nand how those events affected his sensibilities as a writer.\n  He obtained his B.A. and M.A. from the University of New Mexico. \n``Bless me, Ultima,'' in 1972, was his debut novel. It was the \nbeginning of a remarkable literary career. He is also the author of \n``Tortuga,'' ``Zia Summer,'' and ``Albuquerque,'' among many other \nworks. He was a professor of English at the University of New Mexico \nfrom 1974 until his retirement in 1993. Professor Anaya was awarded the \nNational Medal of Arts in 2001. He received the award for his \n``exceptional contribution to contemporary American literature that has \nbrought national recognition to Chicano traditions, and for his efforts \nto promote Hispanic writers.''\n  Rudolfo Anaya has been a prolific writer and a dedicated teacher. He \nhas made a lasting contribution to American arts and letters. I am \npleased to congratulate him on the 40th anniversary of ``Bless Me, \nUltima,'' and I wish him the very best in his future endeavors.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Violence Against Women Act\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the importance of the \npassage of the Violence Against Women Act. As a husband and as a father \nof three young daughters, this issue is especially personal to me. This \npiece of legislation provides extremely valuable Federal resources to \nhelp victims of domestic and sexual violence rebuild their lives. \nWhether it comes in the form of an emergency shelter, legal assistance, \na crisis hotline or advocacy, this bill provides the assistance that \nvictims need, especially in the most vulnerable time.\n  Domestic violence, spousal abuse, and sexual assaults represent \nenormous public policy challenges. Because of\n\n[[Page S2807]]\n\nthe very personal nature of these crimes, it can be extremely difficult \nfor victims to come forward to get the help they need, let alone call \nout those who have committed these heinous crimes. But since this bill \nwas first enacted, the annual incidence of domestic violence continues \nto drop. Additionally, domestic violence reporting has dramatically \nincreased and victims are receiving lifesaving assistance to help them \nmove forward with their lives.\n  In my home State of Colorado, we continue to make great progress \nreducing the number of domestic and sexual assaults that occur, but we \nmust continue to do more.\n  In 2010, the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control \npublished a report which estimated that 451,000 women in Colorado were \nvictims of rape in their lifetime. It also estimated that 897,000 \nColorado women were victims of sexual violence other than rape in their \nlifetime. That same report said 505,000 men had been victims of sexual \nviolence in their lifetime. These statistics are staggering in my view, \nand they make the case for why we had to pass this bill and continue to \nstrengthen the programs that provide lifesaving services.\n  The Violence Against Women Act also includes invaluable programs to \ncoordinate community efforts to respond to incidents of domestic and \nsexual violence by training police officers, judges, and other members \nof the criminal justice system. The legal system in our country is \nalready stretched so thin. The resources provided by this bill will \nhelp law enforcement and court officials track down and bring to \njustice those who commit these crimes.\n  In my opinion, we can't do enough to get these criminals off the \nstreets. For instance, we need to ensure that we support protection and \nprevention services such as training judges and police officers on how \nto identify and respond to abusive situations. We can significantly \ndecrease domestic violence fatalities and the number of displaced \nfamilies if we have better trained officers in our legal system and \nhealth and human services arena.\n  Finally, I wish to thank Chairman Leahy for his tireless efforts to \nmove this critical piece of legislation forward, as well as Senators \nMurray and Klobuchar for their continued leadership on behalf of women \nand children all across the Nation. With a big bipartisan vote today in \nthe Senate, we came together to make sure the Violence Against Women \nAct was passed.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/26/senate-section/article/S2807-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2807-S2809]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. REID.

A former University of Illinois \nSpringfield professor, Dr. Mattilou Sexton Catchpole, passed away at \nthe age of 88.\n  Mattilou was born on Halloween day in Chicago, IL, but grew up in \nTexarkana, AR. Her parents gave her a strong moral background and an \nappreciation for justice. As active participants in the Arkansas civil \nrights movement, they taught her that social justice, equitable \neducational opportunities, and equal rights for all were of the utmost \nimportance.\n  She enlisted in the Air Force during World War II and served as a \nmedical technician stateside. While post-traumatic stress disorder was \nnot categorized as a medical condition, Mattilou knew that many of the \nreturning soldiers experienced hell. She soon realized that quiet \nconversations and a caring touch helped to heal the wounds that she \ncouldn't see.\n  Still caring for others, she first became a registered nurse and then \na certified registered nurse anesthetist, or CRNA. While raising three \nchildren and suffering from sometimes debilitating back pain, she \nworked as a CRNA at the Cleveland Clinic and obtained bachelor's and \nmaster's degrees at Case Western Reserve University.\n  She came to my hometown of Springfield, IL, to teach at the \nuniversity in 1978, and in no time finished her doctorate in health \neducation from Southern Illinois University at Carbondale. Dr. \nCatchpole became the director of the Nurse Anesthesia Program and Nurse \nAnesthesia Completion Program in Springfield. She spent the rest of her \nlife teaching at the university and writing.\n  At the age of 78, Dr. Catchpole was named the 2002 Kayaker of the \nYear by the Missouri Whitewater Association. Physical fitness and the \noutdoors were very important to her. It was swimming that enabled her \nto build the strength and leave behind a full-body cast that doctors \nthought she would wear for most of her adult life because of back pain. \nIn 2006, at the age of 82, Mattilou was one of 18 recipients of the \nPresident's Call to Service Awards for over 5,000 hours of service with \nHealth Volunteers Overseas. You could always rely on Mattilou to lend a \nhelping hand to someone in need or to teach a person all that she knew \nabout a subject.\n  I offer my deepest condolences to her family, her brother, U.A. \nGarred Sexton; her three children, Julia Ann, Nancy, and Floyd; and her \neight grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren. Mattilou's passing \nis a deep loss for so many, but her hard work, accomplishments, and \nstudents will continue to carry on.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/26/senate-section/article/S2809-5", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2809-S2810]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO MAYOR CHARLES LONG\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to my good friend \nMr. Charles Long, the longtime mayor of Booneville, KY. Mr. Long has \nserved as mayor of this small Owsley County town for 53 years. During \nhis tenure, he has worked to provide a better life for the citizens of \nBooneville by providing exceptional opportunities for various daily \nimprovements, as well as working to make vital amenities more easily \naccessible to all.\n  One of the most significant accomplishments of Mayor Long's time in \noffice has to do with developments he oversaw in the area of water and \nsanitation. The mayor oversaw the installation of the town's water and \nsewer system in 1968. Afterwards, he went on to guarantee that over 98 \npercent of Owsley County had access to the water system and worked to \nsee the sewage system expanded to over 400 residents in the county.\n  Mayor Long serves on the Kentucky River Area Development Committee--\nKRADD. The mayor's home county of Owsley is one of the eight counties \nin eastern Kentucky that KRADD supervises. The organization has been a \nmajor force in further developing the rural areas of eastern Kentucky, \nand Mayor Long is an integral part of that process.\n  Besides the hard work Mayor Long does for the people of Booneville, \nhe is known for being a beloved and involved member of his large \nfamily. His children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren are all \nvery proud of him and all he has accomplished.\n  Sadly, Charles recently lost the love of his life and wife of 72 \nyears, Virginia Ruth Long. Mrs. Long passed away on March 27, 2012, at \nthe age of 92. During a recent session of the Kentucky State Senate, \nshe was honored by a Senate Resolution commemorating her life and \naccomplishments. I know Mayor Long surely appreciated that gesture.\n  Charles Long has literally spent the majority of his life serving the \nlocal people of Booneville as their mayor. He is able to look back at \nhis long and successful career and reminisce on the countless \nimprovements he has put in place for the city he holds dear to his \nheart. Mr. Charles Long exhibits a commendable display of \ncharacteristics such as dedication, kindheartedness, and reliability \nwhich set him apart as a true hometown hero.\n  I am honored to stand on the floor of the U.S. Senate today in \ntribute to Mayor Charles Long's service to the town of Booneville and \nthe Commonwealth of Kentucky. And I ask my Senate colleagues to join me \nin expressing recognition to Mayor Long for his long and fruitful \ntenure in office.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would like to call the attention of my \ncolleagues to a column published in the April 23rd edition of The \nWashington Post by Dr. Henry Kissinger and retired GEN Brent Scowcroft. \nThese are two of the most respected voices on nuclear strategy, \ndeterrence, and arms control, and they both recently testified on the \nNew START treaty.\n  The article, titled ``Strategic Stability in Today's Nuclear World,'' \ncomes at an important time. The President, we know, has tasked his \nadvisors to conduct an assessment of our nuclear forces and strategy to \ninform future arms reductions beyond the levels established by the New \nSTART treaty. The administration is said to be considering reductions \nthat could lead to as few as 300 warheads, which would require rather \nsignificant changes to long-standing U.S. nuclear doctrine.\n  Dr. Kissinger and General Scowcroft warn that:\n\n       Before momentum builds on that basis, we feel obliged to \n     stress our conviction that the\n\n[[Page S2810]]\n\n     goal of future negotiations should be strategic stability and \n     that lower numbers of weapons should be a consequence of \n     strategic analysis, not an abstract preconceived \n     determination.\n\n  In fact, the authors go on to warn the reader that:\n\n       Strategic stability is not inherent with low numbers of \n     nuclear weapons; indeed, excessively low numbers could lead \n     to a situation in which surprise attacks are conceivable.\n\n  This short column should be required reading for all of my \ncolleagues, and the eight key criteria listed by the authors, to govern \nnuclear weapons policy, should become the basis for our consideration \nof nuclear strategy and arms control moving forward.\n  I want to express my deep appreciation to Dr. Kissinger and General \nScowcroft for their important contributions to our ongoing debates \nabout nuclear weapons and, more broadly, for their decades of service \nto our country.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the article printed in \nthe Record at the end of my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, April 23, 2012]\n\n              Strategic Stability In Today's Nuclear World\n\n              (By Henry A. Kissinger and Brent Scowcroft)\n\n       A New START treaty reestablishing the process of nuclear \n     arms control has recently taken effect. Combined with \n     reductions in the U.S. defense budget, this will bring the \n     number of nuclear weapons in the United States to the lowest \n     overall level since the 1950s. The Obama administration is \n     said to be considering negotiations for a new round of \n     nuclear reductions to bring about ceilings as low as 300 \n     warheads. Before momentum builds on that basis, we feel \n     obliged to stress our conviction that the goal of future \n     negotiations should be strategic stability and that lower \n     numbers of weapons should be a consequence of strategic \n     analysis, not an abstract preconceived determination.\n       Regardless of one's vision of the ultimate future of \n     nuclear weapons, the overarching goal of contemporary U.S. \n     nuclear policy must be to ensure that nuclear weapons are \n     never used. Strategic stability is not inherent with low \n     numbers of weapons; indeed, excessively low numbers could \n     lead to a situation in which surprise attacks are \n     conceivable.\n       We supported ratification of the START treaty. We favor \n     verification of agreed reductions and procedures that enhance \n     predictability and transparency. One of us (Kissinger) has \n     supported working toward the elimination of nuclear weapons, \n     albeit with the proviso that a series of verifiable \n     intermediate steps that maintain stability precede such an \n     end point and that every stage of the process be fully \n     transparent and verifiable.\n       The precondition of the next phase of U.S. nuclear weapons \n     policy must be to enhance and enshrine the strategic \n     stability that has preserved global peace and prevented the \n     use of nuclear weapons for two generations.\n       Eight key facts should govern such a policy:\n       First, strategic stability requires maintaining strategic \n     forces of sufficient size and composition that a first strike \n     cannot reduce retaliation to a level acceptable to the \n     aggressor.\n       Second, in assessing the level of unacceptable damage, the \n     United States cannot assume that a potential enemy will \n     adhere to values or calculations identical to our own. We \n     need a sufficient number of weapons to pose a threat to what \n     potential aggressors value under every conceivable \n     circumstance. We should avoid strategic analysis by mirror-\n     imaging.\n       Third, the composition of our strategic forces cannot be \n     defined by numbers alone. It also depends on the type of \n     delivery vehicles and their mix. If the composition of the \n     U.S. deterrent force is modified as a result of reduction, \n     agreement or for other reasons, a sufficient variety must be \n     retained, together with a robust supporting command and \n     control system, so as to guarantee that a preemptive attack \n     cannot succeed.\n       Fourth, in deciding on force levels and lower numbers, \n     verification is crucial. Particularly important is a \n     determination of what level of uncertainty threatens the \n     calculation of stability. At present, that level is well \n     within the capabilities of the existing verification systems. \n     We must be certain that projected levels maintain--and when \n     possible, reinforce--that confidence.\n       Fifth, the global nonproliferation regime has been weakened \n     to a point where some of the proliferating countries are \n     reported to have arsenals of more than 100 weapons. And these \n     arsenals are growing. At what lower U.S. levels could these \n     arsenals constitute a strategic threat? What will be their \n     strategic impact if deterrence breaks down in the overall \n     strategic relationship? Does this prospect open up the risk \n     of hostile alliances between countries whose forces \n     individually are not adequate to challenge strategic \n     stability but that combined might overthrow the nuclear \n     equation?\n       Sixth, this suggests that, below a level yet to be \n     established, nuclear reductions cannot be confined to Russia \n     and the United States. As the countries with the two largest \n     nuclear arsenals, Russia and the United States have a special \n     responsibility. But other countries need to be brought into \n     the discussion when substantial reductions from existing \n     START levels are on the international agenda.\n       Seventh, strategic stability will be affected by other \n     factors, such as missile defenses and the roles and numbers \n     of tactical nuclear weapons, which are not now subject to \n     agreed limitations. Precision-guided large conventional \n     warheads on long-range delivery vehicles provide another \n     challenge to stability. The interrelationship among these \n     elements must be taken into account in future negotiations.\n       Eighth, we must see to it that countries that have relied \n     on American nuclear protection maintain their confidence in \n     the U.S. capability for deterrence. If that confidence \n     falters, they may be tempted by accommodation to their \n     adversaries or independent nuclear capabilities.\n       Nuclear weapons will continue to influence the \n     international landscape as part of strategy and an aspect of \n     negotiation. The lessons learned throughout seven decades \n     need to continue to govern the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/26/senate-section/article/S2810-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2810]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 PASSAGE OF THE EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, the following statement is from Senator \nBirch Bayh in honor of the 40th anniversary of Congressional passage of \nthe Equal Rights Amendment:\n\n       Recent events have seen an assault on those who provide \n     health care services to women and we have even seen questions \n     raised anew about issues like contraception. It may have been \n     40 years since we passed the ERA in Congress but the reasons \n     why many of us tried to write women's rights into the \n     Constitution are still with us today.\n       As the Chief Senate Sponsor and floor leader of the Equal \n     Rights Amendment, I remember well the intensity of the battle \n     we fought in the early 1970's. America's history has been a \n     steady expansion of individual rights, beginning with the \n     expansion of the franchise in our early years. From the \n     rights of former slaves after the Civil War to the expansion \n     of the vote for women and then for 18 year olds, we have \n     codified in our Constitution an ongoing commitment to \n     individual rights. It seemed fitting then, and seems fitting \n     now, that our Constitution speak loudly and clearly that the \n     law allow no discrimination on the basis of gender.\n       While the principles involved in this battle remain, the \n     country has evolved quite a bit since 1972. In 1972 there \n     were 2 women in the U.S. Senate and 13 in the House of \n     Representatives. Now there are 17 women Senators and 75 \n     Congresswomen. There were no female Governors in 1972 and had \n     been only 3 in all our history before that, there are 6 now. \n     We have had a female Speaker of the House and have scores of \n     CEOs, business owners and leaders in all walks of life who \n     are female. The number of women elected to state legislatures \n     across the country is larger than ever before. The number of \n     women in the military cannot be compared to the numbers 40 \n     years ago. And in a recent issue of Newsweek, long-time \n     Supreme Court reporter Nina Totenberg spoke about taking the \n     job at NPR in the 70s because the pay was too low for men to \n     want the job.\n       There has indeed been progress, but the principles remain \n     the same. To open the sports pages in the morning is to see \n     female athletes in a number of sports. To watch the \n     television news in the evening has us watching many female \n     anchor persons, weather ladies, and sports announcers. Even \n     the major sports telecasts regularly involve on-air female \n     broadcasters. But is there equal pay for equal work today? \n     Are there still obstacles on the professional paths to \n     boardrooms for women? Is sexual harassment still a prominent \n     issue in offices around America and in our military?\n       It is still fitting in the 21st century for our nation to \n     include in its basic law the principle that discrimination \n     based on sex has no place in American life. It is fitting for \n     our daughters and granddaughters to be reminded that their \n     parents and grandparents took a stand to protect their \n     futures and to ensure that they have an equal place in modern \n     America.\n       In closing, let me stress that the ERA is still the right \n     thing to do, not only in principle but in every day practice. \n     Thank you for your continued, dedicated efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/26/senate-section/article/S2810-2", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2810-S2811]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          RECOGNIZING THE GREATER BRIDGEPORT YOUTH ORCHESTRAS\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, today I commend the Greater Bridgeport \nYouth Orchestras, GBYO, as it celebrates its 50th anniversary this \nyear. This legendary local group currently at a membership of 250 \nstudents of all ages from 29 different communities around the city of \nBridgeport, who participate in 5 different ensembles--has bestowed the \ngift of great music and mentorship to the State of Connecticut. Through \nthe platform of an orchestra, these young musicians have learned how to \nsupport each\n\n[[Page S2811]]\n\nother. They listen closely while others shine as well as play as an \nensemble, producing thrilling fortissimos that echo in audiences' \nhearts long after the final note.\n  While maintaining a high level of musicianship through competitive \nauditions, the GBYO provides an invaluable experience--an alternative \nto joining a sports team--for students who love music. Its members can \nfeel camaraderie, learn teamwork, and come to understand the value of \nweekly group rehearsals and daily practice.\n  I applaud the GBYO for its goal of providing a supportive environment \nwhere lifelong friendships are formed, mentorship thrives, and students \nfeel safe to express their emotions and connect through passionate \nmusic. This sensitivity is rare and precious. GBYO combines the \ndevelopment of emotional intelligence and social skills with the \nprinciples of hard work and diligence. These young musicians are \ntalented, smart, well-rounded, and, best of all, excited.\n  In March, the GBYO celebrated its landmark anniversary with a gala \nalumni concert at the University of Bridgeport, conducted by GBYO's \nmusic director, Christopher Hisey, who is an alumnus of the orchestra. \nHe led a stirring and inspiring alumni ensemble piece to finish the \ntremendous concert. I congratulate executive director Barbara Upton and \nmusic director Christopher Hisey, for their leadership.\n  I wish the Greater Bridgeport Youth Orchestras continued success and \nhope this well-regarded organization can serve as a role model, \ninspiring others to preserve and perpetuate the long tradition of the \narts and the importance it holds for our culture and society.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/26/senate-section/article/S2811-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2811]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 2011 CONNECTICUT WOMEN'S HALL OF FAME\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 2011 \nConnecticut Women's Hall of Fame inductees and their contributions to \nthe recent history of the State of Connecticut and our Nation.\n  In the spirit of preserving the often untold accomplishments of \nimpactful leaders from Connecticut, each year the Connecticut Women's \nHall of Fame publicly honors several women, living or deceased, to \nshare their stories, preserve their legacies, and update and equalize \nthe history that is taught to our children. The Connecticut Women's \nHall of Fame has created and maintained a remarkable space, free of \ncharge, where the utmost respect can be paid to women who have made \nimmeasurable impacts to our daily lives.\n  On October 25, 2011, at the 18th Annual Induction Ceremony and \nCelebration ``Women of Influence: Creating Social Change''--Isabelle M. \nKelley, Denise Lynn Nappier, and Patricia Wald were inducted. These \nthree women are trailblazers, taking on various leadership positions in \ngovernment while breaking through stagnant stereotypes and archaic \ntraditions.\n  Isabelle M. Kelley devoted her passion for societal transformation, \ndrive to accomplish, and energetic entrepreneurship to the problem of \nfood shortages faced by our country's most impoverished families. Ms. \nKelley was born in Connecticut in 1917 and remained there throughout \nher high school and college years, attending Simsbury High School and \nthe University of Connecticut. Upon graduation in 1938 with an \neconomics degree, she was asked to join the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture as an economist to examine food purchasing trends, which \ninspired a life-long interest in our country's food supply. In this \ncapacity, she was the first to publicly link malnourishment in children \nto limited school achievement. She was asked by President Kennedy to \nserve on a task force to realize a national food stamp program. In \n1964, she authored the Food Stamp Act and was appointed as the first \nDirector of the Food Stamp Division of the USDA. It was the first time \nany woman directed a national social program at the USDA and led any \ntype of consumer affairs or marketing division in any Federal agency.\n  Ms. Kelley passed away in 1997, but students of public health and \nnutrition can listen to and read transcripts of her oral history \nproject by Harvard University's Schlesinger Library, whose aim was to \ncapture the voices of 38 women ``who had achieved positions of high \nrank in the federal government during the middle decades of the \ntwentieth century.'' In 2011, she was invited into the USDA's Hall of \nHeroes.\n  The Honorable Denise Lynn Nappier, now serving her fourth term as \nConnecticut's first female State treasurer and first elected statewide \nofficial, and the country's first African American female State \ntreasurer, can serve as a role model to women around the country who \nstrive to impact the field of financial regulation. Born in 1951 in \nHartford, Treasurer Nappier ran for city treasurer in 1989. After \nworking 10 years to engender Hartford's financial development, she won \nthe position of State treasurer. She made visits to schools around the \nState, teaching students how to save and budget--paving the way for \nsuccess in their finances as adults. The Connecticut Women's Hall of \nFame joins other esteemed organizations that have honored Treasurer \nNappier, including the Girl Scouts of Connecticut, the Hartford College \nfor Women, the National Association of Minority and Women Law Firms, \nthe Government Finance Officers Association, and the National Political \nCongress of Black Women.\n  The Honorable Patricia Wald has dedicated her career to public \nservice and the law, retiring from her seat as the first female judge \nfor the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to \nserve on the International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague. Born in 1928 \nin the city of Torrington, she went on to attend law school at Yale \nUniversity as one of only 11 women in her graduating class. Judge Wald \nwas motivated to go into government service by the possibilities of \nsocial reform, especially addressing issues concerning poverty and \ncriminal justice. In 1964, she was nominated by President Johnson to \nthe President's Commission on Crime in Washington, DC. After serving \nthe Carter administration as Assistant Attorney General for Legislative \nAffairs, she was appointed to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals of the \nDistrict of Columbia in 1979, where she served for 20 years, eventually \nas chief judge. Since her retirement from the bench, she has been asked \nto join several commissions and task forces, including President Bush's \nCommission on Intelligence Capabilities of the United States Regarding \nWeapons of Mass Destruction and the Constitution Project's Guantanamo \nTask Force. Most recently, she has served on the advisory board of the \nCoalition for the International Criminal Court. I join those who have \nhonored Judge Wald, including members of the International Human Rights \nLaw Group, the American Lawyer Hall of Fame, and the American Bar \nAssociation, in celebrating her commitment to the law, especially in \nprotecting our country's most vulnerable.\n  I know my colleagues will join me in honoring these remarkable women, \nwho weathered criticism and risked public failure to inspire current \nand upcoming public servants and to better the lives of future \ngenerations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/26/senate-section/article/S2811-2", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2811-S2812]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 2011 CONNECTICUT VETERANS HALL OF FAME\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 2011 \ninductees of the Connecticut Veterans Hall of Fame, a nonprofit \norganization that honors men and women from Connecticut who have served \ntheir communities in commendable ways since retiring from the military. \nStarting in 2005, when established by Executive Order, the Connecticut \nVeterans Hall of Fame has selected at least 10 inductees each year: men \nand women from Connecticut who, even after their great sacrifices as \nActive members of our military, have chosen to continue their service \nin innovative ways to contribute to the lives of current enlistees, \nfellow veterans, and civilians.\n  These local heroes were celebrated at an induction ceremony \nsurrounded by their family and friends this past December attended by \nLieutenant Governor Nancy Wyman and the Connecticut Department of \nVeterans Affairs Commissioner Linda Schwartz. I would like to join \nLieutenant Governor Wyman and Commissioner Schwartz and formally \nrecognize Samuel Beamon, Sr., Rev. Dr. G. Kenneth Carpenter, Richard \nRampone, Ronald Catania, Burke Ross, John Chiarella, Phillip Kraft, \nRonald Perry, Dr. Madelon Baranoski, and Harold Farrington, Jr.\n\n[[Page S2812]]\n\n  Several of these 2011 inductees are well-loved for touching their \ncommunities through a wide range of public leadership initiatives. \nSamuel Beamon, Sr., Rev. Dr. G. Kenneth Carpenter, and Richard Rampone \nserved in Vietnam in the U.S. Marine Corps. Samuel Beamon, Sr. was \nhonored for his exceptional work with the Young Marines Program in \nWaterbury, CT and as past commandant of the Department of Connecticut \nMarine Corps League, as well as his esteemed legacy as lieutenant of \nthe Waterbury Police Department. Rev. Dr. G. Kenneth Carpenter has been \nrecognized as a constant source of spiritual guidance as pastor of the \nUnion Baptist Church in Mystic; in addition, he is founder and \npresident of the Mystic Area Shelter and Hospitality, MASH, which gives \ntemporary shelter and counseling to families--especially those with \nchildren--who are struggling in this tough economy. Richard Rampone, \nwho worked to protect his community as Patrolman for the Berlin Police \nDepartment, is the State commandant of the Marine Corps League \nDepartment of Connecticut, whose mission is to assist marines entering \ncivilian life.\n  Many of our honorees participate in more than one organization, \ndedicating a vast amount of time to helping servicemembers and \nveterans. Ronald Catania, who served in the U.S. Air Force in Vietnam, \nhas given countless hours to numerous groups, including the Connecticut \nPolice Chiefs Association, Connecticut Veterans Memorial, Connecticut \nNational Guard during the Hurricane Katrina disaster, the American Red \nCross, and the Special Olympics. On September 11, he worked the day \nafter the attacks to transport donated goods to Ground Zero for \nemergency responders. Burke Ross, who served in the U.S. Marine Corps \nduring World War II, has been a fervent supporter and participant of \nthe Military Order of the Purple Heart, MOPH, volunteers at the West \nHaven VA Medical Facility, and for the past 25 years has planned the \nannual Memorial Day Services and Parade in the Derby-Shelton area; in \n2001, he was selected as the Disabled American Veteran, DAV, of the \nYear for his more than 30 years as an officer and then chaplain to his \nlocal DAV chapter.\n  The civic dedication of a number of these inductees spans decades. \nJohn Chiarella, who served in the U.S. Army in Korea and Vietnam, has \nspent 10 years ensuring that Waterbury-area students have an education \nin our patriotic traditions, including developing a program called \nForever Wave, whose mission is to instruct on the flag salute. He is \nalso is known for his role as chairman of the Waterbury Veterans \nMemorial Committee. U.S. Army veteran Phillip Kraft has been a voice \nfor veterans' benefits as an instructor at the International Union, \nUnited Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implement Workers of \nAmerica, UAW, annual conference. Also, for many years, Mr. Kraft has \nwatched over burial services and maintained the upkeep of the Spring \nGrove Cemetery in Darian, where approximately 1,500 veterans have been \nlaid to rest, and also takes the lead as CEO of the National Veterans \nServices Fund. Honoree Ronald Perry, who served in the U.S. Marine \nCorps in Vietnam, has been a solid support system for the Meriden, CT, \nMarine community, speaking out on behalf of several veterans \nassociations, including the Marine Corps League of Meriden, and \narranging the birthday celebrations of Meriden-area Marine Corps \nveterans.\n  The remaining two Connecticut veterans honored in 2011, Dr. Madelon \nBaranoski and Harold Farrington, have used the skills and experiences \nthey developed in a professional capacity to positively affect the \nmilitary and veterans communities of Connecticut. After serving in \nVietnam in the U.S. Army Nurse Corps, Dr. Baranoski has compiled \nresearch on the physiological consequences of stress to foster greater \nunderstanding about the mental conditions of veterans in our \ncommunities and to help reform the criminal justice system. She is \ncurrently an associate professor of psychiatry and the vice chair of \nthe Human Investigation Committee at Yale University School of \nMedicine. Harold Farrington, Jr., has spent 30 years helping veterans \nand their families navigate the bureaucracy and reap the benefits of \ngovernment programs as an employee of the U.S. Department of Veterans \nAffairs. In an article for New London's The Day, Mr. Farrington \ncandidly captured the emotions he felt as a 2011 Connecticut Veterans \nHall of Fame Inductee: Having dedicated his life to service, he \nacknowledged that ``to know my work is being recognized is very \nrewarding.''\n  I hope this honor from the State of Connecticut will start to reflect \nand manifest the pride felt by the family, friends, and fellow veterans \nof these inductees. It gives me great pride to laud these courageous \nand selfless individuals who have not hesitated to serve and sacrifice \nin and out of uniform. To them, I say with gratitude: Today, your \ncountry publicly recognizes your contributions and deep, heartfelt \ncommitment to our U.S. veterans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/26/senate-section/article/S2812-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2812]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NATIONAL INFERTILITY AWARENESS WEEK\n\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, building a family is an exciting \nmilestone in the lives of millions of American families. Unfortunately, \nthe road towards conceiving a child is often difficult and painful for \nthe nearly 7 million Americans diagnosed with the disease of \ninfertility.\n  This week, men and women across the country will share their stories \nduring National Infertility Awareness Week. This movement, organized by \nRESOLVE: The National Infertility Association, brings attention to the \ndisease of infertility and encourages the public to take charge of \ntheir reproductive health. Let me take this opportunity to commend \nRESOLVE for its work providing community and giving voice to women and \nmen experiencing infertility.\n  Over the last few decades, significant medical advancements, such as \nin vitro fertilization, have provided a solution for some would be \nparents. However, the high cost to undergo infertility care often poses \nan additional barrier for couples to overcome. It costs more than \n$12,000 for a couple to undergo one cycle of infertility treatment, and \ninsurance coverage is often dismal. For some patients, multiple cycles \nare required to achieve a successful pregnancy outcome. Federal \nGovernment insurance plans do not specifically cover infertility \ntreatments, and only 15 States offer any level of coverage.\n  I have introduced a bill that would alleviate some of the costs \nassociated with infertility care. The Family Act, S. 965 creates a \nFederal tax credit for individuals who are diagnosed with infertility \nby a licensed physician. A tax credit will help make this vital patient \ncare more accessible and affordable to those who lack insurance \ncoverage for these services.\n  I hope you will join me during National Infertility Awareness Week \nand become a cosponsor of the Family Act. This is a necessary step \ntowards ensuring that all of our citizens have the ability to raise a \nfamily, without compromising their financial future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/26/senate-section/article/S2812-2", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2812-S2813]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                              LOST AT SEA\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it is with great sadness that I \nspeak in memory of five extraordinary sailors who recently died at sea \nduring a boat race off the coast of California.\n  On Saturday, April 15, the sailing vessel Low Speed Chase was one of \n49 boats participating in the Full Crew Farallones Race, which has been \nrun annually from San Francisco to the Farallon Islands and back since \n1907. As the yacht rounded an island, it was broadsided by huge waves \nand crashed onto the rocks.\n  Three sailors survived and were rescued by the U.S. Coast Guard. \nTragically, the lives of five others--Alexis Busch, Alan Cahill, Jordan \nFromm, Marc Kasanin, and Elmer Morrissey--were lost.\n  Alexis Busch, who as a teenager had been a beloved batgirl for the \nSan Francisco Giants, managed the Ross Valley Swim and Tennis Club and \ncrewed in sailing races from San Francisco Bay to Australia. Her \nlongtime boyfriend and sailing partner, Nick Vos, was one of the \nsurvivors on the Low Speed Chase.\n  Alan Cahill was a married father of two children and a master marine \ncraftsman who served as caretaker for\n\n[[Page S2813]]\n\nmany boats at the San Francisco Yacht Club. Originally from Cork, \nIreland, Alan moved to the Bay Area to pursue his love of racing. He \nwas a talented sailor and good friend, who served as the best man at \nthe wedding of his crewmate, Bryan Chong, one of the three survivors.\n  Jordan Fromm was a lifelong sailor who was a fixture at the San \nFrancisco Yacht Club, where he had been a member since childhood and \nparticipated in its youth sailing programs. Fromm planned to start his \nown yacht restoration business.\n  Marc Kasanin grew up in Belvedere, started sailing at age 5, and \nspent most of his life on the water as a sailor and a nautical artist. \nHis artwork was recently displayed at the Tiburon Art Festival.\n  Elmer Morrissey earned a Ph.D. in energy engineering and worked as a \nsoftware designer at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. In addition \nto sailing, he enjoyed playing music and rugby and writing humorous \nsports blogs.\n  These crew members were some of the Bay Area's best sailors. Their \nloss is a devastating blow to their families, to their friends, to \ntheir crewmates, and to the entire sailing community. At this most \ndifficult time, my heart goes out to them all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/26/senate-section/article/S2813-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2813]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DOROTHY INGHRAM\n\n MRS. BOXER. Mr. President, I am honored to remember the life, \naccomplishments, and service of Dorothy Inghram, a pioneer who was \nCalifornia's first African American school district superintendent and \nSan Bernardino County's first African American school teacher and \nprincipal. Ms. Inghram passed away at her San Bernardino home on March \n14 at the age of 106.\n  Dorothy Inghram was born on November 9, 1905, the youngest of Henry \nand Mary Inghram's seven children. While at San Bernardino Valley \nCollege, Ms. Inghram wrote the school's alma mater and later \ntransferred to Redlands University to complete a bachelor's degree in \nmusic in 1936. She began her teaching career in Texas but later \nreturned to California and accepted a teaching position in the Mill \nSchool District. For the next 3 decades, she devoted her life to \neducation and literacy in the community.\n  Over the years, Ms. Inghram's professional contributions have been \nacknowledged on many occasions, including numerous awards, a city-\nproclaimed Dorothy Inghram Day, and a library named in her honor. Most \nrewarding to her personally, however, were the admiring and grateful \nformer students who credited her with helping them recognize \nundiscovered talents and sparking interests that led to successful \ncareers.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me, and her grateful community in \nhonoring the life and trailblazing legacy of Dorothy Inghram.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/26/senate-section/article/S2813-2", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2813]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO MR. WAYNE R. GRACIE\n\n Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Mr. \nWayne R. Gracie upon his retirement after an outstanding career of 37 \nyears of distinguished civil service to our great Nation.\n  Since 1975, through seven Presidential administrations, Wayne has \nworked with Congress and directly supported the Secretary and Chief of \nStaff of the Air Force, as well as the Chief of the Air Force Reserve. \nHe has worked on logistics, budgets, and legislative interactions--\nturning words into programming actions--that resulted in new Department \nof Defense policies and programs.\n  Wayne excelled at providing both Houses of Congress with new insight \nand understanding of the Air Force Reserve's need to transition from a \nCold War force to the modern force operating around the world today. \nHis efforts resulted in new funding and development of both a \n``strategic reserve'' for surge operations, as well as a cost-effective \n``operational reserve'' for use in daily military missions.\n  In 1997, backed by his credibility and good will on Capitol Hill, \nWayne led the preparation, messaging, and testimony for congressional \nhearings that resulted in the formation of Air Force Reserve Command, \nthe ninth major command in the Air Force. This authorized a three-star \ncommander and energized new Reserve component personnel benefits.\n  After conducting more than 20 years of continual combat operations in \nIraq, Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, Horn of Africa, Libya, and many \nother locations around the globe, the Air Force Reserve's success is \nevident today. Wayne's efforts were critical to presenting, justifying, \nand enacting new legislation supporting Air Force reservists, their \ncivilian employers, and their families who were impacted by increased \nReserve operations. Thanks to his continuous dialogue with Congress, \nreservists now get improved health care, new credits toward retirement, \ninactive duty training travel pay, and post-9/11 G.I. Bill benefits.\n  Also, Wayne was pivotal to facilitating Air Force Reserve testimonies \nbefore the Senate Armed Services Committee and Senate Appropriation \nCommittee that resulted in additional funding for equipment \nmodernization. His efforts directly led to increased combat \neffectiveness as well as improved humanitarian and disaster response \noperations. These updated capabilities were essential to successful \nrelief missions in Japan and Haiti, as well as in the United States for \nHurricanes Katrina and Ivan, for aerial firefighting in the Southwest, \nand for containing the gulf oil spill.\n  Because of Wayne's visionary leadership, planning, and foresight, the \nAir Force, the Department of Defense, and the Nation will long reap the \nbenefits of his tenure at the Pentagon and his work with us here on \nCapitol Hill. It is experienced, dedicated, professional people like \nWayne who make the Department of Defense and Air Force Reserve the \noutstanding institutions that they are today.\n  I thank Wayne for his many years of dedicated service and wish him \nand his wife Candace the very best as they enter retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/26/senate-section/article/S2813-3", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2813-S2814]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECOGNIZING JOHN T. CYR AND SONS, INC.\n\n Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today I wish to offer my \ncongratulations to John T. Cyr and Sons, Inc., on its 100th \nanniversary. This outstanding Maine company demonstrates why family \nbusinesses are so important to our Nation's economy and to communities \nin every State. The determination and vision that led to a century of \nsuccess define America's entrepreneurial spirit.\n  Sometime around 1903, John Thomas Cyr moved his family from Caribou, \nME--my hometown--to Old Town, near Bangor, where he found work in a \nlumber mill. Nine years later, in 1912, at the age of 51, John T. Cyr \nstruck out on his own. Joined by his son, Joseph, they started a livery \nstable and delivery business.\n  What began with horses, buggies, and wagons is today a thriving \nenterprise of 22 luxury motor coaches, 200 schoolbuses, and nearly 250 \nemployees. A company that got its start hauling lumber for a local \ncanoe factory now serves 17 school districts across Maine with an \nexemplary safety record. They offer tours throughout the United States \nand Canada--from New York City at Christmas to Washington, DC, in \ncherry blossom season. As a native of Aroostook County, I know how \nvaluable their daily intercity service is to the towns and cities of \nnorthern Maine.\n  Handed down and nurtured through the generations, this is a true \nfamily business, owned and operated by the founder's grandson, Joe Cyr, \njoined by his brother, Pete, son Mike, and daughter Becky.\n  Their remarkable story of growth, of meeting challenges, and of \ndelivering value was expertly told in a recent article in Maine Trails \nmagazine. I would like to complement that account with my personal \nobservations.\n  Before coming to the Senate, I worked at Husson University in Bangor, \nwhere I had the pleasure of getting to know Joe Cyr, class of 1962, and \nhis wonderful wife Sue, class of 1965. Joe has been a longtime member \nof the Husson Board of Trustees, and Sue has been a volunteer supporter \nof uncommon energy. Joe and Sue's generosity to Husson includes \nsignificant gifts to athletic programs, a new home for the university \npresident, the annual fund, and most recently, the new Cyr Alumni \nCenter. The countless ways they serve--from the Boys Scouts and the Y \nto St. Joseph Hospital--touch people of all ages.\n  People throughout Maine are fortunate to have such a family as the \nCyrs,\n\n[[Page S2814]]\n\nbut I am especially lucky--my summer camp on Cold Stream Pond is just \ndown the road from theirs. As much as I cherish our time together, \nhaving dinner, playing cards, and enjoying the beautiful Maine summer \nevenings, I cherish even more being in the presence of those who give \nso much to others and who see the act of giving as the greatest reward. \nI am delighted to extend my congratulations to the Cyr family in their \nbusiness's centennial year and to thank them for their contributions to \nthe State of Maine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/26/senate-section/article/S2814-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2814]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO TOM MCSWAIN\n\n Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, Leadership North Carolina is an \norganization committed to engaging and informing leaders from across my \nhome State. Today I wish to recognize a constituent who is a leader of \nLeadership North Carolina. Tom McSwain's service to our citizens may be \nrecognized during his term as chairman of the American Traffic Safety \nServices Association from 2004 to 2006, but his leadership skills were \nforged many years before this term and he continues to lead in many \nways. Tom is a native of Macon, GA, and a proud alumnus of the \nUniversity of Georgia, who has a deep love for and commitment to his \nadopted home State of North Carolina. Two sources of strength for Tom \nare his wife Shawn Scott, an alumna of Leadership North Carolina Class \nIX, and his son, Jack.\n  Currently, Tom serves as eastern region director with responsibility \nfor company sales and activities in the Eastern United States, Latin \nand South America with Ennis-Flint. Ennis-Flint is the world's largest \nsupplier of pavement marking materials and is headquartered in Dallas, \nTX.\n  Tom has served in many professional capacities within the highway \nsafety industry. Most prominently, he was chairman of the American \nTraffic Safety Services Association--ATSSA--from 2004 2006. ATSSA is an \ninternational trade association with 1,600 members who manufacture and \ninstall roadway safety devices such as signs, striping, guardrails, \ncrash cushions, and lighting. In this role, he served as the chair of \nthe past chairman's advisory council and as the president-elect of the \nATSSA Foundation, which provides scholarships to children of \nindividuals killed while working on our nation's highways. He is also a \nboard member of the Road Information Program--TRIP.\n  Our State has benefitted from the migration of citizens from all over \nthe country, bringing their creativity and skills to North Carolina. \nTom moved to his newly adopted home of North Carolina in 1997. \nFollowing his service as Chairman of ATSSA, Tom sought to transition \nhis engagement and focus from the national arena to North Carolina.\n  In 2006, Mr. McSwain graduated from Leadership North Carolina as a \nmember of Class XIII, receiving the prestigious Stanley Frank Class \nAward. This award is presented annually in honor of the late Stanley \nFrank, chair of the LNC Founding Committee, who gave his time, talents, \nand resources to make our State a better place to live and to work. Mr. \nFrank was a Greensboro businessman and a civic giant who was one of the \nearliest, and one of the strongest supporters of LNC. Each recipient of \nthis award exemplifies the spirit of Stanley Frank as selected by their \nfellow participants. Tom was the Class XIII recipient, recognized for \nhis demonstrated leadership, which has made a significant improvement \nin the quality of life, economic well-being, and sense of community in \nour State. Upon graduation, Mr. McSwain expanded his commitment to \nLeadership North Carolina, serving as program chair for Class XIV and \njoining the Leadership North Carolina Board of Directors.\n  Elected as chair of Leadership North Carolina in 2010, Tom has \nbrought his considerable leadership experience to strengthen the \norganization during his 2-year tenure. His work has positioned the \nprogram for sustainability for years to come and strengthened its \nreputation among leaders in business, government, education, and \nnonprofits. The measure of a good leader is the legacy he or she leaves \nbehind. Tom McSwain leaves North Carolina with 900 informed and engaged \nleaders to take the baton and help craft our State's future.\n  On June 30 of this year, Tom McSwain will complete his tenure as \nchair of Leadership North Carolina. We need strong, effective leaders \nnow more than ever. Tom's service to Leadership North Carolina has been \nfocused on engaging, challenging, and informing future leaders. I join \nthe Board of Directors of Leadership North Carolina in recognizing Tom \nfor his leadership, vision, and determination.\n  Tom embodies our State's motto Esse Quam Videri, to be rather than to \nseem, and I ask all my colleagues to join me in thanking Tom McSwain \nfor his service to North Carolina.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/26/senate-section/article/S2814-2", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2814]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO DAN LYONS\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I am proud to recognize one \nof Nevada's veterans whose overwhelming sacrifice on behalf of those \nwho served our great Nation is inspiring. As I speak, Mr. Lyons is \ntraveling on foot from his hometown of Reno, NV to our Nation's capital \nto encourage legislators to assist our homeless veterans.\n  This is a serious issue that I have worked on since I was elected to \nCongress. Today, over 100,000 veterans are on America's streets. Many \nhave serious problems and need support. That is why I stand with Mr. \nLyons as he completes his 2,600 mile journey.\n  The brave men and women who served our country and fought to protect \nour freedom are coming back to a struggling economy with few job \nprospects, leaving them unable to afford housing. Our Nation's \nservicemembers have made great sacrifices for our country, and they \ndeserve our gratitude and support. We must welcome them home and help \nthem transition to civilian life. Assisting our Nation's veterans and \nfamilies is of the utmost importance.\n  I am also grateful that Mr. Lyons is raising awareness for an issue \nthat I am personally involved with. Having a family member who serves \nin the Armed Forces, I have always been an advocate for our troops. \nThat is why I proudly cosponsored and voted in support of bipartisan \nlegislation, the VOW to Hire Heroes Act, which was signed into law by \nPresident Obama. This legislation provides a tax credit to employers \nwho hire veterans while also offering education and funding to provide \non-the-job training and employment assistance to veterans. Ensuring our \nreturning soldiers come home to good paying jobs is the least we can do \nand the VOW to Hire Heroes Act helps put our Nation's veterans back to \nwork.\n  Mr. Lyons' selfless efforts to honor and acknowledge our Nation's \nveterans epitomize service over self. I commend Mr. Lyons for his \nsteadfast determination in raising awareness for those who keep us \nsafe. Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Mr. Lyons \nfor his service to our country and commitment to helping veterans in \nneed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/26/senate-section/article/S2814-3", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2814-S2815]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNIZING HOOSIER ESSAY CONTEST WINNERS\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I wish to take the opportunity to \nexpress my congratulations to the winners of the 2011 2012 Dick Lugar/\nIndiana Farm Bureau/Indiana Farm Bureau Insurance Companies Youth Essay \nContest.\n  In 1985, I joined with the Indiana Farm Bureau to sponsor an essay \ncontest for 8th grade students in my home State. The purpose of this \ncontest is to encourage young Hoosiers to recognize and appreciate the \nimportance of Indiana agriculture in their lives and subsequently craft \nan essay responding to the assigned theme. The theme chosen for this \nyear was ``The Role of the Farm in a Healthy Diet.''\n  Along with my friends at the Indiana Farm Bureau and Indiana Farm \nBureau Insurance Companies, I am pleased with the annual response to \nthis contest and the quality of the essays received over the years. I \napplaud each of this year's participants on their thoughtful work and \nwish, especially, to highlight the submissions of the 2011 2012 contest \nwinners--Travis Koester of Wadesville, IN, and Andrea Ledgerwood of \nAngola, IN. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the \ncomplete text of Travis' and Andrea's respective essays and I am \npleased, also, to include the names of the many district and county \nwinners of the contest.\n\n[[Page S2815]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 The Role of the Farm in a Healthy Diet\n\n                          (By Travis Koester)\n\n       Americans talk skinny, but eat fat. What can farmers do to \n     help? American agriculture will feed the world with a safe, \n     abundant, and affordable food supply. This has been our \n     message in recent years. It is time for change. What word is \n     missing? Healthy! Farmers can help Americans through \n     education and making healthier food more available to low \n     income families.\n       Living on a family dairy farm, what can I do? In a country \n     where more than two-thirds of the population is overweight, \n     adult food choices are often made on impulse, not intellect. \n     Americans say they'd like restaurants to offer healthier \n     items, but only 23 percent order those foods, according to \n     research firm Technomic. We must reach the public at a young \n     age. I can encourage teachers to welcome Farm Bureau Ag in \n     the Classroom. These educational programs can influence my \n     generation to eat healthy.\n       However, healthy food generally costs more than unhealthy \n     food. How can we assist those with low incomes? Working with \n     Partners in Food, our family farm donates lean healthy beef \n     to local food banks, providing the underprivileged with \n     nutritious protein. Furthermore, I live in a community with a \n     plethora of gardens. Grandmother alone has four gardens! I \n     will encourage my community to share excess garden items with \n     the poor by using my family farm as a collection point. \n     Neighbors and family can share healthy fruits and vegetables \n     that I can deliver to local food banks promoting agriculture \n     at the same time.\n       It is time for farmers to take action through education and \n     making healthy food more available to the poor. One farmer at \n     a time, we can make a difference and improve the health of \n     our fellow Americans. Will you join me? American agriculture \n     will feed the world with a safe, abundant, affordable, and \n     healthy food supply.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 The Role of the Farm in a Healthy Diet\n\n                         (By Andrea Ledgerwood)\n\n       Indiana farms are crucial to our state's well-being. They \n     provide healthy foods we eat every day, including milk, eggs, \n     corn, and meat. The health of the animals occupying the farms \n     ensures the quality of the food. Indiana farmers take pride \n     in making sure only the healthiest products go to market.\n       On that note, we also get nutrients from these products. \n     Milk from dairy cows can reduce the risk of health issues \n     such as osteoporosis, some cancers, type two diabetes, and \n     obesity to list just a few. It is just rich, cold, delicious, \n     wholesome, fresh milk from our Hoosier dairy farmers who care \n     about us. Hoosier farmers also grow sweet corn in the rich \n     Indiana soil. Sweet corn contains only one gram of fat per \n     ear of corn--that is seven times less fat than name brand \n     granola bars. It also has significantly more vitamin C than \n     most granola bars. Doesn't a crunchy, sweet, flavorful, fun \n     to eat summer treat from our fellow Hoosier farmers sound \n     delicious?\n       If Indiana were to have more farmers' markets in our cities \n     and towns, I believe we could improve our state's average \n     health, including obesity. When we incorporate educational \n     and nutritional values, Hoosiers will soon realize that \n     eating healthy can be easy, affordable, and fun. The Farm \n     Bureau exhibit at the Indiana State Fair is an excellent \n     example of people working together to educate the public \n     about farm safety and the healthiness of homegrown farm \n     products. They have demonstrations, food samples, and very \n     knowledgeable people that care about your health. I believe \n     if we had more of those types of facilities around Indiana, \n     people will be more encouraged to consume the rich, tasty, \n     fresh farm products from our local Hoosier farmers. Don't you \n     agree . . . there's a lot more than corn in Indiana!!\n\n\n                    2011 2012 DISTRICT ESSAY WINNERS\n\n       District 1: Rachel Stoner, Kyle Venditti; District 2: Luke \n     Lashure, Andrea Ledgerwood; District 3: Ross Kindig, Grace \n     Ringer; District 4: Will Harris, Carley Myers; District 5: \n     Bailey Hayes, Jonathan Meredith; District 6: Aiden Foran, \n     Karsyn Gaynor; District 7: Courtney Brown, Sam Ellis; \n     District 8: Elizabeth Field, Brevin Runnebohn; District 9: \n     Halie Klueg, Travis Koester; District 10: Jerry Clayton, Anne \n     Franke.\n\n\n                     2010 2011 COUNTY ESSAY WINNERS\n\n       Adams: Carley Myers and Triston Vetter, Adams Central \n     Middle School.

McMAHON\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, it is with great privilege that I \ncongratulate BG John R. McMahon, division commander of the Northwest \nDivision of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, on his well-deserved \nretirement after a long and successful career serving our country. \nBrigadier General McMahon has been stationed with the Northwest \nDivision since 2009, and my staff and I have had the pleasure of \nworking extensively with him during that time.\n  An example of Brigadier General McMahon's leadership ability was his \nresponse to a storm that caused serious damage to the Howard Hanson Dam \nin King County. The storm raised the flood threat for hundreds of \nthousands of residents in the Green River Valley, which is home to one \nof the largest manufacturing and distribution bases on the west coast. \nBrigadier General McMahon and the Army Corps reacted quickly and \ndecisively to respond and repair right abutment seepage issues and \nother potential failure modes, allowing the facility to return to \nnormal operation in less than three years.\n  During his tenure, Brigadier General McMahon addressed the need to \nreplace three lock gates on the Columbia-Snake River navigation system, \nand that was no small feat. He has also worked extensively to lay the \ngroundwork with the Department of State in preparation for the upcoming \nrenewal of the Columbia River Treaty. Brigadier General McMahon's hard \nwork leaves a strong legacy upon which these important efforts may \nprogress.\n  Additionally, as we all know, the Missouri River system witnessed \nsome of the worst flooding in history in 2011. Under Brigadier General \nMcMahon's leadership, the Army Corps responded quickly and efficiently \nto minimize the threats of rising floodwaters and to answer calls for \nhelp in repairing the extensive damage caused by these floods. For \nthis, so many are grateful. His professionalism and expertise helped \nour Nation through this disaster and undoubtedly lessened the \ndestruction and prevented loss of life.\n  On behalf of all who live in the Pacific Northwest, I thank Brigadier \nGeneral McMahon for his dedication to the safety and well-being of the \npeople of our region. His knowledge, experience, and tireless effort \nwill be sorely missed. Mr. President, I congratulate General McMahon \nand wish him and his family the best of luck in their future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/26/senate-section/article/S2815-2", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2815-S2816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING PAUL SANDOVAL\n\n Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, today I wish to honor a \ngreat Colorado leader and dear friend, Mr. Paul Sandoval. Two days ago, \nPaul passed away after a battle with pancreatic cancer, and I want to \ntake this opportunity to honor his tremendous legacy and express my \nprofound sadness at the loss of my dear friend a man who was the \nconsummate public servant. I knew Paul as a fiercely compassionate \nperson, tough yet kind, and he maintained these qualities throughout \nhis battle with cancer.\n  Paul was a true family man. Known for his modesty and generosity, he \ngave as much to his family and friends as he did to his community and \nthe State of Colorado. But it is not easy to express\n\n[[Page S2816]]\n\njust how much Paul meant to the people of Colorado.\n  He was perhaps most proud of this crowning achievement: being a \ntamale maker. He left an indelible impact on the culinary landscape of \nthe State. I won't be the first or last to say this, but Paul's tamale \nshop, La Casita, makes the best tamales in Denver. People flocked to \nhis restaurant, a landmark in north Denver, not only because of his \ndelicious ``mile high traditional'' tamales but because of the \ncommunity he created for all who visited. For the past four decades, \nanyone seeking fresh tamales and stimulating conversation about \npolitics made a visit to Paul's restaurant.\n  The consummate public servant, Paul was often called the godfather of \nColorado politics. He served the State faithfully as a State senator, a \nmember of the Denver school board, and an adviser to elected officials \nat the local, State and Federal levels. I often relied on Paul's \nguidance, and I feel the loss of his counsel and friendship deeply.\n  I admire Paul because he never let partisanship get in the way of a \ngood idea. As a supporter of Democrats, Republicans, and Independents, \nhe valued a person's character and integrity, not party affiliation. \nGood people make the call to public service worth heeding, and Paul was \none of the best. He embodied the Colorado principle that when you work \ntogether, things get done for the good of Colorado's families. Paul's \nexample inspires my approach to bipartisanship and collaboration in the \nSenate today.\n  Paul's hard-working, entrepreneurial spirit stems from his early life \nand experiences. He started selling the Denver Post at the age of 6 and \nwas delivering groceries for a local market by the eight grade. At that \nyoung age he even tracked down a customer who owed him for a newspaper, \nthen negotiated with the man to pay interest for holding out. His early \ntraining in negotiation paid off for Colorado because Paul became one \nof our State's talented bridge-builders: he formulated commonsense \npublic policy and then brought people together to achieve it.\n  The son of the founder of a meatpacking union, Paul had politics in \nhis blood and was elected to the Colorado State Senate in 1974. In the \nSenate, Paul was a champion of many issues, but education issues held a \nspecial place in his heart and on his agenda. His leadership ensured \nthe passage of Colorado's first bilingual education bill, and he \ncofounded the Chicano Education Project to implement bilingual \ncurricula across the State. Paul furthered his commitment to educating \nColorado's future leaders by later joining the Denver school board, and \nhe personally set up scholarship funds to support undergraduate and \ngraduate students.\n  For all of his work and in recognition of his leadership throughout \nthe State, Paul received awards too numerous to recount here. Most \nrecently, he was awarded the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce of Metro \nDenver's Lifetime Achievement Award. In addition, at this year's \nJefferson Jackson Day Dinner, the Colorado Democratic Party honored him \nwith its Lifetime Achievement Award.\n  My thoughts and prayers are with Paul's beloved wife Paula, his \nchildren, and his family, and I share their profound grief at the loss \nof my dear friend and confidant. But Paul's legacy will endure through \nthe family he cherished, the generations of public servants he \nmentored, and the gift of inspiration he imparted to all of us.\n  I can think of no better way to describe Paul than as authentic, a \nreal believer in what people could do through a good education and hard \nwork, and a man who nourished a better political system the same way he \nnourished us with the best tamales in Denver. Paul Sandoval will be \ndeeply missed but always remembered, for his extraordinary \nspirit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/26/senate-section/article/S2816-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/26/senate-section/article/S2816-2", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and withdrawals which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/26/senate-section/article/S2816-3", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:35 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1038.

A bill to amend the Helium Act to ensure the expedient and \nresponsible draw-down of the Federal Helium Reserve in a manner that \nprotects the interests of private industry, the scientific, medical, \nand industrial communities, commercial users, and Federal agencies, and \nfor other purposes: to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Helium \nStewardship Act of 2012, along with my cosponsors, Senators Barrasso, \nWyden, and Enzi. This bipartisan bill addresses the need for ongoing \nstewardship of the nation's helium reserve in Amarillo, Texas. The \nhelium reserve is not only a domestic treasure, but it also provides \nnearly 30 percent of the world's helium.\n  Helium is a commodity that is frequently overlooked and often only \nconsidered when you are going to the florist to purchase party balloons \nfor your child's birthday party. I want to take a moment and highlight \nthe importance of this commodity, as well as the importance of the U.S. \nhelium reserve in the world's helium market.\n  Helium is critical to a wide range of industrial, scientific, and \nmedical markets, including medical devices such as MRIs, industrial \nwelding, high tech manufacturing of microchips and fiber optic cables, \nmanufacturing magnets for wind turbines, space exploration at NASA, and \nother important scientific research that is conducted at national \nlaboratories like those in my State.\n  The current sales and management structure for the helium reserve is \ndistorting the private helium market and threatening helium supplies \nfor Federal medical and scientific research, and other private \ncommercial applications. The low government sales price is also a \nbarrier to the development of private sources of helium. But more \nimportantly, if Congress does not act, the helium program will \ndisappear altogether in less than three years, leaving our hospitals, \nnational labs, domestic manufacturers, and helium producers high and \ndry.\n  This bipartisan bill will address these issues by authorizing prudent \nhelium sales and management beyond 2015 and securing private access to \nFederal supplies. It will also allow for the continued repayment of the \nnational debt by selling helium at fair market prices--providing a good \nreturn on investment to the American taxpayer. This will bolster the \nprivate helium sector, and help to create long-term jobs in this \nAmerican resource sector, as well as ensure the continued success of \ndomestic manufacturers that utilize helium in their manufacturing \nprocess.\n  Finally, this bill will ensure secure access to helium for our \nnational labs, scientific researchers, NASA, medical institutions, and \nuniversities, who rely on helium to push the boundaries of science and \ntechnology here in the USA. In particular, as the reserve is sold off, \na 15 year supply of helium will be set aside exclusively for Federal \nresearchers to guarantee continuity of our research programs as we \ntransition to purely private sources of helium.\n  The bill is based on stakeholder input of the National Academies of \nScience, Bureau of Land Management staff, scientific researchers, high-\ntech manufacturers, and the private helium industry to address the most \npressing problems facing Federal helium users and the helium industry \ntoday.\n  I would like to conclude by taking a moment to acknowledge the \nexceptional efforts of Dr. Marcius Extavour who was the AAAS Science \npolicy fellow and physicist working on the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee last year.

A bill to establish the Columbine-Hondo Wilderness in the \nState of New Mexico, to provide for the conveyance of certain parcels \nof National Forest System land in the State, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Columbine-\nHondo Wilderness Act which will designate approximately 45,000 acres in \nthe Sangre de Cristo Mountains in northern New Mexico as wilderness. I \nam pleased that my colleague, Senator Tom Udall, is a cosponsor of this \nlegislation.\n  Located in the Carson National Forest in Taos County, the Columbine-\nHondo is one of the last remaining segments of this high alpine \necosystem to receive permanent wilderness protection. The concept of \nwilderness has deep roots and a long history in the Carson National \nForest. For example, in the early 1900s, Aldo Leopold, known as the \nfather of wilderness, spent his early career in the Forest Service in \nthe Carson where he quickly reached the post of Forest Supervisor. \nThere is no doubt that he spent much time traveling through this \nlandscape that likely helped cultivate his thoughts on the importance \nof wilderness.\n  Leopold's concept of wilderness evolved over time and heavily \ninfluenced policy makers and the growing conservation community. He \nwrote, ``Wilderness is the raw material out of which man has hammered \nthe artifact called civilization. . . . To the laborer in the sweat of \nhis labor, the raw stuff on his anvil is an adversary to be conquered. \nSo was wilderness an adversary to the pioneer. But to the laborer in \nrepose, able for the moment to cast a philosophical eye on his world, \nthat same raw stuff is something to be loved and cherished, because it \ngives definition and meaning to his life.'' One person who shared that \ndefinition and meaning with Aldo Leopold was former New Mexico Senator \nClinton P. Anderson. In fact, due in large part to the conversations he \nhad with Leopold forty years earlier, Senator Anderson led the effort \nin Congress to pass the Wilderness Act of 1964.\n  In that 1964 Act, the Wheeler Peak Wilderness became the first \nwilderness area in the Carson National Forest, which lies just south of \nthe Columbine-Hondo area. Shortly thereafter in 1970, the Taos Pueblo-\nBlue Lake Wilderness, adjacent to Wheeler Peak, was established, \nfurther demonstrating that the idea of wilderness is a valuable concept \nto Indian tribes wishing to protect their most sacred sites for future \ngenerations. Another decade had to pass before Congress protected \nadditional lands in New Mexico as wilderness in 1980, including the \nLatir Peak Wilderness, north of the Columbine-Hondo. In that same Act, \nthe Columbine-Hondo was designated as a Wilderness Study Area to allow \nCongress further time to review the merits of designating this area as \nwilderness.\n  Aldo Leopold laments in A Sand County Almanac that progress in \nconservation is slow--a fact that hasn't changed much in modern times. \n``Despite nearly a century of propaganda,'' he wrote, ``conservation \nstill proceeds at a snail's pace.'' In this context, it is \nunfortunately not surprising that it has taken Congress over 30 years \nto review the merits of the Columbine-Hondo Wilderness Study Area.\n  But the time to permanently protect the Columbine-Hondo is now before \nus. After many years of hard work by local community leaders, a nearly \nunanimous consensus has formed in support of protecting this landscape \nas wilderness. This is due to the longstanding recognition by the \nsurrounding communities and their residents of the benefits that \nwilderness provides them. The mountains provide communities with clean \nair and act as a watershed, providing them with fresh and clean water. \nSportsmen benefit from the protection of quality habitat that will \nensure the elk, deer, and antelope found in the mountains and the fish \nin the mountain streams will continue to thrive. Communities like the \nTowns of Taos and Red River and the Villages of Questa and Taos Ski \nValley can find economic benefits by attracting visitors seeking \nopportunities for solitude and quiet recreation, including hiking, \nbirding, horseback riding, and even the occasional llama trekking. And \ncommunity members can create job opportunities through outfitting and \nother service industries to assist residents and visitors alike explore \nthese gateways to a more primitive era.\n\n  Wilderness also ensures that the way of life of many local ranchers \nwill remain protected from threats like mining or disruptive off-road \nvehicle use. Local mountain biking coalitions have also recognized that \na balance can be reached to protect wilderness values while making \npractical and common sense boundary adjustments that will help promote \nsustainable mountain biking opportunities in the region.\n  During my tenure in the Senate, it has been relatively uncommon to \nfind such overwhelming support for the establishment of a new \nwilderness area. I commend the dedication and perseverance exhibited by \nthe many local wilderness advocates who have devoted many years to see \nthis effort come to fruition. Without their help, it may have taken \nanother decade before Congress addressed this long outstanding matter. \nCongress has had 32 years now to review the designation of the \nColumbine-Hondo Wilderness. With such broad support having been \ndeveloped, I urge my colleagues to support this initiative to protect \nthis area without further delay.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2468\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to improve the health of minority individuals, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am proud to once again introduce \nlegislation addressing the health care disparities in racial and ethnic \nminority communities, the Health Equity and Accountability Act of 2012. \nI would like to thank my cosponsor, Senator Inouye, along with a number \nof our colleagues in the House of Representatives, for all their \nsupport and contributions to this important legislation, and for \nraising awareness of this widespread problem.\n  While there are glaring health disparities based on racial and ethnic \nidentity alone, they are further exacerbated by factors such as \nsocioeconomics, geography, and sexual orientation and identity. \nAlthough the exact causes for the current state of health disparities \nin our country may be debatable, it is undeniable that ethnic, racial, \ngeographic, and other minorities across the United States are plagued \nby disproportionately high rates of disease and experience a diminished \nquality of health care. Statistics paint a disturbing picture of \nminority health, consistently showing higher rates of illness and death \nfor members of minority and marginalized groups.\n  For instance, HIV/AIDS has had a devastating impact on minorities in \nthe U.S. In 2009, ethnic minorities accounted for over 70 percent of \nnewly diagnosed cases of HIV. That year, nine out of ten babies born \nwith HIV belonged to minority groups. The Office of Minority Health \nreported that, compared to Caucasians, Hispanic individuals are 3 times \nmore likely to be diagnosed with AIDS; Native Americans are 1.4 times \nmore likely; and Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders are 2.4 times \nmore likely to be diagnosed with AIDS.\n  Cancer is the number one killer of Asian American Pacific Islanders \nand the second leading cause of death for most other racial and ethnic \nminorities in the United States. Cancer also affects African Americans \nat particularly alarming rates and has a disproportionate prevalence in \nthe population of Hispanic women, who are 1.6 times more likely to be \ndiagnosed with cervical cancer than non-Hispanic women. In addition, \nNative Americans are twice as likely as non-Hispanic whites to develop \nstomach or liver cancer.\n  The infant mortality rates for African Americans are one-and-a-half \nto 3 times higher than the rates for infants born to women of other \nraces and ethnicities. Hispanic individuals are three times more likely \nto be diagnosed with AIDS than Caucasian individuals. As our nation \ncontinues to struggle with obesity, trends show increasingly high rates \nof obesity in minority groups, with young Mexican-American men under \nthe age of 20 experiencing obesity at a rate of 25 percent of the \npopulation, while white men of the same age have a rate of just 15 \npercent.\n  Circulatory diseases are a growing problem in the Pacific region. \nThese diseases not only lower patients' quality of life, but they are \nalso very costly. Data from the Agency for Healthcare Research and \nQuality shows that eliminating preventable hospitalizations that are \nassociated with lower incomes would save $6.7 billion in health care \ncosts each year. However, the numbers alone do not capture the full \nextent of health disparities since there are additional issues with \ndata collection and multiple factors often contribute to deaths.\n  In 2005, I introduced a similar piece of legislation, S. 1580, \nbecause many of the indigenous and ethnic minority communities across \nthe United States and its territories lacked essential access to health \ncare and suffered from certain key diseases at disproportionately high \nrates. The bill I am introducing today addresses many of the same \nissues and also takes into account the strong advances made by the \nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act. In 2008, the landmark \nhealth care reform legislation laid the foundation to start reducing \nsome of those health disparities. Senator Inouye and I are introducing \nthis legislation today to build on the work of the Affordable Care Act, \nand to advance the national discussion on how we can better achieve \nhealth equity.\n  While the Affordable Care Act expanded care in diverse communities \nacross the country, such as Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and \nPacific Islanders, it is important that we take further steps to ensure \nthat all Americans, regardless of racial, ethnic, socioeconomic, \nphysical, and geographic circumstances, have affordable access to high-\nquality health care. Because the causes of health care disparities are \nwide-ranging, the scope of this bill must be equally encompassing. \nTherefore, my bill focuses on two main strategies: first, encouraging \nresearch on diseases and conditions that disproportionately impact \nminority individuals; and second, improving access to effective care \nfor minority communities.\n\n  We must make it easier to identify existing disparities through \ncomprehensive data collection, ensure workforce diversity, target \ndiseases that disproportionately affect minorities, and make culturally \nand linguistically appropriate health care services available to all.\n  We need more comprehensive data on the most significant health care \nproblems experienced by minority individuals and the factors that play \na role in how these diseases affect different communities. The more we \nknow about the way populations are affected by disease, the better \nprepared health care professionals will be to create strategies to both \ntreat and prevent each high-impact disease in specific communities. My \nbill will help to accomplish this by strengthening both data collection \nand the reporting of health data.\n  To complement our efforts in data collection, we must also target \ndisease awareness education and effective preventative services towards \ncommunities with large populations of ethnic and racial minorities at \nhigh risk for certain diseases. Community-based programs as well as \ncomprehensive disease-specific programs already in place are helping to \nensure that the health needs of minority communities are being met. My \nlegislation would revitalize efforts in community health and preventive \nservices, which are the most cost-effective ways of providing care.\n  This bill builds upon the Affordable Care Act's historic investment \nin prevention and calls for resources to target communities striving to \novercome negative social factors. This bill encourages these \ninvestments and focuses on preventing fatal diseases, which could save \nthousands of lives each year and lower health care costs.\n  Although prevention plays a critical role in finding ways to close \ndisparities, we also have to invest in research to develop better \ntreatment plans for diseases that disproportionately affect indigenous, \nracial, and ethnic minorities, and to ensure that currently underserved \ncommunities have access to care. My bill proposes focused approaches to \ncombat a variety of diseases and conditions, including heart disease, \ncancer, diabetes, and HIV/\n\n[[Page S2831]]\n\nAIDS, which have a disparate impact on racial and ethnic minorities. \nThis legislation also helps to provide affordable and culturally \nappropriate access to care in several ways.\n  My bill, the Health Equity and Accountability Act of 2012, includes \nproposals to remove significant barriers to health care coverage and \naccess and maximize the positive impact of federal investments in \nhealth care in minority communities. For example, it would re-establish \nMedicaid eligibility for citizens of the Compact of Free Association \nnations living in the United States. This would greatly ease the \nfinancial burden on States like Hawaii and Arkansas, which have been \nforced to absorb the costs of providing health and social services, \neducation, and public safety for Compact migrants in accordance with \nunfunded Federal mandates since 1996.\n  My bill would also make health care more affordable and improve \naccess by providing a 100 percent Federal Medicaid Assistance \nPercentage, FMAP, for Native Hawaiians who receive health care from \nFederally Qualified Health Centers or the Native Hawaiian Health Care \nSystem. The increased FMAP will ensure that Native Hawaiians have \naccess to the essential health services provided by community health \ncenters and the Native Hawaiian Health Care System. These provisions \nwould provide treatment for Native Hawaiians that is similar to that \nalready provided to Native Alaskans through the Indian Health Service \nor tribal organizations.\n  This legislation will make it easier for minorities with cultural and \nlanguage barriers to improve their health outcomes by enhancing \nlanguage access services, making health literacy a priority in patient \ncare, and making sure there is culturally competent care in the health \ncare delivery system. My bill will support professionals who are well-\nequipped to provide quality health care that is culturally and \nlinguistically appropriate. As a part of this effort, this legislation \ncreates training opportunities for willing and competent minority \ncandidates to enter the health care workforce.\n  The Health Equity and Accountability Act also seeks to ensure that \ncommunities of color benefit from the rapid advances in health \ninformation technology, or health IT. It also encourages new \ninvestments in health IT infrastructure, which will serve as the \nfoundation for improving the quality, effectiveness, and efficiency for \nall Americans in our future health care system. Improvements in health \nIT and health IT infrastructure will also make it possible for rural \ncommunities to access mobile health services and other treatment and \ndiagnostics that were previously unavailable.\n  Another vital service that my bill seeks to make more accessible is \nmental health care. The Affordable Care Act fundamentally improved \nservices for individuals with mental health and addiction disorders. \nDespite the improvements, mental health treatment remains \nunderutilized, especially by minorities, due to social stigma and \ncultural resistance. To develop access and encourage treatment, my bill \nincorporates culturally competent strategies to address mental and \nbehavioral health problems affecting minority communities and \nauthorizes investment in researching and treating these serious \nconditions.\n  However, we cannot simply put these provisions in place and believe \nthat they will eliminate all health disparities. We must have \naccountability and regular evaluation of these programs to ensure they \nare being carried out as they were intended, and that they are meeting \ntheir goals. To that end, my bill strengthens oversight by the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, requiring the Department to \nmake regular scheduled reports to Congress on the impact of these \ninitiatives to ensure that they are continuing to reduce health \ndisparities.\n  April is National Minority Health Month, and as we work diligently to \ntransform health care in America, it is essential that we strive to \neliminate the health disparities that affect our minority groups. This \nbill would significantly improve the quality of life for indigenous \npeople, ethnic and racial minorities, as well as other marginalized \ngroups. I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation, and \nbegin an open dialogue on how we can close the gap in health care \nacross the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/26/senate-section/article/S2831-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2831-S2832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 440--RECOGNIZING THE HISTORIC SIGNIFICANCE OF THE \n                    MEXICAN HOLIDAY OF CINCO DE MAYO\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado (for himself, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Menendez, Mr. \nBingaman, Mr. Reid, Mr. Bennet, Mr. Akaka, Ms. Stabenow, Mrs. \nFeinstein, and Mrs. Hutchison) submitted the following resolution; \nwhich was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 440\n\n       Whereas May 5, or ``Cinco de Mayo'' in Spanish, is \n     celebrated each year as a date of great importance by the \n     Mexican and Mexican-American communities;\n       Whereas the Cinco de Mayo holiday commemorates May 5, 1862, \n     the date on which Mexicans who were struggling for \n     independence and freedom fought the Battle of Puebla;\n       Whereas Cinco de Mayo has become widely celebrated annually \n     by nearly all Mexicans and Mexican-Americans, north and south \n     of the United States-Mexico border;\n       Whereas the Battle of Puebla was but one of the many \n     battles that the courageous Mexican people won in their long \n     and brave struggle for independence and freedom;\n       Whereas the French army, confident that its battle-seasoned \n     troops were far superior to the less-seasoned Mexican troops, \n     expected little or no opposition from the Mexican army;\n       Whereas the French army, which had not experienced defeat \n     against any of the finest troops of Europe in more than half \n     a century, sustained a disastrous loss at the hands of an \n     outnumbered and ill-equipped, but highly spirited and \n     courageous, Mexican army;\n       Whereas, after 3 bloody assaults on Puebla in which more \n     than 1,000 French soldiers lost their lives, the French \n     troops were finally defeated and driven back by the \n     outnumbered Mexican troops;\n       Whereas the courageous spirit that Mexican General Ignacio \n     Zaragoza and his men displayed during that historic battle \n     can never be forgotten;\n       Whereas many brave Mexicans willingly gave their lives for \n     the causes of justice and freedom in the Battle of Puebla on \n     Cinco de Mayo;\n       Whereas the sacrifice of the Mexican fighters was \n     instrumental in keeping Mexico from falling under European \n     domination while, in the United States, the Union Army \n     battled Confederate forces in the Civil War;\n       Whereas Cinco de Mayo serves as a reminder that the \n     foundation of the United States was built by people from many \n     countries and diverse cultures who were willing to fight and \n     die for freedom;\n       Whereas Cinco de Mayo also serves as a reminder of the \n     close ties between the people of Mexico and the people of the \n     United States;\n       Whereas, in a larger sense, Cinco de Mayo symbolizes the \n     right of a free people to self-determination, just as Benito \n     Juarez, the president of Mexico during the Battle of Puebla, \n     once said, ``El respeto al derecho ajeno es la paz'' \n     (``Respect for the rights of others is peace''); and\n       Whereas many people celebrate Cinco de Mayo during the \n     entire week in which the date falls: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the historic struggle of the people of \n     Mexico for independence and freedom, which Cinco de Mayo \n     commemorates; and\n       (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     Cinco de Mayo with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise with Senators Cornyn, \nMenendez, Bingaman, Reid, Bennet, Stabenow, Akaka, Feinstein, and \nHutchison to submit a resolution commemorating Cinco de Mayo.\n  We all love Cinco de Mayo for the food and festivities that we have \ngrown so accustomed to across the country. However, the day is also of \ngreat historical relevance, commemorating the Battle of Puebla, an \nunlikely Mexican military victory over the French in 1852. Since then, \nCinco de Mayo has come to represent Mexican-Americans' many \ncontributions to the United States. For many decades Coloradans and \ncommunities across the country have celebrated this day in a way that \nbrings pride to the contributions of the Mexican-American community of \nour state.\n  The commemoration of Cinco de Mayo also highlights the courage that \nMexican forces displayed on May 5, 1862, a courage that was welcomed by \nthe Union Army as it battled Confederate forces in the American Civil \nWar. The victory of the beleaguered force of Mexican troops at the \nBattle of Puebla was a setback for Napoleon's France\n\n[[Page S2832]]\n\nthat weakened France's immense resources and limited its ability to \nmeddle in America's Civil War. As Mexico sought to defend itself from \nEuropean aggression, the Battle of Puebla is a reminder for us that the \nfoundation of the United States was also built through fights in which \nthe United States often found itself as the underdog. But through \nperseverance, the willingness to fight and die for freedom, and the \ncontributions of a diverse cultural mix of Americans from across the \nglobe, we have been made stronger. This is something we should \ncelebrate about our country's history.\n  This day in history has become especially important in Colorado, \nwhere the contributions of many Mexican-American families can be seen \nthroughout our communities. As in years past, towns throughout Colorado \nand our nation will celebrate with food, educational activities, music \nand dancing, and I encourage my fellow Coloradans to join in their \ncommunities' celebrations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/26/senate-section/article/S2832-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 441--EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE DESIGNATION OF MAY \n              2012 AS NATIONAL YOUTH TRAFFIC SAFETY MONTH\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself, Mrs. Hutchison, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. \nPryor, and Mr. Thune) submitted the following resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 444\n\n       Whereas a decline in physical activity has contributed to \n     the unprecedented epidemic of childhood obesity, which has \n     more than tripled in the United States since 1980;\n       Whereas regular physical activity is necessary to support \n     normal and healthy growth in children and is essential to the \n     continued health and well-being of children;\n       Whereas according to the Centers for Disease Control, \n     overweight adolescents have a 70- to 80-percent chance of \n     becoming overweight adults, increasing their risk for chronic \n     disease, disability, and death;\n       Whereas physical activity reduces the risk of heart \n     disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and certain types of \n     cancers;\n       Whereas type 2 diabetes can no longer be referred to as \n     ``late in life'' or ``adult onset'' diabetes because type 2 \n     diabetes presently occurs in children as young as 10 years \n     old;\n       Whereas the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans \n     issued by the Department of Health and Human Services \n     recommend that children engage in at least 60 minutes of \n     physical activity on most, and preferably all, days of the \n     week;\n       Whereas according to the Centers for Disease Control, only \n     19 percent of high school students are meeting the goal of 60 \n     minutes of physical activity each day;\n       Whereas children spend many of their waking hours at school \n     and, as a result, need to be active during the school day to \n     meet the recommendations of the Physical Activity Guidelines \n     for Americans;\n\n[[Page S2833]]\n\n       Whereas nationally, according to the Centers for Disease \n     Control, 1 out of 4 children does not attend any school \n     physical education classes, and fewer than 1 in 4 children \n     get 20 minutes of vigorous activity every day;\n       Whereas teaching children about physical education and \n     sports not only ensures that the children are physically \n     active during the school day, but also educates the children \n     on how to be physically active and the importance of physical \n     activity;\n       Whereas according to a 2006 survey by the Department of \n     Health and Human Services, 3.8 percent of elementary schools, \n     7.9 percent of middle schools, and 2.1 percent of high \n     schools provide daily physical education (or an equivalent) \n     for the entire school year, and 22 percent of schools do not \n     require students to take any physical education courses at \n     all;\n       Whereas according to that 2006 survey, 13.7 percent of \n     elementary schools, 15.2 percent of middle schools, and 3.0 \n     percent of high schools provide physical education (or an \n     equivalent) at least 3 days per week for the entire school \n     year for students in all grades in the school;\n       Whereas research shows that fit and active children are \n     more likely to thrive academically;\n       Whereas increased time in physical education classes can \n     help the attention, concentration, and achievement test \n     scores of children;\n       Whereas participation in sports teams and physical activity \n     clubs, often organized by the school and run outside of the \n     regular school day, can improve grade point average, school \n     attachment, educational aspirations, and the likelihood of \n     graduation;\n       Whereas participation in sports and physical activity \n     improves self-esteem and body image in children and adults;\n       Whereas children and youths who partake in physical \n     activity and sports programs have increased motor skills, \n     healthy lifestyles, social skills, a sense of fair play, \n     strong teamwork skills, self-discipline, and avoidance of \n     risky behaviors;\n       Whereas the social and environmental factors affecting \n     children are in the control of the adults and the communities \n     in which the children live, and therefore, the people of the \n     United States share a collective responsibility in reversing \n     the childhood obesity epidemic;\n       Whereas if efforts are made to intervene with unfit \n     children to bring those children to physically fit levels, \n     then there may also be a concomitant rise in the academic \n     performance of those children; and\n       Whereas Congress strongly supports efforts to increase \n     physical activity and participation of children and youth in \n     sports: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week of May 1 through May 7, 2012, as \n     ``National Physical Education and Sport Week'';\n       (2) recognizes National Physical Education and Sport Week \n     and the central role of physical education and sports in \n     creating a healthy lifestyle for all children and youth;\n       (3) supports the implementation of local school wellness \n     policies (as that term is described in section 9A of the \n     Richard B.

Res. 446\n\n       Whereas market-based policies and private sector leadership \n     have given the Internet flexibility to evolve;\n       Whereas the position of the United States Government is and \n     has been to advocate for the free flow of information, \n     Internet freedom, and multi-stakeholder governance of the \n     Internet internationally;\n       Whereas the current multi-stakeholder model of Internet \n     governance has enabled the Internet to flourish and allowed \n     the private sector, civil society, academia, and individual \n     users to play an important role in charting the direction of \n     the Internet;\n       Whereas, given the importance of the Internet to the global \n     economy, it is essential that the underlying technical \n     infrastructure of the Internet remain stable and secure;\n       Whereas the developing world deserves the benefits that the \n     Internet provides, including access to knowledge, services, \n     commerce, and communication, the accompanying benefits to \n     economic development, education, health care, and social \n     assembly, and the informed discussion that is the bedrock of \n     democratic self-government;\n       Whereas the explosive and hugely beneficial growth of the \n     Internet resulted not from increased government involvement \n     but from the opening of the Internet to commerce and private \n     sector innovation;\n       Whereas the governments of some countries that advocate \n     radical change in the structure of Internet governance censor \n     the information available to their citizens through the \n     Internet, use the Internet to prevent democratization, and \n     use the Internet as a tool of surveillance to curtail \n     legitimate political discussion and dissent, and other \n     countries operate telecommunications systems as state-\n     controlled monopolies or highly regulated and highly taxed \n     entities;\n       Whereas some countries that support transferring Internet \n     governance to an entity affiliated with the United Nations, \n     or to another intergovernmental organization, might seek to \n     have such an entity or organization endorse policies of those \n     countries that block access to information, stifle political \n     dissent, and maintain outmoded communications structures; and\n       Whereas the structure and control of Internet governance \n     has profound implications for democratization, free \n     expression, competition and trade, access to information, \n     privacy, security, and the protection of intellectual \n     property, and the threat of some countries to take unilateral \n     action that would fracture the root zone file would result in \n     a less functional Internet with diminished benefits for all \n     people: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate calls on the President--\n       (1) to continue to oppose any effort to transfer control of \n     the Internet to the United Nations or any other \n     intergovernmental organization;\n       (2) to recognize the need for, and pursue, a continuing and \n     constructive dialogue with the international community on the \n     future of Internet governance; and\n       (3) to advance the values of a free Internet in the broader \n     trade and diplomatic efforts of the United States Government.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/26/senate-section/article/S2833-3", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2833-S2840]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 42--SETTING FORTH THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET \n  FOR THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2013, REVISING THE \n APPROPRIATE BUDGETARY LEVELS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2012, AND SETTING FORTH \n  THE APPROPRIATE BUDGETARY LEVELS FOR FISCAL YEARS 2013 THROUGH 2022.\n\n  Mr. PAUL submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nplaced on the calendar:\n\n                            S.

Res. 442\n\n            (Celebrating the 140th anniversary of Arbor Day)\n\n       Whereas Arbor Day was founded in Nebraska City, Nebraska on \n     April 10, 1872, to recognize the importance of planting \n     trees;\n       Whereas it is estimated that on the first Arbor Day, more \n     than 1,000,000 trees were planted in the State of Nebraska \n     alone;\n       Whereas Arbor Day is observed in all 50 States and across \n     the world;\n       Whereas participating in Arbor Day activities promotes \n     civic participation and highlights the importance of planting \n     and caring for trees and vegetation;\n       Whereas those activities provide an opportunity to convey \n     to future generations the value of land and stewardship;\n       Whereas National Arbor Day is observed on the last Friday \n     of April each year; and\n       Whereas April 27, 2012, marks the 140th anniversary of \n     Arbor Day: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes April 27, 2012, as National Arbor Day;\n       (2) celebrates the 140th anniversary of Arbor Day;\n       (3) supports the goals and ideals of Arbor Day; and\n       (4) encourages the people of United States to participate \n     in Arbor Day activities.\n\n                              S. Res. 443\n\n    (Honoring the life and legacy of Auxiliary Bishop Agustin Roman)\n\n       Whereas Agustin Roman was appointed auxiliary bishop of the \n     Archdiocese of Miami, Florida in 1979, becoming the first \n     Cuban to be appointed bishop in the United States;\n       Whereas Agustin Roman was expelled from Cuba in 1961 by the \n     regime of Fidel Castro, along with many other Roman Catholic \n     priests;\n       Whereas Agustin Roman ministered in Chile for 4 years \n     before coming to Miami, Florida in 1966, where he quickly \n     became a spiritual leader and advocate for the Cuban \n     community in Miami, as well as for many other immigrant \n     communities, including Haitian refugees;\n       Whereas Agustin Roman was fluent in Latin, English, French, \n     and Spanish, and served on the Bishops' Committee for \n     Hispanic Affairs, worked as a hospital chaplain, and became \n     episcopal vicar for the Spanish-speaking people of the \n     Archdiocese of Miami;\n       Whereas Agustin Roman was the son of humble Cuban peasants, \n     which influenced his commitment to humility, tenacity, and \n     unceasing devotion to his ministry in southern Florida;\n       Whereas Agustin Roman was instrumental in the construction \n     of the Shrine of Our Lady of Charity on Biscayne Bay, which \n     serves as a monument to the patron saint of Cuba, the Virgin \n     of Charity of Cobre, and attracts hundreds of thousands of \n     visitors each year;\n       Whereas in 1980 Agustin Roman served as a mediator during \n     the Mariel boatlift incident, helping more than 100,000 \n     Cubans flee the island and safely resettle in the United \n     States;\n       Whereas Agustin Roman helped negotiate a peaceful \n     resolution to the 1987 riots of Mariel prisoner uprisings in \n     Federal prisons, earning him national recognition for his \n     compassion, gentility, and humble spirit;\n       Whereas after his retirement at the age of 75, Agustin \n     Roman remained active at the Shrine of Our Lady of Charity, \n     greeting visitors and responding to letters from fellow Cuban \n     exiles; and\n       Whereas Agustin Roman passed away on Wednesday, April 11, \n     2012: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes and honors the life of Agustin Roman;\n       (2) recognizes and honors the spiritual leadership of \n     Agustin Roman and his dedication to freedom and faith;\n       (3) offers heartfelt condolences to the family, friends, \n     and loved ones of Agustin Roman; and\n       (4) in memory of Agustin Roman, calls on the United States \n     to continue policies that promote respect for the fundamental \n     principles of religious freedom, democracy, and human rights \n     in Cuba, in a manner consistent with the aspirations of the \n     people of Cuba.\n\n                              S. Res. 444\n\n   (Designating the week of May 1 through May 7, 2012, as ``National \n                  Physical Education and Sport Week'')\n\n       Whereas a decline in physical activity has contributed to \n     the unprecedented epidemic of childhood obesity, which has \n     more than tripled in the United States since 1980;\n       Whereas regular physical activity is necessary to support \n     normal and healthy growth in children and is essential to the \n     continued health and well-being of children;\n       Whereas according to the Centers for Disease Control, \n     overweight adolescents have a 70- to 80-percent chance of \n     becoming overweight adults, increasing their risk for chronic \n     disease, disability, and death;\n       Whereas physical activity reduces the risk of heart \n     disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and certain types of \n     cancers;\n       Whereas type 2 diabetes can no longer be referred to as \n     ``late in life'' or ``adult onset'' diabetes because type 2 \n     diabetes presently occurs in children as young as 10 years \n     old;\n       Whereas the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans \n     issued by the Department of Health and Human Services \n     recommend that children engage in at least 60 minutes of \n     physical activity on most, and preferably all, days of the \n     week;\n       Whereas according to the Centers for Disease Control, only \n     19 percent of high school students are meeting the goal of 60 \n     minutes of physical activity each day;\n       Whereas children spend many of their waking hours at school \n     and, as a result, need to be active during the school day to \n     meet the recommendations of the Physical Activity Guidelines \n     for Americans;\n       Whereas nationally, according to the Centers for Disease \n     Control, 1 out of 4 children does not attend any school \n     physical education classes, and fewer than 1 in 4 children \n     get 20 minutes of vigorous activity every day;\n       Whereas teaching children about physical education and \n     sports not only ensures that the children are physically \n     active during the school day, but also educates the children \n     on how to be physically active and the importance of physical \n     activity;\n       Whereas according to a 2006 survey by the Department of \n     Health and Human Services, 3.8 percent of elementary schools, \n     7.9 percent of middle schools, and 2.1 percent of high \n     schools provide daily physical education (or an equivalent) \n     for the entire school year, and 22 percent of schools do not \n     require students to take any physical education courses at \n     all;\n       Whereas according to that 2006 survey, 13.7 percent of \n     elementary schools, 15.2 percent of middle schools, and 3.0 \n     percent of high schools provide physical education (or an \n     equivalent) at least 3 days per week for the entire school \n     year for students in all grades in the school;\n       Whereas research shows that fit and active children are \n     more likely to thrive academically;\n       Whereas increased time in physical education classes can \n     help the attention, concentration, and achievement test \n     scores of children;\n       Whereas participation in sports teams and physical activity \n     clubs, often organized by the school and run outside of the \n     regular school day, can improve grade point average, school \n     attachment, educational aspirations, and the likelihood of \n     graduation;\n       Whereas participation in sports and physical activity \n     improves self-esteem and body image in children and adults;\n       Whereas children and youths who partake in physical \n     activity and sports programs have increased motor skills, \n     healthy lifestyles, social skills, a sense of fair play, \n     strong teamwork skills, self-discipline, and avoidance of \n     risky behaviors;\n       Whereas the social and environmental factors affecting \n     children are in the control of the adults and the communities \n     in which the children live, and therefore, the people of the \n     United States share a collective responsibility in reversing \n     the childhood obesity epidemic;\n       Whereas if efforts are made to intervene with unfit \n     children to bring those children to physically fit levels, \n     then there may also be a concomitant rise in the academic \n     performance of those children; and\n\n[[Page S2888]]\n\n       Whereas Congress strongly supports efforts to increase \n     physical activity and participation of children and youth in \n     sports: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week of May 1 through May 7, 2012, as \n     ``National Physical Education and Sport Week'';\n       (2) recognizes National Physical Education and Sport Week \n     and the central role of physical education and sports in \n     creating a healthy lifestyle for all children and youth;\n       (3) supports the implementation of local school wellness \n     policies (as that term is described in section 9A of the \n     Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1758b)) that include ambitious goals for physical education, \n     physical activity, and other activities that address the \n     childhood obesity epidemic and promote child wellness; and\n       (4) encourages schools to offer physical education classes \n     to students and work with community partners to provide \n     opportunities and safe spaces for physical activities before \n     and after school and during the summer months for all \n     children and youth.\n\n                              S. Res. 445\n\n  (Expressing support for the designation of May 1, 2012, as ``Silver \n                       Star Service Banner Day'')\n\n       Whereas the Senate has always honored the sacrifices made \n     by the wounded and ill members of the Armed Forces;\n       Whereas the Silver Star Service Banner has come to \n     represent the members of the Armed Forces and veterans who \n     were wounded or became ill in combat in the wars fought by \n     the United States;\n       Whereas the Silver Star Families of America was formed to \n     help the American people remember the sacrifices made by the \n     wounded and ill members of the Armed Forces by designing and \n     manufacturing Silver Star Service Banners and Silver Star \n     Flags for that purpose;\n       Whereas the sole mission of the Silver Star Families of \n     America is to evoke memories of the sacrifices of members and \n     veterans of the Armed Forces on behalf of the United States \n     through the presence of a Silver Star Service Banner in a \n     window or a Silver Star Flag flying;\n       Whereas the sacrifices of members and veterans of the Armed \n     Forces on behalf of the United States should never be \n     forgotten; and\n       Whereas May 1, 2012, is an appropriate date to designate as \n     ``Silver Star Service Banner Day'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate supports the designation of May \n     1, 2012, as ``Silver Star Service Banner Day'' and calls upon \n     the people of the United States to observe the day with \n     appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/26/senate-section/article/S2888-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2888]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  PROVIDING FOR A CONDITIONAL ADJOURNMENT OR RECESS OF THE SENATE AND \n              ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES\n\n  Mr. REID.

Res. 43; that following the prayer and pledge, \nthe Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the morning hour be \ndeemed expired, and the time for the two leaders be reserved for their \nuse later in the day; that the Senate resume consideration of the \nmotion to proceed to S. 2343, the Stop Student Loan Interest Rate Hike \nAct; and that at 4:30 p.m. the Senate proceed to executive session \nunder the previous order.\n  Just so that everyone understands, we have in this the pro forma \nsessions possibility. I am confident the House will adopt our \nadjournment resolution, but just in case they don't, that is why we \nhave that in there.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/26/senate-section/article/S2888-5", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2888]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. REID.
