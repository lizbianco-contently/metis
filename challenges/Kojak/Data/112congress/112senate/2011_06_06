Mr. President, I welcome back my colleagues for what I hope \nwill be a productive month. This month is not unlike last month though \nor the month before or the month before that. Once again, our \nconstituents are concerned with one thing above all; that is, jobs, \nwork. They are concerned because of what the economy means for their \nfamilies and their lives. They are worried about paying the bills next \nmonth and sending the kids to school next year. Too many want to go to \nthe bank and once again know the dignity of depositing a paycheck \ninstead of an unemployment check.\n  Our constituents are also concerned because of what our economic \nfuture\n\n[[Page S3478]]\n\nwill mean for our Nation. They are afraid that ill-informed politicians \nmight lead the country into a default crisis, and they fear all the \nterrible consequences that would have--consequences that would hurt us \nas a country, our families, and the world.\n  I heard these concerns last week in Nevada. We all heard them in our \nStates when we went home last week. We hear them loudly and clearly. So \nwe are going to focus our attention this week and month on jobs just as \nwe have all year.\n  I am disappointed that our Republican colleagues seem determined to \ndistract that focus. They want to spend the Senate's time debating an \nextreme social agenda that would hurt families, seniors, and our \neconomy. They want to end Medicare in order to pay for more \nmillionaires' tax breaks and oil company subsidies. That is not good \npolicy or even good politics. The American people strongly oppose that \npolicy, and so do the Democrats in Congress.\n  Every day Republicans prove they are not just tone deaf to Americans' \nopinions; they are also tone deaf to cold, hard economic facts.\n  Last week we got a discouraging jobs report. The economy added jobs, \nbut not as many as we had hoped. Moody's sent a clear letter warning \nthat a default crisis would send our economy into a tailspin. There is \nno time to waste. The longer Republicans insist on dismantling Medicare \nas a price for moving forward, the longer the unemployed will wait for \ngood news, and the closer the Nation will come to a default crisis.\n  Republicans' ideology of obstruction isn't limited to economics or \nseniors' health. We also see it in their approach to performing the \nSenate's constitutional duty of confirming the President's nominees for \nimportant positions.\n  A few weeks ago, Republicans blocked a well-qualified, fair-minded, \nand widely respected legal scholar for a seat on the U.S. Court of \nAppeals. Now they are continuing these partisan antics by threatening \nto block two more noncontroversial nominees. The first is Peter \nDiamond. He is one of the Nation's top economists. He has won the Nobel \nPrize in economics. Not long ago, he had bipartisan support for his \nnomination to the Fed's Board of Governors. All of a sudden, for no \ngood reason, Republicans have decided to stand in the way of his \nnomination.\n  The second, Don Verrilli, is the President's nominee for Solicitor \nGeneral of the United States. The Judiciary Committee approved him by a \n17-to-1 margin. So in addition to being supremely qualified, he is \nclearly not controversial. But now Republicans are threatening to block \nthis nominee over requests for documents totally unrelated to him or \nhis position. I hope they don't hold him up for reasons that have \nnothing to do with his nomination.\n  Blocking every nominee no matter the merits is no way to govern or \nlead. It is no way to move forward.\n  Mr. President, if we are going to keep our economy upright--for \nfamilies and for our Nation as a whole--we have to recognize real \nproblems and propose realistic solutions. We cannot hold one policy \nhostage to another or be bound by some strange ideology.\n  Every month we play these games guarantees that the following month \nwill bring more of the same avoidable fights. For families worried \nabout affording the basics, and for our Nation's fundamental economic \nstrength, we need to get serious before it is too late.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/06/senate-section/article/S3478-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3478]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, when it comes to doing oversight, I \nthink I have a reputation of doing just as vigorous oversight when we \nhave Republican Presidents as when we have Democratic Presidents, and \nwhat I am speaking to the Senate about today has no partisanship in it \nbecause I could have said the same thing--and did say it--when there \nwas a President Bush or a President Clinton or a President Reagan.\n  I speak today about watchdogging the watchdogs, as I have done many \ntimes in the past. I first started watchdogging the Pentagon back in \nthe early 1980s when President Reagan was ramping up defense spending. \nThen a group of Defense reformers were examining the pricing of spare \nparts of the Defense Department, and we uncovered some real horror \nstories, such as $750 toilet seats and $695 ashtrays, all going into \nmilitary aircraft. That is ridiculous, of course.\n  As news reports of these horror stories were hitting the streets, \nOffices of Inspectors General--OIGs--were sprouting up in every Federal \nagency as a result of a recently passed act of Congress in 1978. The \nDefense Department OIG officially opened for business March 20, 1983. \nToday, thanks to the Inspector General Act of 1978, and the taxpayers, \nwe now have a real army of watchdogs. The question is, To what extent \nare they doing their business?\n  This mushrooming IG bureaucracy is very expensive. It costs over $2 \nbillion a year. But it now occupies a pivotal oversight position within \nour government, with a very important role to play.\n  As a Senator dedicated to watchdogging the taxpayers' precious money, \nI look to the IGs for help. That is because I just don't have the \nresources in my own office to investigate every allegation that might \ncome my way. Like other Members of Congress, I regularly tap into this \nvast reservoir of talent called the inspector general. We count on \nthem. We put our faith and trust in their independence and honesty. We \nrely on them to root out and deter fraud and waste in government \nwherever that waste and fraud rears its ugly head.\n  If--and that is a big ``if''--the IGs are on the ball, then the \ntaxpayers aren't supposed to worry about things such as $750 toilet \nseats. But I underscore the word ``if'' because fraud and waste are \nstill alive and well in government.\n  One could legitimately ask: How can this be? We created a huge army \nof watchdogs. Yet fraud and waste still exist unchecked.\n  So I keep asking myself the same question that one might ask: Who is \nwatchdogging the watchdogs?\n  True, there is an IG watchdog agency called the Council of Inspectors \nGeneral on Integrity and Efficiency. But that is just another toothless \nwonder. So the Senator from Iowa has the duty today. I am here to \npresent another oversight report on the Pentagon watchdog. I call it a \nreport card on the fiscal year 2010 audits, issued by the Department of \nDefense inspector general.\n  It assesses progress toward improving audit quality in response to \nrecommendations that I made on an oversight report that I gave to my \nfellow Senators last year. After receiving a series of anonymous \nletters from whistleblowers alleging gross mismanagement at the Office \nof Inspector General and the audit office within that office, my staff \ninitiated an in-depth oversight review. My staff focused on audit \nreporting by that office, and our work began 2 years ago.\n  On September 7, 2010, I issued my first oversight review. It \nevaluated the 113 audit reports issued for fiscal year 2009. It \ndetermined that the Office of Inspector General audit capabilities, \nwhich cost the taxpayers about $100 million a year, were gravely \nimpaired.\n  As a watchdog, degraded audit capabilities give me serious heartburn \nfor one simple reason. It puts the taxpayers' money in harm's way, and \nit leaves huge sums of money vulnerable to threat and waste. Audits are \nthe inspector general's primary tool for rooting out fraud and waste. \nAudits are the tip of an inspector general's spear. A good spear always \nneeds a finely honed cutting edge. Right now, the point of\n\n[[Page S3479]]\n\nthat spear is dull, and so the inspector general's audit weapon is \neffectively disabled.\n\n  In speaking about my first report on the floor last September 15, I \nurged Inspector General Heddell to ``hit the audit reset button'' and \nget audits to refocus on the core inspector general mission of \ndetecting and reporting fraud and waste. My report offered 12 specific \nrecommendations for getting the audit process back on track and lined \nup with the Inspector General Act of 1978.\n  The response of the Office of Inspector General to my report has been \nvery positive and very constructive. In a letter to me, dated December \n17 last year, Inspector General Heddell promised to ``transform the \nAudit organization,'' consistent with recommendations in my report. The \nnewly appointed deputy IG for auditing, Mr. Dan Blair, produced a \nroadmap pointing the way forward. Blair's report, dated December 15, \nlaid out a plan for improving ``timeliness, focus, and relevance of \naudit reports.'' He promised to create a ``world-class oversight \norganization providing benefit to the Department, the Congress, and the \ntaxpayer.''\n  As part of their response to my report, the audit office also tasked \ntwo independent consulting firms--Qwest Government Services and \nKnowledge Consulting Group--to conduct an organizational assessment of \nthe audit office and its reports. These independent professionals \nseemed to reach the very same conclusions I had. The Qwest report, \nissued October 2010, put it this way:\n\n       We do not believe Audit is selecting the best audits to \n     detail fraud, waste, and abuse.\n\n  The auditors, the Qwest report states, have lost sight of that goal \nand ``need to step back and refocus on the IG's core mission.''\n  That is exactly what I saw last year and what I continue to see \ntoday. However, I wish to be not totally pessimistic. All the signals \ncoming since my report from the IG's office are encouraging. They tell \nme I am on the right track. The key question before us is this: When \nwill the promised reforms begin to pop up on the radar screen?\n  The fiscal year 2010 reports examined in my report card were issued \nbetween October 2009 and September 2010. They were set in concrete, so \nto speak, long before Mr. Blair's transformation was approved. So the \nfull impact of those reforms will not begin to surface in published \nreports until later this year or in the fiscal year 2011-2012 reports. \nHowever, that is not to say some improvement is not possible any time \nnow, since discussions regarding the need for audit reform actually \nbegan in June 2009.\n  As we will soon see, there is no sign of sustained improvement--not \nyet today--but a faint glimmer of light can be seen in the distant \nhorizon. In order to establish a solid baseline for assessing the IG's \ntransformation efforts, my staff has taken another snapshot of recent \naudits. My latest overview report is best characterized as a report \ncard because that is exactly what it is.\n  Each of the 113 unclassified audits issued in fiscal year 2010 was \nreviewed, evaluated, and graded in five categories as follows: category \nNo. 1 was relevance; category No. 2, connecting the dots on the money \ntrail; No. 3, strength and accuracy of recommendations; No. 4, fraud \nand waste meter; and No. 5, timeliness. Grades of A to F were awarded \nin each category. To average, it was necessary, obviously, to use \nnumerical grades of 1 to 5 and then convert them to standard A to F \ngrades.\n  Scoring was based on answers to key questions such as this: Was the \naudit aligned with the core inspector general mission? Did the audit \nconnect all the dots in the cycle of transactions from contract to \npayment? Did the audit verify the scope of alleged fraud and waste \nusing primary source accounting records? Were the recommendations tough \nand appropriate? Lastly, how quickly was the audit completed?\n  Each report was then given a score called the junkyard dog index. \nThat is an overall average of the grades awarded in the five evaluation \ncategories.\n  For grading timeliness, the following procedure was used: Audits \ncompleted in 6 months or less received a grade of A; those completed in \n6 to 9 months, a B; those completed 9 to 12 months, a C; those taking \n12 to 15 months, a D; and those that took over 15 months, an F.\n  After each report was graded individually, all the scores for each \nreport in each rating category were added and averaged to create a \ncomposite score for all 113 audit reports.\n  The overall composite score awarded to the 113 reports was D minus. \nThis is very low, indeed. Admittedly, the grading system used is \nsubjective. However, as subjective as it may be, my oversight staff has \ndetermined it is a reasonable or rough measure of audit quality. Right \nnow, overall audit quality is poor.\n  The low mark is driven by pervasive deficiencies that surfaced in \nevery report examined--with 15 notable exceptions out of the 113. Those \ndeficiencies are the same ones pinpointed by the Qwest report \npreviously referred to. Instead of being hard core, fraud-busting \ncontract and financial audits, most reports were policy and compliance \nreviews having no redeeming value whatsoever. Those are basically the \nfindings I gave to the inspector general last September, when I \ncriticized then what they were doing--spending too much time on policy \naudits and not enough time on chasing the money--on the waste of the \ntaxpayers' money.\n  You have to follow the money if you are to find out where there is \nwaste, fraud, and abuse--particularly the fraud. So what has been done \nin most of these has no redeeming value whatsoever because they did not \npursue fraud-busting contract and financial audits but instead policy \nand compliance reviews. Quite simply, the auditors were not on the \nmoney trail 24/7, where they need to be to root out fraud and waste as \nmandated by the IG Act.\n  There is one bright spot, however. The auditors got it right--mostly \nright--in 5 reports and partially right in 10 other reports. Clearly, \nthis is a drop in the bucket, but these 15 reports--which constituted \njust 13 percent of the total we reviewed for fiscal year 2010 output--\nprove that the audit office is capable of producing quality reports.\n  The 15 best reports earned grades of good to very good overall, with \nexcellent grades in several categories. They involved very credible and \ncommendable audit work. Each one deserves a gold star. While the top \nfive reports earned overall scores of C-plus to B-minus, those scores \nwould have been much higher were it not for long completion times. The \naverage time to complete the top five reports was 21 months. Long \ncompletion times make for stale information and, of course, that makes \nthe reports irrelevant.\n  Had they been completed in 6 months, for example, they could have \nearned a high B-plus score. Such long completion times clearly show \nthat doing the nitty-gritty, down-in-the- trenches audit work requires \nlarge audit teams, if--and I want to emphasize ``if''--they are to be \ncompleted in a reasonable length of time.\n  Right now, there are no specified goals for audit completion times. \nThey are desperately needed. Then audit teams can be organized with the \nright skill sets to meet those goals.\n  My report includes seven individual report cards--six on the best \nreports and one on the worst report. I think the best way for my \ncolleagues to understand my audit report card is to briefly walk \nthrough two of them--the best and the worst.\n  The highest grade was awarded to an audit that the Department of \nDefense entitled ``Foreign Allowances and Differentials Paid to DOD \nCivilian Employees Supporting Overseas Contingency Operations.'' This \nreport examined the accuracy of $213 million in payments to 11,700 DOD \ncivilians in fiscal years 2007-2008 for overseas ``danger and \nhardship'' allowances.\n  After reviewing the relevant payment records, the auditors determined \nthat the Defense Finance and Accounting Service--and I am going to \nrefer to that as their acronym, DFAS--had made improper payments--\nunderpayments and overpayments--totaling $57.7 million. The audit \nrecommended that the DFAS Director ``take appropriate corrective action \nto reimburse or recover the improper payments'' and that new policies \nand procedures be put in place to preclude erroneous payments in the \nfuture.\n  This report received an overall grade of B-minus. However, it \nreceived excellent grades--A minuses in three categories: relevance, \nconnecting the dots on the money trail and fraud and waste meter. But \nit earned a B-minus for incomplete recommendations and an F\n\n[[Page S3480]]\n\nfor timeliness because it took too long--over 21 months--to complete, \nand so it was stale at that point.\n  The auditors went to the primary source records to verify the exact \namount of erroneous payments. I wish to emphasize to the auditors at \nthe IG this move is the one reason why this report earned high scores. \nVery few audits--just a handful--actually verified dollar amounts using \nprimary source accounting records. That is why I emphasize so often on \nthe need to follow the money trail if you are going to find the fraud \nand the waste.\n  In this report, the recommendations were good but did not go far \nenough. Recommending recovery or reimbursement of overpayments or \nunderpayments was worth a B-minus, but responsible officials were not \nidentified and held accountable for the sloppy accounting work that \nproduced $57.7 million in erroneous payments.\n  It is kind of a rule of thumb around this place. If you don't \nidentify who screwed up and make them feel personally responsible and \nsend a message to other people, how are you going to bring about \nchange? Did the audit office follow up to determine whether the DFAS \nDirector had taken steps to reimburse underpayment or recover \noverpayments? The answer is probably no. In fact, nothing has been \ndone. On February 23, 2011, in response to a question from my office, \nDFAS reported that the Department of Defense is still ``developing a \npolicy'' to fix the problem. Isn't it funny that they have to develop a \npolicy for what is so obviously wrong? Once that process is completed, \nthough, DFAS will ``take appropriate corrective action to reimburse and \ninitiate collection action.''\n\n  When auditors make good recommendations, such as here in this audit, \nand nothing happens, it is as though they are kind of howling in the \nwilderness. That has to be very demoralizing.\n  At this late hour the probability of correcting these mistakes is \nfading fast. For starters, this audit work started over 2 years ago. \nCouple that with the fact that it is in connection with payments made \nin 2006. That is 5 years ago. With the passage of so much time, this \nhas become essentially an academic exercise.\n  That is exactly why reports need to focus on current problems and why \nthey must be completed promptly. That is exactly why this one, which \ntook 16 months to complete, earned an F for timeliness, but otherwise \nwas a pretty good audit.\n  The rest of the audits examined in my report card--98 in all, or 87 \npercent, of the total output for fiscal year 2010--were of poor quality \nand earned grades of D and F. These are primary examples of the kind of \naudits targeted in the Qwest Report previously referred to. That is an \noutside report. They had the Department of Defense bring them in to do \nso some investigating that is not questionable because they do not have \nan interest in what comes out. But these audits were not designed to \ndetect fraud and waste. That is what the IG ought to be doing, \nfollowing the money trail.\n  It happens they did not document and verify financial transactions. \nThey were not on the money trail where they needed to be and where \ntheir audit manuals tell auditors to go to detect fraud and waste. They \ndid not audit what truly needs to be audited. They had little or no \nmonetary value or impact.\n  Some were mandated by Congress, including 27 memo-style audits of \nstimulus projects. That is from the stimulus act we passed here in \n2009. Tiger Teams should have been formed to tackle these audits. \nUnfortunately the exact opposite happened. These were the worst of the \nworst. They contained no findings of any consequence. They offered few \nif any recommendations. Most did not even identify the costs of the \nproject audited. The taxpayers were deeply concerned about the value of \nthese so-called shovel-ready jobs that were supposed to be quickly \nconsummated by the stimulus bill of 2009.\n  Taxpayers were looking for aggressive oversight. Taxpayers wanted \nassurances that huge sums of money were not wasted. Taxpayers got none \nof the objectives they sought. Instead of probing audits, the taxpayers \ngot the equivalent of an inspector general stamp of approval, like a \nrubberstamp that reads, ``OK, approved.''\n  I will now review the worst report. It typifies the ineffectiveness \nand wastefulness of the bulk of the fiscal year 2010 audit production. \nI remind my colleagues, each one of these reports costs an estimated \n$800,000.\n  The report that received the lowest score is entitled by the auditor \n``Defense Contract Management Agency Acquisition Workforce for \nSouthwest Asia.'' It received an F score in every category, across the \nboard. The purpose of this report was to determine whether the Defense \nContract Management Agency had adequate manpower to oversee contracts \nin southwest Asia. It concluded that the Defense Contract Management \nAgency was unable to determine those requirements and there was no plan \nfor doing so. The report recommended that the Defense Contract \nManagement Agency ``define acquisition workforce requirements for \nsouthwest Asia.''\n  This is one of many OIG policy reviews, but this one is unique in \nthat it took 18 months to review a policy that did not even exist. This \naudit should have been terminated early on, but as the Qwest Report \npoints out, the inspector general's office has no process ``for \nstopping audits that are no longer relevant.'' So this is like a \nrunaway train. What redeeming value did this report offer to the \ntaxpayers? None that I can see. This is the stuff for a Department of \nDefense staff study, or some think tank analysis, not for an \nindependent officer or inspector general audit.\n  This audit, like so many others like it, did not focus on fraud and \nwaste and, not surprisingly, found no fraud or waste.\n  The Defense Contract Management Agency has a long history of \nexercising lax contract oversight. The Office of Inspector General \nresources would have been better spent auditing one of the Defense \nContract Management Agency's $1.3 trillion in contracts. Go where the \nmoney is, if you want to find the fraud, follow the money.\n  The inclusion of individual report cards on the best and worst audits \nis meant to be a constructive educational exercise. So I am hoping the \nanalysis accompanying these report cards will serve as a guide and a \nlearning tool for auditors and managers alike.\n  I am hoping the auditors will read my report and use it to sharpen \ntheir skills. I hope it will help guide them on a path to reform and \ntransformation. If the auditors adopt and follow the simple guidelines \nused to gauge the quality of the best or worst reports, they will begin \nproducing top-quality audits that are fully aligned with the core IG's \nmission prescribed by that 1978 law.\n  Before wrapping up my comments I wish to call the attention of my \ncolleagues to several very interesting charts presented in the final \nsection of my report card. They appear in the chapter entitled \n``Comparative Performance with Other OIG Audit Offices.'' These two \nsets of charts highlight striking contrasts. They show the Department \nof Defense auditors are being significantly outperformed by their peers \nat three other agencies: the Department of Health and Human Services, \nHousing and Urban Development, and Homeland Security--and by very \nsubstantial margins indeed. Their peers may be five times more \nproductive than they are at the Department of Defense, and able to \nproduce audits at one-quarter of their costs.\n  I would offer one caveat of what I said about the other departments' \nIGs. While I have reviewed comparisons of cost and productivity data \nfrom all four audit offices, I have not evaluated the quality of the \nother reports issued by the other three OIGs, meaning the Department of \nHealth and Human Services, Department of Homeland Security, and Housing \nand Urban Development, as I did the report on quality of the Department \nof Defense report card. I believe it is a fair apples-to-apples \ncomparison. It may not be. I want to say I do not know for sure.\n  Deputy IG of Auditing Mr. Blair needs to provide a satisfactory \nexplanation for these apparent disparities. Otherwise he may need to \nhit the reset button once again on audit production and costs--as well \nas what he has said he is doing now. While Inspector General Heddell \ncannot be happy with an overall audit grade of D-minus, I think he \nunderstands the problem and I believe his heart is in the right place \nand he has taken the right steps to fix it.\n\n[[Page S3481]]\n\nHis apparent commitment to audit reform and Mr. Blair's promise to \ncreate ``a modern, world-class'' auditing oversight organization--those \nwords happen to be music to my ears. They bode well for the future. In \nother words, they bode well for the future where, if these people do \ntheir job and do it right, fraud and waste will be rooted out and \npeople would fear to commit it in the first place, considering the fact \nthat people are going to be on their tail and find out about it.\n  For right now, though, I cannot report that I see sustained \nimprovement in audit quality--not yet, not by a long shot. But the \nsignals coming my way are good. I said that at the beginning of my \ncomments. The ray of hope can be seen on the distant horizon. Maybe we \nwill see it in the next batch of audits and I will be here to report to \nmy colleagues what those audits show. I hope I can give every one of \nthem Bs and As.\n  The 15 best reports show that the Department of Defense Office of \nInspector General Audit Office is capable of producing quality reports. \nThat number is obviously a drop in the bucket but these fine reports \ncould be a solid foundation for building the future. Repeat them 10 \ntimes and Mr. Blair could well be on his way to creating that world-\nclass auditing operation, one that would be capable of detecting--not \nonly detecting but, because people are going to be so scared of them, \nthat would be capable of detecting and deterring fraud and waste.\n\n  Before those lofty goals can be achieved, Mr. Heddell and Mr. Blair \nneed to tear down some walls. I call them the top 10 audit roadblocks, \nand these roadblocks are these:\n  No. 1, top management lacks a clear and common vision of and \ncommitment to the Inspector General's core mission, a problem that \nadversely affects every aspect of auditing;\n  No. 2, most audits are policy-compliant reviews that yield zero \nfinancial benefit to the taxpayers;\n  No. 3, auditors are not on the money trail 24-7, where they need to \nbe to detect fraud and waste;\n  No. 4, auditors consistently fail to verify potential fraud and waste \nby connecting all the dots in the cycle of transactions. They need to \nmatch contract requirements with deliveries and payments using primary \nsource documents. By making these matchups, auditors will be positioned \nto address key oversight questions such as: Did the government receive \nwhat it ordered at an agreed-upon price and schedule, or did the \ngovernment get ripped off, and if so ripped off by how much money?\n  Roadblock No. 5, most audits take so long to complete that they are \nstale and irrelevant by the time they are published. Reasonable time-\nto-complete goals need to be set and the audit team then can be \norganized with the right skills, the skill sets to meet these goals.\n  Roadblock No. 6, until the Department of Defense accounting system is \nfixed, complex audits will require large audit teams if reports are to \nbe completed within a reasonable length of time.\n  Roadblock No. 7, audit findings and recommendations are usually weak, \nresponsible officials are rarely held accountable, and waste or stolen \nmoney is rarely recommended for recovery or returning to the Treasury.\n  Roadblock No. 8, while relentless followup is an important part of \naudit effectiveness, it is not practiced by the audit office.\n  The last roadblock, No. 9, since the Department of Defense broken \naccounting system is obstructing the audit process, contracts designed \nto fix that system need to be assigned a much higher audit priority.\n  These mighty barriers stand between all the promises and reality. IG \nHeddell and Deputy Blair must find a way to tear down these walls. \nOtherwise, audit reform and transformation will never happen. These \nunresolved issues will demand tenacious watchdogging by my oversight \nteam and by all other oversight bodies as well, including the \nCommittees on Armed Services and Appropriations. My oversight staff \nwill keep reading and evaluating the Office of Inspector General audits \nuntil steady improvement is popping up on my oversight radar screen \nevery day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, as Senators return to Washington this \nweek, we do so amidst a crush of troubling news about the economy. In \nthe past week alone, we have learned that home values across the \ncountry are still falling at a time when about one out of five \nhomeowners already owes more on their home than that home is worth. \nAuto sales are down. Manufacturers are showing the weakest growth in \nnearly 2 years. And there is deep pessimism about the prospects of a \nrecovery anytime soon. So while some in Washington have sought to kind \nof paper over the economic problems or offer weak assurances that a \nrecovery is right around the corner, millions of Americans continue to \nsuffer with no end in sight, and very few people are confident things \nwill turn around anytime soon. It is no secret why.\n  For 2\\1/2\\ years, Democrats in Washington have paid lipservice to the \nidea of job creation while pursuing an agenda that is radically opposed \nto it, and the results speak for themselves. They told us that if we \nborrowed $1 trillion and spent it, unemployment would rise above 8 \npercent. Mr. President, 2\\1/2\\ years later, unemployment is hovering \nabove 9 percent--higher than when the stimulus was signed. They told us \nthat if we spent trillions on a new health care entitlement, we would \nsee health care costs go down. A year later, health care costs are \nexpected to go up. They told us that if we spent money on things we \ndidn't have, such as cash for clunkers, turtle tunnels, solar panels, \nand windmills--in other words, on more government--the recovery would \ntake care of itself. And where has it gotten us? Well, last week a \nsecond rating agency threatened that if we do not get our fiscal house \nin order in a matter of weeks, America's stellar rating runs a serious \nrisk of being downgraded. This is uncharted territory.\n  The warning signs are clear and urgent. Something must be done. The \nfirst step is to recognize how we got here. That is the easy part. The \ngovernment-driven policies of the last 2\\1/2\\ years have clearly been a \nfailure. The next step is getting Democrats in Washington to admit it, \nand that is the hard part. If the last few weeks have shown us \nanything, it is that Democrats in Washington are in a deep state of \ndenial. We have seen their approach to all the warnings.\n  As signs of an economic catastrophe have gathered, Republicans have \noffered concrete proposals for creating jobs and growing the economy. \nWe have offered multiple concrete budget proposals. We have offered \nspecific plans for reining in the crushing cost of entitlements and for \npreserving them. Democrats have offered a 30-second campaign ad of \nsomeone pushing a grandmother off a cliff. As ratings agencies have \nsent up smoke signals about the catastrophic consequences of a \npotential default, Republicans have proposed plans that will rein in \nour deficit and debt and send a clear signal to taxpayers and the world \nthat lawmakers in Washington have the will to live within our means. \nDemocrats rushed to the White House and demanded that the President \nraise taxes. These past weeks should have been a wake-up call for \nDemocrats. They sent it through to voicemail. More concerned about an \nelection that is nearly 2\\1/2\\ years away, Democrats have ignored every \nsingle warning.\n  Americans look at all this, and they ask themselves a simple \nquestion: When will these guys get serious? Every light on the control \npanel is flashing red. Yet, amidst all the bad news this past Friday, \nthe President heads out to Toledo to pat himself on\n\n[[Page S3482]]\n\nthe back for an auto bailout that is expected to cost taxpayers tens of \nbillions of dollars. Nearly 14 million Americans are looking for jobs \nand can not find them. Yet the President, who acknowledges that free-\ntrade agreements will create hundreds of thousands of new jobs, is now \nsuddenly holding them hostage in exchange for even more government \nspending. American businesses want to expand and hire. Yet the White \nHouse has weighed them down with mountains of new regulations and \ncosts, health care mandates, taxes, and conflicting signals about the \nfuture. American energy producers want to tap into our own resources. \nYet the administration is blocking them at every turn. One of our \nNation's biggest and proudest manufacturers wants to build a new \nfactory that would employ thousands and solidify its reputation as an \nindustry leader in the world. Yet the administration is standing in the \nway in order to help their union allies. Since when do businesses have \nto ask the President's permission to create jobs?\n  Most people know that when it comes to politicians, you should pay \nmore attention to what they do than what they say. Never was this truer \nwhen it comes to Democrats in Washington today.\n\n  Just consider this. Three years ago, my good friend the majority \nleader issued a press release blasting the Bush administration on its \napproach to unemployment and debt. He called these figures a casualty \nof the administration's failed economic policies and a shameful legacy \nof the policies of the previous 8 years. At the time my friend the \nmajority leader made that statement, unemployment was 5 percent and the \nnational debt stood at $9.2 trillion. Today, with unemployment above 9 \npercent and the debt at more than $14 trillion, Democrats are silent. \nThey have no plan, no proposals, no sense of urgency. They run the \nWhite House and they run the Senate, and yet their entire approach is \nto sit back and wait--no budget, no plans, just wait for the next \nelection; let Republicans offer solutions, and then we will attack them \nand pretend we care about jobs.\n  That is the game plan. Here is the problem. Unless one is a political \nconsultant or just standing around waiting for a bailout, their plan \nwon't do anything to create a single new job--not one--and it won't do \nanything to address the crisis we know is coming.\n  There is no excuse for inaction. That is why Republicans refuse to \nsit back and wait. Until these crises are met, until we see more jobs \nbeing created, until the American people begin to regain their \nconfidence in this economy, then we will have to be out there proposing \nsolutions, coming up with answers, and making our case. And we will \nkeep at it until our Democratic friends finally start to focus on the \nbattle for America's future instead of the battle over next year's \nelection.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I would like to talk about two subjects \nbriefly this afternoon. The first is the relatively bad news about \nunemployment in the country; the fact that the latest numbers are out \nand the country has not produced as many jobs as had been hoped for.\n  In fact, it added only 54,000 payroll jobs in May and thereby fell \nshort of the 130,000 to 150,000 which are needed each month just to \nkeep pace with population growth. So we lost ground. As a result, the \nunemployment rate has now gone back up to 9.1 percent.\n  It is not just the lack of jobs but also other economic news. Factory \norders were down 1.2 percent in April, so we are not growing there. \nInterestingly, the Home Price Index, which is something very important \nin my State, the S Case-Schiller Home Price Index edged down .2 \npercent in March and is now 3.5 percent from this time a year ago.\n  All of these and other pieces of the news present a very bleak \npicture for economic recovery. One of the interesting commentators on \nthis is Michael Barone, who is well known to most of us involved in \npolitical work. He had an interesting op-ed today in the Washington \nExaminer with the unfortunate title, ``Obama Tunes Out, and Business \nGoes on Hiring Strike.'' The problem is, there is some information to \nback up the title of his piece. He is reflecting on government policies \nthe last couple of years such as growing government spending as a \npercent of GDP, which has gone up from 21 percent to 25 percent.\n  So we have been expanding government borrowing and spending at the \nsame time as the economy is depressed. That included the time in which \nthe failed stimulus plan was supposed to have provided economic growth \nand job creation. It also included the time of the health care \nentitlement, the Dodd-Frank financial regulation bill, and so on. So \nlet me quote from the piece. He said:\n\n       It is hard to avoid the conclusion that the threat of tax \n     increases and increased regulatory burdens have produced \n     something in the nature of a hiring strike.\n\n  In relation to the President's speech at George Washington \nUniversity, where the President had sort of repackaged his Federal \nbudget, Barone says:\n\n       The message to job creators was clear. Hire at your own \n     risk. Higher taxes, more burdensome regulation, and crony \n     capitalism may be here for some time to come.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the article by Michael Barone dated \nJune 6, 2011, printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/06/senate-section/article/S3482-2", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3482-S3485]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            NEW START TREATY\n\n  Mr. KYL. The other subject I would like to address today is news on a \ntotally different front, but it is a subject that will be familiar to \nus from last December when the Senate argued the New START treaty and \nultimately passed it. I am going to speak primarily about questions of \nmissile defense cooperation with Russia, which was a big part of that \ndiscussion.\n  I wanted to first call attention to the fact that the Department of \nState released a fact sheet last Wednesday. It was entitled ``New START \nTreaty Aggregate Numbers of Strategic Offense Arms''--a long title. But \nthe statement from the State Department confirmed what we had argued \nduring the time of this START debate and what I thought was pretty \nwidely understood at the time, despite administration protestations to \nthe contrary; namely that the New START treaty is perhaps the first \nbilateral treaty that resulted in U.S. unilateral reductions in nuclear \nforces.\n  As this fact sheet makes clear, Russia was already below the deployed \nstrategic forces and deployed delivery vehicle limits of the treaty \nwhen we ratified the treaty. This is something we tried to point out. \nWe said this is not a two-way street. Russia has already reduced its \nweapons below the levels called for in the treaty. The only country \nthat will have to reduce levels from what currently exists is the \nUnited States. Now this information is confirmed by the State \nDepartment. Even the Arms Control Association recognized this when it \nposted on its blog recently, on June 1:\n\n       Why has Russia already met its obligations? Because Moscow \n     was in the process of retiring older strategic missiles while \n     the treaty was under negotiation.\n\n  Exactly correct. This fact should not be overlooked, especially not \nas the administration undertakes a review of the nuclear deployment \nguidance and targeting and deterrence doctrines, which are designed, or \nso the administration claims, to be ``preparations for the next round \nof nuclear reductions.'' That is according to the President's National \nSecurity Adviser.\n  I worry that the next round may also be a unilateral round where the \nUnited States makes all of the concessions, as occurred under the New \nSTART treaty.\n  According to Gary Samore of the national security staff, at an Arms \nControl Association Conference, he said\n\n[[Page S3483]]\n\nthese may be ``unilateral steps that the U.S. could take.''\n  Obviously, that is something we would be concerned about if we are \nmaking unilateral concessions while the Russians make none. He made one \nother point at the Arms Control Association. He said:\n\n       We've reached the level in our forces where further \n     reductions will raise questions about whether we retain the \n     triad or whether we go to a system that is only a dyad. Those \n     are important considerations. Reductions below the level that \n     we have now are going to require some more fundamental \n     questions about force structure.\n\n  When we speak of the triad or the dyad, remember the triad is the \nsystem we have had all throughout the Cold War that relies on a \ncombination of ICBMs on land, submarine-based missiles at sea, and a \nbomber force that can deliver weapons from the air.\n  As Mr. Samore points out, if we reduce our weapons levels even \nfurther, we will probably reach a point where instead of all three \nsystems, we will only have two. So I think it is clear we have reached \na breaking point where further reductions will require significant \nchanges to the U.S. nuclear deterrent and could presumably alter the \ncommitments that the administration made to the Senate as to the \nmodernization of deterrent.\n  During our debate on the START treaty, there were a lot of promises \nmade about how we were going to retain the triad, and we were not going \nto eliminate further strategic weapons. Now those matters seem to be in \ndoubt, and this is why, one of the reasons why, 41 Senators wrote to \nthe President on March 22 and asked that the Senate be consulted about \nany further changes that the administration may choose to embark upon. \nAnd I want to be clear, it is a choice. There is no compelling \njustification to change the current U.S. nuclear posture. So this would \nbe something the administration would be doing on its own.\n  But I am concerned that in the National Security Adviser's letter--\nresponding to ours--on May 31 there was no reference to how the \nadministration intended to keep the Senate involved as this process \ngoes forward. I think it makes all the more clear the need to pass S. \n1097, the New START Implementation Act, which provides, as one of its \nprovisions, for the Congress to be consulted before any changes are \nmade to the nuclear guidance.\n  I also look forward to an opportunity to discuss these matters with \nthe President's nominee for Secretary of Defense, Mr. Leon Panetta. I \nwill be curious to learn if he agrees with the 10-year commitments made \nto the Senate last year regarding the modernization of the nuclear \ndeterrent, if he agrees with General Chilton who told the Senate that \ncurrent levels of nuclear forces are exactly what is needed for \ndeterrence, and also whether he agrees with Secretary Gates' recent \ncomments at the American Enterprise Institute that nuclear \nmodernization programs are absolutely critical.\n  So it was on the basis of the administration's commitments to our \nnuclear modernization program that some Senators agreed to support or \nto ratify the New START treaty.\n  Let me turn now to the question of missile defense. During the \nconsideration of the New START treaty, many of us made the fundamental \npoint that with respect to missile defense, there was no meeting of the \nminds between Russia and the United States.\n  While the administration insisted that there were no restrictions on \nmissile defense, either legal or otherwise, the Russian side believed \nthat ``the linkage to missile defense is clearly spelled out in the \naccord and is legally binding.'' That was noted by Russian Foreign \nMinister Lavrov on April 6 of last year.\n  Of course, the administration was never willing to share with the \nSenate the negotiating record that the Russian negotiators obviously \nwere aware of. Sharing the record with us might have cleared up just \nwhat understandings the Russians think they received during the \nnegotiation of the treaty.\n  In order to secure Russian support for the New START treaty and \nassuage their misplaced concern about U.S. missile defense activities, \nthe administration initiated talks with Russia to find common ground on \nmissile defense cooperation, and it cancelled a third site deployment \nin Poland and the Czech Republic.\n  Or, as Under Secretary of State Ellen Tauscher characterized the \npurpose of missile defense cooperation in a speech of May 19, 2010: \n``to turn what has been an irritant to U.S.-Russian relations into a \nshared interest.''\n  Although administration officials might deny this, I believe Russian \nofficials were under the impression that in return for Russian support \nfor New START, the United States would provide Russia not only the \nopportunity for missile defense technical cooperation, but that Russia \nwould also play a role in defining future U.S. and NATO missile defense \nplans. Thus, President Medvedev told the Russian General Assembly in \nDecember 2010:\n\n       I'd like to speak plainly about the choice we face in the \n     next ten years: either we reach an agreement on missile \n     defense and create a meaningful joint mechanism for \n     cooperation, or if we fail to do so, a new round of the arms \n     race will begin and we will have to make decisions on the \n     deployment of new strike weapons.\n\n  As it turns out, we didn't have long to wait until the Russians \nthreatened this ``choice.'' In response to the recently concluded U.S. \nand Romanian agreement to base SM-3 block TB missiles in Romania in \n2015, President Medvedev has again threatened the U.S. and NATO with an \narms race if these planned deployments go forward.\n  On May 18, 2011, President Medvedev told a gathering of journalists \nin Moscow that ``if we don't [forge a missile defense cooperation \nmodel], we will have to take retaliatory measures, which we do not want \nto have to do. This will mean forcing the development of our strike \nnuclear potential.\n  Medvedev went on to reiterate a warning issued by the Foreign \nMinistry that Moscow may pull out of the new START disarmament \nagreement in response to the United States' position on missile \ndefense.\n  This is precisely what many of us predicted would happen if we \nratified the New START treaty in December. I didn't think it would \nhappen quite so quickly.\n  This point was reiterated by President Medvedev following the recent \nG-8 summit in Deauville, France when he said, ``We're wasting time . . \n. if we do not reach agreement by 2020, a new arms race will begin . . \n. I would like my partners to bear this in mind constantly.''\n  The Russians are of one point of mind at the top of their leadership. \nThey are threatening a new arms race. What they mean by that is, the \nUnited States reduces our capability to defend against missiles that \ncould theoretically come from Russia.\n  Is this the reset in relationships the administration promised? Did \nthey manage to reset our relationship right back to the dark days of \nthe Cold War?\n  It appears from the comments of the President of the Russian \nFederation that this is precisely what happened.\n  The Russian Foreign Minister has further said Russia needed ``legal \nassurances,'' that the proposed U.S. missile defense deployments were \nnot aimed at Russian territory.\n  Presumably, even the administration would agree no such ``legal \nassurance'' can be made.\n  But, then again, could the administration include such an assurance \nin the Missile Defense Cooperation Agreement, MDCA, or the Defense \nTechnology Cooperation Agreement, DTCA, the administration is \ndiscussing with the Russian Federation?\n  Again, no Senator nor Senate staffer has been able to see the \ndocument that the administration has shared with Russian counterparts. \nSo, we are left to wonder.\n  Here we are, and the Senate, being part of the American Government, \nisn't even privy to what our administration is talking to the Russians \nabout--matters on which eventually the administration is likely to seek \nour consent to. Remember, the Constitution provides for Senate advice \nand consent. What I have said before is if the Senate is to give its \nconsent, we need an opportunity to provide some advice before the \nadministration negotiates its agreements with Russia.\n  Why not share these documents with the Senate--and the House--and \nremove any cause for concern, if, in fact, there is none?\n  I also note Russian President Medvedev has sent a letter to the\n\n[[Page S3484]]\n\nNATO-Russia Counsel outlining Moscow's position on a common missile \ndefense system--which differs significantly from NATO's conception of \ntwo independently operated missile defense systems sharing some form of \nearly warning data. These are two very different things.\n  And, it is not as if Members of Congress have been ambiguous about \nour concerns.\n  Following a 14 April letter to the President signed by 39 Senators, 4 \nSenators met with Senior Defense and State Department officials on May \n15 to again express our concerns about sharing sensitive missile \ndefense technical and sensor data with the Russians, and to better \nunderstand the content and legal authority of the draft Defense \nTechnology Cooperation Agreement and Missile Defense Cooperation \nAgreement being discussed with the Russians.\n  Moreover, the House Armed Services Committee just incorporated the \nNew START Implementation Act into its version of the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, as well as the amendment \noffered by Representative Brooks that will prohibit the sharing of \nsensitive missile defense technology and data.\n  How will the United States and NATO respond to this latest Russian \nintimidation?\n  Will NATO alter its plans to accommodate the Russian objective of a \n``sectoral'' defense system?\n  Will the United States and NATO curtail deployment of phases III and \nIV of the European Phased Adaptive Approach? Phase IV is, of course, \nstill just a paper missile, not something we developed, but it is part \nof our ultimate plan.\n  Will the United States agree to share sensitive information or \ntechnology with Russia for the sake of a missile defense agreement?\n  The administration informs us that these Russian threats are mere \nrhetoric, associated more with the upcoming presidential elections in \nRussia than with any true threats. And that Russia will not pull out of \nNew START or begin a new arms race in response to U.S. missile defense \nplans. The administration assures us the United States will not alter \nits missile defense plans to accommodate Russian concerns.\n  Nevertheless, the Congress needs better insight into administration \nplans for missile defense cooperation and missile defense talks with \nRussia than has thus far been the case.\n  At the very outset, the administration created a separate venue from \nNew START to discuss missile defense cooperation with Russia--this was \nthe so-called Tauscher-Ryabkov track; despite repeated inquiries from \nCongress, the administration still refuses to provide meaningful \ndetails about the nature of these discussions.\n  Likewise, we are interested to know where the administration will \nrecommend basing a new missile defense early-warning radar, called a \nTPY-2 radar. Will it put the radar in the Caucasus, as the Bush \nadministration planned to do, or will it seek instead to base the radar \nin a location less advantageous to the missile defense of the United \nStates homeland, but more acceptable to the Russians--even if that \nmeans that an ally like Israel will be denied access to the data \ngenerated, by the radar, as Turkey has said it requires?\n  To this end, and as I referenced earlier, 39 Senators sent a letter \nto the President on April 14 to inquire whether, contrary to the \nPresident's December 18, 2010 letter, we will make our missile defense \ndecisions ``regardless of Russia's actions.''\n  The letter expresses serious concerns about reports the \nadministration may provide Russia with access to sensitive satellite \ndata and U.S. hit-to-kill missile defense technology, and urges the \nadministration to share with Congress the materials on U.S. missile \ndefense cooperation that have been provided, or will shortly be \nprovided, to the Russian government. We still await these materials.\n  Lastly, the administration owes Senators information about what \nnational security staff member Michael McFaul, whom I understand has \nbeen recently nominated by the President to be the U.S. Ambassador to \nRussia, meant when he briefed the press on May 26 that ``we got a new \nsignal on missile defense cooperation that as soon as I'm done here \nI'll be engaging on that with the rest of the U.S. government.''\n  I am concerned that my staff asked the National Security staff about \nthis almost a week ago and have heard nothing back.\n  I hope to hear back from the administration soon, especially if the \nadministration expects the Senate to act promptly on Mr. McFaul's \nnomination.\n  Mr. President I am deeply skeptical about the course the United \nStates and Russia are on concerning missile defense.\n  I think it should be abundantly clear that Senators and House Members \nwill be paying very close attention to the development and deployment \nof the European phased adaptive approach to make sure it is done in a \nmanner consistent with the security of the United States, without \nconsideration to Russian ``understanding'' of what they think has been \nagreed to between the United States and Russia.\n  I will be working with my House colleagues to ensure that it is very \nclear that the United States will accept no limitations on its missile \ndefenses. But I note, as I said at the outset, it is interesting that \nthings that were told to us at the time the Senate was debating the New \nSTART agreement have turned out not to be true, just as many of us \npredicted, starting with the proposition that the United States would \nbe drawing our weapons down while Russia would not. It turns out that \nis what happened because the Russians were already at the level they \nnegotiated us down to.\n\n  So the question is, What did we get for our unilateral concessions? \nIt appears to me that the only thing we got is an understanding by \nRussia that they are also going to be able to talk us down from our \nmissile defense plans that could protect both the United States and \nallies in Europe or that as an alternative Russians would be part of a \ncooperative missile defense program which would, of necessity, require \nthe sharing of economic data that would be inimical to the U.S. \nnational interests.\n  I express these concerns in the hope that we can receive information \nfrom the administration that might allay our concerns, persuade us that \nit is not involved right now in negotiations, in effect, behind the \nSenate's back, and the best way to assure us is to share the \ninformation with us that we requested in letters we sent previously. I \nhope the administration will, next time it asks for our consent, be \nable to say it had already asked for our advice because I am afraid, if \nit does not, the Senate is much less likely to provide its consent to \nany agreements that might be submitted.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From RealClearPolitics.com, June 6, 2011]\n\n          Obama Tunes Out, and Business Goes on Hiring Strike\n\n                          (By Michael Barone)\n\n       Last week, I noted that various forms of the word \n     ``unexpected'' almost inevitably appeared in news stories \n     about unfavorable economic developments.\n       You can find them again in stories about Friday's shocking \n     news, that only 54,000 net new jobs were created in the month \n     of May and that unemployment rose to 9.1 percent.\n       But with news that bad, maybe bad economic numbers will no \n     longer be ``unexpected.'' You can only expect a robust \n     economic recovery for so long before you figure out, as \n     Herbert Hoover eventually did, that it is not around the \n     corner.\n       Exogenous factors explain some part of the current economic \n     stagnation. The earthquake and tsunami in Japan caused a \n     slowdown in manufacturing. Horrendous tornados did not help. \n     Nor did bad weather, though only a few still bitterly cling \n     to the theory that it's caused by manmade global warming.\n       But poor public policy is surely one reason why the \n     American economy has not rebounded from recession as it has \n     in the past. And political posturing has also played a major \n     role.\n       Barack Obama and the Democratic congressional \n     supermajorities of 2009-10 raised federal spending from 21 \n     percent to 25 percent of gross domestic product. Their \n     stimulus package stopped layoffs of public employees for a \n     while, even as private sector payrolls plummeted.\n       And the Obama Democrats piled further burdens on would-be \n     employers in the private sector. Obamacare and the Dodd-Frank \n     financial regulation bill are scheduled to be followed by \n     thousands of regulations that will impose impossible-to-\n     estimate costs on the economy.\n       That seems to have led to a hiring freeze. The Obama \n     Democrats can reasonably claim not to be responsible for the \n     huge number of layoffs that occurred in the months following \n     the financial crisis of fall 2008. And\n\n[[Page S3485]]\n\n     Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and Federal Reserve \n     Chairman Ben Bernanke did manage to help stabilize financial \n     markets.\n       But while the number of layoffs is now vastly less than in \n     the first half of 2009, the number of new hires has not \n     increased appreciably. Many more people have been unemployed \n     for longer periods than in previous recessions, and many more \n     have stopped looking for work altogether.\n       It's hard to avoid the conclusion that the threat of tax \n     increases and increased regulatory burdens have produced \n     something in the nature of a hiring strike.\n       And then there is the political posturing. On April 13, \n     Barack Obama delivered a ballyhooed speech at George \n     Washington University. The man who conservatives as well as \n     liberal pundits told us was a combination of Edmund Burke and \n     Reinhold Niebuhr was widely expected to present a serious \n     plan to address the budget deficits and entitlement spending.\n       Instead, the man who can call on talented career \n     professionals at the Office of Management and Budget to \n     produce detailed blueprints gave us something in the nature \n     of a few numbers scrawled on a paper napkin.\n       The man depicted as pragmatic and free of ideological cant \n     indulged in cheap political rhetoric, accusing Republicans, \n     including House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, who was \n     in the audience, of pushing old ladies in wheelchairs down \n     the hill and starving autistic children.\n       The signal was clear. Obama had already ignored his own \n     deficit reduction commission in preparing his annual budget, \n     which was later rejected 97-0 in the Senate. Now he was \n     signaling that the time for governing was over and that he \n     was entering campaign mode 19 months before the November 2012 \n     election.\n       People took notice, especially those people who decide \n     whether to hire or not. Goldman Sachs' Current Activity \n     Indicator stood at 4.2 percent in March. In April--in the \n     middle of which came Obama's GW speech--it was 1.6 percent. \n     For May, it is 1.0 percent.\n       ``That is a major drop in no time at all,'' wrote Business \n     Insider's Joe Weisenthal.\n       After April 13, Obama Democrats went into campaign mode. \n     They staged a poll-driven Senate vote to increase taxes on \n     oil companies.\n       They launched a Mediscare campaign against Ryan's budget \n     resolution that all but four House Republicans had voted for. \n     That seemed to pay off with a special election victory in the \n     New York 26th congressional district.\n       The message to job creators was clear. Hire at your own \n     risk. Higher taxes, more burdensome regulation and crony \n     capitalism may be here for some time to come.\n       One possible upside is that economic bad news may no longer \n     be ``unexpected.'' Another is that voters may figure out what \n     is going on.\n\n  Mr. KYL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal).

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Judge Richard Linn\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on the first day of this millennium, \nJanuary 1, 2000, the newest Federal judge, and the first of the \nmillennium, was sworn in. Richard Linn became a member of the Federal \nCircuit Court of Appeals at the stroke of midnight, standing in the \nFederal Circuit's courthouse, with a view of the Washington Monument \nlit behind him, and the oath being administered by Chief Judge H.R. \nMayer.\n  President Clinton had been told of the hundreds of nominations he \nwould make during his Presidency, one he would never regret would be \nthat of Judge Linn. How true that prediction. Judge Linn has brought \ndignity, expertise, and judicial excellence that could set the model \nfor all our Federal courts. His calm but brilliant analyses of our most \ncomplex intellectual property cases reflect the extensive experience he \nhad before going on the bench. This experience now benefits all \nAmericans.\n  My wife Marcelle and I and our children have been privileged to have \nknown Dick and Patti Linn for over a generation, as well as their \nwonderful daughters, Debbie and Sandy, and all their family. This \nweekend, their children, son-in-law Erik, and grandchildren, Jaret and \nDakota, as well as other members of their family, will gather to unveil \na portrait of Judge Linn. I hope that as people visit the Federal \nCircuit Court of Appeals building or are there on business, that they \nwill pause and look. It will give them a chance to see the face of \njustice and a man I admire greatly.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we go back on the matter \nbefore us, with the time still being reserved to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the majority leader and the Republican leader for \nreaching an agreement for the Senate to debate and vote on the \nnomination of Don Verrilli to be Solicitor General of the United \nStates. By doing so, we were able to vitiate the cloture motion and \navoid another unnecessary filibuster. Had agreement not been reached, \nthis would have been the first filibuster in history of a Solicitor \nGeneral nomination.\n  Mr. Verrilli is by all accounts one of the finest lawyers in the \ncountry, whose extensive experience as an advocate for a wide variety \nof clients will serve him well as Solicitor General, the top advocate \nfor the United States. In a long and distinguished career, Mr. Verrilli \nhas argued numerous cases before the Supreme Court, Federal appeals \ncourts and State appellate courts. He clerked for Judge J. Skelly \nWright on the DC Circuit and for Justice William Brennan on the U.S. \nSupreme Court. Mr. Verrilli's impressive breadth of experience both in \nGovernment and in private practice led the Judiciary Committee to \nreport his nomination by a vote of 17-1 nearly a month ago. Seven of \nthe eight Republican members of the committee joined in supporting Mr. \nVerrilli's nomination.\n  The Judiciary Committee heard from many respected lawyers from across \nthe political spectrum in support for Mr. Verrilli's nomination. Eight \nformer Solicitors General from both Republican and Democratic \nadministrations, among them Republicans Charles Fried, Kenneth Starr, \nTed Olson, Paul Clement and Gregory Garre, concluded: ``Mr. Verrilli is \nideally suited to carry out the crucial tasks assigned to the Solicitor \nGeneral and to maintain the traditions of the Office of the Solicitor \nGeneral.''\n  More than 50 prominent Supreme Court practitioners urged the Senate \nto confirm Mr. Verrilli's nomination, including conservatives like \nMaureen Mahoney, Peter Keisler, and Miguel Estrada. They wrote:\n\n\n[[Page S3486]]\n\n\n       Don's approach to practicing law throughout his career--his \n     meticulousness in understanding and presenting facts \n     accurately and his insistence on coherently laying out \n     reasons for the positions he is urging--proves beyond \n     question that Don will protect and promote the rule of law.\n\n  I will ask that copies of the letters in support be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  Don Verrilli is exactly the kind of superbly qualified, serious \nprofessional we should be encouraging to serve the American people in \ntheir government. I expect that he will be confirmed by a strong \nbipartisan majority of the Senate.\n  Like all of the nominations reported by the Judiciary Committee and \npending on the Senate's Executive Calendar, Mr. Verrilli's nomination \nhas been through the Judiciary Committee's fair and thorough process. \nWe reviewed extensive background material on his nomination. All \nSenators on the committee, Democratic and Republican, had the \nopportunity to ask him questions at a live hearing. All Senators had \nthe opportunity to meet with Mr. Verrilli individually, as well. Many \nalso took advantage of the opportunity to ask him questions in writing \nfollowing the hearing.\n  We then debated and voted on his nomination. I thank the members of \nthe committee for their work, consideration and judgment. Many cited \ntheir meetings with Mr. Verrilli and his serious and thoughtful answers \nto hundreds of written questions for the record as a basis for their \nsupport of his nomination. The result of the process was that Senators, \nhaving raised whatever concerns they had and whatever differences they \nhave with the policies of the Obama administration, voted nearly \nunanimously in favor of confirming Mr. Verrilli based on his \nqualifications, experience and appreciation for the responsibilities of \nthe Solicitor General.\n  I appreciate the effort made by the Republican members of the \nJudiciary Committee in considering the Verrilli nomination on its \nmerits and voting to support him, with one exception. I appreciated the \nthoughtful statement by the ranking Republican at our markup, nearly 1 \nmonth ago, in which he set forth his concerns and the painstaking \nprocess he followed to evaluate the nomination and his judgment to \nsupport him. Senator Grassley attended the hearing, met personally with \nthe nominee, and engaged in extensive written questioning, as well. In \nhis statement he commended Mr. Verrilli ``for his serious approach to \nthe task of providing responses'' and for his ``thoughtful answers.'' \nAfter that rigorous process, Senator Grassley became more comfortable \nthat Mr. Verrilli ``understands the duty of the Solicitor General.'' He \nemphasized that Mr. Verrilli had made clear to him that ``he would not \nlend his name or that of the office to carrying out any order which he \nbelieved to be based upon partisan political considerations or other \nillegitimate reasons'' and that rather than do so, he would resign from \noffice. Senator Grassley concluded that he has ``every expectation that \nMr. Verrilli, if confirmed, will honorably live up to his duties, \nobligations, and assurances.''\n  The committee process left no doubt that Mr. Verrilli has an \nextensive knowledge of the law and an understanding of the independence \nrequired to represent the interests of the government and the American \npeople as the Solicitor General of the United States. He is well \nqualified and well suited to serve in the role of what is often called \n``the tenth Justice.''\n  The Senate has a longstanding practice of giving deference to the \nPresident to make nominations for positions in the executive branch. \nHowever, as we have seen with more and more of President Obama's \nnominations, Senate Republicans have dramatically departed from our \nSenate standards. This does great harm to the interests of the American \npeople, the ability of good people to serve, the capacity of the \ngovernment to fulfill its responsibilities and the proper functioning \nof the Senate. Subjecting consensus nominees to unnecessary and \ndamaging delays and unjustified and harmful filibusters is wrong. I am \nglad the Senate leaders have been able to come to agreement to avoid \nthe threatened filibuster of this qualified nominee to serve as \nSolicitor General of the United States.\n  Before the Memorial Day recess, the Senate should have confirmed the \nnomination of Lisa Monaco to be the Assistant Attorney General in \ncharge of the National Security Division at the Justice Department. \nThat is a key national security position. The Judiciary Committee held \na hearing on Ms. Monaco's nomination in April and reported her \nnomination unanimously in early May. Her nomination has since been \nconsidered by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence at an \nadditional hearing and was reported unanimously by that committee, as \nwell, nearly 2 weeks ago. After such a thorough process, there is no \ndoubt that President Obama has made a first-rate choice to fill this \nvery critical national security position. The value of Ms. Monaco's \nwealth of experience and institutional knowledge has been supported by \nthe many former Justice Department officials who have written in \nsupport of her nomination, including former Attorney General Mukasey, \nwho served during the President George W. Bush administration. Without \ncause or explanation, the Republican leadership still has not consented \nto a vote on this important national security nomination.\n  Even more egregious is the unprecedented filibuster of the nomination \nof Jim Cole to be Deputy Attorney General, the No. 2 position at the \nJustice Department also with key national security responsibilities. \nThere is no excuse or justification for the continued failure to act on \nMr. Cole's nomination to fill this critical position. It was blocked \nlast year when it was pending for 5 months in the Senate. The \nnomination was reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee again in \nMarch, and incredibly, has been filibustered for another 10 weeks while \nthe country faces concerns about terrorism in the aftermath of the \nPresident's successful operation against al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden. \nIt is hard for me to understand how, at a time when experts are \nconcerned that al-Qaida will seek reprisals, the Senate has not acted \nto ensure that President Obama has his full national security team in \nplace. Instead, Senate Republicans have chosen to delay action on those \nnominations and to seek to use them as leverage against the \nadministration.\n  I have urged Senate Republicans to reject this partisan approach and \nto come together to work with our President to keep America safe. In \nthe aftermath of 9/11, we expedited law enforcement nominations, \nconfirming an additional 58 officials to posts at the Justice \nDepartment before the end of 2001. We should have done the same with \nthe nominations of Lisa Monaco and Jim Cole. We should treat Mr. Cole's \nnomination with the same urgency and seriousness with which we treated \nall four of the Deputy Attorneys General who served under President \nBush. All four were confirmed by the Senate by voice vote an average of \n21 days after they were reported by the Judiciary Committee. No Deputy \nAttorney General nomination has ever been subjected to a filibuster \nbefore. It is wrong and should end.\n  I am confident that Mr. Verrilli's qualifications, experience, \nability, temperament and judgment will lead to an overwhelming \nbipartisan vote in support of his confirmation to serve as the next \nSolicitor General of the United States.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \ncopies of the letters to which I referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 February 8, 2011.\n     Re Nomination of Donald Verrilli as Solicitor General.\n\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley: We write \n     in enthusiastic support of the nomination of Don Verrilli to \n     become the next Solicitor General of the United States. We \n     write as lawyers who are deeply familiar both with the work \n     of the Solicitor General and with Don's own work and \n     character. Some of us have worked jointly with Don, some of \n     us have appeared opposite him in cases, all of us have seen \n     his work. We believe that Don is ideally suited to carry out \n     the crucial tasks assigned to the Solicitor General, chiefly \n     the representation of the United States in the Supreme Court, \n     and to maintain the traditions of the office that the \n     Solicitor General leads. We urge the Senate to confirm him as \n     Solicitor General.\n\n[[Page S3487]]\n\n       With experience representing a wide variety of clients, and \n     several years serving the United States from within the \n     government at its highest levels, Don is unusually \n     experienced in the vast range of legal issues over which the \n     Solicitor General is responsible on behalf of the United \n     States. He is a quick study, careful listener, and acute \n     judge of legal arguments. He is a masterful writer and oral \n     advocate who knows the importance of clarity, candor, vigor, \n     and responsiveness. The array of departments and agencies the \n     Solicitor General represents, the Congress that enacts the \n     laws being executed, and ultimately the Supreme Court in the \n     performance of its functions all rely on these qualities in a \n     Solicitor General, and all would be well served by Don \n     Verrilli in that position.\n       As important, the successful functioning of the Solicitor \n     General's office requires an ability to see the effects of \n     particular arguments on the overall interests of the United \n     States, both across agencies and over the long term. Shaping \n     arguments to respect those interests, and to protect the \n     special credibility the office has acquired over the decades \n     of its existence, while maintaining clarity and force in \n     presentations, demands the whole range of knowledge, \n     intelligence, judgment, and other capacities that Don has in \n     abundance. More generally, the rule of law depends on a \n     consistent commitment to reason in the unfolding of legal \n     principles. Don's approach to practicing law throughout his \n     career--his meticulousness in understanding and presenting \n     facts accurately and his insistence on coherently laying out \n     reasons for the positions he is urging--proves beyond \n     question that Don will protect and promote the rule of law.\n       Finally, Don has a deeply ingrained habit of civility. Not \n     only in court, but in private interactions, with co-counsel, \n     colleagues, and lawyers who are adverse to his clients, Don \n     maintains his equanimity and politeness and engages in calm, \n     reason-based discussion. His character will serve the highest \n     traditions of the Solicitor General's office.\n       We expect that the Senate, after full inquiry, will see all \n     the virtues we know from firsthand experience that Don \n     possesses. He is the consummate professional, and we hope \n     that the Senate will confirm Don promptly to serve as the \n     Solicitor General.\n           Sincerely,\n     Richard G.

Verrilli Jr. for the Position of \n         Solicitor General.\n\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman,\n     Hon. Charles Grassley, Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Committee \n       on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley: We have \n     served as Solicitors General in the administrations of \n     Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, William Clinton, \n     and George W. Bush. We write in strong support of the \n     nomination of Donald Verrilli to become Solicitor General of \n     the United States.\n       Some of us have worked alongside Mr. Verrilli as co-\n     counsel; some of us have appeared opposite him in cases; all \n     of us are familiar with his work, his demeanor, and his well-\n     deserved reputation as a leading member of the Supreme Court \n     bar. We believe Mr. Verrilli is ideally suited to carry out \n     the crucial tasks assigned to the Solicitor General and to \n     maintain the traditions of the Office the Solicitor General.\n       Mr. Verrilli's long experience representing a wide array of \n     clients, in combination with his recent experience serving in \n     senior positions in government, render him particularly well \n     qualified to address the range of legal issues over which the \n     Solicitor General is responsible on behalf of the United \n     States. His well-deserved, stellar reputation as both a \n     writer and oral advocate, and his deeply ingrained civility \n     and dedication to the rule of law will well serve all three \n     branches of government. We wholeheartedly endorse his \n     confirmation.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                    Seth P. Waxman\n                                                              For:\n                                        Charles Fried (1985-1989).\n                                     Kenneth W.

Mr. President, I will vote to confirm Donald B. \nVerrilli, Jr., to be Solicitor General of the United States, but I do \nso with little enthusiasm. Mr. Verrilli has impressive credentials and \nnoteworthy accomplishments. In addition to his government service in \nthe White House Counsel's Office and at the Department of Justice, he \nhas been a litigator in private practice for more than 20 years. He has \nargued 12 cases, and participated in more than 100 cases, before the \nSupreme Court of the United States. Mr. Verrilli served for over 15 \nyears as an adjunct professor of constitutional law at the Georgetown \nUniversity Law Center. He clerked for Associate Justice William J. \nBrennan, Jr., of the U.S. Supreme Court, and Judge J. Skelly Wright of \nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n  My concern with this nomination is whether or not the nominee will \ndemonstrate appropriate independence in the office. His testimony at \nhis hearing raised doubts about his ability and commitment to uphold \nthat principle. Mr. Verrilli seemed to buy into the notion that he was \nstill the President's lawyer. He gave lipservice to the two traditional \nexceptions to the Solicitor General defending a statute--first, if the \nstatute violates separation of powers by infringing on the President's \nconstitutional authority; and second, if there is no reasonable \nargument that can be advanced in defense of the statute. Mr. Verrilli \nthen appeared to create a third exception one that is not supported by \npractice or tradition. He stated he would defend a statute's \nconstitutionality ``unless instructed by my superior not to do so.''\n  This position advocated by the nominee--that interference in the rule \nof law, by the President or by the Attorney General, is an appropriate \nreason not to defend statutes--was extremely troubling to me and other \nmembers of the committee. That position is not the standard of the \noffice. It is not what the Nation expects from its Solicitor General. \nHis response gave me great pause about supporting his nomination.\n  Following his hearing, I gave Mr. Verrilli ample opportunity to \naddress my concerns. In extensive written questions I asked the nominee \nto review and comment on testimony given by previous Solicitor General \nnominees. In particular, I asked many questions regarding statements by \nprior Solicitors General regarding the independence of the office. I \nasked him to review cases where the Department of Justice had made a \ndetermination not to defend a statute. I asked him to analyze those \ncases as to the rationale for not defending the statute. In addition, I \nasked him to review and comment on a number of Supreme Court cases that \naddress serious constitutional issues.\n  I reviewed his answers to my written questions for the record. I \ncommend Mr. Verrilli for his serious approach to the task of providing \nresponses. In most cases he gave thoughtful answers.\n\n[[Page S3488]]\n\nIn many instances he declined to provide his views on the topic but \ngave general assertions that he would follow the law. In other \ninstances he claimed confidentiality. I do not agree with his assertion \nof confidentiality in most of the instances where he raised that as a \nbasis for not responding. In other circumstances, such a response would \nbe unacceptable. In the past, such responses, or allegations of similar \nresponses, have resulted in a failed confirmation or withdrawal of the \nnomination.\n  Based upon my review of his responses, I am more comfortable with the \nnotion that Mr. Verrilli understands the duty of the Solicitor General. \nI believe, because of my questions and the time he spent contemplating \nthe issues, he will be a better Solicitor General than he otherwise \nwould have been. Mr. Verrilli has been exposed to decades of thought \nand experience by this review. On the whole, I concluded that Mr. \nVerrilli now has a greater sensitivity to the necessity of independence \nin the office. In numerous answers he provided a much better response \nthan he did at his hearing. He indicated he would not lend his name or \nthat of the office to carry out any order which he believed to be based \non partisan political consideration or other illegitimate reasons. \nRather than do so, he said he would resign from office. I will hold him \nto that pledge.\n  I want to be clear about my tepid support for Mr. Verrilli. He is \nnominated to an executive branch position, not a lifetime appointment. \nMy lukewarm support is based largely on the nature of the office to \nwhich he will be appointed, if confirmed.\n  I will put the administration on notice, as well as Mr. Verrilli, the \nSenate, the media, and any other interested party. My less than \nenthusiastic vote for Mr. Verrilli to be Solicitor General of the \nUnited States is limited to that office alone. No entity or individual \nshould presume my support for Mr. Verrilli for any other future office \nto which he may aspire or to which he may be nominated--be it in the \nexecutive, judicial, or legislative branch of government.\n  Furthermore, as ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, I will \nvigorously carry out my oversight responsibilities to ensure the \nSolicitor General and his subordinates are performing as they should. I \nwill be watching to make certain Mr. Verrilli complies with his oath of \noffice, with his obligation to the Constitution and statutes of the \nUnited States, with his duties of the office, and with the assurances \nhe has given the Senate in his oral and written testimony. I expect \nnothing less from all officials of government. I have every expectation \nthat Mr. Verrilli, if confirmed, will honorably live up to those \nduties, obligations, and assurances.\n\n\n                          Tennessee Tornadoes\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, on Wednesday I traveled to Greene and \nWashington Counties in Upper East Tennessee--up near Virginia and North \nCarolina--to visit with the victims of tornadoes that swept across our \nState on April 27 and to see firsthand how the recovery is going.\n  What I found was what I expected to find. In Washington County and \nGreene County, the citizens are not complaining. They are cleaning up, \nand they are helping each other. I also found out there are some things \nthat still need to be ironed out, but so far the recovery from a \ndevastating disaster is going well in East Tennessee. The real work is \nbeing done by people affected by those storms and by volunteers, and I \nthink it says that Tennesseans are doing what Tennesseans usually do.\n  I first met with Alan Broyles, who is the mayor of Greene County, and \nBill Brown, who is director of Greene County's Emergency Management and \nHomeland Security Agency. Seven people lost their lives in Greene \nCounty. We visited the Camp Creek and the Horse Creek communities. We \nsaw many of the homes that have been completely leveled, and debris was \nstill being removed. We saw one home where a couple--the Harrisons had \nbeen helping neighbors into their basement when the tornadoes swept \nthrough and killed both Mr. and Mrs. Harrison, but spared the lives of \nthe neighbors in the basement. There were two crosses there next to \nwhat was left of the basement structure of the home.\n  At the Camp Creek Elementary School where FEMA has set up a disaster \nrecovery center, I met Pamela Ward and her mother-in-law, Betty Ward. \nMrs. Ward's home had been completely destroyed by the tornado, and her \nhusband Kevin and their three daughters were staying in a hotel after \ndiscovering that the insurance on their home only paid off their \nmortgage. Mr. Brown and Q. Winfield, who is FEMA's Federal Coordinating \nOfficer for Tennessee, immediately began working to help the Wards. By \nthe next day, Mr. Winfield had called to let me know that FEMA had \napproved the maximum award to help Pamela Ward and her family get back \non their feet.\n  I also visited Washington County, where I met with Dan Eldridge, who \nis the mayor of the county, as well as local emergency management \nofficials and families affected by the disaster. One resident was \nkilled in a tornado that touched down in Washington County. Hundreds of \nhomes were damaged. However, it was clear that families and volunteers \nhad been hard at work putting their community back together. Rebuilding \nhad begun, and the debris had already been removed in many areas.\n  FEMA is doing an excellent job working with State and local \nofficials, but the generosity of the volunteers and the entire \ncommunity working in a collective way with the churches to help \nfamilies get back on their feet is an amazing sight. It is still very \nimportant for victims to register with FEMA by calling 1-800-321-FEMA \n(3362). Families are also eligible for other forms of disaster \nassistance, including loans from the Small Business Administration and \nunemployment and food stamp benefits. While we cannot make these \nfamilies whole, there are people who still need help, and we have to \nmake sure they know help is available. I want to make sure that \nwhatever the Federal Government is able to do, it is doing.\n  Over the past year, Tennessee has experienced disasters of historic \nproportions. We know very well we are not the only State or the only \ncommunity where this has happened. Beginning with the 1,000-year flood \nthat struck middle and west Tennessee last May, to the devastating \ntornado outbreak and river flooding this year in both the eastern and \nwestern parts of our State, 74 of Tennessee's 95 counties are currently \nPresidentially declared disaster areas. Thousands of people are still \nrecovering, and many are only just beginning to put their lives back \ntogether. In spite of everything this past year has thrown at us, \nTennesseans are going about their business helping themselves and \nhelping others in remarkable and inspiring ways.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to share a few thoughts about the \nstate of the American economy and the lack of effectiveness of this \nCongress in confronting it--in particular, the lack of the leadership \nof the U.S. Senate to deal with the crisis we are facing both \neconomically and financially as part of our economic condition. We \ncan't separate those two.\n  The leading economic indicators are not good. Last week, we were \npummeled with a series of reports that were bad news. The numbers \ncontinue to be disturbing, actually. The share of our population that \nis employed today declined to 58.4 percent--the lowest level since \n1983. So the percentage of people working today is the lowest we have \nhad since 1983.\n  The May jobs report that just came in fell well short of projections. \nThe consensus view of economists was for a gain of 165,000 jobs, but, \nin fact, we gained 111,000 fewer than that. We had a very low job \ncreation month, and it marks the worst jobs report in 8 months. \nEverybody is saying things are getting better and jobs are getting \nbetter, but this is a wake-up call. The numbers have not been strong. \nThey\n\n[[Page S3489]]\n\nhave actually been very fragile. The jobs have to increase about \n180,000 a month to actually stay level, and to begin to increase, we \nhave to be above that. To reduce our unemployment rate, it has to be \nabove 180,000. So we were far below that this month.\n  The percentage of people who are long-term unemployed--who have been \nunemployed for 27 weeks or more--jumped nearly 2 percentage points to \n45.1. The unemployment rate increased to 9.1 percent from 9 percent. \nHowever, the unemployment rate does not take into account those who are \nunderemployed or who may have become discouraged. That is why we have \nsuch a low percentage of people working. Many are discouraged and have \ngiven up looking for work.\n  Since its peak of 12,800, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down \nnow 698 points or more than 5 percent over the last month. I believe \nthis is the sixth consecutive week the Dow has declined.\n  Consumer confidence is also deteriorating. The Consumer Confidence \nSurvey is down 12 points from its peak in February. It has been \nsteadily going downward. Consumer expectations about the future are \neven worse, falling more than 20 points in the last 3 months, from 97.5 \nto 75.2. The last time we experienced a 3-month drop in consumer \nconfidence of more than 20 points was March 2008, during the heart of \nthe great recession.\n  The Misery Index, which combines the unemployment rate with the 1-\nyear change in inflation growth, hit 12.2 percent, the highest level in \na year.\n  Those are grim statistics. Indeed, I am looking at Barron's and a \nlead editorial by Mr. Abelson in today's issue. This is something he \nexpressed unease about, very serious concern, in his lead column for \nthe Barron's publication. He quotes a report from the Liscio Report, \nPhilippa Dunne and Doug Henwood, and he quoted from their analysis:\n\n       More than a little shocking to Philippa and Doug, and to us \n     as well--\n\n  Referring to himself--\n\n     is that private employment today is 2 percent below where it \n     stood 10 years ago and, as they've noted before, job loss \n     over a 10-year period is unprecedented.\n\n  In other words, over 10 years we have 2 percent fewer people working \nin the private sector--the first time we have ever identified a 10-year \nperiod in our history--and he goes back to 1890--that we have actually \nseen a decline in employment over 10 years.\n  It continues:\n\n       So far, they point out somewhat grimly, ``We've regained \n     just 1.8 million jobs lost in the Great Recession and its \n     aftermath, or about one out of every five that have been \n     lost.\n\n  So we only recovered about one in five of the jobs. We have been \nreading that job growth is out there, but it hasn't been much. It has \nbeen anemic, and so has been GDP growth.\n  He goes on to note that ``the number of folks out of work increased \nby 167,000 and a goodly number of those--44.6 percent, to be precise--\nhave been unemployed for 27 weeks or longer, within crying distance of \nan all-time high. The average stay in the ranks of the jobless has \nreached the longest in the postwar period.'' That is World War II. So \nthat is the longest time we have gone with almost half the people being \nunemployed for at least 27 weeks. So it is not a good situation.\n  We have tried. The Federal Reserve has tried. The Congress rammed \nthrough a stimulus bill that didn't work. I felt it wouldn't work, and \nI explained why at that time, but it passed anyway, adding almost $800 \nbillion, $900 billion to the total debt of our country, and every penny \nof that was borrowed. It has not worked. But we will pay interest on \nit.\n\n  Last year, our highway spending was about $40 billion. The interest \non that stimulus bill will be almost that much unless we find some way \nto start paying down our debt. And there is no plan on the table to \nreduce our debt in the immediate future. That is for sure.\n  So what would I say about where we are today? I believe this Congress \ncannot justify having created a financial situation in which 40 cents \nof every $1 we spend is borrowed. We take in $2.2 trillion, and we are \nspending $3.7 trillion. Every economist has told us in the Budget \nCommittee--I am the ranking Republican there--this is unsustainable.\n  President Bush's highest deficit was too high: $450 billion. Under \nthe first 2 years of President Obama, we have had $1.2 trillion and \n$1.3 trillion added to the debt, and this year, on September 30, we \nexpect $1.5 trillion to be added to our debt. We will have doubled the \nentire debt of the United States under 4 years of his leadership.\n  His budget he submitted to us earlier this year makes the situation \nworse. If you take the basic trajectory of the Congressional Budget \nOffice, the President's budget, even though it raises taxes, raises \nspending more and actually puts us on a more unsustainable path than \notherwise would be the case. Over the 10-year budget he proposes, the \nlowest single deficit is $748 billion, and it is going up to around $1 \ntrillion in the 10th year. These are systemic, unsustainable deficits, \nand they have to be confronted.\n  We have to reduce spending. Everybody knows that. But we are not \nwilling to do so. The Democratic leader, when we had the continuing \nresolution and we had the debate over how much to spend the rest of \nthis fiscal year, proposed a $4 billion reduction in spending. And our \ndeficit will be $1,500 billion this year. He proposed to cut $4 billion \nin this year's continuing resolution. After much fight--and the House \nhad passed $60 billion or $70 billion in spending reductions through \nthe rest of the year--the Senate finally, under the Democratic leaders \nhere, got it down to $38 billion, I believe.\n  We are not facing up to reality. So what do you do? The Fed has cut \ninterest rates to zero. We are spending unlimited amounts of money. We \nhave tried all kinds of gimmicks and efforts--reducing the Social \nSecurity tax, other things--to try to create growth in the economy, and \nit has not worked. I suggest part of the problem is the deficit itself.\n  Professors Rogoff and Reinhart have written a book: ``This Time Is \nDifferent.'' In their analysis, when your debt equals 90 percent or \nmore of your economy, you will show at least a 1-percent reduction in \neconomic growth for that year. This year our debt, which is already \nabout 95 percent of GDP, will be 100 percent of GDP by September 30. So \nthe first-quarter growth numbers were 1.8 percent below what had \noriginally been projected. That was a reanalysis of it--1.8 percent. \nAccording to their theory, it would be 2.8 percent growth if we did not \nhave debt in excess of 90 percent of the gross domestic product.\n  I asked Secretary of the Treasury Geithner at the budget hearing \nwhether he agreed with the Rogoff-Reinhart study, which has received \nquite a bit of attention and a great deal of respectful attention. He \nsaid he did. He said that in some ways the situation is worse than that \nsuggests because we could have an economic crisis. When your debt-to-\nGDP is 90 or 100 percent, that is how you can have a circumstance \nsomewhat like we had with the financial meltdown or like they are \nhaving in Greece.\n  So we have been warned by the fiscal commission Chairman and \nCochairman, appointed by President Obama, Mr. Erskine Bowles and Alan \nSimpson. They testified that we are facing the most predictable \neconomic crisis in our Nation's history--the most predictable. When \nasked when it might happen, Mr. Bowles said 2 years, give or take. So \nwe do not know what is going to happen.\n  I think we have to just grow up, realize that we have placed our \nNation in financial jeopardy, that this country has spent money it did \nnot have to a degree greater than this Nation has ever spent before, \nexcept maybe in the height of World War II when the entire Nation was \nin a life-and-death struggle. We have never spent this kind of money. \nWe have never had these kinds of deficits.\n  Many remember the big fight over spending in the mid-1990s that \nresulted in the balancing of the budget in the late 1990s. That was a \nmuch simpler problem than we have today. I have looked at the numbers. \nI have studied the numbers. To get this country to a balanced budget is \ngoing to take some very serious, sustained work. It is going to be much \nmore significant than it was in the mid-1990s. We simply cannot grow \nthis economy--which is the key to getting ourselves out of the mess we \nare in--we cannot grow it by just passing more taxes. We cannot do \nthat.\n  Congress has to step up to the plate. I remain extremely disappointed \nthat\n\n[[Page S3490]]\n\nthe majority in the Senate did not even bring a budget to the floor \nlast year. We are now at 750-, 760-some-odd days without having a \nbudget. That is one reason we are spending so much money we do not \nhave. We do not even have a budget. It was not even brought to the \nfloor last year. Not a single appropriations bill was brought to the \nfloor and passed last year. Since I have been here--and I guess in 20 \nor more years--our Democratic majority had the largest majority any \nSenate has ever had. They had 60 votes last year in the Senate. It only \ntakes 50 to pass a budget. You can pass a budget without a \nsupermajority, without a filibuster. It is designed to make sure we \npass a budget because it is needed that we pass a budget. But it was \nnot even brought up last year.\n  So what about this year? We have not even marked one up. We have not \nhad a hearing in the Budget Committee to mark up a budget. Under the \nBudget Act, the budget is supposed to be passed by April 15. The House \nhas passed a budget, a historic budget, a sound budget. It changes the \nunsustainable trajectory we are on. It is responsible. It has gotten \nwidespread bipartisan applause for being a serious attempt to confront \nthe financial crisis we are facing.\n  The Senate has not produced anything. Indeed, my good friend--and he \nhas a tough job--our majority leader, Harry Reid, said it would be \nfoolish to pass a budget. And his staff said something similar to the \npress. Foolish to pass a budget? What did he mean by that? Would it be \nagainst the American interest to pass a budget? Would it make our \ncountry less strong financially if we passed a budget? Would it be less \nresponsible to pass a budget than to not pass one? I do not think so.\n  Actually, I do not think that is what he meant. What he meant was it \nwould be foolish politically to pass a budget. So he did not bring one \non the floor last year when he had 60 Senators. He has 53 now. He is \nnot going to bring one up again this year. He would be foolish to. Why? \nBecause when you produce a budget, you have to set forth, for the \nentire world--the financial world, the American people, the political \nworld, the individual citizens of this Republic--what your plans are \nfor the future. What are we going to do? How much are we going to \nspend? How much are we going to tax? How much deficit will be created, \nor surplus, if one is to be found? And it is not going to be found \nsoon--a surplus--trust me. I have looked at the numbers. But we have to \nget on the right path. So he thinks that is foolish. I guess because, \nwell, if he produced a budget, he might have to cut spending and \nsomebody might complain. If he produced a budget and it is consistent \nwith what some of my tax-and-spend friends believe and he has a bunch \nof tax increases in there, that might not be popular. So since it is \nnot popular, we are just not going to do it, while we have the lowest \nnumber of people working in this economy since 1983 and we are 2 \npercent below the number of people who were actually working 10 years \nago.\n  This Keynesian spend-tax-spend idea of how to make an economy grow is \nnot sound. We have tried it. It was done over my objection, but it was \ndone. We threw money at this economy the likes of which we have never \nseen before.\n  Now, the Brits, they are reducing their spending. They are making \nsome tough choices in the UK. And some have been pushing back: Oh, you \nare cutting too much. They are having riots in Greece, where people are \nsaying: You are cutting back spending too much. We have to have this \nmoney. But what did the International Monetary Fund say today? I \nbelieve it was today. They said: The UK, the Brits, stay the course. \nStay with your fiscal responsibility that was initiated by the new \nconservative government. Do not go back to spending. Do not adopt the \nidea that you can create something out of nothing by borrowing money, \nmoney you do not have.\n\n  Of course, Julie Andrews laid that out really well in her song. I \nhave thought and always try to remember: Nothing comes from nothing. \nNothing ever could.\n  You cannot borrow your way out of debt, as one person in Evergreen \ntold me his granddaddy said. We have to face the music. We do not have \nthe money to operate at the level we are.\n  I was at a town meeting in Marion, AL, and an elderly gentleman said \nhe lived through the Depression, he lived through World War II, he \nlived through the great inflation surge in the 1970s, and he sees this \nother challenge we face today. He said the problem is not the high cost \nof living; the problem is the cost of living too high. That just sort \nof closed the meeting. He was the last one to speak. I thought there \nwas a real silence there--the cost of living too high.\n  We have just been living on the idea that these brilliant people--the \nFed and the Treasury and all--that they can just borrow money and spend \nit today, and that will make the economy flower, and we will all be \nsuccessful, and we do not have to worry about paying it off.\n  What is a little debt? Well, we went down that road, and it has \ngotten completely out of control, and we cannot sustain it.\n  We are at a point where our debt threatens our economic growth. \nAccording to Rogoff and Reinhart, it is already reducing our growth by \n1 percent. And if we have 2 percent growth for the year--if we have 2 \npercent growth this year instead of 1.8 percent, as we did the first \nquarter--that means 1 million more people employed. A 1-percent growth, \neconomists tell us, is equal to 1 million people employed. If you get 3 \npercent, 4 percent, 5 percent growth, like we ought to have coming out \nof a recession, then you can have millions of jobs created and change \nthis direction of our country.\n  We have used every weapon we have except common sense and sound \npolicy. So what do we do? How do we get out of the mess we are in? It \nis not going to be an easy road, but we need to reduce spending. We \nhave increased spending in the last 2 years--the first 2 years under \nPresident Obama--24 percent in discretionary nondefense spending.\n  We cannot cut that back to where we were in a previous day? Is the \nUnited States of America going to cease to exist if we reduce spending? \nWe are going to have to. We do not have the money. So we do that. We \nsend a message to the world as the people in England have that we \nunderstand the problem. We know we have gone too far. We are going to \nget on the right road. We are going to put our shoulders to the wheel, \nand we are going to lift this country forward and put it on a sound \npath.\n  We can do that. We will do that. That is what the American people \nsaid they wanted--I am convinced--in this last election. They want some \nresponsibility here, and we owe it to them. I hope and pray that we can \ncome together and make some significant changes in the way we spend \nmoney and the amount of debt that we have.\n  Yes, it might be tough for a while, but we will get on the right \npath. We will get this country going in the right direction. So when we \nare confused about the future, nobody knows exactly what to do, I think \nit is time to take a deep breath and go back to the old verities, the \nold truths that nothing comes from nothing. Hard work pays off. \nBorrowing, borrowing, borrowing is a road to disaster. We need to start \npaying down our debt. The kinds of things we tell our children every \nday, this Nation needs to do.\n  If the world and if the business community in our country saw us in \nthat direction, nothing could be better for our economic growth. They \nwould say: The United States of America has finally got it. They have \ntheir heads on right. They are making the decisions that will lay a \nfoundation for sound, positive growth in the future, and they are not \ntrying to get their way out of the problem they are in by something for \nnothing, some gimmick.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to share some brief \nthoughts about the nomination of Donald Verrilli to be Solicitor \nGeneral of the United States. Solicitor General has been called the \ngreatest lawyer job in the world. It is the position in the\n\n[[Page S3491]]\n\nDepartment of Justice that represents the United States in appellate \ncourts and the Supreme Court. As they said, again, there is no higher \nhonor than to appear in the highest Court in the land and be able to \nannounce that you represent the United States of America. That is what \nthe Solicitor General gets to do and supervises that. It is a very \nimportant position.\n  It requires integrity, independence, and a commitment to the rule of \nlaw. Mr. Verrilli, by the account of quite a number of people, is a \nsmart lawyer with significant experience in appellate matters and is \nrespected as to his integrity and his legal ability. I say that because \nI am not going to be able to vote for him today, but what I am saying \nabout him is not to be personal in any way. I can disagree with someone \nabout their approach to law and still sometimes be able to vote for \nthem.\n  I voted for most of the President's nominees. I supported Attorney \nGeneral Holder's nomination. But what I want to say is, we are in a \nstruggle internationally with a most virulent form of terrorism that \nhas been declared by virtually all objective people as a war. We are \ninvolved in a war on terrorism. That is just what it is. Bin Laden and \nthe people who attacked us on 9/11 had declared war against the United \nStates. They had officially said they were at war with us. Our \nPresident, on occasion, has acknowledged that we are at war. Congress \nhas authorized the use of military force in Iraq, Afghanistan, and \nagainst al-Qaida. We have authorized it. We have not in Libya, but we \nhave in those other instances.\n  So the Department of Justice, of which I was honored to be a member \nfor 15 years as a Federal prosecutor, and U.S. attorney in Alabama for \n12--and I loved that great Department and believe in it deeply. I am \ntroubled by the extent to which it is being led by people who have an \nunwise understanding of the nature of the struggle we are in. One of \nthe ways this plays itself out is to conclude that an individual \naffiliated with al-Qaida was presumptively to be tried in civilian \ncourts like a normal criminal. But under the rules of war, under our \nConstitution and laws, and consistent with the history of the United \nStates, it is perfectly permissible to capture an enemy combatant who \nis threatening us and to put them in jail and detain them, just like \nall prisoners of war have been detained, until the conflict is over.\n  No, we do not give them a trial. They are not entitled to lawyers. \nThey are not entitled to go before a judge. They are prisoners of war. \nThey are held in prisoner of war camps. They have to be humanely \ntreated. They cannot be tortured. We have a specific statute about \nthat, and I know we have had some instances where people said we are \ntorturing. Some say it is not. But that is not the situation today. We \nare not close to the line of what is torture of anybody that is being \nheld in custody today.\n  So the question is, What does the Department of Justice say? Well, \nthey have made the statement that there is a presumption that these \nindividuals should be tried in civilian courts. Congress, after several \nyears of debate, finally passed a law that prohibited the funding of a \ncivilian trial of any of the 9/11 terrorists who have been captured. \nSome have been held at the Guantanamo Bay detention facility. They have \nto be tried, if they are tried, before military commissions.\n  Military commissions have historical precedent. For example, in World \nWar II, Nazi saboteurs entered the United States and attempted to \nattack us. They were captured. Trial was held within a few weeks by the \nmilitary, and most of them were executed promptly. The Supreme Court, \nin ex parte Quirin, held that was perfectly appropriate.\n  Now, we cannot try a normal prisoner of war and execute them. We \ncannot do that. If a prisoner of war, however, violates the rules of \nwar and commits crimes above and beyond the rules of war, then they can \nbe tried and punished appropriately.\n  The 9/11 conspirators and other terrorists are wholly and totally \ncommitted to violating the rules of war. They attack innocent men, \nwomen and children. They attack noncombatants. That is all prohibited \nby the rules of war. They do not wear a uniform. If they want to have \nthe protections of the rules of war, they have to wear a uniform when \nthey go into combat. If they are captured, they have to be treated as \nprisoners of war. But if they have been sneaking into the United States \nsurreptitiously, with a plot to bomb a target and murder innocent men, \nwomen, and children, then they have committed a war crime, and so they \ncan be detained as prisoners of war and can be tried by the military as \nthe war criminals they are.\n  So this has been a big battle, and we went through it for years. On \nthe Judiciary Committee, of which I am a member, we had quite a bit of \ndiscussion about it in hearing after hearing. We somehow have \ntragically convinced the world that the American military is torturing \npeople at Guantanamo, and it is not so. The people who were found to \nhave been waterboarded and that kind of thing, it was not done at \nGuantanamo, and it was not done by the U.S. military. Zero.\n  At any rate, we had all of those debates, and we had fusses. We had \nlawsuits filed, and people were complaining about President Bush and \nall his policies. And we remember that. So now we are here with a \nseries of people being appointed to the leadership of the Department of \nJustice, the law enforcement agency, the top prosecutors in the \ncountry, and those positions are being filled by the people--not who \nare prosecuting terrorists, not who know something about it, not \nskilled professional prosecutors who know how to do this job. The top \npositions are being filled with the people who protested.\n  Attorney General Holder himself has said that these cases ought to be \ntried in a civilian court. The Acting Deputy Attorney General, Mr. \nCole, wrote an op-ed in the Legal Times saying the war on terror was a \ncriminal matter, not a military matter.\n  Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division, Tony West, \ndefended John Walker Lindh, the American Taliban; the Acting Solicitor \nGeneral, Neil Katyal, argued on behalf of Salim Ahmed Hamdan, bodyguard \nand chauffeur for Osama bin Laden, in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, arguing that \nmilitary commissions were illegal. These are some of the top positions \nin the entire Department of Justice: the Attorney General, a Deputy \nAttorney General of the Civil Division, and the Acting Solicitor \nGeneral, and the person who is nominated to fulfill that spot.\n  So Mr. Verrilli, I believe, is a good man. In normal circumstances I \nwould be willing to accept his nomination and vote for him. I am not \ngoing to try to slow it down. I am glad to have the vote and cast my \nvote. I am sure he will be confirmed. But it has been reported in the \nmedia that President Obama has now appointed 13 to 16 lawyers to high-\nranking positions in the Department who themselves previously \nrepresented alleged terrorists or their supporters or were senior \npartners at their law firms when their firms decided to accept alleged \nterrorists as clients. Many of these lawyers, including Mr. Verrilli, \nsupport the view that terrorists are criminals and not unlawful \ncombatants. It is all right to defend unpopular people, criminals who \nare unpopular. It is perfectly all right.\n  But I just want to say, as someone who loves the Department, I am \nconcerned about the positions they are taking on the questions of the \ncivilian trials of unlawful combatants.\n  I think it is wrong, and I have voted for the last one I am going to \nvote for to a top position at the Department of Justice who advocate \nthat view. I think it places our Nation at greater risk. We do not need \nto be treating these individuals in that fashion.\n  As a practical matter, it works out this way. If you apprehend the \nChristmas Day bomber, he is treated as a civilian and he has to be \ngiven his Miranda rights within minutes of being arrested, which say \nthat you can have a lawyer, you can remain silent, and you will be \nappointed a lawyer promptly. He has to be taken before a magistrate \npromptly--letting all his terrorist associates know he has been \ncaptured. He is entitled to discovery in the government's case in short \norder, and he is entitled to a speedy trial.\n  All of those things are part and parcel of the civil process. But if \na suspected terrorist is captured as an unlawful combatant and detained \nby the military, he can be held as a prisoner of war, and he can be \ninterrogated--not\n\n[[Page S3492]]\n\ntortured--over a period of weeks, or months; and the military does not \nhave to appoint a lawyer for them. Unlawful combatants can be tried at \nGuantanamo Bay by a military commission--and potentially found in \nviolation of the rules of war--which is what ought to happen in these \ncases.\n  But that is not the position of the Department of Justice. The \nDepartment has been populated with people who have a different view--I \nthink a wrong view--of it. Although I have great respect for Mr. \nVerrilli and his record, which seems to be a good one, the fact that he \nis another voice in the Department for a wrong philosophy is something \nI will vote against by voting no.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is, shall the Senate advise and consent to the \nnomination of Donald B. Verrilli, to be Solicitor General of the United \nStates.\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, yesterday marked the 30th anniversary of \nHIV/AIDS in the United States. Thirty years ago, on June 5, 1981, the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, published the first \nscientific report about five previously healthy men with what is now \nknown as human immunodeficiency syndrome, HIV, and acquired immune \ndeficiency syndrome, AIDS. Since that report, the face of HIV/AIDS has \nchanged into a global epidemic with over 33.3 million people living \nwith HIV. In the United States, over 1.1 million people are living with \nHIV and almost 600,000 people have died from the disease.\n  For three decades this preventable disease has devastated families \nand communities. But there has also been a global response from the \nresearch community, government, health workers, and patient advocates \nto fight this disease and save lives. This battle has yielded notable \nvictories. In the U.S., prevention has saved over 350,000 lives and new \ninfections have decreased by more than two-thirds since the height of \nthe epidemic. Advancements have been made in HIV testing, which is at \nan all time high with 11.4 million more people being tested in 2009 \ncompared to 2006. Biomedical innovations have created powerful drugs \nthat can transform AIDS from a death sentence into a chronic disease.\n  The advancement in HIV/AIDS treatment is embodied by the experience \nof Keith Green. In 1994, when Keith was 17 years old and still a senior \nin high school on Chicago's South side, he was diagnosed with HIV and \ngiven 10 years to live. Keith's prognosis dimmed his hope of a future \nand he lived day to day ignoring the disease and forgoing medication \nand treatment. When Keith was hospitalized at the age of 25, seriously \nill, and 50 pounds underweight, he assumed his 10 years had come a \nlittle early. Fortunately, during his hospitalization, Keith learned \nabout HIV treatment options and started to envision a future for \nhimself. Today, with the help of medication and community support, \nKeith is a leader in the fight against HIV/AIDS.\n  Keith's story illustrates that progress has certainly been made, but \nthe U.S. must continue to be a leader in the fight against HIV/AIDS. In \nthe United States over 1.1 million people have HIV, but one in five of \nthese people do not know they are infected. Each year 56,300 Americans \nbecome infected with HIV. Most of these new infections are among people \nunder the age of 30--young people who have never known a time without \neffective HIV treatment and who may not fully understand the health \nthreat of HIV.\n  The burden of HIV/AIDS continues to be disproportionately borne by \ngay and bisexual men and African Americans\n\n[[Page S3493]]\n\nand Latinos. While Black Americans represent 12 percent of the U.S. \npopulation, they account for almost half of people living with HIV and \nhalf of new infections each year. We can win the fight against HIV/\nAIDS, but our national strategy must focus on eliminating these \ndisparities.\n  The U.S. has been at the frontline combating the AIDS pandemic. We \nhave established aggressive and effective programs, notably the Ryan \nWhite HIV/AIDS Program and the Tom Lantos and Henry J.

SUSAN STONE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nastounding achievements of a dedicated Kentuckian. Worthy of \nrecognition for her contributions to the advancement of rural health \ncare, Dr. Susan Stone has devoted much of her life to the practice of \nnursing and bettering the lives of women, children, and families around \nthe country.\n  Dr. Stone received her first degree in nursing in 1974 and her \nbachelor's of science from the State University of New York. She \nobtained her doctor of nursing from the University of Tennessee Health \nScience Center, as well as her postmasters in nurse midwifery at the \nvery school she is currently president and dean of, the Frontier School \nof Midwifery and Family Nursing in Hyden, KY.\n  Educated in many facets of medicine, Dr. Stone has worked as a nurse \nand a childbirth educator as well as a certified nurse midwife. Then in \n2001 she found a way to make an even greater contribution to \nKentuckians' health, as she was named president and dean of the \nFrontier School. Following in the footsteps of the Frontier School's \nfounder, Mary Breckinridge, Dr. Susan Stone continues to seek to \nimprove health care in Kentucky's rural and underserved areas. \nExpanding the school over the past 5 years to over 1,000 students from \nacross the world, Dr. Stone has made a major impact on its growth. \nExpected to become the No. 1 education provider of advanced practice \nnurses in the future, the Frontier School now provides master's as well \nas doctoral degrees.\n  About 75 percent of students enrolled in the Frontier School are from \nrural counties, furthering Dr. Stone's vision of improving health \neducation and the availability of health assistance around the State. \nAnd since her involvement with the school, it has recently received \nthree prestigious rankings in U.S. News and World Report.\n  For her incredible hard work and devotion to medicine, Dr. Susan \nStone was named the National Rural Health Association's Distinguished \nEducator of the Year 2011. Kentucky is fortunate to have driven, \nfocused women like Dr. Susan Stone, as she continues to educate and aid \nmore students who will take their practice of medicine around the \nworld.\n  Mr. President, the Leslie County News recently published an article \nhighlighting the life and achievements of Dr. Susan Stone. I ask \nunanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Leslie County News, May 12, 2011]\n\n  Frontier School's President and Dean, Dr. Susan Stone, Named NRHA's \n                   Distinguished Educator of the Year\n\n       With great pride, the Frontier School of Midwifery and \n     Family Nursing announces that Dr. Susan Stone, the school's \n     president and dean, has been named the National Rural Health \n     Association's Distinguished Educator of the Year for 2011. \n     Dr. Stone was honored on May 5 during the 34th Annual Rural \n     Health Conference in Austin, Texas. Dr. Stone's devotion to a \n     career of advancing the education of rural health care \n     providers throughout the United States made her a deserving \n     recipient of this prestigious national award. Dr. Stone, who \n     has led Frontier as its president and dean since 2001, has \n     been instrumental in the growth and success of the Frontier \n     School, a distance-learning graduate school of nursing with a \n     historic campus in Hyden, Kentucky. Today, the school offers \n     nationally rated master's and doctoral degree programs and \n     educates nurses to become nurse-midwives, family nurse \n     practitioners and women's health care nurse practitioners. \n     Enrollment at Frontier has grown from just 200 students in \n     2006 to a current enrollment of over 1,000 students \n     representing all fifty states and many countries. Stone has \n     maintained a focus on educating nurses who will serve rural \n     and underserved populations which is evidenced by the fact \n     that 75% of students enrolled in 2010 resided in rural \n     counties and/or health professional shortage areas. Thanks to \n     Dr. Stone's commitment and leadership, Frontier graduates are \n     most certainly increasing access to quality healthcare for \n     those that need it most. The school was founded in 1939 by \n     the visionary Mary Breckinridge, who years earlier founded \n     the Frontier Nursing Service in the mountains of southeastern \n     Kentucky to provide healthcare to women, children and \n     families. Frontier is considered the birthplace of nurse-\n     midwifery and family nursing in America. Dr. Stone's passion \n     for the vision of Mary Breckinridge, who with her nurses \n     traveled on horseback to deliver care and attend births in \n     Appalachia, is evidenced by the school's continued commitment \n     to educate advanced practice nurses to serve in rural and \n     underserved areas. Mary Breckinridge wanted to see her work \n     replicated throughout the nation and world, and Dr. Stone has \n     embraced that vision by educating students from all 50 states \n     and several countries, taking Frontier's philosophy of care \n     across the globe. Like Frontier's founder, Dr. Stone has \n     devoted her career to improving healthcare for women and \n     families. Dr. Stone received her first nursing degree in \n     1974, later followed by a bachelor's of science in nursing \n     from the State University of New York. Dr. Stone worked as \n     nurse, a certified childbirth educator and later as a \n     certified nurse-midwife in New York, after receiving her \n     post-master's certificate in nurse-midwifery from the \n     Frontier School in 1991. During the '90s, while still \n     practicing, she served on the distance-learning faculty of \n     the Frontier School. Dr. Stone, who earned her Doctor of \n     Nursing Practice degree from the University of Tennessee \n     Health Science Center, has been instrumental in expanding the \n     Frontier School's outreach worldwide, through a unique \n     melding of online learning and real-world clinical \n     experiences. The school recently received three high-profile \n     rankings from US News and World Report: Frontier School of \n     Midwifery and Family Nursing is ranked #13 in Nurse-Midwifery \n     programs, #14 in Nurse Practitioner education programs and \n     #50 in Nursing--among all accredited schools in the country. \n     The work and commitment of Frontier graduates toward meeting \n     rural health care needs could fill an entire book. With Dr. \n     Stone's expert guidance, determination, passion and Frontier \n     school is poised to become the No. 1 education provider of \n     advanced practice nurses to serve rural areas, both \n     domestically and internationally.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/06/senate-section/article/S3493-2", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3493-S3494]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO ERNEST RAY RUDDER\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ndistinguished Kentuckian, a self-described ``jack of all trades'' who \nhas come through for his family, friends and neighbors time and again. \nWhether it is as a teacher, a law-enforcement officer, a fireman, a \nfather, a grandfather or a great-grandfather, people know they can \nalways rely on Mr. Ernest Ray Rudder.\n  Mr. Rudder--or, to those who know him, E.R.--has worn many hats \nthroughout his life. Born in Laurel County, KY, in 1947, E.R. attended \nBush School and Berea College, then transferred to Cumberland College \nwhere he earned his bachelor of science degree in biology and \nchemistry. During his college years he also married his childhood \nsweetheart Judy Hacker, and they have been married now for 44 years.\n  E.R. began work as a teacher, teaching all subjects, including \nchemistry and biology, in Clay, Jackson and Laurel Counties. He also \nworked for many years as a school assistant principal and principal. In \n2000, E.R. retired from\n\n[[Page S3494]]\n\nteaching after more than three decades of service.\n  But an easy retirement spent in a rocking chair was not for E.R. He \nwas one of the charter members of the Bush Volunteer Fire Department, \norganized in 1975. While still serving as a school principal, he had \nworked occasionally as a sworn-in deputy for the Laurel County \nSheriff's Office, transporting inmates. Now in retirement, he renewed \nhis commitment to law enforcement. Recently promoted to administrative \nsergeant, he has worked for the Laurel County Sheriff's Office for the \nlast 2\\1/2\\ years under two sheriffs.\n  ``No matter how small the complaint, it is a legitimate concern for \nthem,'' E.R. says of the people he works to serve and protect. And \nluckily for E.R., he has not gotten into any, as he likes to call them, \n``bugtussles'' of the dangerous variety.\n  E.R. has also worked as a school bus driver, an assistant manager at \na restaurant and as a chemist for the London Utility Commission. He is \na member of Providence Baptist Church and a deacon there since 1985. \nWhen his wife Judy is asked what E.R. does in his spare time, she \nanswers, ``He has no spare time.''\n  Kentucky is lucky to have men like Ernest Ray Rudder, who works hard \nto protect and provide for his family and his community. I am sure his \nwife Judy, his children, his grandchildren and his great-grandson are \nvery proud.\n  Mr. President, the Sentinel Echo recently published an article \nilluminating Mr. Ernest Ray Rudder's life and his career. I ask \nunanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From Sentinel Echo Laurel County, Feb. 21, 2011]\n\n                Rudder Has Lived Every Lil' Boy's Dream\n\n                            (By Sue Minton)\n\n       Have you passed someone on the street or in the mall, \n     looked at them in church or school, or just seen them out \n     your car window and wonder where have they been or where are \n     they going, and what is their story?\n       It's easy to forget that everyone has a story to tell and \n     when we take the time to ask questions and listen, we find \n     that every person has a fascinating story to tell and a \n     unique perspective from which to tell it.\n       Ernest Ray Rudder's--E.R. to those who know him best--story \n     began May 14, 1947 when he was born, at home, to Birchell and \n     Maxine Rudder, the oldest of three children.\n       ``I was born in a little white house on East 80, grew-up on \n     Tom Cat Trail, and moved back to East 80,'' he said.\n       Rudder attended Bush School graduating in 1965 and attended \n     Berea College for 1\\1/2\\ years.\n       He, along with his new bride transferred to Cumberland \n     College graduating in 1969 with a bachelor of science degree \n     in biology and chemistry.\n       Rudder and his childhood sweetheart, Judy Hacker, will be \n     married 44 years in May.\n       ``She was only girl I ever dated,'' he said. ``We met in \n     Sunday School class.''\n       Judy said they met when she was in the eighth grade. E.R. \n     said they met before that.\n       ``But I didn't notice you before then,'' Judy said \n     laughing.\n       ``I noticed you,'' he said. ``With your pigtails and big \n     brown eyes.''\n       ``Her mom, Granny Hacker, was my Sunday School teacher, and \n     Judy was in the class.''\n       After receiving his degree, Rudder began his career as an \n     educator in Clay County, teaching all subjects to seventh and \n     eighth graders at Paces Creek. ``This was an experience,'' he \n     recalled. ``I had some famous people in the class, like Gary \n     Gregory, the current Clay County Commonwealth Attorney, for \n     one. And another was the late Cecil Darrell Hooker.''\n       Rudder remembers there being seven seventh graders and 17 \n     eighth graders in the class. ``I was 21-years-old and one of \n     the eighth-grade students was 18.''\n       Rudder taught at Paces Creek for half-a-year and the \n     following two years were spent teaching in Jackson County. \n     After which he returned to Laurel County, teaching chemistry \n     and biology for 13 years at Laurel County High School.\n       ``I absolutely loved teaching. I loved the part where you \n     could teach and actually see the students experience the \n     learning part,'' he said. ``And when you could really have \n     fun teaching.''\n       ``When you saw them light-up, you knew they `got-it','' he \n     added. ``And the students learned because they wanted to, not \n     because they had to know it on some test.''\n       Rudder said some of his former students are now doctors, \n     attorneys, teachers and Pentagon officers, and unfortunately \n     some who wear orange jumpsuits.\n       After 15\\1/2\\ years, Rudder left the classroom for a \n     principal's position at the former Felts Elementary. For 16 \n     years he held principalships at Felts Elementary (four \n     years), assistant principal at Laurel County High School \n     (three years), and Sublimity Elementary (nine years).\n       Rudder retired in 2000 after 31\\1/2\\ years of teaching and \n     caring for the students of Laurel County.\n       Rudder recalls the ``editorial'' he included in the last \n     newsletter he prepared for his staff and students at \n     Sublimity Elementary. ``I told them `Every little boy wants \n     to be a policemen, fireman or teacher and I have been all \n     three. I have been a volunteer fireman for over 30 years and \n     a part-time policeman. So I have succeeded at what all little \n     boys dream of a I threw 30 some years of teaching in there \n     for fun.''\n       Rudder was one of the charter members of Bush Volunteer \n     Fire Department that was organized in 1975. Except for a \n     couple of years he has been secretary/treasurer.\n       And during his principalship at Sublimity Elementary he \n     worked occasionally with the Laurel County Sheriff's Office \n     transporting inmates.\n       ``I was sworn-in as a deputy in 1994,'' he said.\n       ``And, I once ran for sheriff,'' he added.\n       Retirement for Rudder was short lived, lasting less then \n     two weeks.\n       ``I knew when I retired from the school system that I \n     wanted to work with the sheriff's department,'' he said. \n     ``But, I planned on taking some time off. I left school on \n     June 21 and started at the S.O. July 5.''\n       Ruder has worked for the past two sheriffs and the last \n     2\\1/2\\ years he has worked the roads. He was recently \n     promoted to administrative sergeant, and some of his duties \n     include walk-in reports, accident reports, sending reports to \n     Frankfort and logging, cataloging and transporting evidence.\n       ``I enjoy answering calls, reacting with and helping the \n     people when you can,'' he said. ``I try to help the S.O. have \n     a good image and know that it is serving the people.''\n       When Rudder was asked about taking the administrative \n     position he said he was not dumb enough to think that a 63-\n     year-old man should be out there chasing young punks. ``You \n     are inviting trouble,'' he added. ``And I have been lucky, I \n     have not got into any bugtussles, but I have talked several \n     down.''\n       Rudder said there is something new everyday. ``A lot of \n     times you will hear the same story but from different people. \n     You never know what or who is going to walk in. No matter how \n     small the complaint, it is a legitimate concern for them.''\n       ``People think that everything they see on NCIS or CSI we \n     can do,'' he added. ``I tell them `if Gil Grissom was here, \n     it is untelling what we could do, but in the real world, \n     we're not able to do all that'.''\n       ``Like teaching, I absolutely love working for the S.O.,'' \n     he added.\n       Educating and protecting the citizens of Laurel County was \n     only two of Rudder's jobs.\n       During his teaching career he also drove a school bus, was \n     assistant manager at Burger Queen and was a chemist for the \n     London Utility Commission.\n       Rudder drove a school for 13 years, mostly the Marydell \n     route.\n       ``But, my first route was in the Sinking Creek area,'' he \n     added. ``Judy took over my route when I quit and drove for \n     seven years and today Kay Bowling (Rudder's sister) drives \n     the route.''\n       Rudder remembers his Uncle George driving basically the \n     same bus route 50 years ago.\n       With the jobs Rudder has had and his work schedule today \n     when asked what he does in his spare time, Judy was quick to \n     answer, he has no more spare time.''\n       But Rudder said he doesn't feel like he is pushed. ``I \n     would go crazy if I didn't have something to do.''\n       ``I like to read history and historical books,'' he said. \n     ``Over Christmas I read George W. Bush's new book ``Decision \n     Points.'' Loved it. I'm now reading ``15 Stars.'' I watch the \n     History Channel and classic westerns, ``Pawn Stars'' and \n     ``The Pickers'' with a cop show or two thrown in.''\n       ``He is also clerk, treasurer and Sunday school director at \n     church,'' Judy added.\n       Rudder has been a member of Providence Baptist Church since \n     1964 and a deacon since 1985.\n       When asked how he keeps finances from the church, fire \n     department and home straight, he replied laughing ``Judy \n     takes care of all personal finances, and I take care of the \n     rest.''\n       Rudder said his biggest regret was not being around much \n     when his daughter, Dawn, was growing up. And his biggest \n     rewards are his grandchildren and Easton, his great-grandson.\n       ``Dawn and Marc have grown up so fast,'' he said. ``And \n     what can you say about your grandchildren and great-\n     grandchild. And the hardest thing I've ever faced was when we \n     lost Susan, our 18-year-old granddaughter.''\n       Rudder describes himself as a ``Jack of all trades and a \n     master of none.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/06/senate-section/article/S3494-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3494-S3495]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            INTENT TO OBJECT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \ndedication and selfless service of Colonel Laura J. Richardson, who has \nserved as the chief of the Army's Senate Liaison Division since \nOctober, 2009. As a member of the Secretary of the Army's Office of \nLegislative Liaison, Colonel Richardson was responsible for advising \nArmy senior leadership on legislative and congressional issues and for \neducating Senators and staff on Army matters. Colonel Richardson's \noutstanding leadership and hard work was made clear by the tremendous \nsupport that she and her office provided to the U.S. Senate for both \nsessions of the 111th Congress and the first session of the 112th \nCongress.\n  It is a personal honor and a privilege to recognize Colonel \nRichardson today on the floor of the U.S. Senate. She is a native of \nthe great State of Colorado and was a tremendous athlete at Northglenn \nHigh School. She attended Metropolitan State College in Denver, and \nupon graduation; she was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the \nU.S. Army. She then attended flight school and earned her wings as an \nArmy aviator.\n  Colonel Richardson's career highlights include a variety of command \nand staff positions including three years of service in the 17th \nAviation Brigade in Korea. She went on to serve on the III Corps Staff, \nwith the 6th Cavalry Brigade, and with the 101st Airborne Division, Air \nAssault. She was also selected to serve as the military aide to Vice \nPresident Gore from 1999 to 2001, and following her tour at the White \nHouse, she returned to the 101st to take command of the 5th Battalion, \n101st Aviation Regiment. Colonel Richardson's skill and leadership were \nclearly displayed when she led 5th Battalion into Iraq in support of \nOperation Iraqi Freedom in March 2003. Following her highly successful \nbattalion command, she served in a variety of positions on the Army \nstaff in the Pentagon and as the installation commander at Fort Myer, \nVA.\n  Throughout her service to our Nation Laura has been a shining example \nfor the people of Colorado and the United States. Her selfless service, \nprofessionalism, and outstanding performance in each of her assignments \nled to her recent selection for the rank of brigadier general. This \nwell-deserved promotion will take her to Fort Hood, TX, where she will \nserve the next commanding general of the Operational Test Command. That \nmove will also reunite Laura with her husband, BG Jim Richardson, who \nis currently serving at Fort Hood. I want to say a special thank you to \ntheir daughter Lauren. She is a wonderful young woman, and she is a \ngreat role model for other military children.\n  I am proud to call Colonel Richardson a friend and a fellow \nColoradan. Her tireless work helped to further strengthen the \nrelationship between the Senate and the Department of the Army, and \nthrough her leadership, new doors were opened between our proud \ninstitutions. We will miss her here in the Senate, but I know that she \nwill continue to excel in her next assignment and any endeavor that \nfollows. On behalf of my colleagues and all Coloradans, thank you for \nyour service, Laura, and all the best to you and your family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/06/senate-section/article/S3495-3", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3495-S3496]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NORTH CAROLINA VETERANS PARK\n\n  Mrs. HAGAN.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Peter P. \nHenry for his many years of service to the veterans of our country, \nincluding a very long and successful career spent serving as the senior \nexecutive director of the Department of Veterans Affairs Black Hills \nHealth Care System. He will be retiring in July after 41 years of \nFederal service which includes a 16-year period with the Black Hills \nVeterans Affairs, VA.\n  A strong advocate of personal and professional development, Peter \nenhanced his skills and experience through completion of a graduate \ndegree in health care administration before going on to become \nexecutive director of the Black Hills VA. Throughout his tenure with \nthe VA, he has worked tirelessly to provide services to all South \nDakota veterans, even those from rural and reservation areas, making \nsure that every veteran has access to quality care. During his years of \npublic service, he has provided care to over 400,000 veterans and \ntouched the lives of over 20,000 VA health administration staff \nmembers.\n  In his time with the VA, Peter has received many notable awards, \nincluding the Meritorious Presidential Rank Award. He was awarded this \nprestigious honor in 1998 and 2010. It is awarded to only 1 percent of \ncareer civil service executives who consistently demonstrate strength, \nintegrity, and a persistent commitment to excellence in civic service.\n  I would like to express my personal and sincere appreciation to Peter \nfor his outstanding service to the veterans of our great country. I \nwish him and his family happiness in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/06/senate-section/article/S3496-2", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3496]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/06/senate-section/article/S3496-3", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3496]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/06/senate-section/article/S3496-4", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3496]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n\n                          Enrolled Bill Signed\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 5, 2011, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on May 26, 2011, during the adjournment of \nthe Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the Speaker had signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       S. 990.

A bill to amend the Soda Ash Royalty Reduction Act of 2006 \nto extend the reduced royalty rate for soda ash; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. President, today my colleagues Sen. Barrasso, Sen. Enzi, Sen. \nMerkley, and I are introducing the Soda Ash Competition Act. Soda ash, \nor ``disodium carbonate'', is an industrial mineral used in the \nproduction of glass and other products. In 2006, in response to efforts \nby foreign competitors to subsidize non-U.S. production and gain \ncompetitive advantages in the world market, including the partial \nsuspension of value added taxes, VAT, by China, Congress enacted \nlegislation to provide a partial suspension of Federal royalties on the \nore mined to produce soda ash on Federal lands for 5 years. This \nroyalty relief reduced the Federal royalty rate from 6 percent to 2 \npercent and helped U.S. soda ash producers to remain competitive in the \ninternational market. Over the past 5 years, the U.S. industry has been \nable\n\n[[Page S3500]]\n\nto invest hundreds of millions of dollars in production capacity and \nmaintain its market here and abroad. As a result, American companies \nand workers have provided important economic activity here at home, \nprovided a U.S. export valued at nearly $1 billion a year, all while \ncontinuing to generate tens of millions of dollars to the Treasury in \nmineral royalties.\n  Foreign competition continues to be an issue for the U.S. soda ash \nindustry, including unfair manipulation of value added taxes that would \notherwise be levied on competing foreign supplies. In 2007, China \nresumed its practice of suspending part of the 17 percent VAT on \nsynthetic soda ash to aid its domestic producers. On May 31, 2011, \nmembers of both the House and Senate wrote to Commerce Secretary Gary \nLocke and U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk requesting this unfair \ntrade practice be raised with China through the Joint Commission on \nCommerce and Trade.\n  The current statutory royalty relief authority for soda ash expires \non October 12, 2011, and this bill would extend that authority for five \nmore years. The Department of Interior is currently preparing an \nanalysis, which will provide further information on the impact of the \ncurrent soda ash royalty relief and foreign competition on U.S. \nproducers. This study is required by the same 2006 law that authorized \nthe current royalty reduction in order to give Congress additional \ninformation to consider a future extension. We had hoped that this \nanalysis would have been completed by now and first wrote to the \nSecretary of Interior over a year ago seeking to expedite completion of \nthe Department's work. Unfortunately, the analysis has not been \ncompleted and the statutory clock is ticking. My colleagues and I are \nintroducing the bill at this time because, given the looming deadline, \nthe Senate needs to begin examination of this matter sooner rather than \nlater.\n  We look forward to working with our colleagues on the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee and the Senate to address this issue before \ntime runs out on the current authority and U.S. soda ash production of \nthis important mineral loses this tool to offset foreign production \nsubsidies.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 31, 2011.\n     Hon. Gary Locke,\n     U.S. Secretary of Commerce, Constitution Ave., NW., \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Ron Kirk,\n     U.S. Trade Representative, 600 17th Street, NW.,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Locke and Ambassador Kirk: We are writing to \n     express our continued concerns about China's use of a Value-\n     Added Tax (VAT) rebate to promote its soda ash industry at \n     the expense of U.S. exports. For over two years, China has \n     provided its domestic manufacturers with an artificial \n     incentive to export through a 9% rebate of the 17% VAT. For a \n     number of reasons, we ask that the issue of the soda ash VAT \n     rebate be specifically included on the JCCT agenda this fall.\n       After suspending its VAT rebate for soda ash in July 2007, \n     China reinstated the soda ash rebate in April 2009 to \n     encourage its own exports during the global economic crisis. \n     China's state-supported soda ash industry is the largest in \n     the world and this policy is harmful to its international \n     competitors, particularly U.S. soda ash manufacturers. As you \n     may know, U.S. soda ash has a natural advantage over Chinese \n     soda ash, based on a manufacturing process that is much more \n     sustainable in terms of environmental protection and energy \n     use than the synthetic processes used in China. China's \n     manipulation of the VAT rebate to support its domestic soda \n     ash industry also has wider implications--not only is it \n     economically unjustified, it contravenes China's own \n     interests in shifting energy resources from more productive \n     and efficient industries.\n       We must focus on Chinese policies that are a direct threat \n     to U.S. exports and U.S. jobs. The soda ash VAT rebate is one \n     such policy. Chinese exports compete directly with U.S. soda \n     ash exports in the Asia-Pacific market and beyond. Although \n     the VAT is just one part of China's overall industrial \n     policy, the soda ash VAT rebate is a distinct threat to U.S. \n     manufacturing in a sector where the United States enjoys a \n     natural competitive advantage. If we don't stand up for the \n     pillars of our export-based manufacturers like the soda ash \n     industry--and the U.S. workers employed throughout the soda \n     ash supply chain--we cannot seriously contend we are doing \n     everything we can to support U.S. exports.\n       We ask that the Department of Commerce and the U.S. Trade \n     Representative's Office ensure that the soda ash VAT rebate \n     is raised at the highest levels with Chinese officials at the \n     JCCT meetings this year. The message should be as clear as it \n     is convincing; namely, China should live up to its repeated \n     pledge to discourage the expansion of highly-polluting and \n     energy-intensive sectors such as its own soda ash industry. \n     Policies aimed at promoting soda ash exports, such as the VAT \n     rebate, are inconsistent with China's own stated goals and a \n     direct threat to U.S. interests.\n       We greatly appreciate your consideration of this request \n     and look forward to your response.\n         Senator Michael B. Enzi; Senator John Barrasso, M.D.; \n           Representative David Wu; Senator Joseph I. Lieberman; \n           Senator Robert Menendez; Representative Cynthia Lummis; \n           Senator Ron Wyden; Senator Jeff Merkley; Representative \n           James A. Himes; Senator Frank Lautenberg.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Blumenthal, and Mr. Franken):\n  S. 1145. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to clarify and \nexpand Federal criminal jurisdiction over Federal contractors and \nemployees outside the United States, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, I reintroduce the Civilian \nExtraterritorial Jurisdiction Act, CEJA. The United States has \ndramatically more Government employees and contractors working overseas \nthan ever before, but the legal framework governing them is unclear and \noutdated. To promote accountability, Congress must make sure that our \ncriminal laws reach serious misconduct by American Government employees \nand contractors wherever they act. The Civilian Extraterritorial \nJurisdiction Act accomplishes this important and common sense goal by \nallowing United States contractors and employees working overseas who \ncommit specific crimes to be tried and sentenced under U.S. law.\n  Tragic events in Iraq and Afghanistan highlight the need to \nstrengthen the laws providing for jurisdiction over American Government \nemployees and contractors working abroad. In September 2007, Blackwater \nsecurity contractors working for the State Department shot more than 20 \nunarmed civilians on the streets of Baghdad, killing at least 14 of \nthem, and causing a rift in our relations with the Iraqi government. \nEfforts to prosecute those responsible for these shootings have been \nfraught with difficulties, and our ability to hold the wrongdoers in \nthis case accountable remains in doubt.\n  I worked with Senator Sessions and others in 2000 to pass the \nMilitary Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act, MEJA, and then, again, to \namend it in 2004, so that U.S. criminal laws would extend to all \nmembers of the U.S. military, to those who accompany them, and to \ncontractors who work with the military. That law provides criminal \njurisdiction over Defense Department employees and contractors, but it \ndoes not explicitly cover people working for other Federal agencies, \nlike the Blackwater security contractors. Had jurisdiction in the \ntragic Blackwater incident been clear, FBI agents likely would have \nbeen on the scene immediately, which could well have prevented some of \nthe problems that have plagued the case.\n  Other incidents have made all too clear that the Blackwater case was \nnot an isolated incident. Private security contractors have been \ninvolved in violent incidents and serious misconduct in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, including other shooting incidents in which civilians have \nbeen seriously injured or killed. As the military missions in Iraq and \nAfghanistan wind down, MEJA will no longer cover the thousands of \ncontractors and employees who stay on. The legislation I introduce \ntoday fills this gap.\n  Last month, the Senate Judiciary Committee heard testimony from the \nJustice Department and from experts in the area of contractor \naccountability about the many diplomatic and national security benefits \nof expanding criminal jurisdiction over American employees and \ncontractors overseas. The hearing also explored how best to ensure that \nour Nation's intelligence activities would not be impaired by CEJA. The \nlegislation I propose today has been carefully crafted to ensure that \nthe intelligence community can continue its activities unimpeded.\n\n[[Page S3501]]\n\n  This bill would also provide greater protection to Americans, as it \nwould lead to more accountability for crimes committed by U.S. \ngovernment contractors and employees against Americans working abroad. \nIn the last Congress, the Committee heard testimony from Jamie Leigh \nJones, a young woman from Texas who took a job with Halliburton in Iraq \nin 2005 when she was 20 years old. In her first week on the job, she \nwas drugged and gang-raped by coworkers. When she reported this \nassault, her employers moved her to a locked trailer, where she was \nkept by armed guards and freed only when the State Department \nintervened.\n  Ms. Jones testified about the arbitration clause in her contract that \nprevented her from suing Halliburton for this outrageous conduct, and \nCongress has moved to change the civil law to prevent that kind of \ninjustice. Criminal jurisdiction over these kinds of atrocious crimes \nabroad, however, remains complicated and depends too greatly on the \nspecific location of the crime, which makes prosecutions inconsistent \nand sometimes impossible. We must fix the law to help avoid arbitrary \ninjustice and ensure that victims will not see their attackers escape \naccountability.\n  Ensuring criminal accountability will also improve our national \nsecurity and protect Americans overseas. Importantly, in those \ninstances where the local justice system may be less than fair, this \nexplicit jurisdiction will also protect Americans by providing the \noption of prosecuting them in the United States, rather than leaving \nthem subject to hostile and unpredictable local courts. Our allies, \nincluding those countries most essential to our counter-terrorism and \nnational security efforts, work best with us when we hold our own \naccountable.\n  In the past, legislation in this area has been bipartisan. I hope \nSenators of both parties will work together to pass this important \nreform.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1145\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve the \nprovision of assistance to homeless veterans, to improve the regulation \nof fiduciaries who represent individuals for\n\n[[Page S3503]]\n\npurposes of receiving benefits under laws administered by the Secretary \nof Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today, as Chairman of the Senate \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs, I am pleased to introduce the Veterans \nPrograms Improvement Act of 2011.\n  The bill I am introducing today would allow the Department of \nVeterans Affairs to continue the important work of ending veteran \nhomelessness, improve the quality of the fiduciary program administered \nby VA, improve claims processing and make a number of other \nimprovements to VA programs. This statement is not a full summary of \nall the provisions within this legislation. However, I would like to \nprovide an overview of the major benefits this legislation would \nprovide.\n  The administration recently reported that as many as 76,000 veterans \nexperienced homelessness on a given night in 2009. Many of these \nveterans face significant challenges such as mental illness, physical \ndisability, and substance abuse. In order to heal and remain in stable \nhousing, these veterans will need a great deal of support. I want to \ncommend the VA for working tirelessly to reduce the number of veterans \nsleeping in the streets. We are certainly off to a good start, but I \nrecognize that there is still much more work to be done.\n  This bill will extend the life and improve upon several critical \nprograms in the ongoing effort to get homeless veterans off the streets \nand into secure housing. Current law requires that VA diagnose \n``serious mental illness'' or a ``substance abuse issue'' before it can \nuse its authority to contract for emergency shelter services. In the \ntough economic times this country is experiencing, homeless veterans in \nneed of these services do not always suffer from serious mental illness \nor substance abuse issues, and would not be eligible. This legislation \nwill ensure that these services are available to all homeless veterans \nwho need them.\n  One of the keys to ending veteran homelessness is VA's Grant and Per \nDiem program, which was established to assist public and nonprofit \nprivate entities in furnishing services to homeless veterans. This bill \nwill enhance this essential program by allowing grant funds to be used \nfor new construction, in addition to currently approved uses such as \nexpansion, remodeling, and acquisition. It will also allow grant funds \nto be used as a match for funding from other sources, and will require \nVA to take a hard look at how per diem payments are made in order to \nrecommend improvements. This bill also seeks to include male homeless \nveterans with minor dependents as an additional population with special \nneeds, for eligibility under VA's special needs grant program.\n  The unemployment rate for returning veterans has reached as high as \nhigh as one in five this year. Sadly, we are seeing some of these new \nveterans appearing in homeless shelters. This is not just a VA problem, \nnor is it just a HUD problem--we all have an obligation to collaborate \nand address these unmet needs. To better assist in the effort to end \nhomelessness among veterans, Congress needs more details surrounding \nthe plan to end veteran homelessness. This legislation would require \nthe Administration to expand upon their existing plan and submit a plan \nthat includes details, such as a timeline, benchmarks, and \nrecommendations. We will only be successful if we can work together to \nprovide the appropriate tools to ensure access to medical care, \naffordable housing, and education and jobs.\n  Committee oversight has identified claims where frustrated families \nof veterans and survivors with severe dementia, such as those who seek \nVA pension benefits for home or institutional care see months go by \nbecause VA refuses to accept signatures from representatives or family \ncaregivers. The situation is sometimes resolved by having the claimant \nmark an ``X'' or sign a claims form even when the claimant lacks the \nability to understand what is written on the form. In other cases, it \nappeared that the caregiver gave up and no benefits were paid to \notherwise eligible beneficiaries. This is unacceptable treatment for \nsome of our most vulnerable veterans, and my legislation would improve \nthe quality of VA's fiduciary program.\n  This legislation would make a number of additional improvements to VA \nprograms. It would grow certain servicemembers to be eligible for a VA \nguaranteed home loan. Right now, to satisfy the occupancy requirement \nfor a VA home loan, a veteran or servicemember or their spouse must be \nliving in the home. Under this standard, a servicemember who is a \nsingle parent and is away on active duty is not eligible for a \nguaranteed home loan, even if that veteran's child is living in the \nhome. This is unfair and wrong. Under this bill, a servicemember or \nveteran's dependent child will now satisfy the occupancy requirement. \nThis change will help our servicemen and women better use their VA home \nloan benefits.\n  It is important that our disabled veterans face as few barriers as \npossible when attempting to obtain VA home loans. My legislation would \nallow an individual to receive a fee waiver if, during a pre-discharge \nprogram, he or she receives a disability rating for purposes of VA \ncompensation based on existing medical evidence, such as service \nmedical and treatment records. This change would allow an eligible \nindividual to purchase a home without having to pay a VA funding fee, \neven if he or she has not undergone a pre-discharge examination or a VA \ndisability evaluation. Specially Adapted Housing assistance provides \ncritical support for our veterans in need. This bill extends VA's \nauthority to provide Specially Adapted Housing assistance to eligible \nveterans who are residing temporarily with family members. In addition, \nthe assistance provided to such veterans would be annually adjusted \nbased on a cost-of-construction index already in effect for other \nSpecially Adapted Housing grants.\n  By honoring servicemembers who have died while on active duty, we \nensure that their sacrifice and service will never be forgotten. \nProviding a presidential memorial certificate to the survivors of \nfallen servicemembers is one such way for our country to honor their \nservice. Under current law, survivors of active duty servicemembers who \nhave died are not eligible to receive a presidential memorial \ncertificate. This is because eligibility is limited to survivors of \nveterans who were discharged under honorable conditions. Because a \nservicemember who died in active service is not defined by law as a \n``veteran,'' his or her survivors are not eligible to receive a \nmemorial certificate. This bill would authorize VA to provide a \npresidential memorial certificate to the next of kin, relatives, or \nfriends of servicemembers who have fallen while on active duty. In so \ndoing, we express our country's deepest thanks for that servicemember's \nultimate sacrifice.\n  Addressing the claims backlog and ensuring veterans receive the \nbenefits they have earned is one of my top priorities. One of the \nreasons for the unreasonably long delays that occur in VA decision-\nmaking is the time it takes, often in excess of one and a half years, \nfor the VA to forward an appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals. This \nbill would waive agency of original jurisdiction review over new \nevidence submitted after a veteran has filed a substantive appeal, \nunless the veteran requests it. Presuming a waiver of AOJ review would \nimprove the timeliness of processing appeals, while at the same time \npreserve the veteran's right to request initial review by the AOJ, \nshould he or she so desire.\n  This is not a full summary of all the provisions within this \nlegislation. However, I hope that I have provided an appropriate \noverview of the major benefits this legislation would provide.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1148\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, for the last couple weeks, I \ntraveled to senior centers from Toledo to Youngstown to Columbus to \ntalk with seniors and health professionals about the threats facing \ntheir Medicare benefits. We owe it to our children, we owe it to our \ngrandchildren, we owe it to succeeding generations to reduce our \nNation's deficit. We know almost exactly one decade ago we had the \nlargest budget surplus in the history of our country. We know during \nthe next 8 years--as Congress and President Bush cut taxes mostly on \nthe wealthy in 2001 and 2003, began two wars with Iraq and Afghanistan \nand didn't pay for them, did a prescription drug benefit, a supposed \nbenefit that was, in many ways, a bailout for the drug and insurance \ncompanies and didn't pay for it, and deregulated Wall Street--during \nthose 8 years, we had the largest budget deficit in American history. \nWe went from the largest budget surplus in American history to the \nlargest budget deficit in American history.\n  What we see in the Republican budget now, as we talk about Medicare \nand as they talk about Medicare--ending Medicare as we know it, turning \nMedicare over to the insurance companies--what we are seeing is sort of \nthe same old game, the same old song from people who do not much like \nMedicare; that is, cut taxes on the wealthy again and pay for those tax \ncuts--you have to find a way to pay for them--I guess, pay for those \ntax cuts by cutting the Medicare benefits seniors have earned. That is \nwhat is troubling to me about this Republican budget.\n  Too many Americans are facing a middle-class squeeze, working hard, \nplaying by the rules, finding it still hard to get ahead in this \neconomy. Many parents, many Americans in their forties and fifties and \nsixties are part of a sandwich generation. They are helping their \nparents as their medical costs go up and their parents are not earning \nvery much. They are maybe getting Social Security, maybe something \nelse, and they are trying to pay for their children's college, so this \nis the wrong time, as if there would ever be a right time, to turn \nMedicare over to the insurance industry, Medicare as we know it.\n\n  That is why Senators Cardin from Maryland, McCaskill of Missouri, and \nTester of Montana wrote a letter to the Vice President calling for the \nRepublican plan to end Medicare as we know it to be taken off the table \nduring the deficit reduction negotiations.\n  I want to see our deficit reduced. I want to see us have a long-term \nplan to get our budget deficit under control the way we did in the \n1990s and turned budget problems inherited by President Clinton--\nbequeathed by Presidents Reagan and Bush, inherited by President \nClinton--how we got from a budget deficit to a budget surplus.\n  The statistics behind Medicare are clear. The number of seniors \nlifted out of poverty in these 45 years, the number of families who \nhave the help to care for a parent or grandparent--we can't reverse \nthose gains for the ultimate form of rationing health care for seniors. \nMake no mistake, this is rationing health care. When you shift the \ncost, you give a senior citizen a voucher--you give them an $8,000 \ncheck, and that check goes to insurance companies to pay for health \ninsurance. If it runs short, what happens--and it likely will--they pay \nout-of-pocket. That really is rationing. If you are not a fairly \nwealthy senior and you run out of this privatized Medicare voucher, you \nwill reach into your pockets and pay for it. That is rationing because \nmany seniors won't be able to pay for it.\n  When I hear the terms ``death panels'' and ``rationing'' and all \nthese things that conservative politicians usually enthralled in the \ninsurance industry are telling this Chamber and down the hall in the \nHouse of Representatives--real rationing is when seniors can not afford \nto pay out-of-pocket for their health insurance costs because of what \nthis Republican budget plan does. Their plan calls for vouchers for \nprivate health coverage, doubling their out-of-pocket costs in the \nfirst year alone. The average senior would receive an $8,000 voucher; \nhowever, in the first year of the voucher program, out-of-pocket \nexpenses would, according to the Congressional Budget Office--not a \nDemocratic group, not a Republican group, a down-the-middle group--the \nCongressional Budget Office said seniors' out-of-pocket expenses would \ndouble to more than $12,500 annually. As I said, at the same time, \nRepublicans are going to take these savings to the budget, these cuts \nto senior care, to Medicare, and finance tax cuts for those people who \nearn 10 times or more than the average retirement income of a Medicare \nrecipient.\n  Seniors would see their prescription drug costs explode. In the \nhealth care bill, we cut the costs of prescription drugs to those \nseniors who are in the coverage gap, the so-called doughnut hole, cut \nthem in half. That would go away. In other words, the Republican budget \nplan in my State across the river from the Presiding Officer's State \nwould hand an $89 million prescription drug bill tab to split among \n139,000 Ohio seniors. Tens of thousands of Ohio seniors, thousands of \nWest Virginia seniors, tens of thousands of seniors in the assistant \nmajority leader's State of Illinois would be paying tens of millions of \ndollars in higher drug costs as a result of the Republican budget bill. \nThe Senate voted that bill down, largely along party lines.\n  Republicans continue to want to privatize Medicare, to turn Medicare \nover to the insurance industry. It simply would put insurance companies \nin charge of Medicare. It would put insurance companies in charge of \nthe health of our seniors.\n  Is that what we want? That is why we had Medicare in 1965, because \ninsurance companies were in charge of health care for seniors, meaning \nhalf of the seniors had no health insurance--people over 65 in the year \n1965. Now roughly 99 percent of seniors have health insurance, and that \nis because of this program that most of us dearly love and the huge \nmajority of our constituents in West Virginia, Illinois, and Ohio love, \nand that is called Medicare.\n  Now, Mr. President, put aside all I have said for a moment. Forget \nabout vouchers, forget about privatization, forget about insurance \ncompanies even, and think in a personal way about what Medicare has \ndone in this country.\n  Medicare was created in 1965, passed mostly by Democrats in the House \nand Senate, signed by President Lyndon Johnson in July of 1965. We have \nhad Medicare for 45 years. Think about what it has done. Forget all the \nacademic and policy questions. What Medicare has done is helped people \nin this country live longer, healthier lives. What that means is people \nhave been able to get to know their grandchildren. Somebody who is 65 \nor 70 or 75 or 80, and enjoys generally good health, has had years--\nmaybe decades--of helping to raise a grandchild, getting to know their \ngranddaughter, getting to play with their grandson, all the things \ngrandparents want to do. Senior citizens have had a greater quality of \nlife because of what we call Medicare, and they have gotten to know \ntheir grandchildren better.\n\n  Think what that means to children. They have gotten to know their \ngrandparents better and have gotten the kind of guidance only \ngrandparents can give. Margaret Mead, the great anthropologist, a few \ndecades ago said ``wisdom and knowledge are passed from grandparent to \ngrandchild.'' Wisdom and knowledge are passed from grandparent to \ngrandchild, because we all know if we have children, our kids don't \nalways listen to us but our grandchildren do.\n  I have a 3-year-old grandson named Clayton who lives in Columbus, OH. \nWhen I am in Washington, my wife picks him up a lot of days after \nschool. We don't live in Columbus, but she goes down there and picks \nhim up after school. Every day Clayton gets to spend with his \ngrandmother and, when I am home, every weekend with his grandfather. I \nget to see Clayton not as often as I want but fairly often.\n  What Margaret Mead said is right. Grandparents impart a special \nwisdom and knowledge to grandchildren. Think of the benefit \ngrandchildren have because of their grandparents. I wouldn't have \nlooked at it quite the same way until I had my first grandson 3 years \nago, but I understand that now.\n  That, to me, is the real beauty of Medicare. It has helped this \ncountry's seniors live longer healthier lives and has helped this \ncountry's children be raised in a moral way, in a practical way, in an \neducational way, better than they would have if their grandparents \nhadn't been around.\n\n[[Page S3509]]\n\n  When I hear Republicans say they want to get rid of Medicare as we \nknow it, they want to turn Medicare and senior health care over to the \ninsurance industry, we know what will happen. Seniors won't live longer \nhealthier lives because they will have lost Medicare as we know it.\n  That is why we sent a letter to Vice President Biden--Senator Tester, \nSenator McCaskill, Senator Cardin, and I did--to say, take Medicare off \nthe table. We need to deal with this budget deficit, but don't mess \nwith Medicare while we are doing it. It is that simple.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, later this week we are going to consider \nan issue which is complicated, but it is an issue that affects every \nsingle American who ever takes a piece of plastic and pays for anything \nat a hotel, a restaurant, a convenience store, tuition at a school, or \na charitable deduction to the Red Cross in the midst of a disaster. If \nyou use plastic, every time that debit card--we are talking just about \ndebit cards for this conversation--every time that debit card is \nswiped, there is a fee that goes to the bank that issued the card. One \nmay think to oneself, I wonder how they negotiate those fees. The \nanswer is, they don't. What happens is the credit card companies--the \ntwo giants, Visa and MasterCard, working through the issuing banks--\ndetermine what is going to be charged every time someone swipes the \ncard.\n  What does a local grocery store have to say about it? Nothing. Their \nalternative is to not accept plastic at all. Visa and MasterCard say, \nyou want to use our card, you play by our rules and our rules will tell \nyou how much we take every time you swipe a card. I have seen it \nhappen, and my colleagues have too, where you go into a store and shake \nyour head because that young person in front of you just bought a candy \nbar and is using a piece of plastic to pay for it and you think to \nyourself, Why didn't they reach in their pocket and pull out a dollar \nbill to pay for it. Instead, they swipe the card, and we know what \nhappens. That person selling the candy bar just lost money, because the \nbanks and the credit card companies are going to get that swipe fee \nwhich happens to be more than the profit this little grocery store is \ngoing to make on a candy bar.\n  Naturally, retailers across America have said, this isn't fair to us. \nWe have no negotiating power when it comes to how much is taken out \neach time there is a plastic transaction for debit cards, and the \nconsumers don't know. We know as retailers, but the consumers don't \neven know. There is no transparency. There is no competition. What is \nwrong with this picture?\n  If we believe in a free market, we believe in those two things. We \nought to believe there would be some competition so maybe there would \nbe one debit card company that charges a lower fee. Maybe there would \nbe special consideration given if somebody paid in cash.\n  I guess this dates me, but there was a time when people paid in cash \nfor almost everything, except when they used a check, and that was \nrare. And when they processed the check, it was pennies. Right now, the \nFederal Reserve tells us that for each and every debit card \ntransaction, the average fee charged is 44 cents.\n  When we passed an amendment here last year, we said to the Federal \nReserve, What is the actual cost to the company, the issuing bank and \nthe credit card, debit card company, for processing this transaction? \nThey said, 10 cents or 12 cents, and they are charging over 40 cents on \neach transaction. Who pays it? We all pay it. Even if you walk into a \nstore to pay cash, that merchant has put a price on a good that \nconsiders the fact that most people are using plastic so they have to \nraise the price to cover that fee. So we said to the Federal Reserve, \nSit down and figure out what is reasonable and proportional in terms of \nthe cost that should be collected every time someone swipes a card.\n  Well, this is a big political issue, one of the biggest. One might \nsay it is a multibillion-dollar issue, and it is. Because each month in \nAmerica, over $1.3 billion is collected from customers all across \nAmerica when they swipe their debit cards. Where does the money go? \nMost of it goes to the biggest banks on Wall Street--the same banks \nthat were just moaning and groaning a few years ago about how they \nneeded a bailout because they made some big mistakes. They are back \nagain. They want a bailout when it comes to these debit cards. They \nwant to be able to continue to collect 40 cents and more on every \ntransaction.\n  We passed a law that said the party is over. Starting July 21, there \nwill be a new rule that will establish a reasonable fee, and they have \nbeen fighting this with all of their might, all of their lobbyists, all \nof their workers, all the letters they can send, against this reform. \nWhy? Because it involves huge amounts of money for these major Wall \nStreet banks and credit card companies.\n  We have to bring an end to this. Consumer groups across America, \nlabor groups, and small business groups--retail federations, merchants, \nsaloon keepers, hotel owners, restaurant owners, convenience store \nowners--all across America have said we have to quit this. This isn't \nfair to us and to our customers. Let us have a reasonable amount \ncharged for what is actually taking place with the debit card and we \ncan live with it, but not four times as much as they are charging \ntoday. Incidentally, go up to Canada--not a lot different than the \nUnited States. They have debit cards and credit cards there, issued by \nbanks. Do my colleagues know what the interchange fee is charged in \nCanada today? Zero. No charge. No charge at all to the merchant who \ntakes a debit card to Canada. The same companies, Visa and MasterCard, \ncharge zero in Canada and 40 cents in the United States. Aren't we \nblessed to have two great credit card companies who dreamed up how to \nstick it to American consumers at the benefit of American banks on Wall \nStreet particularly? That is what this is about.\n  Most of my colleagues have gone home over the last week or two and \nthey have heard about this issue because it means a lot to a lot of \npeople. What we did was exempt in this law credit unions and community \nbanks. Some people say, Why did you exempt them? Why shouldn't they \nhave reduced fees too? Well, we want to make sure that financially they \nare not disadvantaged by this, and we put in a specific exemption, sent \nit to the Federal Reserve to write up their rules to protect them. I \nhave said on the floor and I will say it again, if at the end of the \nday the rule from the Federal Reserve does not provide adequate \nprotection for credit unions and community banks, I am ready to sign up \ntoday to put in even more protection in the law. I will be there. I \nwant to make sure they understand. They were exempted because I believe \nthey should be, and I want to make sure that exemption works.\n  But I don't care what happens to the Wall Street banks. I don't care \nwhat happens to these credit card companies. They seem to end up on \ntheir feet when it is all over anyway. After giving them billions of \ndollars in taxpayers' money to bail them out of their mess that they \nmade of things in this recession, what did they do? They sent us a big \nwet kiss in the form of multimillion-dollar bonuses for all of their \nofficers, smiling all the way to the bank with taxpayers' money. We \ndon't owe them a thing.\n  The Members who will come to the floor this week and vote with those \nbig banks and those credit card companies really have to ask \nthemselves: When are you ever going to stand up for consumers and \nretailers and merchants and small businesses across America? Is \nsomebody going to speak up for them in this Chamber?\n  That is what this debate is about, and I hope at the end of the day \nmy colleagues will stand tall and say no to Wall Street, no to the \ncredit card companies; that they will stand by the retailers and \nmerchants, to give them a chance for transparency and competition, to \ngive them a chance for a reasonable--reasonable--fee for what is \nactually transpiring in this transaction.\n\n[[Page S3510]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/06/senate-section/article/S3510-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3510]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10:30 A.M.
