Madam President, Republicans love to talk about taxes. They \nlike them low, we like them high--or so they would have you believe. By \nthat logic, Republicans ought to be lining up to support our payroll \ntax legislation. Democrats propose we cut taxes for 160 million \nAmericans and every single business in our country. The average \nAmerican family would save about $1,500. Yet Republicans appeared out \nof the woodwork to oppose our plan. They do not like these particular \ntax cuts because they are paid for with a small, 3.25-percent surtax on \npeople making more than $1 million a year. But we have learned that \nRepublicans only care about keeping taxes low for a very small group of \npeople. This small group is the richest of the rich.\n  Here is the contrast. One side has Democrats fighting to cut taxes \nfor 160 million Americans who make an average of less than $30,000 a \nyear. On the other side, we have Republicans fighting to keep taxes low \nfor fewer than 350,000 people who take home more than $3 million every \nyear. The contrast: 160 million Americans who make an average of less \nthan $30,000 a year; on the other side, Republicans are fighting to \nkeep taxes low for the richest of the rich--350,000 people who make \nmore than $3 million a year.\n  What is worse, if Republicans get their way, if they are able to give \nthe richest of the rich a pay increase, in effect, taxes will actually \nincrease by about $1,000 a year for 120 million American families. \nEvery American family will have $1,000 less to spend on food, clothing, \nand diapers next year--except those 350,000 people.\n  Republicans can continue to try to protect people who earn an average \nof $3 million apiece. We are not going to do that, not in today's \neconomy. In other words, Republicans are increasing taxes on nearly \nevery American family to protect people who make an average of $37,500 \na week--far more than most Americans make in a year. You can take \nNevada, you can take Kentucky--take Kentucky, the home of my friend the \nRepublican leader. There, 2.1 million middle-class workers will be hit \nwith a tax increase if the Republicans block our proposal. In Nevada, \nwe have fewer people than Kentucky, but the same basically applies\n\n[[Page S8010]]\n\nin Nevada. But in Kentucky specifically, 1,345 Kentuckians earn an \naverage of $3.5 million each, each year, and that will be protected \nthanks to the efforts of Senate Republicans.\n  Why would Republicans throw 92 percent of American families under the \nbus, whacking them with a tax increase beginning January 1, to protect \nthe richest of the rich? Why would they do that? It certainly sounds \nlike political suicide, not to mention shockingly callous policy. One \nmight assume there is a compelling reason for Republicans to stake out \nthis seemingly indefensible ground, to take the side of the top two-\ntenths of 1 percent of American earners while raising taxes on 160 \nmillion others.\n  Here is their reason. They say they want to protect job creators. Of \ncourse that claim is laughable on its face. Our bill would cut taxes \nfor literally every business in America, and for 98 percent of these \ncompanies, these firms, including virtually every small business, it \nwould cut payroll taxes in half, from 6.2 percent to 3.1 percent.\n  I could quote virtually every member of the Republican caucus, all 47 \nof them, singing the praises of small businesses that create jobs \nbecause they have come at various times during this year and previous \nyears to talk about small businesses, what good they do for America. \nAnd I agree with that. You will not get disagreement from Democrats. \nThat is why our bill cuts taxes for every small business in America, \nincluding 50,000 firms in Nevada. Yet legislation that will cut taxes \nfor 92 percent of American families and every single business in the \nNation without adding a penny to the deficit may not get a single \nRepublican vote because it would cost a few incredibly prosperous, rich \nAmericans about 2 weeks of pay.\n\n  To top it all off, Republicans know the tax increase they are \nfoisting on middle-class families would be devastating for our economy. \nThe Economic Policy Institute has stated that this Republican tax hike \nwill reduce GDP by $128 billion and cost almost 1 million jobs--972,000 \nto be exact. That would send our economy back into a tailspin, and it \nis impossible to tell how long would be our recovery.\n  Republicans often say we cannot afford to raise taxes on the top two-\ntenths of 1 percent of American taxpayers, so I ask, how can we afford \na tax increase on 92 percent of American families?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/30/senate-section/article/S8010-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8010]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I know my good friend the majority \nleader may have been a little busy during the last 24 hours. Maybe he \nmissed the news. Reuters said:\n\n       U.S. Senate Republicans Back Payroll Tax Cut Extension.\n\n  The Wall Street Journal says:\n\n       GOP Set to Back Payroll Tax Cut.\n\n  IBD says:\n\n       GOP Open to Payroll Tax Cut.\n\n  U.S. News:\n\n       Mitch McConnell Says Congress Will Likely Extend Tax Cut \n     One More Year.\n\n  CBS says:\n\n       GOP working on alternative proposal for payroll tax cut \n     extension.\n\n  Washington Post:\n\n       ``Majority'' of Republicans likely to back payroll tax cut \n     extension.\n\n  And Fox News:\n\n       Republicans Back Payroll Tax Cut Extension.\n\n  Madam President, this is not an argument about whether we ought to \nextend the payroll tax cut that was enacted last year for 1 year. The \nissue is how do you pay for that, and we have differences of opinion \nabout that.\n  This week, as we all know, the Senate is debating the extension of a \ntemporary payroll tax cut that the two parties agreed to last year to \nhelp those struggling in a bad economy. But before getting into any \ndetail about the various proposals that are being considered for \nextending this temporary tax cut, I think it is important to establish \na couple of things right here at the outset.\n  First, the debate we are having this week is not about whether to \nextend this temporary relief for millions of working Americans out \nthere who are struggling as a result of the ongoing jobs crisis; it is \nabout whether we should help those who are struggling in a bad economy \nby punishing the private sector businesses the American people are \ncounting on to help turn this economy around.\n  The President and Democrats here in Congress are saying we ought to \nrecoup the revenue we will not get from one group of taxpayers by \nsocking it to another group, a significant number of whom happen to be \nemployers. What this really means is that one way or another they want \nthe money coming back to Washington so that the President and his \nallies in Congress can divvy it up how they want, protecting and aiding \nthe politically favored few. This really sums up the whole story of \nthis President and the economic policies he has promoted over the past \nfew years--send your money to Washington so the President and his \nallies in Congress can spend it their way, on things such as turtle \ntunnels or bailing out politically connected investors of failing solar \ncompanies.\n  The Democrats can say they just want some people to pay a little bit \nmore to cover this or that dubious proposal, but what they do not tell \nyou is that 80 percent of the people they want to tax are business \nowners--in other words, the very people we are counting on to create \nthe jobs we need in this country. Think about that. The Democrats' \nresponse to the jobs crisis we are in right now is to raise taxes on \nthose who create the jobs. This is not just counterproductive, it is \nabsolutely absurd.\n  That brings me to my second point, which is this: The only reason we \nare talking about extending a temporary cut in the payroll tax right \nnow, the only reason we are even talking about extending unemployment \ninsurance right now is because President Obama's economic policies have \nfailed working Americans.\n  Democrats and liberal pundits are fond of saying that Republicans are \nrooting against the economy, but it is easy to refute that one. If \nRepublicans wanted the economy to stall, we would just stand on the \nside lines and wave through everything the President and his Democratic \nallies in Congress propose. That is what the Democrats did for the \nfirst 2 years of the President's term, and now we are living with the \nresults. Unemployment is still stuck at around 9 percent, 14 million \nAmericans are looking for work and can't find it, millions more are \nunderemployed or have given up on finding a job altogether, and here we \nare, 3 years into this Presidency, still talking about temporary \nstimulus measures.\n  Republicans will put aside their misgivings and support this \nextension not because we believe, as the President does, that another \nshort-term stimulus will turn this economy around but because we know \nit will give some relief to struggling workers out there who continue \nto need it nearly 3 years into this Presidency. Americans should not \nhave to suffer any more than they already are for the Democrats' failed \neconomic policies.\n  Republicans reject the idea that the way to help people is for the \ngovernment to write them a check every once in a while or adjust their \npay stub at a time of our choosing. We think it is time to get past the \nidea that government should be the sole arbiter of people's futures and \nlivelihoods. We need to get government out of the business of picking \nwinners and losers, and that is why Republicans think the real answer \nis broad-based tax reform that clears out the deductions and the \nloopholes and the special carve-outs for those who are rich enough or \npolitically connected enough to benefit from it.\n\n  If one is a small business owner, we don't think they should have to \nhave an army of tax lawyers on staff to figure out how to keep their \nbusiness profitable and their employees on the payroll. If one is an \nindividual, they should not have to hire an accountant to keep from \ngetting ripped off by the IRS. We think Americans are ready for tax \nreform that makes the system fair for everybody, that levels the \nplaying field so people in small businesses can compete without having \nto beg for favors or beg for loopholes. We are going to keep pressing \nfor it, and part of that is looking beyond these temporary stimulus \nmeasures.\n\n[[Page S8011]]\n\n  Let's be very clear about this. The Democrats' quick-fix approach has \nfailed. Nearly 3 years have passed since Democrats passed the mother of \nall stimulus bills, and we have 1.3 million fewer jobs in this country \nthan we had when the President signed it into law. Yet they are still \nat it. Republicans in the House have passed an avalanche of legislation \naimed at liberating the private sector and getting the economy growing \nagain. It all dies at the Senate door. Democrats are not interested. \nWith Democrats in control of two-thirds of the government in \nWashington, all we get is more temporary stimulus and calls to raise \ntaxes on the very people we are counting on to jolt this economy back \nto life. That is why we are standing here 3 years into this \nadministration still talking about temporary stimulus measures paid for \nby permanent tax hikes--temporary stimulus measures paid for by \npermanent tax hikes.\n  Democrats don't seem interested in doing anything that will lead to \neconomic growth. They are stuck on stimulus. They are stuck on \ngovernment. They are stuck on economic policies that have already \nfailed. So we are not arguing against extending the payroll tax cut. We \njust think it should not be punishing job creators to pay for it. We \nthink that if this kind of temporary relief engineered at some \nlawmakers' whim is the sum and substance of Democrats' plan for getting \nthis economy going again, we are in trouble.\n  The American people don't want a temporary allowance from Democrats \nin Washington. They want us to get out of the way, to lift the burdens \nto growth so they can get this economy going. That is why Republicans \nare proposing a very different approach to paying for this extension. \nWe can maintain this tax relief without raising taxes on job creators. \nIf past experience shows us anything, it is that Washington will only \nspend every dime it gets and then some anyway, when we need to find a \nsolution that doesn't give more power to Washington. We will never get \nthis economy going or help people create the wealth and jobs America \nneeds if we continue to allow Washington to dictate all the rules of \nthe game when it comes to our economy. At the end of the day, the real \nquestion in this debate isn't whether lawmakers in Washington should or \nshould not extend some temporary stimulus but whether the American \npeople should continue to allow Washington to have so much power over \ntheir lives. That is what this debate is about.\n  Mr. REID.

I now withdraw my motion to proceed.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The motion is withdrawn.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, on one of the Sunday shows, the assistant \nleader, the Republican whip, my friend, the junior Senator from \nArizona, indicated that Republicans would not support the withholding \ntax proposal we had made. On Monday, that was what the Senate \nleadership said. So I am very happy there has been a conversion and now \nthey agree to support it but be careful. Remember, they are very clever \nand unclear on how they want this paid for. One Republican Senator said \nhe didn't want it paid for, and that, in fact, has been the standard \nmantra of the Republicans: Tax cuts should not have to be paid for. The \nBush tax cuts, amounting to trillions of dollars, were not paid for. \nThat is, of course, one reason we have this huge problem with the \ndeficit.\n  I think we also have to recognize that one thing our country lacks is \nconfidence. There are a lot of reasons, but one reason the country \nlacks confidence is people out here are talking about how bad the \neconomy is doing. It is doing very poorly, and I recognize that. But we \nhave had growth over the last many months. Is it as significant and as \nrobust as we want? Of course not, but we have a growing economy; that \nis to say about my friend, the prior President, President Bush, we had \nno growth there. That was downhill. When he came into office, there was \na surplus of trillions of dollars. That was taken away with not paying \nfor all these tax cuts, the unpaid war in Iraq, the unpaid war in \nAfghanistan, and at least 8 million jobs were lost. We are trying to \nwork our way out of that, and we have worked very hard.\n  My friend talks about the stimulus bill, the Economic Recovery Act. \nLet's just talk about something I know a lot about, the State of \nNevada. But for that bill, in the State of Nevada, which is very hard \nhit with the economic recovery, a State that for two decades had been \nthe No. 1 place in America to come to start a business, to get a job, \nto buy property, that is no longer the case. That is no longer the \ncase. But the stimulus bill has kept the schools open, has allowed \npeople on Medicaid to continue getting some help, and we have had--\nbecause of that bill--thousands and thousands of jobs created with \nsolar projects, geothermal projects all over the State of Nevada. Is it \nenough? Of course not. But let's start building some confidence and \nallowing people with these companies that have trillions of dollars, \nlet's have them start spending some of it and creating jobs.\n\n  We are for tax reform. I agree with my friend the Republican leader, \nwe should have tax reform. It is important because the Tax Code is not \nworking. It is helping the wrong people, and we look forward to doing \nwhat we can to work that out. I was hoping in the supercommittee that \none of the things they would have given was instructions to the Ways \nand Means Committee and the Finance Committee to come up with some tax \nreform that would be meaningful and build the economy even more than we \ncould have ever dreamed, and a lot of that can be done with tax reform. \nSo I acknowledge that.\n  We look forward to working with my friends on the other side of the \naisle. They say they are in favor of now extending withholding and we \nknow that has created lots of jobs and we are glad they are going to do \nthat. But, I repeat, let's be very careful of how it is paid for. The \nAmerican people believe we should pay for it the way we have suggested. \nThe only people in the world who don't think it should be paid for in \nthe way we suggested are the Republicans in the Senate. All the polls \nshow\n\n[[Page S8012]]\n\nthe vast majority of Americans believe the richest of the rich should \ncontribute a little bit to bringing this country out of the economic \nproblems we have.\n  So I would hope we can move forward. We are going to have a cloture \nvote on this matter soon. We have to get through this very important \nDefense bill, which is to take care of our troops. One of the managers \nof that, of course, is someone we look to for guidance with military \nmatters. That is John McCain, who, as we know, is a certified war hero. \nWhen that is finished, we will work this out on the payroll tax.\n  I hope that prior to the cloture vote having taken place and being \nnecessary, we will have some agreement on how to move forward because \nthere are a lot of other things to do before the end of this year. \nThere are other tax issues that are extremely important that \ntraditionally have been completed before the end of a year such as we \nare in right now.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The last time my good friend the majority leader and I \nhad a discussion on the floor, he reminded everyone he would get the \nlast word. Of course, since he has prior recognition to me, he can get \nthe last word if he chooses. So I will just remind him of that at the \noutset. He will get the last word if he chooses to. I will not fight \nfor the last word, but I will make this point with regard to the \nobservation from my good friend.\n  We have just heard essentially the argument going into next year's \nelection. Argument No. 1 is it could have been worse. That is an \ninspiring message to take to the American people. It could have been \nworse.\n  We also heard argument No. 2. The second argument goes essentially \nlike this: After being in the administration in power for 3 years, No. \n1, it is George Bush's fault. Among other causes of our current dilemma \nthat have been cited by the President and others, in addition to the \nprevious administration, it was a tsunami in Japan, it is the European \ndebt crisis, of course it is the Republicans in Congress, it is those \nmillionaires, it is those people in Wall Street. In short, it is \neverybody's fault but ours. That is the argument they are left with \nwhen they are going into an election year facing the American people \nand they have nothing else to say.\n  People don't think the stimulus worked. People don't like ObamaCare. \nThey don't like Dodd-Frank. There is absolutely nothing, in terms of \npositive accomplishment, our good friends can cite; thus the argument: \nIt is anybody's fault but mine.\n  It will be an interesting discussion going into next year, but it \nstrikes me that our job in the Senate is not to frame campaign \narguments on a weekly basis but actually try to get something done. As \nmy friend indicated, there are things that need to be done before the \nend of this year: The Defense authorization bill that we will finish \nthis week, the appropriations bills in one way or another--either a \ncombination of them or a continuing resolution, each of them, through \nthe end of the next fiscal year.\n  We have tax extenders. We have the doc fix. We have the completion, \nin spite of the exercise we will engage in tomorrow, with two \napproaches to continuing the payroll tax extension. I have already \nindicated the overwhelming majority of Republicans think it should be \nextended, and so we will have to figure out how to package that and \nactually accomplish something, not just come out on the floor and score \npolitical points but actually accomplish something for the American \npeople on things such as unemployment insurance, extension of the \npayroll tax reduction enacted a year ago, and the doc fix. These are \nthe kinds of things that actually have to be done. The more time we \nspend on the floor with these political messaging votes, the less time \nwe actually have to do what the American people sent us to do.\n  So I will be working with my friend, the majority leader. I mean, we \nwork together every day. When we get past the political speeches and \nthe show votes, there are things that need to be done, and we will be \nworking together to get those things accomplished before Christmas.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I agree with virtually everything the Republican leader \nsaid. I do think the Presidential election will be based on what took \nplace in the Bush administration and how we have tried to recover from \nthat, and how things have been exacerbated because of the tsunami and \nbecause of the European debt crisis.\n  I also agree wholeheartedly with my friend that we need to work \ntogether the rest of this Congress. It is difficult to do, but we need \nto set aside Presidential politics and work in our sphere as \nlegislative leaders to try to move this country along. So I look \nforward to that, and I appreciate the constructive remarks of my \nfriend.\n  Madam President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/30/senate-section/article/S8012-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8012]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

It is \nsimply a group of amendments that have been proposed by Members on both \nsides of the aisle, approved--no one has objected--and yet there are \nobjections to moving forward with these amendments in a package. There \nare important amendments by Members on both sides.\n  I would urge my colleagues who would object to moving forward with \nthis package of amendments which have been agreed to by both sides--and \nthere has been no objection voiced to them individually--that I would \nlike to move to adopt those shortly before the vote on cloture at 11 \no'clock. If someone objects to that, then I would insist that they come \nover to the floor and object. That is the procedure we will follow that \nI would like to inform my colleagues.\n  In other words, we have a group of amendments. They have been cleared \nby both sides; no one objects. And yet there seems to be an objection \nto moving forward with a group of amendments that has already been \nagreed to. So according to parliamentary rules, I will insist that the \nMember be here present to object when I move forward with the package \nshortly before the hour of 11. Anyone watching in the offices, please \ninform your Senator of that decision.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, just to reinforce something the Senator \nfrom Arizona said, these are amendments there is no objection to on the \nsubstance. We have worked very hard, working with all the Senators, to \nclear amendments. That process will continue after the cloture vote as \nwell. But we now have this group we have worked very hard on. We know \nof no objection. If there were an objection, they would not be in a \ncleared package. So we know of no objection. None have been \nforthcoming. They have been here for a day or two now, and the Senate \nneeds to work its will.\n  This is the way we should be operating, if there is no objection to \nan amendment, if people have had a chance to look at it. They have been \ncleared on both sides. Any committee on jurisdiction that has an \ninterest has been talked to, and that has been taken care of. This is, \nit seems to me, the right way to proceed.\n  I commend Senator McCain for what he just said and join with him in \nthat sentiment.\n  The bill we have before us that we will be voting cloture on at about \n11 o'clock would authorize $662 billion for national defense programs. \nThis is $27 billion less than the President's budget request. It is $43 \nbillion less than the amount appropriated for fiscal year 2011. We have \nbeen able to find savings without reducing our strong commitment to the \nmen and women of our Armed Forces and their families, without \nundermining their ability to accomplish the mission we have assigned to \nthem that they handle so remarkably bravely and consistently. So we \nhave identified and scrubbed this budget to find those savings, and the \nbill we will be voting cloture on--and, hopefully, adopting cloture--\nreflects those savings.\n  Because of our action last night on the counterfeit parts amendment, \nthe bill now contains important new provisions to help fight the tide \nof counterfeit electronic parts, primarily from China, that is flooding \nthe defense supply chain. I went through the provisions last night, and \nI will not repeat them here other than to say we are taking strong \naction to make sure the parts that are provided to our weapons systems \nare new parts as required and are not counterfeit parts.\n  There are a number of steps in this bill. They are effective and \nstrong steps. We require, for instance, that parts that are being \nsupplied come from the original manufacturer of those parts or an \nauthorized distributor of those parts or, if that is not possible \nbecause the parts are no longer being manufactured or there is no \nauthorized distributor, that whoever is supplying those parts be \ncertified by the Department of Defense, the way they currently are, by \none part of the Department of Defense, the Missile Defense Agency, as \nbeing a reliable supplier.\n  We have had too many cases of missiles and airplanes that have \ndefective parts, and the lives of our people in uniform depend upon \nthese as being quality parts. We are not going to accept the status quo \nanymore in terms of counterfeiting, mainly from China, and we are \ntaking this strong action in\n\n[[Page S8015]]\n\nthis bill now, following last night's action, to make sure this status \nquo is reversed.\n  We have over 96,000 U.S. soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines on \nthe ground in Afghanistan. We have 13,000, as we speak, remaining in \nIraq. There are many issues upon which we disagree. But every one of us \nknows we must provide our troops with the support they need and deserve \nas long as they are in harm's way. Senate action on the Defense bill \nwill improve the quality of life for our men and women in uniform. It \nwill give them the tools they need to remain the most effective \nfighting force in the world, and it will also send a critically \nimportant message that we as a nation stand behind our troops and their \nfamilies and we appreciate their service.\n  So I hope we can adopt the cloture motion which is before us so we \ncan proceed to the postcloture period, where we can then resolve the \nremaining amendments that can be resolved, and then pass this bill, \nhopefully, tomorrow. But we have a lot of work to do today and \ntomorrow. We have many dozens of amendments yet to be voted on, \ndisposed of, and hopefully cleared in many cases.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, the following amendments have been \ncleared by myself and the ranking member. We have cleared a number of \namendments on both sides. We are working with many Members. There will \nbe an additional package after this one. We are going to continue to \ntry to clear amendments. We expect that we will. We know of no \nobjection to any of the following amendments despite their being \navailable for review.\n  They are amendments numbered: 1056 on behalf of Senator Wicker, 1066 \non behalf of Senator Ayotte, 1102 on behalf of Senator Inhofe, 1116 on \nbehalf of Senator Wicker, 1122 on behalf of Senator Shaheen, 1129 on \nbehalf of Senator Reid, 1130 on behalf of Senator Reid, 1132 on behalf \nof Senator McCain, 1134 on behalf of Senator Blunt, 1143 on behalf of \nSenators Hagan and Portman, 1149, as modified by changes at the desk, \non behalf of Senator Begich, 1162 on behalf of Senator Warner, 1164 on \nbehalf of Senator Warner, 1165 on behalf of Senator Warner, 1166, on \nbehalf of Senator Warner, 1167, as modified by changes at the desk, on \nbehalf of Senator Warner, 1178, as modified by changes at the desk, on \nbehalf of Senator Murray, 1180, as modified by changes at the desk, on \nbehalf of Senator Collins, 1183, as modified by changes at the desk, on \nbehalf of Senator Sessions, 1207 on behalf of Senator Coburn, 1210 on \nbehalf of Senator Nelson (FL), 1227 on behalf of Senators McCain and \nPortman, 1215, as modified by changes at the desk, on behalf of Senator \nCasey, 1228 on behalf of Senators McCain and Portman, 1237 on behalf of \nSenator Shaheen, 1240 on behalf of Senator Warner, 1245 on behalf of \nSenator McCain, 1250 on behalf of Senator McCain, 1266 on behalf of \nSenator Warner, 1276 on behalf of Senator Baucus, 1280 on behalf of \nSenator McCain, 1281, as modified, on behalf of Senator McCain, 1298 on \nbehalf of Senators Webb and Graham, 1301 on behalf of Senator Levin, \n1303 on behalf of Senators Levin and McCain, 1315 on behalf of Senator \nHatch, 1317 on behalf of Senator Portman, 1324 on behalf of Senator \nCochran, 1326 on behalf of Senator Risch, and 1332 on behalf of \nSenators Lieberman and Cornyn.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. They have been cleared on this side.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nconsider these amendments en bloc, that the modifications at the desk \nbe adopted, the amendments be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank Senator McCain and our staffs. We are going to \ncontinue to work to clear additional amendments following the cloture \nvote. We are now voting on cloture. We all as leaders and managers, of \ncourse, hope that this will pass.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I thank my colleagues for allowing this \npackage of these amendments to go through. We will be working on \nadditional amendments that we can agree to.\n  We are about to vote on cloture, and if cloture is invoked, I want to \ninform my colleagues, those amendments that are pending and filed will \nbe eligible for votes, and we will be using the chronology of when they \nwere filed. We will be notifying every Member who has an amendment that \nis filed and pending and germane. We will try to arrange time \nagreements for those who want votes. We will be looking to also see \nareas where we could agree and adopt an additional package. It is my \nunderstanding that if cloture is invoked, we will have 30 hours, and \nduring that period we wish to get these amendments resolved.\n  I remind my colleagues that if the 30 hours expires and there are \nstill pending germane filed amendments, there will have to be \nadditional votes taken at some time after the 30 hours. So I would urge \nmy colleagues who have filed, pending, germane amendments that we sit \ndown during the cloture vote or just afterward and try and arrange a \nschedule of votes that is most convenient for them in keeping with \ntheir schedule.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues for allowing that package to go through. \nThose are very important amendments which have been agreed to by both \nsides. I realize we have a long way to go, but this is a significant \nstep forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, the only additional suggestion I would \nhave is that Members who come here who have amendments that are both \npending and germane, assuming we get cloture, if they could check with \nus, either side here, to see where they are on the chronology, they \nwill get a feel as to where they are, because we are going to attempt \nto move down the chronology as amendments were made pending.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

On this vote, the yeas are 88, the \nnays are 12. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having \nvoted in the affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, I want to begin my comments \ntoday on this year's National Defense Authorization Act by thanking all \nthe members of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee. I would especially \nlike to thank the subcommittee's ranking member, Senator Sessions, for \nthe close working relationship we have shared. It is always a pleasure \nto work with my friend from Alabama.\n  The annual National Defense Authorization Act is one of the most \nimportant pieces of legislation Congress passes every year, and this \nyear marks what I hope will be the passing of the Defense Authorization \nAct for the 50th year in a row. I would like to give my colleagues a \nbrief overview of the provisions in the National Defense Authorization \nAct we are considering today as they relate to the Strategic Forces \nSubcommittee.\n  The jurisdiction of the subcommittee includes missile defense, \nstrategic forces, space programs, intelligence programs, cybersecurity, \nthe defense-funded portions of the Department of Energy, and the \nDefense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board.\n  In preparing the provisions in the bill that relate to areas of our \njurisdiction, the subcommittee held six hearings on defense programs at \nthe Department of Energy, strategic nuclear forces, missile defense, \nand space programs at the Department of Defense, and implementation of \nthe New START treaty. The subcommittee's provisions were adopted in a \nbipartisan manner. I again want to thank Senator Sessions, our ranking \nmember, and his staff and the professional staff on the Armed Services \nCommittee for the close work we have enjoyed with them working on the \nhearings and preparing this bill.\n  Our committee oversees the nuclear strategic forces. As many know, \nthe U.S. Strategic Command--in my home State of Nebraska--is charged \nwith our Nation's nuclear deterrence.\n  It is important to note that this bill strengthens and improves our \nNation's nuclear command and control and all the missions that fall \nunder USSTRATCOM by providing the full authorization of the new command \nand control complex. Reliable and assured command, control, and \ncommunication from the President to the nuclear forces is fundamental \nto our strategic deterrent, and the new command and control complex at \nOffutt Air Force Base in Nebraska will provide this mission surety.\n  In the area of missile defense, we have funded the program at $10.1 \nbillion, including the full $1.2 billion requested for the Ground-Based \nMidcourse Defense System. We have also included a provision that would \nset forth the sense of this Congress that it is essential for the \nGround-Based Midcourse Defense System to achieve the levels of \nreliability, availability, sustainability, and operational performance \nnecessary to ensure that the United States remains protected.\n  The bill also supports the development and deployment of the European \nPhased Adaptive Approach, EPAA, to missile defense. This is the U.S. \nMissile Defense Program to defend our military forces and NATO allies \nin Europe from Iranian missile threats. The Defense Department has \nnearly completed phase 1 of the EPAA with an Aegis Ballistic Missile \nDefense, BMD, ship now patrolling the Mediterranean and a missile \ndefense radar now located in Turkey. The United States also \nsuccessfully negotiated the agreements with Poland and Romania to \ndeploy land-based Aegis BMD Systems in their countries in future phases \nof the EPAA.\n  The committee also made a few funding adjustments in the new bill to \nreflect the fact-of-life changes since the Armed Services Committee's \nmarkup of its earlier bill, S. 1253.\n  For example, the recent flight test failure of the Aegis Ballistic \nMissile Defense System, with the Standard Missile-3 Block IB \ninterceptor, means the program will have a substantial delay before it \ncan begin procurement. The program will also need additional research \nand development funds to fix the flight test problems. So the bill \nadjusts the funding to permit such fixes.\n  In addition, the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, \nSystem has experienced slower production than expected and will not be \nable to use all the funds planned and requested in the budget. \nConsequently, the bill adjusts the funding accordingly.\n  In mid-2009, Secretary Gates directed U.S. Strategic Command to stand \nup U.S. Cyber Command as a subunified command. The command reached full \noperational capability a year ago.\n  Since that time, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff \ncharacterized cyber warfare as one of the two ``existential threats'' \nto America, and a former Director of National Intelligence publicly \nproclaimed his belief that adversaries could take down the Nation's \npower grid or devastate the country's financial system. Very damaging \nintrusions into government, military, and industrial networks are \nalmost a daily occurrence, resulting in the loss of precious and \nexpensive advanced technology--the technology that fuels economic \ngrowth and sustains our security.\n  Over the last 2 years, the Strategic Forces Subcommittee has \nsupported legislation to accelerate the arduous process of developing \npolicies and doctrine to guide our responses to cyber attacks and to \ngovern the use of cyber weapons by our own military forces. The \nsubcommittee has also sponsored legislation to begin to close the gap \nin cyber defenses by developing new technological approaches in \npartnership with America's cutting-edge information technology sector.\n  Moving on to space programs, the bill would provide the Air Force the \nauthority to purchase in a block buy, using a fixed price contract, the \nnext two Advanced Extremely High Frequency satellites--an important \npart of the nuclear command and control system. This will result in a \n20-percent savings.\n  We have authorized the President's level of funding for the nuclear \nmodernization program at the DOE's National Nuclear Security \nAdministration, but we are fully aware that the Budget Control Act that \nwas passed last summer has reduced the levels that can be appropriated \nby some $400 million. I would note that even with this reduction, it is \nstill a 5-percent increase over last year's levels. I will be working \nwith my colleagues to carefully evaluate the President's request for \nfiscal year 2013 in light of the commitments both the Congress and the \nadministration made under the New START treaty for modern \nnuclearization.\n  This Congress made commitments for modernization, and moving forward \nwe must honor those commitments. Most importantly, we need to continue \nto ensure that our stockpile is safe, reliable, and works as intended \nby the military so that we maintain our strategic deterrent well into \nthe 21st century.\n  We understand the budget climate that we are in, and it is likely \nthat realistic adjustments must be made as a\n\n[[Page S8023]]\n\nresult of the mandated reductions to defense spending in the Budget \nControl Act. But we will work with the Department of Defense and U.S. \nStrategic Command to ensure that pressing priorities are met and our \nstrategic deterrence are not undercut.\n  Let me again thank my colleague, Senator Sessions, and our staff for \nthe productive and bipartisan relationship we have had on this \nsubcommittee and also all members of the subcommittee. I look forward \nto working with our colleagues to pass this important legislation.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Cuban Oil Drilling\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I want to speak while we are in this pause on \nthe Defense bill about a looming problem that the entire eastern \nseaboard of the United States has; that is, the Spanish drilling \ncompany Repsol is bringing a rig in that has been constructed over in \nAsia, and sometime early next year they are going to drill in deep \nwater off the north coast of Cuba.\n  The Spanish drilling company is a very competent company. As a matter \nof fact, they adhere to safety standards that are required by the \nUnited States because they drill in the Gulf of Mexico in American \nwaters. So if there is a responsible party in drilling, then we have \none. However, there are other leases the Cuban Government is granting \nto other countries for drilling that may not adhere to the safe \nstandards that are set that Repsol will agree to abide by, the same \nsafety standards that they use drilling in American waters and have \nagreed in principle that they will follow a plan of action with the \nU.S. Secretary of the Interior in the case that there should be a \nspill.\n  All of that is well and good, but there are other companies coming \ndown the line drilling in other leases that may not adhere to their \nstandards.\n  If there were a spill off the north coast of Cuba, guess who is going \nto be affected because that is where the Gulf Stream comes along, and \nthen flows northeast, parallels the Florida Keys and all those delicate \ncoral reefs, comes in and hugs the east coast of Florida from Miami all \nthe way to Palm Beach, goes off the coast a few miles, hugs the coast \nall the way up to the middle of the peninsula at Fort Pierce, FL, and \nthen parallels the eastern seaboard all the way up past Georgia, South \nCarolina, North Carolina, and then leaves, paralleling the eastern \nseaboard at Cape Hatteras, and goes off across the Atlantic and ends up \nin the northern part of Europe. Now, if there were a major spill--it \ndoesn't have to be to the magnitude of the Deepwater Horizon spill off \nof Louisiana. If there were a major spill and all that oil is carried \nin the Gulf Stream and it comes into the coast at Miami, Fort \nLauderdale, and Palm Beach--you know what happened to the tourism \nindustry all along the gulf coast when, in fact, on some of those \ncoasts there was not much oil at all, but people didn't come as \ntourists because they thought the beaches were covered.\n  Can you imagine the economic calamity that would occur as a result of \na spill? Therefore, my colleague, Marco Rubio, and I and other \nSenators--in particular, Senator Menendez of New Jersey--have filed \nlegislation that will require financial responsibility from a foreign \nsource. If they spill in foreign waters, there would be a cause of \naction against them if damage is done to the interest of the United \nStates, be it the governments of the United States, be it private \nindividuals, or be it private companies.\n  If we do not have a cause of action where there is liability as a \nresult of a spill, by whomever, in foreign waters, and if it comes in \nthe scenario that I have laid out, which is real spilling oil off the \nnorth coast of Cuba in a major oil disaster that is carried by the Gulf \nStream up the eastern seaboard of the United States--if we do not have \nfinancial responsibility, then there is no incentive for those foreign \noil companies drilling to adhere to safety standards and, if there is a \nspill, to quickly adhere to a spill cleanup plan.\n  Talking about the economic disaster that occurred as a result of the \ngulf oilspill in the Deepwater Horizon, it would pale in comparison to \nthe economic disaster that would occur in such a spill that would be \ncarried by the Gulf Stream. It would not only affect Florida, it would \naffect Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. If there were any \neddy current that would carry it back in, it would take it right on \ninto the Chesapeake on up into Cape May in New Jersey, and you see the \nparticular consequences.\n  As a matter of fact, the gulf stream goes by Bermuda. It could have \ndevastating effects on that country.\n  I hope our Senators, coming to this new reality, will realize that we \nhave to remember the terrible consequences as a result of a major oil \nspill. Remember, this was a company off of Louisiana that was not \nadhering to the highest safety standards, and look at the disaster that \noccurred from that. Remember how they tried to hide the amount of oil \nthat was being spilled because it was 5,000 feet below the surface of \nthe water? It was not until we got the streaming video that the \nscientists could calculate that it wasn't 1,000 barrels a day it was \ndumping into the gulf, it was 50,000 barrels a day. As a result, before \nthey got that well capped, it ended up being almost 5 million barrels \nof oil in the Gulf of Mexico.\n  We don't even know the future consequences because there is a lot of \noil out there sloshing around, and there is a lot of it down there \ndeep. We don't know what is happening down there. We don't know what is \nhappening to the critters. We know what is happening to some of the \ncritters in the marshes where the oil has now mixed up into the \nsediment and the critters are down there digging around, and we are \nseeing the effect of that when we check the gills of these fish that \nare being hatched, living off the sediment. The consequences are not \ngood.\n  It is the responsible thing to do, to make foreign oil companies \ndrilling in foreign waters understand there is going to be an economic \nconsequence if they damage the economic interests of the United States. \nThat is the bill Senator Menendez, Senator Marco Rubio, and I have \nfiled. I commend it to the consideration of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1211\n\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, one of the reasons I came to Congress \nwas to be a voice for our troops and our military families. They answer \na call higher than any other, fighting to protect our country, our way \nof life, our values--all that we hold dear. Our men and women in \nuniform fight, put their lives on the line every day for us, and our \njob is to fight for them and ensure that when they come home, they have \nan opportunity to go to college, find a good-paying job, afford a new \nhome, start a family, have access to quality health care.\n  After a decade of two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, we have asked \nmore of our military than ever before, including our National Guard and \nReserves. Our Reserve components are deployed in record numbers, \nincluding serving in combat zones. While they serve alongside our \nActive-Duty military, our Guard and Reserve members do not have access \nto all of the assistance, services, and benefits that the troops they \nfight shoulder to shoulder with have. Currently, our Guard and National \nReserve members are left largely on their own to find and obtain \nservices that they need to recover from combat, rejoin their families, \nand adjust back to normal civilian life. This needs to change.\n  I am offering amendment No. 1211, together with my colleague, Senator \nBlunt of Missouri, to give our National Guard and Reserve members the \nservices they not only deserve but desperately need. This amendment \nwould expand access to health care, family and financial counseling, \nand other\n\n[[Page S8024]]\n\nservices to which the Guard and Reserve members currently do not have \nfull access. My amendment extends nationwide a highly successful \nprogram that is existing right now in Vermont. It would set up a system \nof support of fellow veterans across the country serving as outreach \nspecialists, people our Guard and Reserve members can talk and relate \nto, and help them get access to the services they need. It would give \nthe Defense Department the additional resources it needs to provide \ncounseling and reintegration services for National Guard and Reserve \nmembers.\n  This amendment has the strong support of the National Guard \nAssociation, which said this amendment would help ensure that 448,000 \nNational Guard men and women who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan \nsince 9/11 are provided with the necessary services upon their return \nfrom war.\n  Members of the National Guard and Reserve are the citizen soldiers \nwho step up and accomplish extraordinary acts of valor and bravery for \nour country. They are veterans. They deserve these services when they \nreturn because of the sacrifices they made and continue to make for our \ngreat country.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1189\n\n  I would also like to speak in support of the amendment of Senator \nMurray, amendment No. 1189.\n  Mental health disorders, substance abuse, and traumatic brain \ninjuries affect nearly 20 percent of all servicemembers who have been \ndeployed to Iraq and Afghanistan--that is one in five. But, unlike \nActive-Duty servicemembers, Guard and Reserve members do not have \ndirect access to the counseling services they need, putting enormous \nstrain on these veterans and the families who stand by them and who \nhave stood by them.\n  The amendment of Senator Murray would embed mental health \nprofessionals in armories and Reserve centers, bringing mental health \nsupport within reach for Guard and Reserve members where and when they \nneed it.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            A Second Opinion\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor, as I have over the \npast year and a half, as a physician who has practiced medicine in \nWyoming for a quarter of a century. I go home every weekend and visit \nwith my former patients, my former colleagues. As I talk to people \naround the State of Wyoming about the newly passed health care law, \ntheir concerns are those we have heard from around the country and \ncertainly those on the Senate floor. That is why I keep coming back to \nthe Senate floor with a doctor's second opinion about the health care \nlaw.\n  What we know patients would like in terms of health care is that the \ncare they get is the care they need from the doctor they want, at a \ncost they can afford. For many people across this country, a cost they \ncan afford is a major issue, which is why I think so many people were \nhappy to hear the President say, in his initial talk about what he was \nproposing for health care in this country, we need to get the cost of \nhealth care down. He said: If his bill were to pass and become law, the \ncost of care would drop about $2,500 per family across the United \nStates. That is what people were looking forward to.\n  In so many ways, the President overpromised and underdelivered \nbecause what people have seen is the cost of their health care has \ncontinued to go up as a result of the President's health care law.\n  The States around the country are now looking at ways to deal with \nthis health care law. Many States have set up committees to deal with \nit based on their State legislatures, and we have done the same thing \nin my home State of Wyoming. In Wyoming, we have asked for a study to \nbe done to take a look at what the impacts of the President's health \ncare law would be on health care and the cost of care in our State. A \nreport was authored by a Massachusetts group called Gorman Actuarial. \nThe report examined how the health care reform law passed last year by \nCongress is going to affect the State of Wyoming specifically. This \ninformation is being used in Wyoming by our Health Benefits Exchange \nSteering Committee. That is the committee which is reviewing various \noptions for a State-run health exchange, and that is what people are \nlooking at: What is the best thing to do for our State.\n  As they have come upon this work effort, what they are telling us is \nabout the individual market for insurance--people who end up buying \ninsurance individually because they don't get it necessarily through \nwork; purchasing insurance in different ways, but they have to buy \ntheir insurance on the individual market. This report says that in \nWyoming, as a result of the health care law, the current individual \nmarket enrollees will see average premiums increase by 30 to 40 percent \nbased on the components of the law. Some supporters of the law say: \nWell, they are going to get more insurance than they would otherwise, \nand that is true because they are going to get a government-mandated \namount of insurance which may be a lot more insurance than they want or \nneed. That is one of the fundamental problems of this health care law, \ngovernment-mandated levels of insurance. Many people in Wyoming feel \nthey don't want that level of care, which is why I believe individuals \nshould be able to opt out of this provision of the health care law. \nStates ought to be able to opt out. States and individuals ought to be \nable to receive a waiver. But right now, that is not happening. So what \nwe are seeing in Wyoming is a significant increase in the cost--not the \ndecrease the President promised but an increase in the cost of health \ninsurance beyond what it would have gone up had there not been a health \ncare law at all.\n  I talk to young people around the State--and I met with a number of \nyoung people from my State just the other evening--and they ask about \nthis and how it is going to affect the young. What we see is their \nrates are going to go up quite a bit. A lot has to do with the fact \nthat there is--that the lowest amount they can end up charging someone \nwho is young and then compare that to someone who is older, the ratio \nis 3 to 1. So for someone who is not very healthy and older, they will \nonly be paying three times what a younger person will be paying based \non what passed this House and this Senate. That means that for those \nyounger people, they are going to pay a lot more than they necessarily \nwould based on their own good health, exercise habits, fitness, diet, \nand in terms of what their real costs ought to be to be insured.\n  I guess it is not a surprise when we saw the election results coming \nout of the State of Ohio Tuesday a few weeks ago about the specific \nindividual mandate that said everyone has to buy insurance. On that \nday, on election day in Ohio, 66 percent of the voters said they didn't \nwant this government mandate, a mandate that people must buy \ngovernment-approved insurance. They don't want that to apply to them. \nTwo-thirds of the people in Ohio on election day voted against the \nmandate, which is not unusual to see because we have seen that across \nthe country. We have seen that in Missouri last year on balloting day. \nWe saw it in the new national polls.\n  This health care law is less popular now than it was the day it was \nsigned. People continue to want to be able to get out from underneath \nthe health care law. That is why I continue to come to the Senate floor \nweek after week with a doctor's second opinion as more information \nbecomes available, just as this study in Wyoming became available. The \nPresident's promise, ``If you like what you have you can keep it,'' we \nare finding out is not true, and the fact that the President promised \nhealth care premiums would drop for families by $2,500 per family is \nnot true.\n  That is why I continue to believe this health care law is bad for \npatients, it is bad for providers--the nurses and the doctors who take \ncare of those patients--and it is bad for the taxpayers\n\n[[Page S8025]]\n\nof this great country. That is why it is time to repeal and replace \nthis broken health care law.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendments Nos. 1125 and 1126\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise today in support of \namendments Nos. 1125 and 1126, which have been offered by the \nIntelligence Committee chairwoman, Senator Feinstein.\n  While the Senate did not adopt my amendment that would have \ninstructed the Senate to consider these detainee matters separately \nfrom the Defense authorization bill, I believe Senator Feinstein's \namendments make important changes and improvements to the bill--\nimprovements that may yet avoid a problem with a Presidential veto.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for his comments yesterday on the \ndetainee provisions that are in this proposed legislation. I urge my \ncolleagues to support these amendments. I want to be clear. I intend to \nsupport them.\n  I have serious concerns going forward about the unintended \nconsequences of enacting the detainee provisions in subtitle D of the \nDefense Authorization Act. These amendments help to alleviate some of \nmy concerns.\n  I wish to, in the context of the debate we are having, note that in \naddition to the Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta; the Director of \nNational Intelligence, General Clapper; and FBI Director Mueller--who \nall oppose the detainee provisions--CIA Director Petraeus's senior \nstaff has indicated they, too, oppose the detention provisions. The CIA \nbelieves it is important to preserve the current U.S. Government's \nprosecution flexibility that has allowed both the Bush and the Obama \nadministrations to effectively combat those who seek to do us harm.\n  After the vote yesterday, I had a chance to talk with a number of \nMembers on the other side of the aisle and, frankly, on the other side \nof the debate, because this had bipartisan support on both sides of the \ndebate. But the folks I talked to told me they did not support my \namendment, but they were still interested in making some more targeted \nchanges to the detention provisions. I hope those colleagues will take \na close look at what Senator Feinstein is offering here today.\n  Let me speak to specifically what she would help resolve with her \namendments. There are two important shortcomings that still exist in \nthe current bill. One of her amendments would preserve the flexibility \nof the military, law enforcement, and intelligence agencies to \ncollaborate, without undue limitation, in any investigation, \ninterrogation, and prosecution of suspected terrorists. The other \namendment would make it clear that American citizens cannot be held \nindefinitely in military detention without a trial. Again, I know the \nPresiding Officer spoke powerfully to that very legitimate and \nimportant concern yesterday.\n  The current language in the bill--which is why I took to the floor \nyesterday and I know on other occasions to make this point--I believe \nwill disrupt the investigation, interrogation, and prosecution of \nterror suspects by forcing the military to interrupt FBI, CIA, or other \ncounterterrorism agency operations--against each of these \norganizations' recommendations, including the military's.\n  In sum, we are going to create an unworkable bureaucratic process \nthat would take away the intelligence community's and the \ncounterterrorism community's capabilities to make critical and, in some \ncases, split-second decisions about how best to save Americans' lives.\n  Further--I cannot emphasize this enough--although my friends on the \nother side of this debate argue otherwise, the detainee provisions do \nallow for the indefinite military detention of American citizens who \nare accused of planning or participating in terror attacks. Simply \naccused--that cuts directly against values we hold dear: innocent until \nproven guilty, presumption of innocence. That is why this is such an \nimportant debate.\n  Let me be clear. There are American citizens who have collaborated \nwith our enemies. There are American citizens who have participated in \nattacks against our soldiers and civilians. Those Americans are \ntraitors. They should be dealt with, and we already have a system for \nensuring they are brought to justice and made to pay a very heavy price \nfor their crimes. That system is working. However, even in the darkest \nhours, we must ensure that our Constitution prevails. We do ourselves a \ngrave disservice by allowing for any citizen to be locked up \nindefinitely without trial--no matter how serious the charges may be \nagainst them. Doing so may be politically expedient, but we risk losing \nour principles of justice and liberty that have kept our Republic \nstrong, and it does nothing to make us safer. Our national security \nleadership has even said if we implement these provisions, it could \nmake us less safe.\n  If I might reflect a bit on what we have learned. At least in three \ndifferent wars--three wars we all learn about in our history classes: \nthe Civil War, World War I, and World War II--as we look back at those \nthree wars, we made the decision and we drew the conclusion as \nAmericans that we overreached, that we constricted civil liberties. \nPresident Lincoln limited habeas corpus in the Civil War. I know the \nPresiding Officer is familiar with the Palmer Raids during World War I \nand the aftermath of World War I. Of course, we know all too well the \nhistory of the interment of Japanese Americans.\n  I am not suggesting these provisions, as they are now included in \nthis bill, would result in historians drawing those similar kinds of \nconclusions 10 or 20 or 30 years from now. But why not be safe? Why not \ntake the time to ensure that we keep faith with those core values that \nmake America what it is? That is all I am asking. I think that is all \nSenator Feinstein is asking for us to do. That is what the 38 Senators \nwho joined us yesterday to vote for my commonsense approach were saying \nas well.\n  In sum, Senator Feinstein has offered some small changes. It would \nhelp alleviate some of the justifiable concerns with these provisions. \nAs I have said, I continue to worry that there will be unintended \nconsequences to enacting the detainee provisions altogether. However, \nwe can make some of these small improvements to avoid harming our \ncounterterrorism activities and preventing the loss of rights and \nfreedoms granted to all Americans by our Constitution.\n  In closing, I urge all of our colleagues to support Senator \nFeinstein's amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, briefly, while my friend from Colorado is \non the floor, he said: Take the time. We have been taking time, I tell \nthe Senator from Colorado, since September 11, 2001, when the United \nStates of America was attacked. We passed the Detainee Treatment Act. \nWe passed other pieces of legislation--the PATRIOT Act, and others. \nTake the time?\n  I say, in all due respect, we have taken a lot of time--in fact, \nhundreds and hundreds of hours of debate, discussion--as to how to \naddress this threat to the United States of America.\n  If the Senator from Colorado supports the Feinstein amendment, I \nagree with that. I cannot agree that we have not taken the time. I \npersonally have taken--I cannot tell you--untold hours addressing this \nissue of how we treat detainees. We may have a fundamental \ndisagreement, but I do reject the argument that we have not taken the \ntime.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Would the Senator respond to a question?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Go ahead.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. As the Senator from Arizona knows, I have the \nutmost respect for the time the Senator has spent in this very \nimportant area. I think what I have been trying to say is that in \nregard to this particular set of detainee provisions, I want to ensure \nthat all of the questions the FBI Director, General Clapper, Secretary \nPanetta, and others have raised about how these provisions would \nactually be applied--I have no question that the intent is spot on--I \njust am aware that there have been some concerns raised about how these \nnew provisions would actually be applied. I\n\n[[Page S8026]]\n\nthink Senator Feinstein's amendments--and I do not know where the \nSenator from Arizona stands at this point--may provide some greater \nclarification. I know there have been some conversations on the floor \nas to how we will deal with these amendments. So I appreciate the \nSenator's comments.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Colorado for his clarification, \nand I think I understand more clearly his rationale for his support of \nthe amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. I yield the floor as well and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               North American Energy Security Act of 2011\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of the North \nAmerican Energy Security Act of 2011. This is legislation I am \nsponsoring, along with Senator Lugar, Senator Vitter, Senator Johanns, \nand 37 other cosponsors--we already have 37 cosponsors on this \nlegislation. This is a solutions-oriented bill that addresses concerns \nalong the route of the Keystone Pipeline. The Keystone Pipeline is \ndesigned to carry 700,000 barrels a day of oil from Alberta, Canada, \nfrom the oil sands area in Canada, to refineries in the United States \nalong the gulf coast, both in Texas and in Louisiana.\n  This is a $7 billion high-tech pipeline that will make a huge \ndifference for our country, both in terms of energy security and also \njob creation. This is a project, Keystone Pipeline, that I have been \nworking on for quite some time, formerly as Governor of the State of \nNorth Dakota and now as part of this body, the Senate. There already \nexists a pipeline called the Keystone Pipeline, which was built by \nTransCanada, that goes from Alberta, Canada, all the way down to our \nrefineries. This pipeline runs through the eastern part of North Dakota \nand on down to Paducah, IL, and other locations as well, bringing \napproximately 600,000 barrels a day of Canadian crude into the United \nStates.\n  The Keystone XL project would also be constructed by TransCanada, and \nit would come down from the Alberta area in Canada down just along \nNorth Dakota's western border in eastern Montana and go on down to \nCushing and, as I said, to the refineries along the gulf coast.\n  In addition to bringing Canadian crude into the United States, it \nwould also pick up crude along the way, crude produced in North Dakota. \nFor example, in my home State of North Dakota, we will add 100,000 \nbarrels a day of light sweet crude produced in the Williston Bay, \ncentered in North Dakota and Montana, into that pipeline.\n  It is also designed to move our domestic crude to refineries as well. \nThis is an important project that has been in the permitting process \nfor 3 years. It has been going through the NEPA process, seeking an \nenvironmental impact statement and approval not only of EPA but of our \nState Department for 3 years.\n  We need to get it going because it is not only about reducing our \ndependance on oil from the Middle East, Venezuela, and other places in \nthe world that are not friendly to the United States, but it is also a \nhuge job creator. This project is a big-time job creator. We are \ntalking about a $7 billion investment to build the pipeline. We are \ntalking about 20,000 construction jobs right away. We are talking about \n250,000 jobs over time. We are talking about $600 million in tax \nrevenue to States and other localities.\n  This is a huge project, and we need to get it going. We particularly \nneed to get it going at a time when we have 9 percent unemployment in \nour economy and more than 14 million people looking for work. So we \nneed it to get that economic activity going. We need it to get people \nback to work. We need it for energy security. We need this project to \nreduce our dependance on oil from the Mideast.\n  Where is the project right now? The latest issue that has been raised \nas far as not getting approval for the project from the Department of \nState was that the State of Nebraska had environmental concerns that \nthe pipeline, this 1,700-mile pipeline running from the oil sands in \nCanada all the way down to our refineries, that in its route through \nthe State of Nebraska, it was going through an area that was \nenvironmentally sensitive and that would create a problem.\n  It is the High Plains area, the Sand Hills area of Nebraska. The \nconcern was that with the Ogallala aquifer underlying that area and the \nirrigation for that farming and ranching region, that pipeline was a \nproblem. In fact, there was opposition in the State of Nebraska to the \nproject for that reason.\n  However, working with the company, TransCanada, and with the State of \nNebraska, we have addressed that issue. Recently, the State of Nebraska \nhad a special session. Gov. Dave Heineman called a special session in \nNebraska. They held the session, and they came up with a plan, through \ntheir Department of Environmental Quality, working with the EPA, to \nreroute the project in the State of Nebraska.\n  On the basis of that rerouting and going through the approval process \nthey developed between the State and Federal Government, on that basis, \nthey have now addressed that concern in Nebraska. What this legislation \ndoes, it essentially is a solutions-based piece of legislation that \nsays: OK, we are addressing these issues that have been raised. Now we \nneed to move forward to capture the tremendous benefits for our country \nthat this project provides: big-time job creation and reducing our \ndependance on Middle Eastern oil.\n  How does the bill work? Specifically, what it provides is that 60 \ndays after its passage, the pipeline is approved so work can commence \non the Keystone XL pipeline. That means 20,000 jobs. That means $7 \nbillion in investment starts right away.\n  Then, as to the Wyoming piece, the State of Wyoming, together with \nEPA and the Federal Government, works through to reroute in Nebraska, \nso that a portion of the pipeline is then approved once they have gone \nthrough their process and decided on the route that meets the concerns \nin Nebraska.\n  In essence, this legislation, again, it is about addressing the \nconcerns, solving the problem, and moving forward. This incorporates \nthe special legislation and the solution that has been put forward by \nthe State of Nebraska. It incorporates it right into the bill and \nenables us to move forward.\n  I have referenced the tremendous benefits in terms of energy \nsecurity, in terms of job creation, in terms of working with our best \nfriend and ally, Canada, in reducing our dependence on oil from places \nsuch as the Middle East and Venezuela.\n  But let me address one other point. Another point that has been \nbrought up in opposition to the pipeline project is that the production \nof oil in Canada, in the oil sand region, produces CO2. So \nthat if this pipeline is built, some argue then there will be more \nCO2 released because of production in Canada in the oil \nsands and that product coming into the United States.\n\n  But, in fact, without this pipeline, we will produce more \nCO2. The point, let me underscore, is that this pipeline \nproject will actually produce less CO2 than we would \notherwise produce without the creation of the pipeline.\n  Why is that? Let me go through it. If we do not have the pipeline, \nthen instead of bringing that product into the United States, that \nproduct will still be produced. The production will still occur in \nCanada. But the pipeline, instead of coming into the United States, \nwill be rerouted to the western border of Canada, and it will be sent \nto China.\n  That means large oil tankers will be hauling the product to \nrefineries in China. The refineries in China produce higher emissions \nthan our refineries. Plus, we have those ships that produce \nCO2 as they haul all this product to the Far East. \nFurthermore, since that supply is not coming to the United States, we \nhave to continue to import product from the Middle East and also from \nplaces such as Venezuela, as I mentioned.\n  In essence, we have supertankers bringing that product to the United \nStates. So not only are we, in essence, now hauling the equivalent of \n700,000 barrels a day around the world in supertankers and producing \nCO2 emissions there, we are also taking this\n\n[[Page S8027]]\n\nproduct over to the Chinese refineries, where they have higher \nemissions.\n  My point is, the oil sands are still produced, are they not, under \neither scenario? But without this pipeline, we actually have higher \nCO2 emissions on a global basis. Again, it is about \naddressing all the concerns that have been raised with this project, \nand it does that. At the same time, we create tens of thousands of jobs \nright off the bat. We create hundreds of millions in revenue for States \nand localities at a time when they badly need it and, again, we reduce \nour dependance on oil from parts of the world where it truly is an \nissue for our country in regards to energy security.\n  It is about common sense. It is about addressing all the issues that \nhave been raised. I urge my colleagues to join me and the 37 sponsors \nand cosponsors that we already have on this legislation to pass it and \nhelp put people back to work, help get our economy going, and help \nimprove our national energy security.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1414\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak to a \nbipartisan amendment my colleague from Illinois, Senator Kirk, and I \nhave offered. We believe it is one of the most critical issues facing \nour country in terms of national defense and global security. We have \ncome together to the floor to speak about it.\n  One of the greatest threats--if not the greatest--to the security of \nour Nation and Israel is the concerted effort by the Government of Iran \nto acquire the technology and materials to create a nuclear weapon that \nwill do two things:\n  First, we can be sure it will alter the balance of power in the \nMiddle East.\n  Second, altering the balance of power with a nuclear Iran dedicated \nto the destruction of the State of Israel would most certainly lead to \nhostilities--hostilities that could spill over to engulf the entire \nregion and well beyond.\n  We cannot, we must not, and we will not let that happen. But the \nclock is ticking. Published reports suggest we may be just a year away \nfrom Iran having a nuclear weapon and the ability to deliver that \nnuclear weapon to a target. To forestall this scenario and, more \nimportantly, to prevent it from happening in the first place, we must \nuse all of the tools of peaceful diplomacy available to us. Simply put, \nwe must do everything in our power to prevent Iran from obtaining a \nnuclear weapon. I do not believe there is anyone on either side of the \naisle who disagrees with that proposition.\n  We come to the floor today to discuss a bipartisan amendment I have \noffered with my friend from Illinois, Senator Kirk, to limit Iran's \nability to finance its nuclear ambitions by sanctioning the Central \nBank of Iran, which has proven to be complicit in Iran's nuclear \nefforts. This amendment will impose sanctions on those international \nfinancial institutions that engage in business activities with the \nCentral Bank of Iran.\n  This is a timely amendment that follows the administration's own \ndecision last week designating Iran as a jurisdiction of primary money \nlaundering. In fact, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the \nDepartment of the Treasury wrote:\n\n       The Central Bank of Iran, which regulates Iranian banks, \n     has assisted designated Iranian banks by transferring \n     billions of dollars to these banks in 2011. In making these \n     transfers, the Central Bank of Iran attempted to evade \n     sanctions by minimizing the direct involvement of large \n     international banks with both the Central Bank of Iran and \n     designated Iranian banks.\n\n  The Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial \nIntelligence, David Cohen, has written this:\n\n       Treasury is calling out the entire Iranian banking sector, \n     including the Central Bank of Iran, as posing terrorist \n     financing, proliferation financing, and money laundering \n     risks for the global financial system.\n\n  The administration's own decisions clearly show that Iran's conduct \nthreatens the national security of the United States and its allies, \nand the complicit action of the Central Bank of Iran, based on its \nfacilitation of the activities of the government, its evasion of \nmultilateral sanctions directed against the Government of Iran, its \nengagement in deceptive financial practices and illicit transactions, \nand, most importantly, its provision of financial services in support \nof Iran's effort to acquire the knowledge, materials, and facilities to \nenrich uranium and to ultimately develop weapons of mass destruction, \nthreatens regional peace and global security.\n  We recently learned just how far down the nuclear road Iran has come. \nThe International Atomic Energy Agency's report indicates what all of \nus already suspected--Iran continues to enrich uranium and is seeking \nto develop as many as 10 new enrichment facilities; that Iran has \nconducted high-explosives testing and detonator development to set off \na nuclear charge, as well as computer modeling of the core of a nuclear \nwarhead; that Iran has engaged in preparatory work for a nuclear \nweapons test; that an August IAEA inspection revealed that 43.5 pounds \nof a component used to arm nuclear warheads was unaccounted for in \nIran; and that Iran is working on an indigenous design for a nuclear \npayload small enough to fit on Iran's long-range Shahab-3 missile, a \nmissile capable of reaching the State of Israel.\n  What more do we need to know before we take the next diplomatic step \nto address the financial mechanism that is helping make Iran's nuclear \nambitions a reality? These revelations, combined with Iran's \nprovocative effort in October to assassinate the Saudi Ambassador to \nthe United States, demonstrate that Iran's aggression has taken a \nviolent turn and that we have every reason to believe that if Iran gets \na nuclear weapon, it may very well use it, and use it against our ally, \nthe State of Israel.\n  This amendment will impose sanctions on any foreign financial \ninstitution that engages in significant transactions with the Central \nBank of Iran, with the exception of transactions in food, medicine, and \nmedical devices. It recognizes the administration's actions last week \npursuant to section 311 of the PATRIOT Act designating the entire \nIranian banking sector as a primary money laundering concern. It \nrequires the President to prohibit transactions of Iranian financial \ninstitutions that touch U.S. financial institutions.\n  To ensure that we don't spook the oil market, transactions with \nIran's Central Bank in petroleum and petroleum products would only be \nsanctioned if the President makes a determination that petroleum-\nproducing countries other than Iran can provide sufficient alternative \nresources for the countries purchasing from Iran and if the country \ndeclines to make significant decreases in its purchases of Iranian oil.\n  This bipartisan amendment has been carefully drafted to ensure the \nmaximum impact on Iran's financial infrastructure and its ability to \nfinance terrorist activities and to minimize the impact on the global \neconomy. Iran has a history of exploiting terrorism against coalition \nforces in Iraq, in Argentina, Lebanon, and even, in their attempt to \nassassinate the Saudi Ambassador, in Washington. While Iran's drive to \nadvance its nuclear weapons program has been slowed by U.S. and \ninternational sanctions, it clearly remains undeterred.\n  Today, we take--hopefully today or tomorrow when we vote on this \namendment--the next step in isolating Iran politically and financially. \nI look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on the other \nside and with the administration to achieve this goal and to also \nadvance the legislation I introduced earlier this year with many others \non both sides of the aisle--the Iran, North Korea, and Syrian Sanctions \nConsolidation Act, which has 80 bipartisan cosponsors at this point. \nOur efforts to date have been transformative. But just as Iran has been \nprepared to adjust to the sanctions and unanticipated loopholes, just \nas it has been prepared to take advantage of every loophole to \ncircumvent the sanctions and keep moving forward in its effort to \nachieve a robust nuclear program, we must be equally prepared to adjust \nand adapt by closing each loophole and stopping the regime's nuclear \nefforts. By identifying the Central Bank of Iran as the Iranian \nregime's partner and the financier of its terrorist agenda, we can \nbegin to starve\n\n[[Page S8028]]\n\nthe regime of the money it needs to achieve its nuclear goals.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan amendment that will \ngo a long way toward closing financial loopholes and helping prevent \nthe Iranian regime from moving its nuclear ambitions to the weapons \nphase and closer to the warhead of a missile.\n  We cannot, we must not, and we will not allow Iran to threaten the \nstability of the region and the peace and security of the world. I \nappreciate the support of my distinguished colleague from Illinois who \nis on the floor, who has worked with us in this regard and come to a \ncommon view and effort to maximize the effect on Iran and minimize the \neffect to both us and the global economy, and certainly urge passage of \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Menendez-\nKirk amendment. I particularly thank my partner Senator Menendez, a \nmember of the Banking Committee, who has been a leader regarding \nIranian terror, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and \nrepression of human rights for 20 or 25 years now.\n  We are reaching a decisive point now in the relations of Iran to \nother countries and, most importantly, to the United States. I think \nthis amendment comes at one of the final hours of how peaceful means \nand economic sanctions can be used to avoid a conflict. That is why it \nis so important for the Senate to adopt the Menendez-Kirk amendment, \nwith the long-term goal of collapsing the Central Bank of Iran, so that \ncountry doesn't produce nuclear weapons that would destabilize the \nentire Middle East. We launched this effort, along with Senator \nSchumer, particularly in August when we called on our President to \nsanction the Central Bank of Iran.\n  In these partisan times in which the two sides are far apart on many \nissues, we had 92 Senators--all but 8 Senators signed the letter--\nsaying: Collapse the Central Bank of Iran and use this as a tool in our \ndiplomatic war chest to make sure we can remove one of the greatest \ndangers from the country, from one of the most dangerous regimes.\n  The record is pretty clear. The International Atomic Energy Agency \nhas ruled on the subject of Iran. We remember the IAEA because they, \nwith regard to Iraq and the Saddam Hussein weapons of mass destruction \nprogram, were consistently correct and the Bush administration was \nwrong. The IAEA said in its intelligence estimate that the threat was \noverstated in Iraq. So with that level of credibility, we should listen \nto the IAEA on the subject of Iran. There, they have been extremely \nclear as well.\n  They have outlined how Iran has a separate enrichment cycle, going \nway above the enrichment of uranium necessary to fuel a civilian \nreactor--5 percent--now toward 20 percent, where there is no civilian \nuse, moving toward the 98 percent needed to power a nuclear weapon.\n  They talked about undisclosed nuclear facilities, especially a \nbrandnew one, which appears to be the final cascade necessary to enrich \nuranium to bomb-grade material.\n  They most ominously talk about a warhead of a particular weight that \nwould equate what would be in a nuclear weapon. Unlike a conventional \nwarhead, which basically has a spark initiator and explosive material, \nthis warhead has an electric generator aboard. That is only used to \npower and initiate a nuclear explosion.\n  So it is clear from the statements of the independent United Nations \nagency that Iran--a signatory on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty--\nis violating its obligation and is creating, as fast as it can, a \nnuclear weapons program.\n  We also know that Iran has become the first space-bearing nation of \nthe 21st century and that, unlike the North Koreans, who have failed in \nspace launch time after time, Iran was able to orbit the Omid satellite \naboard the Safir rocket and is the first nation to be able to \naccomplish that technological fete in this century. If you can orbit \nanywhere over the Earth, you can deorbit over the Earth--an ominous \nsign for the future of Saudi Arabia, Iraq, our allies in Turkey, but \nespecially our friends in Israel, and, in the long term, the United \nStates.\n  The record of Iran with regard to its own citizens shows the \ncharacter of its government. Long ago, we knew about 330,000 Baha'i \ncitizens of Iran who have been forced to register their addresses, \nwhose kids have all been kicked out of universities, and whose families \nare not allowed any contracting with the Government of Iran. The \nbureaucratic mechanisms of Kirstallnacht have formed. We have seen this \nmovie in a different decade, wearing different uniforms, in a different \ncountry, but the ominous signs are that it may turn out in the same \nway.\n\n  Many people on the international committee know about Neda, who was \nprotesting the stealing of an election in Iran, and of her death simply \nfor protesting that stolen election. We know about Hossein Ronaghi, the \nfirst blogger, who called for tolerance in Iran, who is now languishing \nin Evin prison. We know about Nasrin Sotoudeh, age 48, mother of two, \nwhose sole crime was representing Shirin Ebadi, a Nobel laureate, and \nhow she was thrown in jail.\n  Beyond the nuclear program, beyond the missile program, beyond the \nrepression of human rights in the country, we know about Iran's long \nrecord of terror; that Iran is the paymaster for Hezbollah. We have \nknown that for a long time. They have tortured the poor country of \nLebanon. But in some sense, there was a symmetry. We understood how \nthis Shiite power would support a Shiite sect in Lebanon even though \nthey spoke Arabic. But then, over the last decade, they jumped the \nShiite-Sunni divide, and they also backed a new terror group called \nHamas that was trying to surround our allies in Israel with missiles \nand the terror necessary to extinguish the Jewish people and the Jewish \nState.\n  We know how the Iranian regime is now one of the central pillars of \nthe Syrian dictatorship and how, as that dictatorship hangs onto power, \nit is somewhat on the back of Iranian money and Iranian weapons and \nexpertise that allows them to repress their own people. Most recently, \non the back of a bipartisan certification that Iran supports terror \nfrom President Reagan, President Bush, President Clinton, President \nBush, and President Obama, we have seen a higher level of \nirresponsibility on behalf of the Iranian regime.\n  According to our own Attorney General, the head of the Iranian \nRevolutionary Guard's Quds Force, Suliman, tried to contact and hire a \nMexican drug cartel--one of the most dangerous, the Zetas--to \nassassinate the Saudi Arabian Ambassador to the United States at a \nGeorgetown restaurant. It was only because the incompetent Iranians \nhired a DEA agent in Mexico that we found out about this. They would \nhave, had they been able to accomplish their goals, lit off a car bomb \nin Washington, DC, paid for by the Government of Iran and briefed all \nthe way to the top level of their government.\n  Today, we find--after they had their Basij radical young person's \nmovement overrun the British Embassy, seizing classified documents and \nholding, for a time, 50 British personnel--shades of the 1979 hostage \ncrisis, when for 440 days Iranian radicals held Americans. Our allies \nin the United Kingdom have now made the decision to remove all Iranian \ndiplomats from the United Kingdom.\n  We have seen other calls, brave calls, of allied action. A man I \nadmire greatly, the President of France, President Sarkozy, has called \nfor seizing all purchases of Iranian oil. He has publicly called for \nthe collapse of the Iranian Central Bank.\n  So it is with this level of irresponsibility--on nuclear technology, \non missiles, on the repression of human rights, on the support of \nterror, on the plot to kill Americans inside Washington, DC, and the \noverrunning of an embassy of our closest ally in Europe, the United \nKingdom--that we come forward with the bipartisan Menendez-Kirk \namendment.\n  What does this amendment do? It basically says, in part, if you do \nbusiness with the Central Bank of Iran, you cannot do business with the \nUnited States of America. It forces financial institutions and other \nbusinesses around the world to choose between the small and shrinking \n$300 billion economy of Iran and the $14 trillion economy of the United \nStates. In that contest, we all\n\n[[Page S8029]]\n\nknow how just about everyone will choose, and we wish that choice to be \nmade. We seek to break the stable financial intermediary in between \nIranian oil contracts and the outside world so that it will just be \neasier to buy oil from elsewhere and, working with our allies, to make \nthat oil more plentiful.\n  We realize the concerns with this amendment. Some have said this \namendment comes too quickly; that it is too soon. So that is where \nSenator Menendez and I have agreed, working with the administration, to \ngive time and flexibility. Under this amendment, nothing happens right \naway. Several weeks and several months go by before any action is \nrequired. That is intended as a signal to oil markets that this \nrequirement is coming, that we seek for them, as our allies--for \nexample, in Japan or South Korea or in Turkey--to wind up their current \ncontracts and supplies and meet their needs by other means.\n  By the way, other means are coming. We are expecting Libyan \nproduction to double. We are also expecting Iraqi production to go way \nup. Of course, we know the swing production of Saudi Arabia--no love \nlost toward the Iranians after having tried to kill their ambassador \nhere. We will be working with the oil suppliers to make sure that \neveryone's needs are met while funding to the Iranian regime is slowly \nchoked off.\n  We also provide two waivers in this amendment--and this is very \nimportant--at the request of the administration. We say if there is a \ntemporary restriction of oil supply, this amendment can be suspended \nfor a time. If there is some unforeseen national security disaster, \nsome real problem the President can see, he has that flexibility.\n  But the general picture is this: The Central Bank of Iran, the heart \nand financial soul of a web of terror, of nuclear production, of human \nrights abuse, and the oppression of other people--principally in \nSyria--is no longer acceptable to the international community, and so \nthis regime should operate without the benefit of funding from the \ninternational community.\n  I think this amendment is one of the last best hopes for peace and to \nbring effective economic sanctions to bear so that a burden doesn't \nfall on our friends in Saudi Arabia or our allies in Israel to do the \nfar more tough military work that may be required to remove this common \ndanger.\n  Many people say we can't convince a country that is on a nuclear \nweapons course to reverse course. I say, well, we show our ignorance of \nhistory because we saw the Argentines give up a nuclear program, the \nBrazilians, and likely the South Africans detonated a weapon and then \ndecided to give up their program. In Kazakhstan and Ukraine, nuclear \nweapons were given up. In Libya, nuclear weapons were given up. With \neffective pressure, my hope is that it can happen here.\n  We know President Ahmadinejad is not popular. We know the regime in \ngeneral does not enjoy the support especially of its younger citizens. \nWe know at least half of Iranians, in a stolen election, voted for the \nother guy who was not allowed to take power.\n\n  So this amendment comes forward with a solid bipartisan pedigree. It \nhas been endorsed specifically by Senators Lieberman, Schumer, Kyl, \nFeinstein, Gillibrand, Manchin, Nelson of Florida, Nelson of Nebraska, \nStabenow, and Heller under the leadership of Senator Menendez and \nmyself. For us, it gives time for the oil markets to adjust and unhook \nfrom Iran. It gives flexibility to the administration. But, most \nimportantly, it helps us deal in an economic and diplomatic way with \none of the greatest dangers to our society.\n  We think about the future ahead, and some people say this amendment \ncould cause some disruption in oil markets. Yes, we are asking \ncountries to unhook from the terror regime in Iran. But just think \nabout the instability that would come if military conflict broke out \nbetween Iran and Israel or worse if nuclear weapons were loosed from \nIran in the Middle East. If we do nothing, as soon as 2 years from now \nwe could have a detonation of an Iranian nuclear weapon in the Middle \nEast. If we show weakness and a lack of resolve, then countries in that \nregion will decide they need nuclear weapons programs of their own. We \nwill give birth to the Saudi nuclear weapon program, the Egyptian \nnuclear weapon program, and others.\n  This amendment is an attempt to make sure that for young Americans \nthe 21st century is not the most dangerous century they will face, and \nto use the full economic weight of the United States, working with our \nallies, to remove what is the greatest emerging danger.\n  I think Senator Menendez is living in the spirit of those who watched \nthe 1930s and worried about when America slept. Well, we are not \nasleep. We know exactly what is happening. By decisive bipartisan \naction of the Senate, we are bringing the best pressure to bear, of \nnonmilitary means, to make sure our kids inherit a much safer 21st \ncentury.\n  With that, I commend my partner in this effort, and I urge the Senate \nto adopt the Menendez-Kirk amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, I rise in full support of this \namendment, and I thank Senator Menendez for his leadership on this \nissue, which dates from a long time back, and Senator Kirk, who has \nreally lit a flame of concern under this body about this issue, and \njustifiably so. They have done a great job, and I thank both of them \nfor their strong efforts.\n  I believe when it comes to Iran we should never take the military \noption off the table, but I have long argued that economic sanctions \nshould be tried first and could be actually very effective in choking \nIran's nuclear ambitions before any military option need be considered. \nBut they have to be done strongly, they have to be done well, and they \nhave to be done toughly.\n  Earlier this month, the report on Iran's nuclear program by the IAEA \nwas alarming and proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that, despite the \nlies--and there is no other word to use--by the Iranian Government, \nthey are developing a nuclear weapon. According to recent reports, Iran \ncould have at least one workable nuclear weapon within a year and \nanother maybe 6 months after that.\n  The new information shows that Iran has been working relentlessly to \nacquire the capability to produce a nuclear weapon. Additionally, the \nIAEA report details a highly organized program dedicated to acquiring \nthe skills necessary to produce and test a bomb.\n  So I say to America and the world: Enough is enough. The extreme and \ndangerous leader of the Government of Iran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, must \nbe held accountable. One of our greatest problems that we will live \nwith for decades is a nuclear Iran. We do not want to look back and \nsay: If we were only a little quicker, a little stronger, a little \ntougher, we might have prevented it. The Iranians, when they see they \nmight face real economic punishment if they proceed in developing \nnuclear weapons, have turned back in the past, and they will do that \nagain.\n  We have begun to impose economic sanctions, and I salute the \nPresident, who has worked very hard on this issue. I have talked with \nhim on this issue. I know he believes in it strongly. I know the \nPresident knows the danger of a nuclear Iran and is working very hard \nin that regard. But every time we find ways to impose economic \nsanctions that have real teeth against Iran, they try to find a way \naround it. Our job is to move quickly and to plug those loopholes.\n  We have sanctioned Iranian banks and pretty much prevented them from \ndoing what we don't want them to do. According to all reports, it has \nhad a real effect on the Iranian National Guard and on the economy of \nIran itself. But the Iranian Government has now tried to move through \nthe Central Bank of Iran. It has been heavily involved in terrorism and \nthe financing of nuclear and conventional weapons technology. The \nCentral Bank has played a critical role in helping other Iranian banks \ncircumvent our effective financial sanctions.\n  To close 10 holes but leave 1 open will not achieve our goal, and the \nlast remaining open hole through which financial commerce can flow into \nIran for prohibited activities is the Central Bank of Iran. The threat \nof sanctions against the Central Bank will frighten Iran. It might make \nthem think twice before they proceed in developing this nuclear weapon \nbecause they will pay\n\n[[Page S8030]]\n\nreal economic consequences that will hurt the Iranian regime and its \nhenchmen, above all, and will, unfortunately, hurt the Iranian people \nas well. But there is no choice in this matter.\n  So we must strengthen the President's hand as he continues to work to \nbuild an international coalition determined to prevent the rise of a \nnuclear Iran. By giving the administration the capability to impose \ncrippling sanctions on Iran should they continue with their nuclear \nweapons program, Congress is putting forth a tough and smart plan to \naddress the real threat Iran poses to the United States and our allies \nand, of course, Israel.\n  This amendment will do three important things to strangle Iran's \nability to continue with its nuclear weapons program. First, it will \nfreeze the assets of Iranian financial institutions that come under \nU.S. jurisdiction. Second, it would prevent the maintenance in America \nof correspondence accounts by foreign financial institutions conducting \nsignificant petroleum-related transactions with Iran's Central Bank. \nAnd lastly, it would urge the President to undertake a diplomatic \ninitiative to wean other nations off Iranian crude.\n  The amendment supports the administration's actions last week \ndesignating the entire Iranian banking system as a threat to government \nand financial institutions because of Iran's illicit activities, \nincluding its pursuit of nuclear weapons and its support of terrorism.\n  Senators Kirk and Menendez have done an excellent job in crafting a \ncomprehensive plan, a smart plan, a tough plan, to arm the \nadministration with the tools it needs to put a stop to Iran's nuclear \nrogue program. I have optimism that this will have a real effect and \ncould indeed deter Iran if we move, and move quickly.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered \nby our colleagues, Senators Menendez and Kirk, and I thank them for \ntheir leadership on this issue. To me, this is an extremely important \namendment that I hope will get the support of all the Members of the \nSenate. It tightens the restrictions we already have against Iran.\n  I compliment the Obama administration for the work they have done \ninternationally by expanding the sanction against Iran and against \nIran's petroleum and petrochemical industries. It has been effective, \nbecause we have gotten other countries to follow the leadership of the \nUnited States.\n  I think everyone in this body understands the risks of Iran to the \nsecurity of not only its region but the entire world. Iran is a very \ndangerous nation. It has ambitions to spread terrorism in the region \nand to affect U.S. interests. It is for that reason that we cannot \nallow Iran to become a nuclear weapons state. Our most effective way to \ndeal with this is to isolate Iran and to make sure the sanctions that \nare imposed actually will accomplish the objective of penalizing the \ncountry but not the individual people of Iran.\n  The amendment offered by Senator Menendez and Senator Kirk would \nallow us to expand the sanctions against Iran to the Central Bank of \nIran. The amendment requires the President to prohibit all transactions \nand property and interest in property of the Iranian financial \ninstitutions that touch U.S. financial institutions, and to prohibit \nthe maintenance of correspondence or payable-through accounts by \nforeign banks that have conducted financial transactions with the \nCentral Bank of Iran.\n  What does that mean? It means we are trying to put the sanctions \nwhere they will have the most impact, and that is on the financial \nsystem of Iran itself. The Iranian Central Bank depends upon other \nbanks around the world, and this amendment would allow us to have an \neffective way to isolate the Central Bank of Iran, putting additional \nfocus on the Iranian policies that have violated the United Nations' \nresolutions.\n  Iran has violated their commitments. They violated their commitments \nas they relate to their nuclear programs. They haven't complied with \nagreements they have entered into. It is important that the \ninternational community stand united. This is important for the \nstability of the region, it is important for the security of Israel, \nour closest ally in that region, it is important for the Arab states \nthat have talked to us about the danger of Iran, it is important for \nU.S. interests. So it is important that we get this moving.\n  Iran's complete disregard for its obligations under the Nuclear \nNonproliferation Treaty and its directives of the multiple U.N. \nSecurity Council Resolutions belies the government's continued \ninsistence that its nuclear program is one based upon its energy needs. \nIt is not based upon its energy needs. It is trying to become a nuclear \nweapons state, something we must make sure does not occur.\n  We need to take all steps we can in order to deny Iran the ability to \nhave international legitimacy while they are violating their \ninternational commitments. This amendment continues the U.S. leadership \non this issue and follows up on the work our Nation has done in getting \ninternational support to make clear to Iran that if they continue along \nthese policies of violating their international commitments, they are \ngoing to continue to be isolated and it is going to affect the economy \nof their nation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would ask that I be notified after 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1274\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I have offered an amendment that \nclarifies--although that is not exactly the right word--the fact that \nan unlawful combatant or a combatant who is held by the U.S. military \nfor being an enemy of the United States, a combatant against the United \nStates, or an unlawful combatant, is not therefore entitled to be \nreleased if the U.S. military or the civilian courts choose to \nprosecute him and he is acquitted or after he serves his sentence but \nbefore hostilities have ended. These are entirely different matters.\n  There are two questions: Are you an enemy combatant of the United \nStates? These are the kinds of prisoners of war in World War II, \nGermans, for example, who were kept in Aliceville, AL. They stayed in a \nprisoner-of-war camp until the war was over, and they went home. They \ndidn't violate the rules of war; they weren't prosecuted for any \ncrimes. They simply were not released so that they could go and rejoin \nthe battle in an attempt to kill more American service men and women. \nBut they were lawful. They wore uniforms, they complied with the rules \nof war, and they were not able to be prosecuted.\n  But when a person sneaks into the country with an intent to murder \nwomen and children and innocent noncombatants, does not wear a uniform, \nand violates other provisions of the rules of war, then they can be not \nonly held as a combatant but they can be held and tried for commission \nof crimes against the United States. That is the classic standard of \nthe law of war.\n  I believe it is clear that if a person is captured and tried for a \ncrime and, let's say, acquitted--whether in a civilian court or a \nmilitary commission--they are not entitled to be released. To that end, \nI would quote a number of statements to that effect. But I believe the \nlegal system would be a lot better off if we spoke clearly on that \nmatter today so there is no doubt whatsoever.\n  President Obama, on May 21, 2009, said this:\n\n       But even when [the prosecution] process is complete, there \n     may be a number of people who could not be prosecuted for \n     past crimes, but who nonetheless pose a threat to the \n     security of the United States.\n\n\n[[Page S8031]]\n\n\n  In other words, they remain prisoners of war who are likely to join \nthe enemy if they are released. He goes on to say:\n\n       These are people who, in effect, remain at war with the \n     United States. As I said, I am not going to release \n     individuals who endanger the American people.\n\n  I think that is consistent with all rules of war, and I think the \nPresident was right in that statement.\n  Attorney General Eric Holder, in November of 2009, before the \nJudiciary Committee, said:\n\n       I personally think that we should involve Congress in \n     [ensuring that the Executive Branch has the authority to make \n     that decision], that we should interact with . . . this \n     committee in crafting a law of war detention process or \n     program.\n\n  In other words, he was calling on us to work with them in developing \nstatutes. But, historically, I think the law is clear at any rate.\n  Jeh Johnson, General Counsel to the Department of Defense, who came \nfrom the New York Times as general counsel for the New York Times--not \na career Department of Justice defense attorney--said this before the \nSenate Armed Services Committee:\n\n       The question of what happens if there's an acquittal is an \n     interesting question . . . I think that as a matter of legal \n     authority, if you have the authority under the laws of war to \n     detain someone, and the Hamdi decision said that in 2004, \n     that is true irrespective of what happens on the prosecution \n     side . . . as a matter of legal authority, I think we have \n     law-of-war authority, pursuant to the authority Congress \n     granted us with AUMF, as the Supreme Court interpreted it, to \n     hold that person provided they continue to be a security \n     threat, and we have the authority in the first place.\n\n  So, again, he is saying if they are not convicted, they can still be \nheld if they continue to be a threat.\n  Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on ``Meet the Press'' November of \nlast year:\n\n       MR. GREGORY: But my question is, are we committed with \n     these terror suspects that if they are acquitted in civilian \n     courts, they should be released?\n       SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, no. . . .\n\n  Senator Jack Reed, our West Point graduate and a member of the Armed \nServices Committee--I am proud to serve with my Democratic colleague--\nthis is what he said the November before last:\n\n       There are no guarantees [of conviction], but under basic \n     principles of international law, as long as these individuals \n     pose a threat, they can be detained, and they will. . . . I \n     do not believe they will be released . . . under the \n     principle of preventive detention, which is recognized during \n     hostilities.\n\n  I believe this is legislation that would do nothing more but, \nimportantly, will affirm the classical understanding of our laws of \nwar, and as a result, the people who are charged can be tried, and if \nthey are not convicted of a crime, they can still be detained.\n  I would note that an individual American soldier or German soldier or \nJapanese soldier who is lawful and released has a duty to report back \nto their military unit and commence hostilities until the war is over.\n  Senator Graham is here, a current JAG officer in the U.S. Air Force \nwho has studied these matters very closely and has been engaged in this \ndebate so eloquently. I am delighted to have him here and to have his \nsupport on this amendment. Perhaps he has some comments?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Perhaps the Senator will yield for a question?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will be pleased to.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. As I understand the purpose of this amendment, it is \nbasically to have the Congress on record for the concept that once you \nare determined to be an enemy combatant, a part of the enemy force, \nthere is no requirement to let you go at any certain time because in \nwar it would be silly to let an enemy prisoner go back to the fight for \nno good reason.\n  As the Senator has indicated, in the law of war, you can be \nprosecuted for a war crime. You could be taken to a Federal court and \nprosecuted for an act of terrorism, but if you are acquitted, that is \nnot an event that would require us to release you if the evidence still \nexists that you are a threat to the country and part of the enemy \nforces; is that correct?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is correct.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. What I would like my colleagues to understand is that no \nGerman prisoner in World War II had the ability to go to a Federal \njudge and say: Let me go.\n  If you had brought up the concept in World War II that an American \ncitizen who was collaborating with the Nazis could not be held as an \nenemy combatant, you would have been run out of town.\n  Does the Senator agree with me that in every war we have fought since \nthe beginning of our Nation, unfortunately, there have been episodes \nwhere American citizens side with the enemy?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is certainly true.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Does the Senator agree with me that our Supreme Court, as \nrecently as about 3 to 4 years ago, affirmed the fact that we can hold \nour own as enemy combatants when the evidence suggests they have joined \nforces with the enemy? That is the law?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is the law as I understand it.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Does my colleague agree with me that makes perfect sense, \nthat an American who helps the Nazis has committed an act of war, not a \ncommon crime?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is correct.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Does he agree with me that our courts understand that \nwhen an American citizen collaborates with an enemy of our Nation, that \nis an act of war by that citizen against his own country and the law of \nwar applies, not domestic criminal law?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I certainly agree with the Senator that an American \ncitizen can join in a war against the United States.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. And they can be treated as an enemy combatant in \naccordance with our laws?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is correct.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. And the law of war allows the following: trial or \ndetention or both. Is that correct?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is correct.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. You can be held as an enemy combatant without trial?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is correct.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. There is no requirement in international law to prosecute \nan enemy prisoner for a crime?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Absolutely. It is up to the detaining authority whether \nthey believe a person has committed a crime.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Does the Senator agree with me that we do not want to \nstart the practice in the United States that everybody we capture as an \nenemy prisoner is automatically a war criminal because that could come \nback to haunt our own people in future wars?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Absolutely.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. That we should reserve prosecution for a limited class of \npersons among enemy prisoners?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The Senator has consumed 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I ask unanimous consent to have 1 more minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair was informing the Senator that 10 \nminutes has elapsed.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I asked to be informed at 10. I see Senator Sanders is \nhere.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Let's just logically walk through this. In every war in \nwhich America has been involved, American citizens unfortunately have \nchosen at times to side with the enemy. Our courts say the executive \nbranch can hold them as enemy combatants, and the purpose is to gather \nintelligence. Does the Senator agree with that?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is a very important purpose of that.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The Senator has been a U.S. attorney; is that correct?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is correct.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Does criminal law focus on intelligence gathering?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Absolutely not. It focuses on punishment for a crime \nalready committed, normally.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Does the Senator agree that holding an enemy prisoner--\none of the benefits of capturing someone is gathering intelligence?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Absolutely.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Does the Senator agree that our criminal system is not \nfocused on that?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Absolutely. In fact, we specifically tell people \narrested that they have a right not to provide any intelligence, and it \nindicates it is clearly not the primary function.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Does the Senator agree with me that if this Congress\n\n[[Page S8032]]\n\nchose to change the law and say that an American citizen who has \nassociated himself with al-Qaida cannot be interrogated for \nintelligence-gathering purposes, we would be less safe?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Absolutely.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. And that would be a change in the law as it exists today.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Absolutely.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Does the Senator agree with me that his amendment that \nsays you can be acquitted but still be held as an enemy prisoner is \nconsistent with the law today?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I certainly believe it is.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Senator for offering this amendment.\n  To my colleagues, we are trying to fight a war, not a crime, within \nthe value systems of being the United States, being the champion of the \nfree world. I do not believe in torturing people, but I do believe--\ndoes the Senator agree with me that when it comes to interrogating \npeople, sometimes the best tool is time?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Absolutely. Someone may not be willing to talk today, \nbut as time goes by they might be willing to completely change and be \nforthcoming.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Does the Senator agree with me that we gathered good \nintelligence over time from people held at Guantanamo Bay?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is certainly true.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Without water boarding them?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Absolutely.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. My point to my colleagues--and I enjoyed this \ndiscussion--is that if you take the ability to hold someone as an enemy \ncombatant off the table, you cannot interrogate them for intelligence-\ngathering purposes, and if you put a time limit on how long you can \nhold them, you defeat the purpose of gathering intelligence. Does the \nSenator agree with that?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Absolutely. That would undermine one of the functions \nof the U.S. military in dealing with enemies of the state.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Does my colleague also agree that in this war, we provide \na due process unlike any other war in the past?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. There is no doubt. No war has ever been lawyered to the \ndegree this has.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Does the Senator agree with me that every enemy \ncombatant, citizen other otherwise, held at Guantanamo Bay or captured \nin the United States has their day in Federal court through habeas \nproceedings?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. They do, and to a large degree that is different from \nany other war in our history.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. We never had, in the history of other wars, a Federal \njudge determining whether the military has the ability to determine \nwhether someone is an enemy combatant, but we have that in this war. \nDoes the Senator agree with that?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Absolutely.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Does the Senator agree that the government has to prove \nto an independent judge by a preponderance of the evidence that the \nperson is a member of al-Qaida involved in hostilities?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. So everybody held after judicial review for the first \ntime in the history of warfare.\n  Does the Senator agree with me that the annual review process that we \nhave created by this law, this bill, the Defense Authorization Act, is \nsomething we have not done in other wars?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. We have not done that before, yes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Every detainee not only gets their day in Federal court, \nthe government must prove they have a solid case to hold them as an \nenemy combatant, and everyone gets a yearly review as to whether they \nare a continuing threat?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I believe so, yes, consistent with the language in the \nrecent Supreme Court opinions--recent opinions--and perhaps it even \ngoes further than what the Supreme Court requires.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Is the Senator familiar with competency hearings in the \ncivilian court?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. In our civilian law, we can hold people who are a danger \nto themselves or others without a trial but with judicial oversight; is \nthat correct?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is done every day, yes, with judicial oversight.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Would the Senator agree with me that it is very smart to \nevaluate whether we should allow someone to be let go and intelligence \nprofessionals should be able to make that decision as to whether the \nindividual is a military threat, that that is a logical process?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Absolutely it is. And just for the fact of my \namendment, it does not require people to be held. It only gives the \ngovernment the authority to do so if they deem it appropriate for the \ndefense of America.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Does my colleague agree with me that the recidivism rate \nof people we are releasing from Guantanamo Bay has gone up?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes. It is extraordinarily disappointing, actually, and \nagainst projections of many of those advocating for early release.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Some of these people have gone back to fighting and \nkilled American soldiers?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. They certainly have.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Does the Senator agree with me that the dangers our \nNation faces do not justify changing existing law, denying this country \nthe ability to gather intelligence even against an American citizen \njoined with al-Qaida, that that would be an unwise decision given the \ndangers we're facing?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Does he agree with me that we need a legal system that \nunderstands the difference between fighting a war and fighting a crime?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. So well said. I agree.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, with regard to the question of \ncitizenship, I would just say to my colleague that this in no way deals \nwith that. Whatever the courts, whatever the bill and other laws say \nabout citizenship will apply here. It does not change that status at \nall. I do believe the legislation is clearly consistent with the \nstatements and testimony of President Obama; Attorney General Eric \nHolder; Jeh Johnson, counsel of the Secretary of Defense; Secretary of \nState Clinton, and others.\n  I urge acceptance of my amendment and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 1073 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Cardin \namendment, No. 1073, be withdrawn. That has the approval of the sponsor \nof the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I want to say a word about two amendments \nI have offered, both of which I think are important and both of which \nshould be agreed to.\n  As I think you know, this country has a recordbreaking deficit and a \n$15 trillion national debt. What many people do not know is that one of \nthe reasons our deficit is as high as it is is because there is a \nsignificant amount of fraud from defense contractors who sell their \nproducts to the Department of Defense.\n  I think the American people are very clear that when we pay one \ndollar for a product that goes to our military, we want to get one \ndollar's worth of value; that we do not want to see the taxpayers of \nthis country or the Department of Defense ripped off because of \nfraudulent contractors. Unfortunately, fraud within the DOD in terms of \nprivate contractors is widespread.\n  During the last number of years, we have seen company after company \nengaged in fraud, including some of the largest defense contractors in \nthe United States. For example, Lockheed Martin, the largest defense \ncontractor in our country, in 2008 paid $10.5 million to settle charges \nthat it defrauded the government by submitting false invoices on a \nmultibillion-dollar contract connected to the Titan IV space-launch \nvehicle program. That did not seem to sour the relationship between \nLockheed and the DOD, which gave Lockheed $30.2 billion in contracts in \nfiscal year 2009--more than ever before. One of the patterns we see is \nthat a company gets convicted or reaches a settlement with regard to \ncharges of fraud, but next year they continue to get very significant \ncontracts.\n  In another case regarding one of the very large defense contractors, \nNorthrop Grumman paid $62 million in 2005\n\n[[Page S8033]]\n\nto settle charges that ``it engaged in a fraud scheme by routinely \nsubmitting false contract proposals'' and ``concealed basic problems in \nits handling of inventory, scrap and attrition.'' Despite that serious \ncharge of pervasive and repeated fraud, Northrop Grumman received $12.9 \nbillion in contracts the following year, 16 percent more than the year \nbefore.\n\n  It seems clear to me that we need to do a much better job in terms of \nattacking fraud within the Department of Defense. Several years ago, I \noffered an amendment--which was passed--which provided that the DOD \nlist virtually all of the fraud committed within the DOD. We have that \nreport, and it is rather astounding. People should read it. Right now \nwhat this amendment does is it says to the DOD: Get your act together, \nhire the necessary well-trained staff so they are monitoring the \ncontracts and making sure we do not continue to see the pervasive \namount of fraud committed against the taxpayers of this country or the \nDefense Department. I would hope very much that amendment gets \nwidespread support and that we see it passed.\n  There is another amendment we have offered, which I think is equally \nimportant, and that deals with making sure the Department of Defense--\nwhich turns out to be the largest single consumer of energy in the \nUnited States of America. Obviously, the Department of Defense has huge \nresources, controls huge numbers of buildings, has enormous aircraft, \nand so forth and so on. It is by far the single largest consumer of \nenergy in the United States, accounting for approximately 90 percent of \nFederal energy consumption, with an annual energy cost of up to $18 \nbillion. So the Department of Defense spends $18 billion on energy \ncosts alone. I think, in recent years, the Department of Defense has \nunderstood the importance of trying to move toward energy efficiency in \nterms of saving energy, but we have a long way to go.\n  The major program to help cut energy consumption and costs at our \nmilitary bases is called the Energy Conservation Investment Program. \nThis is a very important program, although a relatively small program. \nThis program has operated for more than 10 years, helping to invest in \nprograms for more energy-efficient lighting, for example, at an Air \nForce base in Alaska, geothermal heating at Fort Knox Army Base in \nKentucky, wind turbines for an Army base in Arizona, and solar power \nfor the Air Force in Colorado.\n  Historically, according to the Department of Defense, every $1 used \nby the Energy Conservation Investment Program yields $2 in savings. We \ninvest in energy efficiency; we invest in sustainable energy. For every \n$1 invested, we save $2. This makes it a very positive program for the \nDOD. Some projects, such as energy efficiency improvements at a Navy \nbase in California, achieve greater than $15 in savings for every $1 \ninvested.\n  The Department itself, the DOD, has stated this program achieves \n``long-term public benefits by investing in technologies that increase \neconomic efficiency and health benefits, build new sources of renewable \nenergy, enhance job creation/retention, improve military facilities, \nand improve the quality of life for our troops and their families.''\n  Unfortunately, the authorization for this program in the current \nDefense authorization bill is $135 million, a relatively small amount \nof money for a Department of Defense which spends about $18 billion \nevery year on energy. I think what we want to see is, A, the DOD save \nmoney through energy efficiency and sustainable energy and, secondly, \nbecome a model for the country as we attempt to break our dependence on \nfossil fuel, foreign oil, and we attempt to cut back on greenhouse gas \nemissions.\n  I can tell you that in the State of Vermont, we have our National \nGuard base, where we have worked with them to install a major solar \ninstallation which will pay a significant part of their electric bill. \nFrankly, I would like to see this done on National Guard bases all over \nthe country and to the Active-Duty structures as well.\n  The bottom line is, we are currently spending about $135 million, a \nrelatively small amount of money compared to the $18 billion energy \nbill run up by the DOD. What this amendment would do is increase the \nauthorization for the Energy Conservation Investment Program to $200 \nmillion, up from $135 million--not anywhere near as much as I think we \nshould be doing, but it is a step forward in helping the Department of \nDefense save money on their energy bill, break our dependence on \nforeign oil, and help us cut greenhouse gas emissions.\n  We know there remain many worthy projects at our military bases that \nhave not yet been funded at today's funding levels that could be funded \nif my amendment were to pass. The amendment is fully offset and paid \nfor by reducing expenditures on construction at overseas' bases, while \nstill leaving nearly $300 million in funding for that purpose. I think \nthat is a decent offset.\n  I applaud the Department of Defense and the military for the strides \nthey have made so far in investing in energy efficiency and renewable \nenergy. There are some wonderful projects going on all over this \ncountry--in fact, all over the world--under the DOD, and they deserve \ncredit for that. They can and should be a leader for our country, but \nwe still have a very long way to go.\n  I would ask for support from my colleagues for this amendment, which \nwill save the Department of Defense money, will help break our \ndependency on foreign oil, move us to energy independence, and cut \ngreenhouse gas emissions.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 1230, As Modified, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent to withdraw McCain amendment No. \n1230, as modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1172, As Modified\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a \nmodification to amendment No. 1172 be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1172), as modified, is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To require a report assessing the reimbursements from the \n  Coalition Support Fund to the Government of Pakistan for operations \n          conducted in support of Operation Enduring Freedom)\n\n       At the end of subtitle B of title XII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1230. REPORT ON COALITION SUPPORT FUND REIMBURSEMENTS TO \n                   THE GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN FOR OPERATIONS \n                   CONDUCTED IN SUPPORT OF OPERATION ENDURING \n                   FREEDOM.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than 120 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense, shall \n     submit a report to the congressional defense committees and \n     the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the \n     Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives \n     assessing the effectiveness of the Coalition Support Fund \n     reimbursements to the Government of Pakistan for operations \n     conducted in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.\n       (b) Elements.--The report required under subsection (a) \n     shall include the following elements:\n       (1) A description of the types of reimbursements requested \n     by the Government of Pakistan.\n       (2) The total amount reimbursed to the Government of \n     Pakistan since the beginning of Operation Enduring Freedom, \n     in the aggregate and by fiscal year.\n       (3) The percentage and types of reimbursement requests made \n     by the Government of Pakistan for which the United States \n     Government has deferred or not provided payment.\n       (4) An assessment of the effectiveness of Coalition Support \n     Fund reimbursements in supporting operations conducted by the \n     Government of Pakistan in support of Operation\n\n[[Page S8034]]\n\n     Enduring Freedom and of the impact of those operations in \n     containing the ability of terrorist organizations to threaten \n     the stability of Afghanistan and Pakistan and to impede the \n     operations of the United States in Afghanistan.\n       (5) Recommendations if any, relative to potential \n     alternatives to or termination of reimbursements from the \n     Coalition Support Fund to the Government of Pakistan, taking \n     into account the transition plan for Afghanistan.\n       (c) Form.--The report required under subsection (a) shall \n     be submitted in unclassified form, but may contain a \n     classified annex.\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I wish to speak briefly about this \namendment. I think most people in this body understand we are \nreimbursing the Pakistani military for efforts they are putting forth \non behalf of what we are doing in Afghanistan in Enduring Freedom. We \nhave crafted an amendment that asks for certain reporting to take place \nfrom the Pentagon and for them to look at ways of diminishing this \nreimbursement over time as we wind down our operations in Afghanistan.\n  This amendment has been drafted in such a way as to not further \nescalate tensions between us and the Government of Pakistan. This is a \ngood-government type of amendment that asks the Pentagon to begin \nlooking at ways of decreasing the support we are giving to the \nPakistani military on our behalf regarding Afghanistan as we wind down \nour operations there simultaneously.\n  It is my understanding that both the chairman and ranking member of \nthe Armed Services Committee have accepted this, there is no hold from \nthe majority on the Foreign Relations Committee, and I hope we will \nhave an opportunity to vote and pass this by voice vote very soon.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I support the amendment, as modified, by \nthe Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Corker, who has devoted a great deal of \ntime and effort and thought to this issue, and the result is this \namendment. I point out that it would require the Secretary of Defense \nto prepare a report on the effectiveness of coalition support fund \nreimbursements made to Pakistan in support of coalition military \noperations in Afghanistan.\n  Before I proceed, let me once again express my deep condolences to \nthe families of the Pakistani soldiers who were killed this weekend in \na cross-border air action. All Americans are deeply saddened by this \ntragedy, and I fully support NATO and the U.S. military in their \ncommitment to conduct a thorough and expeditious investigation.\n  As my colleagues will recall--this is an important aspect of Senator \nCorker's amendment--Congress has authorized and appropriated funding \nfor coalition support fund reimbursements to Pakistan since we began \nour military operations in Afghanistan. At the time, Pakistan made a \nstrategic decision to support the U.S. war effort against the Taliban \ngovernment in Afghanistan and their al-Qaida terrorist allies. In \nresponse, Congress and the Bush administration agreed to reimburse the \nPakistani Government for military activities that support our mission \nin Afghanistan.\n  Over the past decade, Congress has provided billions of dollars worth \nof these reimbursements to Pakistan, and we should acknowledge that \nmuch good has come of it. Over the past few years in particular, \nPakistan has shifted tens of thousands of their soldiers from the \neastern border of their country opposite India to the tribal areas in \nwestern Pakistan. Pakistani troops have been deployed and engaged in \nmilitary operations in their western provinces and tribal areas for \nmore than 2 years straight. They have paid a heavy price in this \nprolonged fighting.\n  Hundreds of Pakistani troops have given their lives to fight our \nmutual terrorist enemies in their country, and thousands of Pakistani \ncivilians have been tragically murdered in the same time by these \nmilitant groups who show no compunction about attacking weddings and \nfunerals and mosques. We honor the sacrifice of Pakistan's soldiers, \nand we mourn the loss of innocent Pakistani civilians.\n  It must be noted, however, that certain deeply troubling realities \nexist within Pakistan. It must be noted that elements in Pakistan's \narmy and intelligence service continue to support the Haqqani Network \nand other terrorist groups that are killing U.S. troops in Afghanistan, \nas well as innocent civilians in Afghanistan, India, and Pakistan. It \nmust also be noted that the vast majority of the materials for \nimprovised explosive devices that are maiming and killing U.S. troops \nin Afghanistan originate within Pakistan. These are facts. We cannot \ndeny them. Any effective strategy for Pakistan and Afghanistan must \nproceed from this realistic basis.\n  It is for this reason that I believe this amendment and this report \nwould be extremely useful. Already, in response to recent Pakistani \nactivities, the administration has chosen to withhold coalition support \nfund reimbursements to Pakistan. Over the past two quarters, that \nwithheld money amounts to roughly $600 million. I can imagine that, \namid the current tensions, further administration requests to Congress \nfor reimbursement of coalition support funds for Pakistan will not be \nforthcoming.\n  The report requested in this amendment would seek additional \ninformation on the amounts, types, and effectiveness of coalition \nsupport fund reimbursements to the Government of Pakistan. It also \nwould seek recommendations as to the future disposition of this \nprogram, including potential alternatives to it or the possible \ntermination of it altogether. That option cannot be ruled out. This is \nvaluable information and recommendations to have as Congress continues \nto discuss and debate not just the future of the coalition support fund \nreimbursements to Pakistan but the future of our relationship with \nPakistan more broadly. I strongly support this amendment.\n  Again, I don't want to spend too much time stating the facts. This is \na terrible dilemma. The fact is that Pakistan is a nuclear nation. They \nhave a significant nuclear inventory. The fact is that for 10 years we \nand Pakistan had virtually no relations. We found that not to be a \nproductive exercise. But at the same time, when there exists--as my \ncolleague from Tennessee agrees--two fertilizer factories from which \ncome the majority of the materials used for the majority of IEDs \nmanufactured and that are killing young Americans, it is not tolerable. \nI understand, as I have said earlier in my comments, the tragedy that \nresulted from the deaths of these young Pakistani soldiers. I also \nunderstand, as every one of us does, what it is like to call a family \nmember of a young man or woman who has lost their life in Afghanistan, \nwhich has happened many times, as a result of an IED.\n  In a hearing of the Armed Services Committee, the then-Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff ADM Mike Mullen, stated:\n\n       The fact remains that the Quetta Shura and the Haqqani \n     Network operate from Pakistan with impunity.\n\n  I wish to repeat, these are the words of the former Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff.\n\n       Extremist organizations serving as proxies of the \n     government of Pakistan are attacking Afghan troops and \n     civilians as well as U.S. soldiers. For example, we believe \n     the Haqqani Network--which has long enjoyed the support and \n     protection of the Pakistani government and is, in many ways, \n     a strategic arm of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence \n     Agency--is responsible for the September 13th attacks against \n     the U.S. embassy in Kabul.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       This is ample evidence confirming that the Haqqanis were \n     behind the June 28th attack against the Inter-Continental \n     Hotel in Kabul and the September 10th truck bomb attack that \n     killed five Afghans and injured another 96 individuals, 77 of \n     whom were U.S. soldiers . . .\n\n  Finally, another comment by Admiral Mullen who, by the way, worked \nvery hard for a long period of time to develop a close working \nrelationship with General Kayani and other military leaders in \nPakistan. He went on to say:\n\n       The Quetta Shura and the Haqqani Network are hampering \n     efforts to improve security in Afghanistan, spoiling \n     possibilities for broader reconciliation, and frustrating \n     U.S.-Pakistan relations. The actions by the Pakistani \n     government to support them--actively and passively--\n     represents a growing problem that is undermining U.S. \n     interests and may violate international norms, potentially \n     warranting sanction. In supporting these groups, the \n     government of Pakistan, particularly the Pakistani Army, \n     continues to jeopardize\n\n[[Page S8035]]\n\n     Pakistan's opportunity to be a respected and prosperous \n     Nation with genuine regional and international influence.\n\n  Finally, I wish to say again this is an incredibly difficult \nchallenge for U.S. security policy. We have a country on which we are \ndependent in many respects for supplies, for cooperation, for, \nhopefully, not to be a sanctuary, although it is not the case, for \nTaliban and al-Qaida elements. We have a country that is a nuclear \npower, and we have a country that has a government that I will say \ncharitably is very weak.\n  It seems to me the Corker amendment is important for the American \npeople to know exactly where we are, what policy we are going to \nformulate, and what measures need to be taken, because we have, as I \nmentioned earlier, spent billions of U.S. taxpayers' dollars. That \ndoesn't play very well in States such as mine where we have 9 percent \nunemployment and more than half--or just less than half the homes \nunderwater. So the Corker amendment isn't all we need. In fact, we need \nto have a national debate and discussion about the whole issue of our \nrelations with Pakistan. But I believe the Corker amendment is a very \nimportant measure so we can assure the American people that not only \nare their tax dollars wisely spent but that actions are being taken to \nprevent needless wounding and death of our brave young men and women \nwho are serving in the military.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support the amendment of the Senator from \nTennessee. It is a balanced amendment which deals with a very complex \nsituation. What Senator Corker is doing is pointing out very important \nfacts. One is that Pakistan has received a lot of funds from the United \nStates for this particular purpose which is aimed at helping the \nsuccess of our operations in Afghanistan. The whole purpose of the \ncoalition support fund is to reimburse Pakistan for the support they \nprovide--for instance, in providing security for trucks and other \nequipment that is going through Pakistan that have oil, fuel, food \ngoing into Afghanistan to support the effort in Afghanistan. That is \nthe purpose of these funds. It is a good purpose. This is not a foreign \naid deal; this is a reimbursement deal.\n  The problem is that while on the one hand the Pakistanis are \nassisting us, on the other hand they are assisting our enemy and the \nenemy of mankind and the enemy of the Afghan people and the enemy of \nthe coalition forces in Afghanistan. That is the problem. That is the \ndilemma which we all face and which this amendment seeks to address. \nAgain, it does so in a way which doesn't prejudge the outcome of the \nassessment, but it makes a very important point, which is, as is now \nstated in the amended final paragraph, that we need recommendations \ngiven this ``on the one hand they are with us, on the other hand they \nare against us'' situation. We need recommendations from the \nadministration, if any, relating to potential alternatives to or \ntermination of reimbursements for the coalition support fund, the \nGovernment of Pakistan, taking into account the transition plan for \nAfghanistan.\n  I agree with my friend from Arizona that we send condolences to the \nfamilies of troops in Pakistan who have recently lost their lives. We \nalso have to understand that Pakistan has paid a huge price for \nterrorism in their country against their people. They have paid a \nmassive price. But what is unacceptable to us is that they are making \nus pay a price by providing a safe haven for the Haqqanis and for the \nQuetta Shura. Our troops, our families, coalition troops, coalition \nfamilies, Afghan troops, and Afghan families are paying a heavy price \nbecause of the Pakistan support through their ISI for the insurgency in \nAfghanistan.\n  Admiral Mullen, a former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, put \nit very succinctly. He said the Haqqani Network is a veritable arm of \nthe Pakistan intelligence service. When he was pressed on that \nformulation, he said he meant every word of it.\n  So we have to send an important message to Pakistan, and the message \nis that we want a normal relationship if we can have one, but we cannot \nhave a normal relationship if you are, on the one hand, supporting the \nvery people who are attacking us in Afghanistan and, on the other hand, \npurporting to help us through the protection of supplies going through \nPakistan, helping us succeed in Afghanistan.\n  We cannot have it both ways. They cannot have it both ways. This \namendment sends a very significant and important message, I believe, to \nthe Pakistanis and to our coalition allies and to our Afghan partners \nthat what is going on inside Pakistan has to come to an end. I believe \nthis will help bring that important result about. So I very much \nsupport the amendment of Mr. Corker, the Senator from Tennessee, and \nhope we can adopt it.\n  If there is no further debate about it--there may be others who do \nwant to debate, so I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, because of the tremendous cooperation of \nthe Senator from Michigan and the Senator from Arizona--obviously, my \ngoal is to call for this amendment to be adopted--I did not provide a \nlot of context because I know they both support this amendment. But I \nwant to thank them both for their comments.\n  I do not think there are two Senators who can better articulate the \nissue we face in Afghanistan with Pakistan, which is both a friend and \na foe on many occasions. None of us who have traveled to Afghanistan--I \nknow these two Senators have probably more than most, but all of us who \nhave been there have heard our generals talking about the fact that \nthey are fighting a war in Afghanistan that is really being led and \ndirected out of Pakistan.\n  So basically we have an issue here. I think the two Senators have \narticulated the issue very well. The fact is, we need to know, first of \nall, if what we are doing in support of the Pakistan military is \neffective for us, and the two Senators have outlined that is a big \nissue.\n  The second piece is how we are actually reimbursing. If you talk with \nfolks at the State Department, we literally are going through reams of \ninvoices and documents, looking at how many bullets they have used, how \nmuch food has been supplied to the military, what is going to be \ncounted, what is not going to be counted. We are spending more time, in \nmany ways, accounting for this than we are really looking at how \neffective the aid is.\n  This amendment would deal with both of those issues. I thank the \nSenators for putting this in the proper context, and I do hope, with \nthe Senators' support and the support of the chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, that this is an amendment we can voice vote. I \nthank both Senators for their leadership on this issue but also for \nputting this in the appropriate context.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Without objection, the amendment, as modified, is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1172), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I believe Senator Cantwell will want to be \nrecognized.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll of the Senate.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, we continue to make progress on the \nDefense authorization bill. Hopefully somewhere in the Halls of \nCongress, we are also making progress on the FAA authorization bill \nand, maybe before the end of the year, getting that to a final resolve.\n  I know my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are working very \nhard, but I had to come to the Senate floor at this moment to say that \nChristmas came early in the Northwest today when a major deal between \nthe Boeing Company and aerospace workers, machinists, resolved what had \nbeen a conflict in the past on how to work together.\n\n[[Page S8036]]\n\n  A new relationship of working together on incentives and efficiency \nand performance has resulted in the Boeing Company making a decision to \nbuild the next-generation 737 MAX plane in the Pacific Northwest. That \nis great news for aerospace workers in Puget Sound. It means there is \ngoing to be a skill set for building fuel-efficient planes for many \nyears to come. But it is a great testament to both the company and the \nworkers who--a year ago you probably heard more about the NLRB issue, \nand now what you are hearing about is an agreement on a multiyear \ncontract that is going to get these workers jobs in building planes \nwith the next-generation technology.\n  This is very big and important news not just for the Pacific \nNorthwest but for the country because it means we can come together to \nresolve differences. I would hope the Senate might apply some of the \nsame things because the dispute as to where these two organizations \nwere about how to proceed to the future obviously had a lot of \ndiscussion, even here on the Senate floor, and yet now today we see \nthem coming together in a huge milestone agreement that means more \nplanes are going to be built, in an agreement where workers and the \ncompany are working together to improve performance and deliver these \nplanes, which many people want because they are so fuel-efficient, on \ntime.\n  So for the Northwest to have this kind of boost, this shot in the \narm, at this point in time is really important. I expect that as this \nagreement and the agreement details are seen by many people, they will \nsee this really is a way forward for the Northwest to continue to be at \nthe top of the aerospace game. That is important because the United \nStates needs to be at the top of the aerospace game. We are facing \ntough competition from many countries such as China and Europe and \nothers that are trying to lure the manufacturing base away from the \nUnited States.\n  What we see in the Northwest is that not only do you have a company \nsuch as Boeing, but you have a chain of many suppliers that are also \nworking to make aerospace manufacturing in the United States one of the \nkey industries in which the United States is world premier.\n  So I say congratulations to both the company and to the machinists \nand to Machinists International for their hard work on inking this \ndeal. I hope it will bring much benefit and economic growth not just to \nPuget Sound--certainly to there--but to the rest of the country as \nwell.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1126\n\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Feinstein amendment \nwith regard to section 1031 of this legislation. I am particularly \nworried because, unlike the authorized use of force original doctrine \nand legislation passed by the Congress, we limited the authority of the \nPresident and the U.S. military to those connected directly to the \nSeptember 11 mass murder of Americans. I think, in times of emergency, \nI understand that. But the legislation would be the first congressional \nauthorization to go far beyond that, to say that any ``person who . . . \nsubstantially supported al-Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces''--\nundefined--`` . . . including any person who has committed a \nbelligerent act'' would be allowed to be picked up by U.S. military \nauthorities and held in U.S. military detention.\n  While I am in favor of robust and flexible U.S. military action \noverseas, including action against American citizens waging war against \nthe United States, such as Anwar Al-Awlaki, I think we all should agree \non a special zone of protection inside the jurisdiction of the United \nStates on behalf of U.S. citizens.\n  I say this in support of the Feinstein amendment because I took the \ntime--as we all should from time to time, serving in this body--to re-\nread the Constitution of the United States yesterday. The Constitution \nsays quite clearly: In the trial of all crimes--no exception--there \nshall be a jury, and the trial shall be held in the State where said \ncrimes have been committed. Clearly, the Founding Fathers were talking \nabout a civilian court, of which the U.S. person is brought before in \nits jurisdiction.\n  They talk about treason against the United States, including war in \nthe United States. The Constitution says it ``shall consist only in \nlevying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them \nAid and Comfort.\n  The following sentence is instructive:\n\n       No person--\n\n  ``No person,'' it says--\n\n     shall be convicted of Treason unless on the Testimony of two \n     Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession in open \n     Court.\n\n  I would say that pretty clearly, ``open court'' is likely to be \ncivilian court.\n  Further, the Constitution goes on, that when a person is charged with \ntreason, a felony, or other crime, that person shall be ``removed to \nthe State having Jurisdiction of the Crime''--once again contemplating \ncivilian, State court and not the U.S. military.\n  As everyone knows, we have amended the Constitution many times. The \nfourth amendment of the Constitution is instructive here. It says:\n\n       The right of the people to be secure in their persons, \n     houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches \n     and seizures--\n\n  Including, by the way, the seizure of the person\n\n     shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, [except] \n     upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and \n     particularly describing the place to be searched, and the \n     persons or things to be seized.\n\n  Now, in section 1031(b)(2), I do not see the requirement for a \ncivilian judge to issue a warrant. So it appears this legislation \ndirectly violates the fourth amendment of the Constitution with regard \nto those rights which are inalienable, according to the Declaration of \nIndependence, and should be inviolate as your birth right as an \nAmerican citizen.\n\n  Recall the fifth amendment, which says:\n\n       No person--\n\n  By the way, remember, ``no person''; there is not an exception here.\n\n       No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or \n     otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or \n     indictment--\n\n  Hear the words--\n\n     of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval \n     forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of \n     War--\n\n  Meaning there is a separate jurisdiction for U.S. citizens who are in \nthe uniformed service of the United States. But unless you are in the \nservice of the United States, you are one of those ``no persons'' who \nshall be answerable for a ``capital'' or ``infamous crime,'' except on \n``indictment of a Grand Jury.''\n  The sixth amendment says:\n\n       In all criminal prosecutions--\n\n  Not some, not by exception; in all criminal prosecutions--\n\n     the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public \n     trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein \n     the crime shall have been committed. . . .\n\n  I go on to these because I regard all of these rights as inherent to \nU.S. citizens, granted to them by their birth in the United States.\n  If we go on through the Constitution's amendments, we find in the \nfourteenth amendment that it says:\n\n       No State shall make or enforce any law--\n\n  Any law--\n\n     which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens \n     of the United States. . . .\n\n  I realize these powers have been defined by courts. But we would \nrecall that even Abraham Lincoln ex post facto lost his ability to \nsuspend the writ of habeas corpus pursuant to a Supreme Court decision; \nthat in the case of Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, the Court did recognize that \nunder the 2001 statute, the President is authorized to detain persons \ncaptured while fighting U.S. forces in Afghanistan. But I will recall--\nand, by the way, this included American citizens--I will recall that \nwas in Afghanistan.\n  Clearly, we see in the case where an American citizen has gone to a \nforeign jurisdiction, joined a terrorist organization or foreign \nmilitary, and is waging war on the United States, they can be held as a \ndetainee of the U.S. military. Why didn't this legislation say that? \nWhy did it not restrict its purview to those provisions? In Padilla v. \nHanft, the Fourth Circuit did allow the capture of a U.S. citizen, \nPadilla--by the way, arrested at O'Hare Airport, a U.S. citizen and \nheld in military detention. The Fourth Circuit said because he had \nforeign training and a foreign connection that it was legal to hold \nhim.\n\n[[Page S8037]]\n\n  But, remember, very soon thereafter the Bush administration \nsurrendered this case. I think the Bush administration realized they \nwere about to lose in the Supreme Court on the subject of whether the \nU.S. military could arrest and detain a U.S. citizen and to deprive \nthem of their rights and subject them only to review under a petition \nof habeas corpus. I think they realized they had to kick Padilla into \nthe civilian court system, and therefore they did. It is only in that \ncontext that we should read the Padilla decision.\n  I think the bottom line is this: We funded a multihundred-billion-\ndollar Department of Defense, in the words of the movie, to put men on \nthat wall, that we need on that wall, to defend us against foreign \nthreats, and they must do hard and difficult things, including \nsometimes to U.S. citizens, such as Anwar al-Awlaki, who are waging war \non the United States from a terrorist base in Yemen.\n  But the whole purpose of this exercise and this institution is to \ndefend the rights of the United States and U.S. citizens inside their \nown country. One of the first things a person does when they join the \nU.S. military is not to swear allegiance to a President or to a foreign \nleader but actually swear allegiance to the Constitution of the United \nStates and to its rights.\n  What is the whole purpose of the Constitution? It is to defend our \nrights against the government because we are one of those unique \ngovernments that ``posits'' a limited government and which rights are \nreserved according to the 10th amendment to the States or the \nindividuals; that our rights supersede the government's. So we cannot \nsay for an individual, for example, in Wisconsin, who has never been \nabroad, who may or may not have committed an act or may or may not have \none association, that suddenly the U.S. military can roll in on that \nperson, seize him or her, hold them in military detention, and only \nsubject review of that case by one habeas corpus petition.\n  I would argue, then, that all of our rights as American citizens hang \non the decision of the President of the United States; that if the \nPresident of the United States decides a person is substantially part \nof al-Qaida, the Taliban, or associated forces engaged in hostilities \nagainst the United States or they have committed a belligerent act or \nsupported such hostilities in aid of such forces, all of their rights \nas an American citizen are now forfeited. Clearly, that is not the \ncase.\n  The Founding Fathers understood the power of the state run amok under \na distant king who did not regard the rights of the individual as worth \nmuch. We founded a republic and then wrote a constitution to defend \nthose rights. While we face a very difficult and dangerous world \noverseas and have to do difficult and dangerous things, which I \nsupport, we should make sure there is a place for peace and justice and \nrights inside the United States.\n  So for us, in looking at this provision, the Feinstein amendment \nclearly limits the scope of this legislation in an appropriate way--\nthat we do the difficult things overseas. But the whole purpose of the \nDepartment of Defense is to defend the United States and those rights \ninside our country, but that we as U.S. citizens, especially when we \nare inside this country, have inalienable rights which cannot be \nseparated from us by any executive action; that we can only be held, \nincarcerated, that we can only have our liberties taken away from us on \nindictment of a grand jury, before a civilian court, and with a \npresumption beyond a reasonable doubt by unanimous vote of that jury.\n  That is the essence of who we are as Americans, and it is a historic \ndecision that we would make if we allow this power to go forward. I \nthink that is why Senator Paul and I were the only two Republicans to \nvote against this. That is why so many e-mails and letters that I have \nreceived in the last few hours support this decision.\n  I understand that others have a different view. They describe the \nUnited States as a battlefield. I would say that is on overly harsh \ndetermination of how cheaply our rights can be held; that we have a \nmultihundred-billion-dollar Defense Department; that we have a \nsubstantial and capable FBI; that we have enormous State and city and \nlocal police establishments, all with the capabilities to investigate \nand prosecute crimes, but under the Constitution of the United States; \nand that if we hold U.S. citizens as capable of losing their rights on \nan executive branch decision, that not beyond the shadow of a doubt but \non a lower standard of care, that in the executive branch's view a \nperson is connected to one of those things, then our rights are not \nworth very much.\n  I would say the whole purpose of the Constitution is to hold our \nrights higher than the government and subject only to review by a \ncivilian court. That review, as described in the Constitution of the \nUnited States, is far more than a habeas corpus review. The text of the \nConstitution specifically refers to grand jury indictment.\n  For those who have questions, I would urge them, first, take a moment \nto reread the Constitution, that first document which, as a member of \nthe U.S. military or as an elected Member of this body, we have to \nswear allegiance to, and then make up their minds. I think when they \ndo, they will support the Feinstein amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I must admit that I have heard some \nbizarre arguments in my time as a Member of this body in referencing \nthe Constitution of the United States as a basis for the argument. Now, \nit is my understanding my friend from South Carolina--I ask unanimous \nconsent to enter into a colloquy with the Senator from South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. It is my understanding that under the Constitution, it is \nthe Supreme Court of the United States that gives the interpretation of \nthe Constitution as to various laws and challenges to the Constitution. \nIt is their responsibility. Is that a correct assumption?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes, it is.\n  Mr. McCAIN. So our colleague from Illinois who continues to quote \nfrom the Constitution of the United States fails to quote from the \nspecific addressing of this issue by the U.S. Supreme Court, \nspecifically the Hamdan decision. Is that correct?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Is it not true that according to that decision, the U.S. \nSupreme Court, whom we ask to interpret the Constitution of the United \nStates--they have made many interpretations over the years--says there \nis no bar to this Nation's holding one of its own citizens as an enemy \ncombatant.\n  Now, one would think to the casual observer that is exactly what the \nU.S. Supreme Court meant. It is fairly plain language, not really \ncomplicated. I am not a lawyer, but how the Senator from Illinois, \nquoting from inalienable rights, can somehow totally disregard in every \nway what the U.S. Supreme Court says--they go on to say we hold that \n``citizens who associate themselves with the military arm of the enemy \ngovernment''--and I believe, in the view of most, they would view that \nas a member of al-Qaida, which this legislation specifically addresses. \nWe hold that ``citizens who associate themselves with the military arm \nof the enemy government and with its aid, guidance and direction,'' \nwhich is exactly, basically, the language of our legislation, ``aid, \nguidance and direction enter this country,'' enter this country, ``bent \non hostile acts are enemy belligerents within the meaning of the law of \nwar.''\n\n  How can anything be more clear to the Senator from Illinois? I mean, \nit is beyond belief. It is beyond belief.\n  They then go on and talk about the Civil War, the U.S. Supreme Court \ndoes. They talk about the Civil War. They talk about a code binding the \nUnion Army during the Civil War that captured rebels would be treated \nas prisoners of war. So a citizen, no less than an alien, can ``be part \nof or supporting forces hostile to the United States or coalition \npartners and engaged in an armed conflict against the United States.''\n  Now, after 9/11, we declared that we were at war with al-Qaida. Is \nthat correct?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. So we are at war. We have American citizens who are enemy \ncombatants. Yet the Senator from Illinois, in the most bizarre fashion \nthat I have heard, says, therefore, they are\n\n[[Page S8038]]\n\nguaranteed the protections of--as he said--a trial.\n  I mean, I do not get it. Maybe the Senator from South Carolina can \nexplain.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I will be glad to yield to my friend from Illinois. Let \nme just try to set the stage the best I can. And I would love to have \nSenator Levin weigh in and anyone else.\n  The law, as it exists today, to my good friend from Illinois, has \nlong held that when an American citizen collaborates with the enemy, \nthat is an act of war, not a common crime. The constitutional review \nprovided by the Supreme Court in cases involving American citizens \ncollaborating with the enemy has said that we view that as an act of \nwar and we apply the law of war. So our Supreme Court, in the Hamdi \ncase just a few years ago, upheld the ruling in the In re Quirin case, \nwhich went back to World War II.\n  In that case, we had American citizens assisting Nazi saboteurs. The \nSupreme Court ruled that citizenship status does not prevent someone \nfrom being treated as part of the enemy force when they choose to join \nthe enemy.\n  Why is this important? My good friend from Illinois is an intel \nofficer. Intelligence gathering is part of war. An enemy combatant can \nbe interrogated by our military intelligence community without Miranda \nrights. They can be held for an indefinite period of time to be \nquestioned about past, present, and future attacks. The Supreme Court \nhas legitimized that process because the individual in question was an \nAmerican citizen captured in Afghanistan.\n  He pled to the Court: You cannot hold me as an enemy combatant \nbecause I am an American citizen.\n  The Court said: No, there is a long history in this country of having \nAmerican citizens who collaborate with the enemy to be held as an enemy \ncombatant.\n  Unfortunately, in every war we have engaged in, American citizens \nhave provided aid and comfort to the enemy. In World War II we had \nAmerican citizens assisting Nazi saboteurs.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Was not one of the most famous cases a woman whose name \nwas Tokyo Rose, who propagandized--she was an American citizen. She \npropagandized on behalf of the Japanese when we were in the war. \nAfterwards she was given a military trial.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes. The point is----\n  Mr. McCAIN. Not a civilian trial, not given her Miranda rights, but \ntried by military tribunal.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Right. What we have done in the Military Commissions Act \nin 2009, civilians, American citizens cannot be tried in military \ncommissions. It can only go to Federal court. But the point we are \ntrying to make is it has been long held in this country that when an \nAmerican citizen abroad or on the homeland decides to help the enemy, \nwe have the right to hold them, not under a criminal theory but under \nthe law of war because their effort to help the enemy, I say to my good \nfriend from Illinois, is an act of war against their fellow citizens.\n  This is so important. If we deny our country the ability to hold and \ninterrogate an American citizen who has joined forces with al-Qaida, we \nlose the ability to find out the intelligence they may have to keep us \nsafe. If the choice is that an American citizen who chooses to \ncollaborate with al-Qaida must be put in the criminal justice system, \nmeaning they will have criminalized the war, the Congress will have \nrestricted executive branch power.\n  To make it clear--please understand, I say to Senator Feinstein--the \ncourts of the United States have acknowledged that the executive branch \ncan hold an American citizen as an enemy combatant when they engage and \nassist the enemy. The courts of the United States recognize the power \nof the executive to do that as Commander in Chief.\n  The question for us is, Do we want to be the first Congress in the \nhistory of the Nation to say to the executive branch that they no \nlonger have that power given to them by the courts, inherent with being \nCommander in Chief, to protect us against enemies foreign and domestic.\n  I argue to my colleagues, given the threats we face from homegrown \nterrorism, from al-Qaida groups and their affiliates, that now is not \nthe time to change the law preventing our military intelligence \ncommunity from holding an American citizen who is helping the enemy on \nthe homeland and prevent them from gathering intelligence.\n  I argue that the reason no other Congress has done this in past wars \nis because it didn't make a lot of sense. I argue that if a Senator \ncame to the floor of the Senate during World War II and suggested that \nan American citizen who sided with the Nazis to sabotage American \ninterests here could not be held as an enemy combatant, they would have \nbeen run out of town because most citizens would say anybody who helps \nthe enemy--citizen or not--is a threat to our country.\n  Unlike other wars, we do have due process that exists today that \nnever existed before. No Nazi soldier was able to go to a Federal court \nand say: Judge, let me go. The reason I have agreed, and the courts \nhave applied habeas review to enemy combatant determination, is this is \na war without end.\n  How does one become an enemy combatant? The executive branch makes \nthe accusation. They have to follow the statutory criteria. This is a \nlimited group of people in a limited classification. American citizen \nor not, if someone falls into this group, they can be held as an enemy \ncombatant. But the executive branch has to prove to an independent \njudiciary that the case is sufficient, and under the law the judge has \nto agree with the military; we have an independent judiciary looking \nover the shoulder of the military in this war, unlike at any other \ntime. So the government has to prove to a Federal judge, by a \npreponderance of the evidence, that this person is, in fact, an enemy \ncombatant. If the judge disagrees, they are let go. If the judge \nagrees, we hold the enemy combatant, and they get an annual review \nprocess as to whether future detention is warranted. So we have robust \ndue process.\n  But please understand what the Feinstein amendment is about. It is \nabout the Congress of the United States, the Senate of the United \nStates, for the first time in American history, restricting the ability \nof the executive branch to hold an American citizen who is \ncollaborating with the enemy and question them under the law of war. If \nwe do that to ourselves, we will regret it. I don't want to be in the \nfirst Congress, in the times in which we live, to change the law to \ndeny our intelligence community and the Department of Defense the \nability to deal with American citizens who have decided on their own to \nbecome part of al-Qaida. The day one decides they are going to side \nwith al-Qaida, they have committed an act of war against the rest of \nus, and the courts acknowledge they can be held as an enemy combatant, \nnot a common criminal.\n  The question for the Congress is, Do we want to undo that in the \ntimes in which we live? I plead with everybody in this body, get \nyourself educated about what the law is today. I ask Senator Levin, we \nhave done nothing to change the law in this bill; is that correct?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Not only does 1031, the overall section, not change the \nlaw, it incorporates it, according to the administration's own \nstatement of policy on what the current law is. The Senator is right. \nThere is nothing in here which in any way affects habeas corpus, nor \nshould we seek to do so. Habeas corpus remains exactly as it is. We \ncould not change it if we wanted to, and we don't want to.\n  While the Senator asked me a question, I wish to answer a question \nwith a question to him. Is it not true that for the first time, we \nprovide that where there is going to be an unprivileged enemy \nbelligerent who could be held in long-term detention under the law of \nwar--for the first time we provide a judge and a lawyer to that person; \nis that right?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. That is correct, and we have been working on that \ntogether for 5 years. To respond, if I may, because I think it is a \nvery good discussion, does the Senator agree with me that under the law \nthat exists today, in terms of the Supreme Court rulings, an American \ncitizen can be held as an enemy combatant?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I read this yesterday, and I will read it again now. The \nSenator is right. I don't know how anybody reading this can reach any \nother conclusion but what the Supreme\n\n[[Page S8039]]\n\nCourt says, not because they are right or wrong but because of the \nSupreme Court: ``There is no bar to this Nation's holding one of its \nown citizens as an enemy combatant.''\n  By the way, nor should there be, in my judgment.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Does the Senator agree that in past wars American \ncitizens, unfortunately, have collaborated with the enemy?\n  Mr. LEVIN. They have, and they have been treated as enemy combatants.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Does he agree with me that in World War II some American \ncitizens agreed to assist the Nazis and were held as enemy combatants?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I agree.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Does the Senator agree it is good policy to hold and \ninterrogate someone who is helping al-Qaida to find out what they know?\n  Mr. LEVIN. It is good policy. If they decline, under the procedures \nunder our language, the person should be first interrogated for \nwhatever length of time those procedures provide--by the FBI, local \npolice or anybody else. They have the right to do that.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Does the Senator agree that the criminal justice system \nis not set up to gather military intelligence?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. To interrupt, briefly, I wonder--in the interpretation of \nthe Senator from Illinois of the Constitution of the United States--if \nit is an American citizen, say, somewhere over in Pakistan, who is \nplotting and seeking to destroy American citizens, it is OK for us to \nsend a predator and fire and kill that person, but according to the \ninterpretation of the Senator from Illinois, if that person were \napprehended in Charleston planning to blow up Shaw Air Force Base, then \nthat person would be given his Miranda rights, how in the world does \nthat fit?\n\n  Again, this is one of the more bizarre discussions I have had in the \n20-some years I have been a Member of this body.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Under the law as it exists today, an American citizen can \nbe held as an enemy combatant. The question we are debating on the \nfloor--Senator Feinstein is saying that in the future an American \ncitizen who is deemed to have collaborated with al-Qaida or the Taliban \nor others could no longer be held as an enemy combatant for an \nindefinite period, which means we cannot gather military intelligence \nas to what they know about past, present, and future attacks.\n  I argue we would be the first Congress in history to bring about that \nresult and that now would be the worst time in American history to do \nthat. If we cannot hold a citizen who is suspected of assisting al-\nQaida under the law of war, the only option is to put them in the \ncriminal justice system. Then we cannot hold them indefinitely, and we \ncannot ask about present, past or future attacks because now we are \ninvestigating a crime, nor should we be allowed to do that under \ncriminal law.\n  The point is that when a person assists the enemy, whether at home or \nabroad, they have committed an act of war against our citizens, and the \nSupreme Court has acknowledged that the executive branch has the power \nto hold them as an enemy combatant. The question is, Are we going to \nchange that and say in the 21st century, in 2011, every American \ncitizen who chooses to cooperate with al-Qaida can no longer be \ninterrogated for intelligence-gathering purposes by our Department of \nDefense and our intelligence community; that they have to go into the \ncriminal justice system right off the bat, where they are given a \nlawyer and are read their Miranda rights? If we do that, we are going \nto deny ourselves valuable intelligence. We would be saying to our \ncitizens that we no longer treat helping al-Qaida as an act of war \nagainst the rest of us.\n  If one suggested during World War II that someone who collaborated \nwith the Nazis should be viewed as a common criminal, most Americans \nwould have said: No, they turned on their fellow citizens and they are \nnow part of the enemy.\n  All I want to do is keep the law as it is because we need it now more \nthan ever. I am sensitive to due process. There is more due process in \nthis war. Every enemy combatant being held at Guantanamo Bay, captured \nin the United States, has to go before a Federal judge. The military \nhas to prove their case to a Federal judge. There is an annual review \nprocess. That makes sense to me. What doesn't make sense to me is for \nthis country and this Senate to overturn a power that makes eminent \nsense when we need it the most. It doesn't make sense to set aside a \nSupreme Court case that acknowledges that when an American citizen \naffiliates with al-Qaida, that is an act of war against the rest of us \nand to criminalize that conduct, denying us the ability to gather \nintelligence. If we go down that road, we have weakened ourselves as a \npeople, without any higher purpose.\n  To those American citizens thinking about helping al-Qaida, please \nknow what will come your way: death, detention, prosecution. If you are \nthinking about plotting with the enemy inside our country to do the \nrest of us harm, please understand what is coming your way: the full \nforce of the law.\n  The law I am talking about is the law of armed conflict. You subject \nyourself to being held as an enemy of the people of the United States, \ninterrogated about what you know and why you did what you did or \nplanned to do, and you subject yourself to imprisonment and death. The \nreason you subject yourself to that regime is because your decision to \nturn on the rest of us and help a group of people who would destroy our \nway of life is not something we idly accept. It is not a common, \neveryday crime. It is a decision by you to commit an act of aggression \nagainst the rest of us.\n  I hope and pray this Senate will not, for the first time in American \nhistory, deny our ability to interrogate and find intelligence from \nthose citizens who choose to associate with the enemy on our soil, \nbecause if we do that, it will be a deviation from the law that has \nexisted at a time when we need that law the most.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I will yield to Senator Feinstein in a \nminute. I appreciate the debate with my friends and mentors. The three \nof us who were just debating were all military officers, but we have \ndifferent views. We are dangerously close to being similar to the House \nof Representatives, where they have face-to-face debate. I appreciate \nthat.\n  The law that should not be changed is the Constitution of the United \nStates, and we realize the regulations of the United States have force, \nthat the statutes of the United States have greater force, and the \nSupreme Court decisions have even greater force. But no document is \nabove the actual words of the Constitution. I will say those words are \nour birthright as American citizens.\n  The sixth amendment says you shall be secure in your person and that \nshall not be violated and no warrant shall issue except upon probable \ncause--meaning that a court has made that decision. Your first \namendment rights say that no person--and there is no exception in the \nConstitution--shall be held to answer for capital or otherwise infamous \ncrimes, unless presentment or indictment of a grand jury.\n  By the way, I am talking specifically about a U.S. person inside the \njurisdiction of the United States. Our sixth amendment right says that \nin all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right of a \nspeedy and public trial. Our fourteenth amendment right says no State \nshall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or \nimmunities of the citizens of the United States. These are, without \nquestion, for U.S. citizens. There is a balancing act between the \nthreats we perceive. We know the threats from foreign enemies and \nterrorists. That is well known to us, especially the new generation of \nAmericans who witnessed the mass murders of September 11.\n  The Founding Fathers were also wrestling with another threat--the \nthreat of the state, the government itself, against its own individuals \nand the abuse of power. We would forget the lesson of history, unless \nwe understood that is a threat as well. We are told there will be no \nintelligence benefit if a U.S. citizen who is arrested can't be \ninterrogated by Homeland Defense or FBI people. And yet, I would say, \nas a member of the intelligence community, the FBI and the Department \nof Homeland Security are part of the intelligence community and feed\n\n[[Page S8040]]\n\ninformation into the intelligence community and can be used.\n\n  One of the key ideas behind our American government is it is not what \nwe do, it is how we do it. One of the things missing in section 1031 is \nwho is the decider. The decider in this case is the suspicion of being \npart of the al-Qaida, the Taliban, or committing that belligerent act, \nbut we have no court making the decision. As an American, you no longer \nhave a right to the civilian court system, and those rights are \ninherent to you and are your birthright as an American citizen.\n  We should make sure that what we do here and now is that we \nunderstand your rights; that as an American citizen you can only be \nincarcerated on indictment by a grand jury, which is by a preponderance \nof evidence; and then conviction is beyond the shadow of a doubt. Under \nthis language, if you are accused of being part of al-Qaida or the \nTaliban, or of committing an act, you can be held subject to only one \nhabeas review on a preponderance of evidence.\n  Most Americans think you can only be convicted of a crime in the \nUnited States beyond the shadow of a doubt by a jury of your peers. But \nif this is passed, that is no longer true. We want to make sure the \ndecider always is a civilian article III court. We are talking about a \nvery specific definition here inside the jurisdiction of the United \nStates among American citizens.\n  I agree we can kill Anwar al-Awlaki, who is making war on the United \nStates from a foreign jurisdiction. But when we are inside the United \nStates, the whole point of the U.S. military and our establishment is \nto defend our rights, and those rights cannot be taken away from us by \nany executive action. They can only be taken away from us by action of \na civilian court, by a jury of our peers and by their decision beyond a \nshadow of a doubt.\n  With that, I yield for the Senator from California, whose amendment I \nso strongly support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I want one quick moment to respond and then \nI will propound a unanimous consent request.\n  We couldn't change the Constitution here if we wanted to, and nobody \ndoes want to. And that includes the right of habeas corpus. All the \nconstitutional rights which the Senator from Illinois talked about are \nconstitutional rights. They are there. They are guaranteed. They \ncouldn't be changed by the Congress if we wanted to, and I hope nobody \nwants to change those rights.\n  But what the Senator ignores, and what has been ignored generally \nhere, is that there is another path, and the Supreme Court has approved \nthis path so that if any American citizen joins a foreign army in \nattacking us, that person may be treated as an enemy combatant. That is \nnot me speaking. That is the Supreme Court in Hamdi.\n  There is no bar to this Nation's holding one of its own citizens as \nan enemy combatant.\n  If you join an army and attack us, you can be treated as an enemy \ncombatant. The Supreme Court has said so more than once.\n  My unanimous consent request is the following: that the Senator from \nCalifornia be recognized first for whatever comments she wishes to \nmake, then the senior Senator from Illinois be recognized to speak on \nwhatever subject he wishes--on the amendment of the Senator from \nCalifornia or whatever--and then Senator Merkley's amendment be in \norder to be called up by Senator Merkley.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the distinguished manager of the bill, and I \nsay to the distinguished senior Senator from Illinois, who is here, I \nwill try to be relatively brief. But I would also say that seldom do we \nget an opportunity on the floor of the Senate to debate what is \nfundamental to this American democracy. In a sense, I am pleased this \nissue has now been aired publicly because I think we can address it \ndirectly.\n  Senator Durbin, I also want to thank your colleague, the junior \nSenator from Illinois, Senator Kirk, for his cosponsorship of this \namendment.\n  The fact of the matter is, the original draft of this defense bill \nhad this language in it:\n\n       The authority to detain a person under this section does \n     not extend to the detention of citizens or lawful resident \n     aliens of the United States on the basis of conduct taking \n     place in the United States except to the extent permitted by \n     the Constitution of the United States.\n\n  That was removed from the bill. Essentially, what we are trying to do \nis put back in that you cannot indefinitely detain a citizen--just a \ncitizen--of the United States without trial. Due process is a basic \nright of this democracy. It is given to us because we are citizens of \nthe United States. And due process requires that we not authorize \nindefinite detention of our citizens.\n  Where I profoundly disagree with the very distinguished chairman and \nranking member of the Armed Services Committee is by saying that Ex \nparte Quirin established the law for U.S. citizens in this area that \nstill holds. It does not. I went to the Hamdi opinion, and I wish to \nread some of the plurality opinion as written by Justice O'Connor. This \nfirst quote is from page 23 of her opinion.\n\n       As critical as the government's interest may be in \n     detaining those who actually pose an immediate threat to the \n     national security of the United States during ongoing \n     international conflict, history and common sense teach us \n     that an unchecked system of detention carries the potential \n     to become a means for oppression and abuse of others who do \n     not present that sort of threat.\n\n  Continuing on page 24:\n\n       We reaffirm today the fundamental nature of a citizen's \n     right to be free from involuntary confinement by his own \n     government without due process of law, and we weigh the \n     opposing governmental interests against the curtailment of \n     liberty that such confinement entails.\n\n  It then goes on, referring to the Hamdi case, on page 26:\n\n       We therefore hold that a citizen-detainee seeking to \n     challenge his classification as an enemy combatant must \n     receive notice of the factual basis for his classification, \n     and a fair opportunity to rebut the government's factual \n     assertions before a neutral decisionmaker.\n\n  Then to quote from Justice Scalia's opinion, which is important \ncommentary on the 1942 case Ex parte Quirin, he says:\n\n       The government argues that our more recent jurisprudence \n     ratifies its indefinite imprisonment of a citizen within the \n     territorial jurisdiction of Federal courts. It places primary \n     reliance on Ex parte Quirin, a World War II case upholding \n     the trial by military commission of eight German saboteurs, \n     one of whom, Hans Haupt, was a U.S. citizen.\n\n  Justice Scalia concludes:\n\n       This case was not this Court's finest hour.\n\n  Mr. President, the difference today is that we as a Congress are \nbeing asked, for the first time certainly since I have been in this \nbody--and I believe since the senior Senator from Illinois has been in \nthis body--to affirmatively authorize that an American citizen can be \npicked up and held indefinitely without being charged or tried. That is \na very big deal, because in 1971 we passed a law that said you cannot \ndo this. This was after the internment of Japanese-American citizens in \nWorld War II. It took that long, until 1971, when Richard Nixon signed \nthe Non-Detention Act, and that law has never been violated.\n  The Quirin case was not about whether a U.S. citizen captured during \nwartime could be held indefinitely, but rather whether such an \nindividual could be held in detention pending trial by military \ncommission. The recent case of an American put into military custody, \nof course, was Jose Padilla, and there was a good deal of controversy \nover the years about his case. He was ultimately transferred out of \nmilitary custody, tried and convicted in a civilian court.\n\n  What we are talking about here--and I am very pleased Senator Kirk \nand Senator Lee have joined us as cosponsors in this--is the right of \nour government, as specifically authorized in a law by Congress, to say \nthat a citizen of the United States can be arrested and essentially \nheld without trial forever.\n  The hypothetical example that has been offered by the Senator from \nArizona, the ranking member of the committee, is: Would we want someone \nwho is an American--who is planning to kill our people, bomb our \nbuildings--not to be held indefinitely under the laws of war? I believe \nit is a different situation when it comes to American citizens. What if \nit is an innocent\n\n[[Page S8041]]\n\nAmerican we are talking about? What if it is someone who was in the \nwrong place at the wrong time? The beauty of our Constitution and our \nlaw is it gives every citizen the right of review--review by a court, \nand this is what the Hamdi decision is all about. The defense bill on \nthe floor, as written, would take us a step backward. The bill, as \nwritten, would say an American citizen can be picked up, can be held \nfor the length of hostilities--is that 5 years, 10 years, 15 years, 20 \nyears, 25 years, 30 years--without a trial. I say that is wrong. I say \nthat is not the way this democracy was set up. And I also say that is \ntotally unnecessary because our federal courts work well to prosecute \nterrorists. We can go back to the Shoe Bomber, as a case in point. We \ncan go back to Abdulmutallab as a case in point. We can go back to the \nrecord of the Federal courts prosecuting over 400 terrorists since 9/\n11.\n  I want to thank Senator Durbin for his interest in this issue and his \ncosponsorship of this amendment. It is very much appreciated. I don't \nknow whether we can win this, but I think it is very important that we \ntry and I know we are getting more and more support as people learn \nmore about what this bill does. I think it is very important that we \nbuild a record in this body, because I have no doubt this is going to \nbe litigated. I hope we are successful with this amendment. I hope we \ncan protect the rights of Americans.\n  Mr. President, as we have occasion to look at people in Guantanamo, \nwe know there are people there who were in the wrong place at the wrong \ntime. If they are going to be held forever, that is a mistake, and we \ndon't want the same thing to happen to American citizens in this \ncountry.\n  This is another example of how we are over-militarizing things that \naren't broken. As I have said previously here on the floor, I don't see \na need for the military to go around arresting Americans. The national \nsecurity division of the FBI now has some 10,000 people. They have 56 \nfield local offices with special agents who are well equipped to arrest \nterrorists and also interrogate them. Certainly the Justice Department \nis equipped to prosecute terrorists in Federal criminal court. The \nconviction rate and the long sentences achieved shows their success.\n  I am hopeful we will be able to pass this amendment and change the \nbill to reflect that Americans are protected from permanent detention \nwithout trial. That is all we are trying to do.\n  I thank the Senator from Illinois, I thank the Chair, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me say at the outset what an \nextraordinary job my colleague from California has done. There was a \ntime in American history, before law schools, when people read the law \nand practiced the law. The Senator from California has not only read \nthe law, she has written many laws, and her competence in advocating \nthis important constitutional question has been proven over and over. \nSo I thank her for having the determination and courage to stand up for \nher convictions against some who would be critical of anyone who \nbroaches the subject.\n  This is a controversial subject. We are talking about the security of \nAmericans. We are talking about terrorism. We all remember a few years \nago when our lives were interrupted--a time we will never forget--when \nterrorists attacked the United States and killed 3,000 innocent \nAmerican people on 9/11. We came together in this Congress, Democrats \nand Republicans, and said we need to keep this country safe; that we \nnever want that to happen again. So we passed new laws, suggested by \nPresident George W. Bush, and enacted by Democrats and Republicans in \nCongress.\n  We created new agencies, such as the TSA security agency at airports \nand we empowered our intelligence branches--which Senator Feinstein has \na particular responsibility for as chairman of the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee--by giving them more people, more technology, and more \nauthority, and we said to them, keep us safe.\n  We said to our military: We want you to be the best in the world and \ncontinue to be, and we will provide the resources for that to happen. \nThen we turned, as Senator Feinstein has noted, to the Federal Bureau \nof Investigation and said: We are going to dramatically increase your \nnumbers and give you the technology you need to keep us safe.\n  Here we are some 10 years later, and what can we say? We can say \nthanks to the leadership of President George W. Bush and Barack Obama, \n9/11 was not repeated--and we never want it repeated.\n  We can also say, with very few exceptions, in the 10 years since 9/11 \nthat we have done all these things consistent with America's values and \nprinciples. Other countries--and we see them even today--faced with \nuncertainty and insecurity throw out all of the rules of human conduct \neven to the point of killing their own people in the streets to \nmaintain order. Thank God that never has occurred in the United States, \nand I pray it never will. Those of us who are elected to represent our \nStates in the Senate take an oath, an oath that we are going to uphold \nand defend the Constitution with its values and principles. We \nunderstand that taking that oath may mean that we are accepting due \nprocess, and due process says a fair day in court for someone accused \nof a crime. Other countries dispense with that. They don't need a \ntrial. They find someone suspected of a crime, whatever it might be, \nthat person is given summary execution, and that is the end of the \nstory. No questions asked.\n  We don't do it that way in America. We establish standards of conduct \nand justice, and particularly as it relates to the people who live in \nAmerica, our citizens and legal residents who are in the United States. \nThat is what this debate is about.\n  This is an important bill, S. 1867. It comes up every year in a \nvariety of different forms, and we are lucky to have Senator Carl Levin \nand Senator John McCain who put more hours into it than we can imagine \nto write the bill to authorize the Department of Defense to do its job. \nIt is the best military in the world, and their hard work makes certain \nthat it stays in that position.\n  But this provision they have added in this bill is a serious \nmistake--serious. It is serious enough for me to support Senator \nFeinstein in her efforts to change and remove the language. Why?\n  First, we know the law enforcement officials in the United States of \nAmerica, the Attorney General's Office, the FBI have done a good job in \nkeeping America safe. They have arrested over 300 suspected terrorists \nin the United States--over 300 of them--and they have tried them in the \ncriminal courts of America, on trial, in public, for the world to see \nthat these people will be held to the standards of trial as an American \ncitizen. Of those 300, they have successfully prosecuted over 300 \nalleged terrorists, then incarcerated them in the prisons of America, \nincluding Marion, IL, in my home State, where they are safely and \nhumanely incarcerated.\n  The message to the world is: We are going to keep America safe, but \nwe are going to do it by playing by the rules that make us America. Due \nprocess is one of those rules, and it has worked. It has worked under \ntwo administrations.\n  Now comes this bill and a suggestion that we need to change the \nrules. The suggestion is, in this measure, that we will do something \nthat has not been done in America before. Section 1031 of this bill, \nfor the first time in the history of America, will authorize the \nindefinite detention of American citizens in the United States. This is \nunprecedented. In my view, as chair of the Constitution Subcommittee of \nSenate Judiciary, it raises serious constitutional concerns.\n  Senator Levin and Senator McCain disagree. In an op-ed piece for the \nWashington Post, they recently wrote:\n\n       No provision in the legislation expands the authority under \n     which detainees can be held in military custody.\n\n  But look at the plain language of section 1031. There is no exclusion \nfor U.S. citizens. So the question is, If we believe an American \ncitizen is guilty or will be guilty of acts of terrorism, can we detain \nthem indefinitely? Can we ignore their constitutional rights and hold \nthem indefinitely, without warning them of their right to remain \nsilent, without advising them of their right to counsel, without giving \nthem the basic protections of our Constitution? I don't believe that \nshould be the standard.\n\n[[Page S8042]]\n\n  I listened to Senator McCain. He makes a pretty compelling argument: \nWait a minute. You are telling me that if you have someone in front of \nyou who you think is a terrorist who could repeat 9/11, you are going \nto read their Miranda rights to them?\n  Well, as an American citizen, yes, I would. I would say to Senator \nMcCain the same argument would apply if that person in front of me was \nnot a suspected terrorist but a suspected serial killer, a suspected \nsexual predator; we read them their Miranda rights. We believe our \nsystem of justice can work with those rights being read.\n  Do you remember the case about 2 years ago of the person who was on \nthe airplane, the Underwear Bomber, Abdulmutallab? He was coming to the \nUnited States to blow up that airplane and kill all the people onboard, \nand thank God he failed. He tried to ignite a bomb and his clothing \ncaught on fire, and the other passengers jumped on him, subdued him, \nand he was arrested. This man, not an American citizen, was taken off \nthe plane and interrogated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. \nAfter he stopped talking voluntarily, they read him his Miranda rights. \nWe all know them from the crime shows that we watch on TV: the right to \nremain silent, everything you say can be used against you, the right to \nretain counsel. He was read all those things, and he shut. But that \nwasn't the end of the story.\n  By the next day, they were back interrogating him and they had \ncontacted his parents, brought his parents to this country. He met with \nhis parents and turned and said: I will cooperate. I will tell you \neverything I know. He started talking, and he didn't stop.\n  At the end of the day, he was charged with terrible, serious crimes, \nbrought to trial in Detroit, and pled guilty under our criminal system. \nNow, he wasn't an American citizen, but even playing by the rules for \nAmerican citizens we successfully prosecuted this would-be bomber and \nterrorist.\n  What is the message behind that? The message behind that is we will \nstand by our principles and values and still keep America safe. We will \ntrust the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Justice \nto successfully prosecute suspected and alleged terrorists. We will not \nsurrender our principles even as we fight terrorism every single day.\n\n  Now, this bill changes, unfortunately, a fundamental aspect of that. \nIt says if an American citizen is detained and suspected to be involved \nin terrorism with al-Qaida or other groups, they can be held \nindefinitely without being given their constitutional rights.\n  I appreciate that Senator Levin and Senator McCain have said they are \nwilling to consider excluding U.S. persons, but section 1031 doesn't. I \nhope they do.\n  I want to address a couple statements that have been made by my \nRepublican colleagues. I like them and respect them.\n  I would say to Senator Graham, my colleague and friend from South \nCarolina, I listened to Senator Levin tell us privately and publicly \nover and over again: What we have here doesn't change the law. Then I \nlistened to your arguments on the floor saying: Well, the law needs to \nbe changed. That is why we are doing this. So I am struggling to figure \nout if Senator Levin and Senator Graham have reconciled.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. May I respond?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I want the Senator to respond, but I want to ask point \nblank, is there an exclusion currently in the law for U.S. citizens \nunder section 1031 and whether or not under 1031 American citizens can \nbe detained indefinitely?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. No. And there should not be. Could I finish my thought?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Of course.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Now, we are good friends, and we are going to stay that \nway. But you keep saying something, Senator Durbin, that is not true. \nThe law of the land is that an American citizen can be held as an enemy \ncombatant. It is the Hamdi decision, and I quote:\n\n       There is no bar to this Nation's holding one of its own \n     citizens as an enemy combatant.\n\n  Hamdi was an American citizen captured in Afghanistan fighting for \nthe Taliban. Justice O'Connor specifically recognized that Hamdi's \ndetention could last for the rest of his life because law of war \ndetention can last for the duration of the relevant conflict.\n  The Padilla case involves an American citizen captured in the United \nStates, held for 5 years as an enemy combatant, and the Fourth Circuit \nreviewed his case and said that we could hold an American citizen as an \nenemy combatant.\n  To my good friend from Illinois, throughout the history of this \ncountry American citizens in every conflict have, unfortunately, \ndecided to side with the enemy at times. In re Quirin is a 1942-1943 \ncase that involved American citizens assisting German saboteurs. They \nwere held under the law of war because the act of collaborating with \nthe enemy was considered an act of war, not a common crime.\n  So the law of the land by the courts is that an American citizen can \nbe held as an enemy combatant. That has been the law for decades.\n  What Senator Feinstein would do is change that. The Congress would be \nsaying we cannot hold an American citizen as an American combatant.\n  I do appreciate the time. Now, let me tell you why I think that is \nimportant.\n  The Senator is a very good lawyer. Under the domestic criminal law, \nwe cannot hold someone indefinitely and question them about enemy \nactivity: What do you know about the enemy? What is coming? What were \nyou doing? Where did you train? Under domestic criminal law, we can't \nquestion somebody in a way that would put them in jeopardy.\n  Under military intelligence gathering we can question an enemy \nprisoner without them having a lawyer to be able to find out how to \ndefend America. If we can't hold this person as an enemy combatant, the \nonly way we can hold them is under domestic criminal law. When the \ninterview starts and the guy says: I want my lawyer; I don't want to \ntalk to you anymore--under the criminal justice model there is a very \nlimited time we can hold them or question them without reading them \ntheir rights or giving them a lawyer.\n  Under intelligence gathering our Department of Defense, the FBI, and \nthe CIA can tell the individual: You are not entitled to a lawyer. You \nhave to sit here and talk with us because we want to know what you know \nabout present, past, and future attacks.\n  If we can't hold an American citizen who has decided to collaborate \nwith al-Qaida as an enemy combatant, we lose that ability to gather \nintelligence. That is the change that Senator Feinstein is proposing; \nthat the law be changed by the Congress to say enemy combatant status \ncan never be applied to an American citizen if they collaborate with \nal-Qaida. That would be a huge loss of intelligence gathering, it would \nbe a substantial change in the law, and it would be the first time any \nCongress has ever suggested that an American citizen can collaborate \nwith the enemy and not be considered a threat to the United States from \nthe military point of view. I don't want to go down that road because I \nthink that is a very bad choice in the times in which we live.\n  So to my good friend, the law is clear we can hold an American \ncitizen as an enemy combatant. The Congress is contemplating changing \nthat, and I think it would be a very bad decision in the times in which \nwe live to deny our ability to hold an American citizen and question \nthem about what they know and why they decided to join al-Qaida.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask for the regular order. What is the \nregular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois has the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Simply stated, if a person decides to collaborate with \nal-Qaida in a very limited way, can we hold them? They have to be a \nmember of al-Qaida or affiliated with it or be involved in a hostile \nact. But if they do those things, historically, American citizens who \nchose to side with the Nazis--in this case, al-Qaida--have been viewed \nby the rest of us not as a common criminal but as a military threat.\n  Now is not the time to change that. We need that ability to question \nthat person: Why did you join al-Qaida? Where did you train? What do \nyou know about what is coming next? And the only way we can get that \ninformation is to hold them as an enemy combatant and take all the time \nwe need to protect this Nation and interrogate.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to reclaim the floor.\n\n[[Page S8043]]\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes, sir. I appreciate the exchange.\n  Mr. DURBIN. And would the Senator end that with a question mark?\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. And, was I right?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank my colleague from South Carolina.\n  What the Senator concluded with, though, I think is critical to this \nconversation. He said the only way to get to the bottom of whether \nthere is an al-Qaida connection that could threaten the United States \nis military detention. Well, the Abdulmutallab case argues just the \nopposite. It was the Federal Bureau of Investigation that he sat before \nand told all of the information that the Senator has just discussed.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. May I respond and say the Senator is right.\n  I am an all-of-the-above guy. I believe that military and civilian \ncourts should be used.\n  When an American citizen is involved, does the Senator agree with me \nthat military commissions are off the table?\n  Mr. DURBIN. So the Senator is arguing that every President should \nhave all the options, criminal courts as well as military commissions \nand tribunals?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Absolutely.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Well, what is the difference, then, with what the Senator \nis standing for and what is the current situation? From my point of \nview, our Presidents--President Bush and President Obama--since 9/11, \nhave used both, with more success on the criminal courts side--\ndramatically more success on the criminal courts side.\n  The obvious question that Senator Feinstein poses is, if the system \nisn't broken, if the system is keeping us safe, if we have successfully \nprosecuted over 300 alleged terrorists in our criminal courts and 6 in \nmilitary commissions, why do we want to change it?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Here is the point I am trying to make.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Retaining the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you. And this is a very good exchange.\n  My view is that when we capture somebody at home and the belief is \nthat they are now part of al-Qaida, that if we want to read them their \nMiranda rights and put them in Federal court, we have the ability to do \nthat. This legislation doesn't prevent that from happening.\n  Does it, I ask Senator Levin?\n  Mr. LEVIN. It does not.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. But what Senator Feinstein is proposing is that no longer \ndo we have the option of holding the American citizen as an enemy \ncombatant to gather intelligence, and we don't have the ability to hold \nthem for a period of time to interrogate them under the law of war.\n  What I would suggest to the Senator is that the information we \nreceive from Guantanamo Bay detainees has been invaluable to this \nNation's defense. To those who believe it was because of waterboarding, \nI couldn't disagree more. The chief reason we have been able to gather \ngood intelligence at Guantanamo Bay is because of time.\n  The detainee is being humanely treated, but there is no requirement \nunder military law to let the enemy prisoner go at a certain period of \ntime.\n  If you take away the ability to hold an American citizen who has \nassociated himself with al-Qaida to be held as an enemy combatant, you \ncan no longer use the technique of interrogating him over time to find \nout what he knows about the enemy.\n  You are worried about prosecuting them. I am worried about finding \nout what they know about future attacks. They are not consistent. You \ncan prosecute somebody. That is part of the law. What the Senator is \ntaking away from us is the ability to gather intelligence. Our criminal \njustice system is not set up to gather intelligence.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I want to reclaim the floor. I know Senator McCain is \nanxious for me to conclude and there is something he is anxious to do \nquickly, but I will try to do this in appropriate time for the gravity \nof the issue before us.\n  But to suggest the only way we can get information about a terrorist \nattack on the United States by al-Qaida and other sources is to turn to \nthe military commissions and tribunals and not use the FBI and not use \nthe Department of Justice defies logic and experience. Abdulmutallab, \nthe Underwear Bomber, a member of al-Qaida, failed in his attempt to \nbring down that plane, interrogated successfully by the FBI, basically \ntold them everything he knew over a period of time. It worked. To argue \nthat you cannot do this defies the experience with Abdulmutallab.\n  I want to say a word about the Hamdi case. I listened as Senator \nFeinstein read the Supreme Court decision. I do not think the Supreme \nCourt decision stands for what was said by the Senator from South \nCarolina. I think what he said was inaccurate. I do not believe Justice \nO'Connor went to the extent of saying you can hold an American citizen \nindefinitely.\n  Let me also say when it comes to the Hamdi case, Hamdi was captured \nin Afghanistan. He was captured on the battlefield in Afghanistan, not \nthe United States. And Justice O'Connor, in that opinion, was very \ncareful to say the Hamdi decision was limited to ``individuals who \nfought against the United States in Afghanistan as part of the \nTaliban.'' She was not talking about American citizens and their \nrights. She was talking about this specific situation.\n  Now let's go to the case of Jose Padilla. Jose Padilla, some will \nargue, is a precedent for the indefinite detention of American \ncitizens. But look at what happened in the case of Padilla, a U.S. \ncitizen placed in military custody in the United States. The Fourth \nCircuit Court of Appeals, one of the most conservative courts in our \nNation, upheld Padilla's military detention.\n  Then, before the Supreme Court had the chance to review the Fourth \nCircuit's decision, the Bush administration transferred Padilla out of \nmilitary custody and prosecuted him in an article III criminal court.\n  I do not think that Hamdi or Padilla makes the case that has been \nmade on this floor.\n  I want to say I think Senator Feinstein is proper in raising this \namendment. I think the fact is that Hamdi is a U.S. citizen, but it \ndoes not stand for the indefinite detention of U.S. citizens as this \nnew law would allow.\n  It troubles me that as good, as professional, as careful as our \ngovernment has been to keep America safe, we now have in a Defense \nauthorization bill an attempt to change some of the most fundamental, \nconstitutional principles in America. This bill went through a great \ncommittee, our Armed Services Committee, but not through the Judiciary \nCommittee which has specific subject matter jurisdiction over our \nConstitution. It did not go through the Intelligence Committee. And for \nthe record, the provisions in this bill--which some have said are not \nthat significant, that much of a change--are opposed by this \nadministration, opposed by the Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta, who \nreceived a 100-to-nothing vote of confidence from the U.S. Senate when \nhe was appointed, opposed by our Director of National Intelligence, who \nsays these provisions will not make America safer but make it more \ndifficult to protect America, and opposed by the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation.\n  I entered a letter from Director Muller in the Record yesterday, as \nwell as the Department of Justice.\n  You have to ask yourself, if all of these agencies of government, \nwhich work day in, day out, 24-7 to keep us safe, tell us not to pass \nthese provisions because it does not make America safer, it jeopardizes \nour security, why are we doing it?\n  Senator Feinstein has the right approach: Let us try to preserve some \nof the basic constitutional values here. I think we can. I hope my \ncolleagues will take care before they vote against Feinstein. Despite \nthe respect, which I share, that they have for our Armed Services \nCommittee and its leadership--this is a matter of constitutional \nimportance and gravity. It is important for us to take care and not to \nchange our basic values in the course of debating a Defense \nauthorization bill. Let's keep America safe but let's also respect the \nbasic principle that American citizens are entitled to constitutional \nrights. The indefinite detention of an American citizen accused--not \nconvicted, accused of terrorist activity--the indefinite detention runs \ncounter to the basic principles of the Constitution we have sworn to \nuphold.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Michigan.\n\n[[Page S8044]]\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if the Senator will yield for a question. Would \nthe Senator agree that the majority opinion in Hamdi said the \nfollowing:\n\n       There is no bar to this Nation's holding one of its own \n     citizens as an enemy combatant.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would respond by saying Justice O'Connor in that \ndecision said:\n\n       [A]s critical as the Government's interest may be in \n     detaining those who actually pose an immediate threat to the \n     national security of the United States during ongoing \n     international conflict, history and common sense teach us \n     that an unchecked system of detention carries the potential \n     to become a means for oppression and abuse of others who do \n     not present that sort of threat. . . .\n       We therefore hold that a citizen-detainee, seeking to \n     challenge his classification as enemy combatant, must receive \n     notification of the factual basis for his classification, and \n     a fair opportunity to rebut the Government's factual \n     assertions before a neutral decisionmaker.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Would the Senator agree that specifically referred to \nthere is that a citizen being held as an enemy combatant is--excuse me. \nWould the Senator agree that what he read refers to the exact statement \nof the Justice that a citizen who is held as an enemy combatant is \nentitled to certain rights? Would the Senator agree that that, by its \nown terms, says that a citizen can be held as an enemy combatant?\n  Mr. DURBIN. In the particular case of Hamdi, captured in Afghanistan \nas part of the Taliban.\n  Mr. LEVIN. She did not say that. She said ``a citizen.'' I know what \nthe facts of the case are. She did not limit it to the facts of the \ncase.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am sorry but she did. The quote:\n\n       . . . individuals who fought against the United States in \n     Afghanistan as part of the Taliban.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. She did not limit it to that. She described the facts of \nthat case.\n  Mr. DURBIN. She limits it to that case. If I could make one response \nand then I will give the floor to the Senator. This is clearly an \nimportant constitutional question and one where there is real \ndisagreement among the Members on the floor. I think it is one that \nfrankly we should not be taking up in a Defense authorization bill but \nought to be considered in a much broader context because it engages us \nat many levels in terms of constitutional protections.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I agree with the Senator that Justice O'Connor said what \nthe Senator said she said. Would the Senator agree with me that Justice \nO'Connor said:\n\n       There is no bar to this Nation's holding one of its own \n     citizens as an enemy combatant.\n\n  Would the Senator agree that she said that?\n  Mr. DURBIN. As it related to Hamdi captured in Afghanistan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Would the Senator agree she said that, however?\n  Mr. DURBIN. As it related to Hamdi, of course.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am giving the Senator an exact quote. I know the facts \nof the case.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I can read the whole paragraph rather than the sentence.\n  Mr. LEVIN. You already have. Given the facts of the case. I \nunderstand the facts of the case, that it was somebody captured in \nAfghanistan. My question is, of the Senator: Would he agree that \nJustice O'Connor said--she is talking about this case, of course----\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. ``There is no bar to this Nation holding one of its own \ncitizens''?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Captured on the field of battle in Afghanistan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Would the Senator agree that the Justice said the \nfollowing, that a citizen, no less than an alien, can be ``part of or \nsupporting forces hostile to the United States or coalition partners'' \nand ``engaged in an armed conflict against the United States,'' and \nwould pose the same threat of returning to the front during the ongoing \nconflict? Would the Senator agree that she said that?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Of course.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Would the Senator agree that she quoted from the Quirin \ncase, in which an American citizen was captured on Long Island?\n  Mr. DURBIN. She did make reference to the Quirin case.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Did she cite that with approval?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would say there was some reservation in citing it. I \nsay to the Senator, our difficulty and disagreement is the fact we are \ndealing with a specific individual captured on the field of battle in \nAfghanistan with the Taliban.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I understand.\n  Mr. DURBIN. We are not talking about American citizens being arrested \nand detained within the United States and being held indefinitely \nwithout constitutional rights.\n  Mr. LEVIN. My question, though--my question is: Did Justice O'Connor \nsay that, in Quirin, that one of the detainees alleged that he was a \nnaturalized United States citizen, we held that--these are her exact \nwords:\n\n       Citizens who associate themselves with the military arm of \n     the enemy government, and with its aid, guidance and \n     direction enter this country bent on hostile acts, are enemy \n     belligerents within the meaning of . . . the law of war.\n\n  Did she say that?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I can tell the Senator there were references in there to \nthe case, but the Supreme Court has never ruled on the specific matter \nof law which the Senator continues to read. Until it rules, we will \nmake the decision in this Department of Defense authorization bill, and \nit is not an affirmation of current law because there has been no \nruling.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Isn't it true that Justice O'Connor was specifically \nreferring to a case of a person who was captured on Long Island? Last I \nchecked, Long Island was part--albeit sometimes regrettably--part of \nthe United States of America.\n  Mr. LEVIN. She is quoting with approval from the Quirin case in which \none of the detainees was----\n  Mr. McCAIN. Captured in the United States of America.\n  Those are the facts of the case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I am afraid we have to move to the \namendment of Senator Merkley, who has been very patient.\n  Mr. LEVIN. According to a unanimous consent agreement which was \nentered into----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I understand Senator Merkley was going to be recognized \nnext to offer his amendment. That was according to the unanimous \nconsent agreement. I understand the Senator from New Hampshire, I don't \nknow for how long, needed to make a unanimous consent request. Am I \ncorrect? No? I am incorrect.\n  According to the existing unanimous consent agreement, which was \nentered into----\n  Mr. McCAIN. Can I ask the indulgence----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I ask the indulgence of my friend from Oregon, that \nthe Senator from South Carolina be allowed 2 minutes, and the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire be allowed 5 minutes? Would that be all right with \nthe Senator from Oregon?\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank him for his courtesy too. I say to the Senator \nfrom Illinois, this is an important debate and discussion. I appreciate \nhis presentation. I think a lot of people are getting a lot of good \ninformation, on what is a very complex and very central issue. I thank \nthe Senator from Illinois.\n  I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Please understand what you are about to do if you pass \nthe Feinstein amendment. You will be saying as a Congress, for the \nfirst time in American history, an American citizen who allies himself \nwith an enemy force can no longer be held as an enemy combatant. The In \nRe Quirin decision was about American citizens aiding Nazi saboteurs, \nand the Supreme Court held then that they could be held as enemy \ncombatants. So as much respect as I have for Senator Durbin, it has \nbeen the law of the United States for decades that an American citizen \non our soil who collaborates with the enemy has committed an act of war \nand will be held under the law of war,\n\n[[Page S8045]]\n\nnot domestic criminal law. That is the law back then. That is the law \nnow.\n  Hamdi said that an American citizen--a noncitizen has a habeas right \nunder law of war detention because this is a war without end. The \nholding of that case was not that you cannot hold an American citizen, \nit is that you have a habeas right to go to a Federal judge and the \nFederal judge will determine whether the military has made a proper \ncase. It has nothing to do with an enemy combatant being held as an \nAmerican citizen. What this amendment would do is it would bar the \nUnited States in the future from holding an American citizen who \ndecides to associate with al-Qaida.\n  In World War II it was perfectly proper to hold an American citizen \nas an enemy combatant who helped the Nazis. But we believe, somehow, in \n2011, that is no longer fair. That would be wrong. My God, what are we \ndoing in 2011? Do you not think al-Qaida is trying to recruit people \nhere at home? Is the homeland the battlefield? You better believe it is \nthe battlefield.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 more \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. That is the point. Why would you say that if you are in \nAfghanistan, we can blow you up, put you in jail forever, but if you \nmake it here, all of a sudden we cannot even talk to you about being \npart of al-Qaida. What a perverse outcome, to say if you make it to \nAmerica, you are home free; you cannot be interrogated by our military \nor our CIA; you get a lawyer. And that is the end of the discussion. \nThat is what you would be doing. That is crazy. No Congress has ever \ndecided to do that in other wars. If we do that here, we are changing \nthe law in a way that makes us less safe. That is not going to be on my \nresume.\n  It is not unfair to make an American citizen account for the fact \nthat they decided to help al-Qaida to kill us all and hold them as long \nas it takes to find intelligence about what may be coming next. And \nwhen they say ``I want my lawyer,'' you tell them ``Shut up. You don't \nget a lawyer.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. ``You are an enemy combatant, and we are going to talk to \nyou about why you joined al-Qaida.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Madam President, I also rise in opposition to the \namendment offered by Senator Feinstein, and I certainly appreciate the \ncomments of my colleague from South Carolina. It would lead to an \nabsurd result that if we were in a situation where an American citizen \nbecame a member of al-Qaida and from within our country attacked \nAmericans and we could not gather the maximum amount of information \nfrom them to make sure we could prevent future attacks against our \ncountry--that is what is at issue here.\n  I would like to point out a couple of issues that have not been \naddressed with respect to Senator Feinstein's amendment.\n  If you look at the language of that amendment, she says that the \nauthority described in this section for the Armed Forces of the United \nStates to detain a person does not include the authority to detain a \ncitizen of the United States without trial until the end of \nhostilities. I think this provision is going to create some real \nproblems for the executive branch. If I were they, I would be in here \nraising these issues because it does not distinguish--the language--\nbetween an American citizen who is captured overseas versus an American \ncitizen captured in the United States of America.\n  Let's use the example of Anwar al-Awlaki. Mr. al-Awlaki, a member of \nal-Qaida, was actually killed by us overseas. So it would lead to the \nabsurd result that we could not detain him to gather intelligence, but \nwe believe that we are authorized--by the way, I agreed with the \nadministration taking that step to take out Mr. al-Awlaki, who was a \ngreat danger to our country overseas. So the language as written would \nlead to that absurd result that would tie the administration's hands, \nthat they can actually kill these individuals, but they can't detain \nthem under military custody and interrogate them to make sure we can \nfind out what they do know and what other attacks are being planned \nagainst the United States of America.\n  Also with respect to the language in this amendment, the language \nitself is a defense lawyer's dream. You can't hold a U.S. citizen until \nthe end of hostilities. Well, how long can you hold them? I mean, it is \nnot clear. There is no language in that. This is going to be litigated \nto heaven, and this is an area where our intelligence professionals \nneed clarity. This is going to create more issues for the executive \nbranch in an area that needs clarity and where there needs to be some \nidentified rules and they have to be focused on gathering intelligence \nto protect Americans.\n  Senator Durbin has cited the Abdulmutallab case on numerous occasions \nas a way--as a great case as an example of how we can gather \nintelligence from enemy combatants to protect America. Let's review the \nfacts of that case again. Fifty minutes into the interrogation, he was \ntold: You have the right to remain silent. He exercised that right \nbecause he was given Miranda warnings, and it was only 5 weeks later \nthat we were actually able to get through the Miranda warnings after we \nwent to his parents. Is that the type of system we want? What happened \nin that 5 weeks? What did we lose in terms of information that could \nhave protected America?\n  If we can't hold an American citizen who has chosen to be a member of \nal-Qaida and has participated in a belligerent act against our country \nto ask them what other attacks they are planning and whom they are \nworking with, how are we going to get information to make sure that--\nGod forbid--we can prevent another 9/11 on our soil, because that is \nwhy they want to come to the United States of America. Also, how do we \ndeal with this issue of homegrown radicals?\n  Unfortunately, this amendment, in my view, is going to be a situation \nwhere we are opening the welcome mat. If you get to America and you can \nrecruit one of our citizens to be a member of al-Qaida, then you don't \nhave to worry about them being held in military custody. You don't have \nto worry about us using our maximum tools to gather intelligence to \nprotect Americans.\n  I think this amendment is very misguided. I again would point out \nthat the administration should be concerned about the language in this \namendment. It does not distinguish between an American citizen who is \ncaptured on our soil who is trying to attack us and one overseas. But \neither way, if an American citizen has joined al-Qaida and is trying to \nkill us from within our own country, they have become part of our enemy \nand are at war with us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the Feinstein amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I believe it is now in order for Senator Merkley to offer \namendment No. 1257, as amended, with the amendment at the desk. The \namendment at the desk has four words added to the printed amendment, \nand those words are ``NATO and coalition allies''; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1257, as Modified\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 1257, as \nmodified, under the unanimous consent agreement and rise to speak to \nit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the amendment No. \n1257, as modified, is now the pending question.\n  The amendment (No. 1257) as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 484, strike line 22 through 24 and insert the \n     following:\n       (c) Transition Plan.--The President shall devise a plan \n     based on inputs from military commanders, NATO and Coalition \n     allies, the diplomatic missions in the region, and \n     appropriate members of the Cabinet, along with the \n     consultation of Congress, for expediting the drawdown of \n     United States combat troops in Afghanistan and accelerating\n\n[[Page S8046]]\n\n     the transfer of security authority to Afghan authorities.\n       (d) Submittal to Congress.--The President shall include the \n     most current set of benchmarks established pursuant to \n     subsection (b) and the plan pursuant to subsection (c) with \n     each report on progress.\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, this amendment requires the President \nof the United States to develop a plan to expedite the reduction of \nU.S. combat troops in Afghanistan and to accelerate the transfer of \nresponsibility for military and security operations to the Government \nof Afghanistan. Before I speak to some of the details, I want to thank \nthe original cosponsors who have worked hard on this amendment: Senator \nMike Lee, Senator Tom Udall of New Mexico, Senator Rand Paul, and \nSenator Sherrod Brown.\n  The United States went to Afghanistan with two main goals that were \nlaid out by President Bush: to destroy al-Qaida training camps and to \nhunt down those responsible for 9/11. Our very capable American troops \nand their NATO partners have aggressively pursued these objectives. \nThere are very few al-Qaida operating in Afghanistan. Secretary of \nDefense Leon Panetta said in June 2010 that there were at most only 50 \nto 100 al-Qaida members in Afghanistan. Afghanistan is no longer and \nhas not been for some time a central arena for al-Qaida activity.\n  American forces have also effectively pursued the second objective, \nwhich is capturing or killing those who attacked America on 9/11. In \nrecent years, America has captured or killed two dozen high-level al-\nQaida operatives, including Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the alleged \noperational mastermind of the September 11 attacks, who was captured in \na raid on a house in the Pakistani garrison city of Rawalpindi near the \ncapital, Islamabad; Ramzi bin al-Shibh, described as a key facilitator \nof the September 11 attacks; Sheikh Sa'id Masri, an Egyptian believed \nto have acted as the operational leader of al-Qaida, who was killed in \na U.S. drone strike. Most importantly, our exceptional intelligence \nteams and armed services have tracked down and killed Osama bin Laden, \nthe founder and head of al-Qaida.\n  Citizens may fairly ask--and they do ask--given that we have \nsuccessfully pursued our original two missions, isn't it time to bring \nour sons and daughters home? Our citizens remind us that the United \nStates has been at war in Afghanistan for over 10 years, the longest \nwar in American history. Our citizens recognize that the war in \nAfghanistan has come at a terrible price. More than 1,200 Americans \nhave died from snipers, from improvised explosive devices, and other \ndeadly weapons of war. More than 6,700 Americans have been wounded by \nthose same weapons. Thousands of our soldiers have suffered from--and \nwill suffer for years, decades to come--traumatic brain injuries and \npost-traumatic stress disorder. Our soldiers have paid a huge price. \nTheir families have paid a huge price.\n  In addition, the war in Afghanistan has consumed and is consuming an \nenormous share of our national resources. According to the \nCongressional Research Service, by the end of this year--just over a \nmonth from now--we will have spent the better part of $\\1/2\\ trillion \nor approximately $444 billion. In 2011 alone, we will spend about $120 \nbillion.\n  So what is the answer to our citizens who ask, given our success in \ndestroying al-Qaida training camps and given our success in pursuing \nthose responsible for 9/11, why we haven't brought our troops and our \ntax dollars home. The official answer is that America has expanded its \nmission in Afghanistan from the narrow two original objectives of \ndestroying al-Qaida and hunting down those responsible for 9/11 to the \nbroad mission of nation building.\n  Destroying al-Qaida--our original mission--and building a modern \nnation state where one has never existed are two entirely different \nthings. The expanded mission of nation building in Afghanistan goes way \nbeyond those original two military objectives. This expanded nation-\nbuilding mission involves creating a strong central government. It \ninvolves creating an election process for a functioning democracy. It \ninvolves building infrastructure--roads and bridges and schools. It \ninvolves a major mission to create a sizable national police force and \na sizable and effective national army.\n  We have spent a lot on this mission, but the success is limited. Over \n10 years, as I mentioned, we have spent $444 billion. Now, that is in a \nnation that had a prewar gross domestic product, or economy, of about \n$10 billion a year. So we have spent an amount equal to 44 times the \neconomy of Afghanistan. One would think the result is we would have \nrebuilt the infrastructure of Afghanistan 10 times over or 20 times \nover. But the reality is there is very little to show for this nation-\nbuilding mission. Why is that the case? Most simply, this nation-\nbuilding mission is systematically stymied by multiple forces. One is \nhigh illiteracy.\n\n  On my recent trip to Afghanistan, I was told that among those \nrecruited for the national police, the literacy rate at a first grade \nlevel is only about 16 percent--first grade level, 16 percent. The goal \nis to be able to raise that literacy rate so that soldiers can read the \nserial numbers on their rifles. That is a very different world from the \nworld we live in.\n  The second huge factor is vast corruption. Just after my first trip \nto Afghanistan, the newspapers were full of stories about the family \nmembers and the associates of the President of Afghanistan building \nmassive mansions in Dubai. Well, sending our money to Afghanistan so \nthe elite can send it to Dubai to build mansions does not serve our \nnational security.\n  The efforts in nation building are stymied by deeply felt, ancient \ntribal and ethnic divisions. Moreover, there is a strong national \naversion to the very mission of building a strong central government. I \nhad an interesting experience where I met with six Pashtun tribal \nleaders in Kabul, the capital. They came in to share their stories and \neach one of them said that some form of the government you are trying \nto build is an affliction to our people. Please do not build a stronger \ngovernment that exploits and afflicts our people. I said to them, help \nme understand this, because building a government means a force that \ncan help with education, that can help with health care, that can help \nbuild transportation infrastructure, that can help provide security for \nbusinesses to prosper. They spoke to me and said--one of them summed it \nup and said, Senator, you don't understand. All of the government \npositions here are sold. The people who buy them do not buy them to \nserve our people. They buy them to exploit our people. And when you \nbuild a strong central government, which we oppose, the exploitation \nincreases.\n  So this nation-building mission is systematically stymied by high \nilliteracy, vast corruption, extensive and deep tribal and ethnic \ndivisions, and a historic national aversion to a strong central \ngovernment.\n  We have been in Afghanistan for more than 10 years. It is time to \nchange course. Our President recognizes this. He has worked out an \nagreement with the NATO partners to remove the remaining combat troops \nby the end of 2014. That is just over 3 years from now. But what \nhappens during this next 3 years? This amendment says: Mr. President, \nduring these next 3 years, seize the opportunity to diminish the combat \nrole of American soldiers and increase the responsibility placed with \nthe Afghanistan Government and the Afghanistan forces. Seize that \nopportunity.\n  I say to my colleagues today, this is incredibly important for our \nsuccess in transferring responsibility. If we do not provide the \nopportunity and the necessity for the Afghanistan institutions to take \nresponsibility for their own security, they will not be prepared to \nexercise that responsibility down the road.\n  The United States is facing a global terrorist threat. We will be \nwell served by using U.S. troops and resources in a counterterrorism \nstrategy against terrorist forces wherever in the world they may locate \nand train. That strategy was highlighted by the pursuit of Osama bin \nLaden in Pakistan or more recently our successful pursuit of Anwar \nAwlaki in Yemen. Our intelligence and our military, the best in the \nworld, have proven without a doubt that they excel at this strategy. \nThus, it makes sense to expedite the reduction of U.S. combat troops in \nAfghanistan and accelerate the responsibility for military and security \noperations to the Government of Afghanistan. That is what this \namendment does.\n  The amendment specifically requires the President to prepare a plan \nfor the\n\n[[Page S8047]]\n\nexpedited reduction of troops and accelerate transfer responsibility \nbased on inputs from military commanders, from NATO and coalition \nallies, from diplomatic missions in the region, from appropriate \nmembers of the Cabinet, and from consultation with Congress. What this \namendment does not do is it does not limit our ability to identify an \nattack by al-Qaida or terrorist forces wherever they may be in the \nworld. It does not limit our ability to destroy al-Qaida or associated \nterrorist training camps wherever they may be, wherever they are in the \nworld. It does not restrict funding for supplies and equipment needed \nby our troops deployed in the field.\n  If our national security is well served by taking the fight to al-\nQaida wherever they are, if our nation-building strategy in Afghanistan \nis confounded by illiteracy and corruption and cultural opposition and \ntribal and ethnic conflicts, if our national resources are needed in \nthat global antiterrorism strategy and are needed as well for nation \nbuilding here at home, if our men and women have suffered enough on \nAfghan soil, then we should encourage our President to seize every \nopportunity over these next 3 years to reduce our forces in Afghanistan \nand to transfer security responsibilities to the Afghan Government.\n  That is what this amendment does, and I encourage every colleague to \nsupport it.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor and note the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I oppose this amendment for one simple \nreason. It requires the President to submit a plan to Congress for an \naccelerated drawdown from Afghanistan--an accelerated withdrawal; not \njust the withdrawal that is already planned, not the withdrawal that \nhas already been accelerated on several occasions, but a new \naccelerated drawdown.\n  The President is supposed to submit a plan to Congress for an \naccelerated drawdown from Afghanistan. Does that mean the Congress of \nthe United States could see a plan for an accelerated withdrawal from \nAfghanistan? Is it required that it be implemented by Congress or is it \na nice informational, notional kind of thing: Here is a plan. Hey, \nlet's get together. I have a plan. And the President's drawdown plan, \nour senior military commanders have stated, is already--already--more \naccelerated than they are comfortable with.\n  First of all, I don't get the point of the Senator's amendment, which \nis to submit a plan. It doesn't require that the plan be acted on, just \na plan. I can submit a plan for him if it is plans he is interested in. \nBut the fact is we are accelerating our withdrawal from Afghanistan at \ngreat risk, as our military commanders have testified--much greater \nrisk. So I guess another accelerated plan would obviously have the \nresult of even greater risk to the men and women in the military.\n\n  I understand the opposition of the Senator from Oregon to the war. \nThat is fine. I respect that. But an amendment that a plan is to be \nsubmitted without any requirement that it be implemented--a plan which \nwould already accelerate more what has already been accelerated--I \nguess is some kind of statement.\n  The plan as required by this amendment would be based on inputs from \nour military commanders. I can tell the Senator from Oregon what our \nmilitary commanders in Afghanistan have said in testimony before the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, which is that more acceleration would \nmean greater risk. The acceleration that is already taking place means \ngreater risk. But the Senator from Oregon wants a more accelerated \nplan, I guess.\n  Then-chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, ADM Mike Mullen, \ntestified before the House Armed Services Committee on June 23--this is \nthe Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff--that the President's \ndrawdown plan would be--that is the present plan, not an accelerated \nplan such as the amendment proposes--``more aggressive and incur more \nrisks than I was originally prepared to accept.''\n  I wonder if the Senator from Oregon heard that. The present plan is \n``more aggressive and would incur more risks'' than the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff would have been prepared to accept. So with this \namendment, we accelerate even more.\n  On the same day, in testimony before the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence, GEN David Petraeus stated that no military commander \nrecommended what the President ultimately decided. That is the present \nplan.\n  Their concerns were well grounded. Our commanders had wanted to keep \nthe remaining surge forces in Afghanistan until the conclusion of next \nyear's fighting season, which roughly occurs with the onset of the \ncolder months. That was their recommendation to the President. So now \nthe President shall devise a plan based on inputs from military \ncommanders. I can tell the Senator from Oregon what the input from the \nmilitary commanders is. It is the same input he got with the first \naccelerated withdrawal. All we have to do is pick up the phone and ask \nthem. We don't have to have an amendment. That was their recommendation \nto the President. However, the President chose to disregard that advice \nand announce that all U.S. forces would be withdrawn from Afghanistan \nby the end of next summer. That guarantees that just as the fighting \nseason next year is at its peak, U.S. surge forces will be leaving \nAfghanistan. In my view, that is a huge and unnecessary risk to our \nmission. But the decision has been made. I think there will be great \nlong-term consequences to it.\n  A story was related to me recently by a former member of the previous \nadministration, high ranking, in a meeting with one of the highest \nranking members of the Government of Pakistan. He said to this high-\nranking government official: What do you think the chances for peace \nwith the Taliban are? That individual laughed and said, Why should they \nmake peace? You are leaving.\n  Those are fundamental facts. The primary reason for maintaining all \nof our surge forces in Afghanistan through next year's fighting season \nis because of another time the President chose to disregard the advice \nof his military commanders. It is well known that our military leaders \nhad wanted a surge to be 40,000 U.S. troops, but the President only \ngave them 33,000. So rather than being able to prioritize the south and \neast of Afghanistan at the same time, as they had planned, our \ncommanders had to focus first in the south, which they did last year \nand this year, and then concentrate on eastern Afghanistan next year, \nall because they didn't have enough troops.\n  That is not my opinion; that is the sworn testimony of military \nleaders before the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n  The President's decision made the war longer and now our commanders \nwill not have the forces they said they wanted and needed to finish the \njob in eastern Afghanistan.\n  Before we mandate a plan to further accelerate the drawdown of U.S. \nforces from Afghanistan, I suggest we review the facts and consider the \npotential consequences of the overly accelerated drawdown we already \nhave.\n  Before we base such a plan on the views of our military commanders, I \ncertainly recommend that my colleagues travel to Afghanistan and speak \nwith those commanders who can explain far better than I can why further \naccelerating our drawdown is reckless and wrong.\n  So I do not get the amendment. I do not understand why the title of \nit is ``To require a plan for the expedited transition of \nresponsibility for military and security operations in Afghanistan to \nthe Government of Afghanistan.''\n  As I said, in case the Senator from Oregon missed it, we have already \naccelerated, and in the view of our military commanders, unanimously, \nit is a far greater risk.\n  It says:\n\n       The President shall devise a plan based on inputs from \n     military commanders, NATO and Coalition allies, the \n     diplomatic missions in the region, and appropriate members of \n     the Cabinet, along with the consultation of Congress, for \n     expediting the drawdown of United States combat troops in \n     Afghanistan and accelerating the transfer of security \n     authority. . . .\n\n\n[[Page S8048]]\n\n\n  Apparently, the Senator from Oregon is not satisfied with the \nPresident's already accelerated plan for withdrawal from Afghanistan \nbeginning in the fall of--well, it has already begun--but the serious \nwithdrawal in the fall, September 2012.\n  I can assure--I can assure--the Senator from Oregon that if our \nwithdrawal, which I greatly fear now, will have long-term consequences, \na further accelerated withdrawal will absolutely guarantee that \nAfghanistan becomes a cockpit--a cockpit--of competing interests from \nIran, from India, from Pakistan, and from other countries in the \nregion. I think the people of Afghanistan deserve better.\n  So I will, obviously, oppose this amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the current \namendment be set aside so I might speak briefly regarding amendment No. \n1126.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I wonder \nif the Senator would just seek the right to--the Senator has a right to \nspeak on another amendment without setting aside this amendment. So I \nask that the Senator not set aside the pending amendment but just \nsimply speak on whatever amendment he wishes to speak.\n  Mr. LEE. Wonderful. The second request is withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1126\n\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, I rise today to speak in support of \namendment No. 1126 to the current pending legislation. The purpose of \nthis amendment is to make clear that the United States shall not detain \nfor an indefinite period U.S. citizens in military custody.\n  I understand this has been the subject of a lot of debate. I also \nunderstand this would be a break not only with the current pending \nlegislation but also with current practice, based on Supreme Court \nprecedent and lower court precedent that some have interpreted to deem \nthis a constitutionally permissible practice.\n  It has often been suggested by several of my colleagues that it is \nthe province of the Supreme Court to interpret the Constitution, and \nthat statement is absolutely correct as far as it goes. But it is not \nthe beginning of the analysis and the end of the analysis.\n  We, as Senators, independently have an obligation, consistent with \nand required by our oath to the Constitution--which I took just a few \nmonths ago just a few feet from where I stand now--to uphold the \nConstitution of the United States. That means doing more than simply \nthe full extent of whatever the courts will tolerate.\n  In this instance, what we are talking about is the right of the U.S. \nmilitary to detain indefinitely, without trial, a U.S. citizen, simply \non the basis that person has been deemed an enemy combatant.\n  Now, there is a real slippery slope problem here, and it is the very \nkind of slippery slope problem for which we have protections such as \nthe fifth amendment and the sixth amendment. You see, under the fifth \namendment, a person cannot be held for an infamous crime unless they \nhave been subjected to a process whereby a grand jury indictment has \nbeen issued. A person cannot be held and tried for a crime without \nhaving counsel made available to them and without the opportunity for a \nspeedy trial in front of a jury of the peers of the accused.\n  We can scarcely afford as Americans to surrender these fundamental \ncivil liberties for which wars have been fought, for which the founding \nera, the founding generation fought so nobly against our mother country \nto establish and thereafter to protect. We have to support these \nliberties. I think at a bare minimum, that means we will not allow U.S. \nmilitary personnel to arrest and indefinitely detain U.S. citizens, \nregardless of what label we happen to apply to them. These people, as \nU.S. citizens, are entitled to a grand jury indictment to the extent \nthey are being held for an infamous crime. They are also entitled to a \njury trial in front of their peers and to counsel.\n  We cannot, for the sake of convenience, surrender these important \nliberties. I am not willing to do that. That is why I support this \namendment, amendment No. 1126, to the pending legislation. I encourage \neach of my colleagues to do so.\n  I want to point out that yesterday I voted against what became known \nas the Udall amendment. I did so in part because I do not believe that \nfixed the problem I am talking about. The Udall amendment did not even \npurport to address current practice or the policies as they have been \nestablished in recent years: that this kind of detention is in some \ncircumstances acceptable. It called for a study and it eliminated \ncertain provisions in the proposed legislation, but it did not fix the \nunderlying problem.\n  This Feinstein amendment, amendment No. 1126, does fix that. That is \nwhy I support it. I encourage each of my colleagues to do the same.\n  When we take an oath to the U.S. Constitution--to uphold it, to \nsupport it, to protect it, to defend it--we are doing more than simply \nagreeing to do whatever the courts will tolerate. We are taking an oath \nto the principles embodied in this 224-year-old document that has \nfostered the greatest civilization the world has ever known.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1257, as Modified\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me just ask Senator Merkley a question, \nand then I think we can proceed from there.\n  It is my understanding that the original language in this and related \namendments had the dates 2012 and 2014 in them, and it could have been \ninterpreted that the Senator was trying to press those dates forward \nrather than address--as I interpret the Senator's current amendment--\nthe pace of reductions after consultation with the people the Senator \nhas identified. Am I correct?\n  Mr. MERKLEY. The Senator is correct. The amendment is designed to \nencourage, to increase the pace of the reduction of U.S. forces and the \ntransfer of responsibility to Afghanistan's forces.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, unless there is someone else here who wants \nto speak, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment, \nas modified.\n  The amendment (No. 1257), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from New \nHampshire----\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Senator from New Hampshire had \nintended to talk about her amendment and withdraw it, and she may be \ncoming. I have not had a chance to notify her, so there may be a \ncouple-minute delay.\n  So I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, in an exchange I had on the floor, I \nmentioned the people on wonderful Long Island. I made a joke. I am \nsorry there is at least one of my colleagues who cannot take a joke. So \nI apologize if I offended him and hope that someday he will have a \nsense of humor.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S8049]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I have been working for some time to \nwrestle with this question of the right number of military forces we \nneed in Europe. It is an issue that has given me some pause. I thought \nwe had an agreement several years ago to make some noticeable changes \nin that force structure. Some changes have indeed been made and others \nwere in the works and they apparently have been put on hold and \naltered.\n  So I just wished to share some thoughts about it. I thank Senator \nLevin and Senator McCain for working with me to develop an amendment to \nthis bill that helps call attention to this problem with the Department \nof Defense.\n  We have had a long and historic relationship with Europe and our \nEuropean allies. They remain the best allies we have in the world. We \nhave large numbers of troops still in Europe. But there are not nearly \nas many as there have been in the past. But the numbers are still \nextraordinary. We have, at this time, 80,000 U.S. troops in Europe, and \nI do not believe military threats justify that large a troop presence. \nOur historic even larger number was based on the Soviet threat, the \nFulda Gap, the weakness of our European allies after World War II and \ntheir lack of strength and the bond that NATO meant. We stuck together \nand transformed the entire North Atlantic region in a positive way.\n  A book called ``Paradise and Power'' has been written about where we \nare today. It is a pretty significant book, frankly. The essence of it \nis that the Europeans are in a paradise protected by American power, \nand they do not feel any need to substantially burden themselves with \nnational defense because the United States is there.\n  We have a nuclear presence, we have 80,000 troops, and we have the \nfabulously trained, highly skilled military with the lift capability of \nmoving to a troubled and dangerous spot at any time. I do think it is \nfair to say they have become a bit complacent.\n  As part of a CODEL I led in 2004, we visited Europe, because the \nUnited States was going through a BRAC, a reduction of U.S. basing, and \nwe did not have the same type policy with regard to international \nbases. We visited--Senator Chambliss and Senator Enzi and I--bases in \nEurope, particularly bases we felt would be enduring, such as Rota, \nSpain, Sigonella and Vicenza and other bases--and Ramstein in Germany.\n  But there are others, lots of others. So part of the NATO commitment \nis that each nation in Europe would invest and spend 2 percent of their \nGDP on defense. We have been 4 percent--sometimes over that recently--\nin recent years. So our NATO members, however, are falling below that. \nGermany, the strongest economy in Europe, is at 1.2 percent of GDP on \ndefense, and they spend a large portion of that on short-term, less \nthan 1 year, military training of young people in Germany.\n  The fact is, a 9-month trainee is not someone in the modern world we \ncan send into combat. They are just not sufficiently trained. Many \nmilitary experts believe this is a waste of money. So even the money \nthey are spending, in many ways, is not effectively and wisely spent to \ncreate the kind of modern military they have to have to be successful \nin a serious manner.\n  We do, though, believe Europe is not facing the kind of threats we \nhad. I think it is appropriate for us to talk to our European allies \nand say we want to proceed with a drawdown, where possible. This Nation \nis borrowing 40 cents of every $1 we spend. The Defense Department, \nunder the sequester that will occur as a result of the failure of the \ncommittee of 12 to reach an agreement, will be facing dramatic cuts in \nspending, over $1 trillion based on President Obama's projected budget \nover 10 years. We need to look for every reasonable savings we can.\n  The Defense Department is taking too heavy a cut in my opinion, far \nmore than any other department of government. However, we cannot \nsustain that. I do not support that large a cut, but it will be \nreducing spending by a significant amount. So I believe we should think \nabout our foreign deployments. The National Defense Authorization Act \nrepresents a vision for defense spending. We are now down from $548 \nbillion spent on the Defense Department last year, $527 billion this \nyear, an actual reduction in noninflation dollars of over $20 billion.\n  As a matter of fact, the Budget Control Act agreement calls for a \nreduction of total spending in the discretionary account this year of \n$7 billion; whereas, the Defense Department is taking $20 billion. \nOther departments therefore are receiving increases to get the net 7 \nthat is claimed. Unfortunately, that is not an accurate number because \nwe do not achieve even the $7 billion promised.\n  Since 2004, the Defense Department had a plan to transfer two of its \nfour highly trained combat brigades in Europe back to the United States \nas part of the larger post-world war realignment. However, in April of \nthis year, the Department of Defense announced it would maintain three \ncombat brigades and not bring the fourth one home until 2015.\n  I have asked the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General \nDempsey, at the Armed Services hearing, and I asked Admiral Stavridis, \nour European EUCOM commander, and they had no good explanation for why \nwe are altering the plan that has been in place.\n  So my amendment has been agreed to on both sides and would require \nthree things from the Department of Defense: No. 1, assessment of the \nApril 2011 decision to station three Army brigade combat teams in \nEurope; No. 2, an analysis of the fiscal and strategic costs and \nbenefits of reducing the number of forward-based military personnel in \nEurope to that recommended by the 2004 Global Posture Review; and, No. \n3, to describe the methodology used by the Defense Department to \nestimate the current and future cost of U.S. force posture in Europe.\n  So is Europe more threatened today than before? I do not think so. \nThe United States has a tougher financial condition today than before? \nYes. I believe we need to look at this carefully. I thank Senator \nMcCain and Senator Levin for working with me to recommend an amendment \nthey believe is consistent with the goals I am seeking without \nmicromanaging the Department of Defense.\n  I thank the Chair. I am pleased this amendment will be considered, \nand perhaps we can make some progress to analyzing more properly the \ndeployment of forces in Europe. Finally, I would say there is no doubt \nin my mind that the economy of the United States is benefited if a \nbrigade is housed in the United States, and the costs of support and \nfamily are in the United States strengthening our economy rather than \ntransferring the wealth of our Nation to a foreign area.\n  I hope we will consider that as we deal with this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1229\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1229 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is already pending.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I note the presence of my colleague, Senator Lieberman, \non the floor, the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee.\n  I thank my friend from Connecticut for his support of this amendment \nand the importance, with the full realization of the key role the \nchairman of the Homeland Security Committee plays in the issue of cyber \nsecurity, which is the most--in many respects, one of the most looming \nthreats to our Nation's security.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Arizona. I \nappreciate this amendment he has offered. I believe I am now listed as \na cosponsor. If not, I ask unanimous consent that I be so listed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. This amendment essentially codifies a very important \nmemorandum of understanding between the Department of Homeland Security \nand the NSA, the National Security Agency. This is a perfect balance \nand exactly the kind of overcoming of stovepipes we need to see in our \ngovernment.\n  Under existing law, the Department of Homeland Security has \nresponsibility for protecting nondefense government, Federal Government \ncyberspace--cyber networks--and the privately owned and operated \ncyberspace,\n\n[[Page S8050]]\n\nwhich actually amounts to some of the most critical cyber \ninfrastructure in our country is privately owned.\n  Today, as Senator McCain suggested, a target of attack by an enemy \nwanting to do us harm could be, for instance, our transit systems, \nfinancial systems, electric grid, and the like. What is embodied in \nthis memorandum of understanding between DHS and NSA--which we will, by \nthis amendment, codify into law--is to maintain the quite appropriate \ninterface of the Department of Homeland Security with the privately \nowned cyber-infrastructure and those who own and operate it, yet \nutilizing the unsurpassed capabilities of NSA.\n  I appreciate that in this colloquy Senator McCain and I are entering \ninto, we both make clear--and I appreciate that his intention here in \noffering this amendment is not to circumvent the need for broader \nlegislation to protect our American cyberspace from theft, \nexploitation, and attack. It happens that the current occupant of the \nchair, the junior Senator from Rhode Island, has been a leader in this \nChamber in pushing us to deal with these kinds of problems.\n  Senator Reid has announced that he will bring a comprehensive cyber-\nsecurity bill to the floor of the Senate in the first work period of \n2012. That is very good news for our security. As Senator McCain said, \nI don't know that we today have a more serious threat to our security \nthan that represented by those who would do us harm by attacking our \ncyber-systems, both public and private. This colloquy makes clear that \nthis is a very significant first step, and that we need to do something \nmore comprehensive and look forward to doing it on a bipartisan basis \nin the first work period in 2012.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Connecticut, my dear friend. The \namendment establishes a statutory basis for the memorandum of agreement \nbetween the Department of Defense and Homeland Security on cooperative \ncyber-security support. Nobody should have any doubt about how serious \nthis issue is. Secretary of Defense Panetta said this in June:\n\n       The next ``Pearl Harbor'' we confront could very well be a \n     cyber attack.\n\n  ADM Mike Mullen at a hearing on \n9/22 referred to the cyber-threat as an existential threat to our \ncountry. This is a serious issue and one that, as the Senator from \nConnecticut pointed out, is of utmost importance to our Nation's \nsecurity.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I would like to thank my friend Senator \nMcCain for introducing an amendment codifying an existing memorandum of \nagreement between the Department of Homeland Security and the \nDepartment of Defense that formalizes their cooperation on \ncybersecurity work. Our Nation needs to confront the growing threats we \nface in cyberspace; as Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta testified in \nJune, the ``next Pearl Harbor we confront could very well be a cyber-\nattack.''\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend for cosponsoring my amendment, and \nshare his concern about the threat our Nation faces. In a hearing \nbefore the Armed Services Committee just two months ago, former \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen called the \ncyber threat an ``existential'' threat to our country.\n  The purpose of my amendment is to codify the current memorandum of \nagreement, and to ensure that the relationship between DoD and DHS \nendures. This growing partnership demonstrates that the best \ngovernment-wide cybersecurity approach is one where DHS leverages, not \nduplicates, DoD efforts and expertise. This is just one of the many \nissues we need to address on cyber legislation, and does not diminish \nthe need for a comprehensive bill addressing our Nation's \ncybersecurity. But our work together on this should serve as an example \nof where consensus can and should exist moving forward.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I agree wholeheartedly. The approach embodied by the \nmemorandum of agreement--and this amendment--exemplifies the potential \nfor DoD and DHS to leverage each other's expertise, to make efficient \nuse of existing government resources, and to avoid unnecessary growth \nof government. That is the approach we must follow as we continue down \nthe path toward comprehensive cybersecurity legislation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I agree, and I again thank my colleague for supporting my \namendment. While at the end of the day we may not agree on all of the \nprovisions of a bill, I look forward to working together early in the \ncoming year to address these issues under a process that allows for \nfull debate of the issues on which we may differ.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1229) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nLieberman and I be allowed to engage in a colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1068\n\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, obtaining intelligence from high-value \nterrorist detainees is an urgent national security priority that is \nessential to protecting Americans. Unfortunately, under current law, \nterrorists need look no further than the Internet to find out \neverything they need to know about our interrogation practices and how \nthey can circumvent them. Under President Obama's 2009 Executive Order \n13491, all U.S. Government interrogators are limited to the \ninterrogation techniques that are available online and described in the \nArmy Field Manual. As a result, all members of the intelligence \ncommunity, including the non-Department of Defense intelligence \nprofessionals who support the high-value detainees interrogation group, \nmust conform to the procedures in the Army Field Manual, which was \nwritten by the U.S. Army for the U.S. Army; that is, there is little \nflexibility permitted under these rules, and they are easy for those \nwho want to harm us to circumvent them and to know exactly what \ntechniques we will use to gather information to protect our country if \nthey are detained as an enemy combatant.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Let me thank my friend, Senator Ayotte, for playing \nsuch a leading role in our debates on this critical issue of how our \ncountry handles detainees and gathers intelligence in our war on \nterrorism. I share her concerns about the potential damage to our \nintelligence collection efforts inflicted by adherence to the existing \nrestrictions on interrogations. That is why I am pleased to be, with \nothers, a cosponsor of the amendment introduced, amendment No. 1068.\n  I will say that I am also disturbed about the amount of \nmisinformation that seems to be circulating about this amendment and \nsimilar efforts in the past that I have supported.\n  I ask the Senator from New Hampshire, does amendment No. 1068 \nauthorize torture?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I thank my friend, the Senator from Connecticut, first, \nfor his leadership in this body on national security. We both had the \nprivilege of serving our States as attorneys general.\n  The answer is no. This is an amendment, I point out, that not only is \nSenator Lieberman sponsoring--and I appreciate his experience and \nleadership on this most important national security issue--but Senator \nChambliss, vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, as well as \nSenator Graham and Senator Cornyn, who are both members of the Armed \nServices Committee, as well as the Judiciary Committee. It is very \nimportant to be clear about what this amendment would and would not do.\n  This proposal takes every possible measure to put into place \nintelligence-gathering practices that honor our American values and \nlaws. Our amendment in no way condones or authorizes torture. There \nhave been many groups trying to misrepresent what is in this amendment. \nAny new interrogation techniques that are developed would be required \nto comply with the U.N. Convention Against Torture, the Military \nCommissions Act, the Detainee Treatment Act, as well as section 2441 of \nTitle 18 U.S. Code that relates to war crimes.\n\n[[Page S8051]]\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend for that clarification. It is very \nimportant. It is very critical--particularly for those who \nmisunderstood this amendment--to understand the host of protections \nthat the amendment puts in, both compelling compliance with the \ninternational convention against torture, as well as explicit \nprohibition in American law against interrogation that amounts to \ntorture.\n  I want to ask my friend another question. Right now, all Federal \nGovernment interrogators, whether in the military or in the civilian \nintelligence community, are limited to using the Army Field Manual. So \nwhy does the Senator think it is so critical to give interrogators the \nability--limited ability--to go beyond the Army Field Manual?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I appreciate the question from my friend and colleague. \nThe decision by President Obama to limit interrogators to the Army \nField Manual was based, in part, on the horrible abuses that happened \nat Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. Undoubtedly, the abuses at Abu Ghraib \nfailed to reflect American values, tarnished America's reputation, and \ncertainly damaged our interests. However, responding to these abuses by \nreflexively applying an Army Field Manual--which, to be clear, \nterrorists can go online and get and know exactly which techniques they \nwill be subject to if captured--to all Federal Government interrogators \ndoesn't reflect the severity of the threat to our country and the \nimportance of providing our nonmilitary intelligence collectors all of \nthe lawful tools they need to gather intelligence to prevent nuclear \nattacks and protect our country.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator for that answer. I completely \nagree with her. It is important to step back and perhaps state the \nobvious. Why do we capture enemy combatants? Why do we take prisoners \nof war? Two reasons, really. The obvious one is to get them off the \nbattlefield against us so they can no longer attempt to kill Americans \nin uniform and, in the case of the war we are in with Islamist \nterrorists, to kill civilians. That is first--get them off the \nbattlefield.\n  The second purpose--and this has been the traditional purpose of \ntaking prisoners of war as long as there has been warfare in human \nhistory, and all the more so now--is to gather intelligence from them \nthat will assist us in defeating the enemy and protecting our goals and \nprotecting the lives of our men and women in uniform. That traditional \npurpose for taking prisoners of war is all the more critical in the \nunconventional war we are in against a brutal enemy that doesn't strike \nfrom battleships or tactical air fighters or military tanks or even in \nuniform; they strike us from the shadows, and they strike civilians as \nwell.\n  It is very important to approach this amendment understanding that we \nare trying to increase, in a reasonable way, the capacity of those who \nwork for us to protect our security and freedom to interrogate \ndetainees that we have captured in the war against terrorism. One of \nthe purposes is to gather intelligence, which will help us protect the \nlives of Americans and of our allies.\n  The preface to the Army Field Manual says it applies to the active \nArmy, the Army National Guard, and the U.S. Army Reserve, unless \notherwise stated. So as to the field manual, recognizing that these \nwords create limited applicability of the manual outside the Army, the \nArmy Training and Doctrine Command authors had the wisdom to warn that \nthis manual was ``Army doctrine,'' and it would have to be adapted, \naltered to apply to other ``military departments'' or other military \nservice. If the interrogation techniques in this manual are not ideally \nsuited for military services other than the U.S. Army, why should \ncivilian interrogation professionals in the intelligence community, and \nparticularly those who are in support of a high-value detainee \ninterrogation, those who get the most powerful and influential and \ndangerous prisoners of war, be forced to comply with a document written \nfor a defined military unit, which is the U.S. Army? I ask my friend \nfrom New Hampshire that question.\n\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I appreciate the question from the Senator from \nConnecticut. Absolutely, as the Senator pointed out, the Army Field \nManual was not created for this purpose. As he mentioned, the high-\nvalue detainee interrogation group is a group consisting of the CIA, \nFBI, and Defense Intelligence Agency, designed to interrogate the worst \nterrorists, who are likely to have valuable information about future \nattacks and information we need to protect our country. To address this \nproblem, we drafted the amendment through this authorization that would \nallow members of the intelligence community, who are assigned to or in \nsupport of the high-value interrogation group, to utilize interrogation \ntechniques that are consistent with our laws and values. Our amendment \nwould ask the Secretary of Defense, working with the Director of \nNational Intelligence and the Attorney General, to develop a classified \nannex to the Army Field Manual that terrorists could not see. \nUnfortunately, now they can go on the Internet and look at the \ntechniques. It classifies that the Army Field Manual would provide \ninterrogation techniques that would be used by that important select \ngroup of intelligence-gathering professionals, to allow them to have \nfor their use the techniques they need to gather information and \nprotect our country.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Again, I thank my friend from New Hampshire, but I \nwant to go back to something I said earlier. We have described the \npurpose of this amendment--what I call the due process we have put into \nit, the mandate that it comply with existing international norms and \ntreaties, and, obviously, to comply with our law. I want to say to my \ncolleague that it is certainly not my intention--and I ask my colleague \nis it her intention--that any of the measures we are authorizing--the \ninterrogation tactics for the worst of the terrorist detainees--should \nor could equal what is conventionally known as torture? In other words, \nwe are not attempting to legalize torture with this amendment.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I thank the Senator for the question. The answer is, no; \nwe are not. We believe torture violates our laws and runs counter to \nAmerican values. That is what I believe. That is why we specifically \nrequire the techniques developed by the Secretary of Defense, the \nDirector of National Intelligence, and the Attorney General have to \ncomply with the U.N. Convention Against Torture and all applicable \nlaws, including the Detainee Treatment Act. Thus, the ACLU's claim the \namendment threatens to revive the use of torture is patently false, \nunfortunately.\n  Currently, the Army Field Manual interrogation techniques our \nintelligence community interrogators must follow are publicly listed \nonline. That is unacceptable. It is like the New England Patriots \ngiving their opponents their playbook days or weeks before the game \nbegins. In my experience as attorney general of New Hampshire and as a \nmurder prosecutor, no detective or cop in even a common criminal case \nwould tell the criminals what techniques they are going to use to \ngather information.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, could I ask my friend from New Hampshire to \nallow me to propose a unanimous consent request?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I would grant the leader that request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. The reason I ask is that Senator Levin and I have a \nclassified briefing that starts at 5:30.\n  May I ask the Senator how much longer she wishes to speak? It doesn't \nmatter, but just so I have an idea.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I would say probably 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \nstatement of Senator Ayotte of approximately 10 minutes--she has been \nhere long enough that she has learned to keep Senators' time, and 5 \nminutes really isn't 5 minutes--does the Senator from Connecticut wish \nto speak?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I would say to the leader, I am in this \nwith the Senator from New Hampshire, so we will complete our colloquy \nwithin 10 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. So following their colloquy of 10 minutes, I ask unanimous \nconsent the Senate proceed to a period of morning business for 1 hour; \nthat following that we go back to the Defense authorization bill.\n  There will be no more votes this evening, though, Mr. President.\n\n[[Page S8052]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate the time of the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I thank our leader for giving us the opportunity to \ncontinue this colloquy.\n  I just wanted to point out--we were talking about the fact the Army \nField Manual is online--that in my experience as New Hampshire's \nattorney general and prior to that as a murder prosecutor--and I know \nmy colleague served as his State's attorney general as well--no \ndetective or cop on the beat, in a common criminal case--and, of \ncourse, we are dealing with a situation where we are at war with \nterrorists--would ever give a criminal their playbook as to what \ntechniques they would use to question them to get information to see if \na crime has been committed and to see that justice is served. Yet here \nwe are in a situation where we have online the techniques from the Army \nField Manual while we are at war with terrorists who want to kill us.\n  What we are saying with this amendment is that we need to allow the \nintelligence professionals to develop techniques, but in a classified \nannex, consistent with our laws, that would allow them to gather \nintelligence and not tell our enemies what techniques will be used to \ngather information from them.\n  Not surprisingly, al-Qaida terrorists have taken advantage of our \nwillingness to tell them publicly on the Internet what will and will \nnot happen during an interrogation should they be captured. Al-Qaida \nterrorists have familiarized themselves with the interrogation \ntechniques they would confront if captured, and they are training on \nhow to respond. That makes it more difficult for us to gather \ninformation.\n  The willingness of the United States to give the equivalent of \ninterrogation CliffsNotes to terrorists places our interrogators at a \ndisadvantage and makes it more difficult to gather the information we \nneed to save American lives. So developing a classified annex of lawful \ntechniques for intelligence professionals who are interrogating the \nworst terrorists would make it harder for terrorists to train to avoid \nand resist interrogation.\n  The key to our amendment is giving this limited group of intelligence \ncommunity interrogators the techniques they need to gather information \nbut to do so without resorting to torture and while retaining an \noperational advantage that makes it more likely an interrogation will \nbe successful.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Again, Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New \nHampshire. Just in listening to her, it seems so unacceptable that we \nare basically telegraphing to our enemy exactly the range of tactics \nthat we will use against them as part of the interrogation.\n  We have set some quite appropriate constraints in this amendment \nconsistent with our values and our laws and international law so that \nwe are not going to get anywhere near torture. But when a member of al-\nQaida or a similarly associated terrorist group is captured, I want \nthat person to be terrified about what is going to happen to them while \nin American custody. I want them not to know what is going to happen. I \nwant the terror they inflict on others to be felt by them as a result \nof the uncertainty of not knowing they can look on the Internet and \nfind out exactly what our interrogators are going to be limited to.\n  Again, we will not tolerate torture. We will not tolerate what \nhappened at Abu Ghraib. I think the limited interrogation in the Army \nField Manual was an understandable but excessive reaction to the \nextreme and unacceptable behavior by Americans at Abu Ghraib. I hope \nthis amendment will facilitate a return to the kind of sensible middle \nground on which we will not be shackling our interrogators as they try \nto get intelligence, within the law, to protect our freedom and the \nsafety of those who are fighting for us.\n\n  So I want to ask my friend from New Hampshire whether she thinks we \nhave now a kind of one-size-fits-all approach to interrogation that is \nposted online. In other words, our laws should make it easier, within \nthe law, not harder, to gather intelligence to keep Americans safe. Yet \nit seems the current policy runs counter to that basic principle. Does \nmy friend from New Hampshire agree?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I do. I do agree. As a matter of common sense, this \namendment should go forward. The reality of telling our enemies online \nwhat to expect just defies common sense. That is what we are addressing \nwith this amendment.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. If I may, I find the discussion fascinating. May I enter \ninto the colloquy?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Subject to the previous order, the Senator is \nwelcome to join the colloquy.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Chair.\n  As I understand it, the reason the Senator is having to do this is \nbecause President Obama, by Executive order, prevented the CIA and \nother agencies from using any enhanced interrogation techniques that \nhave been classified in the past; is that correct?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. That is right. Unfortunately, we are just telegraphing to \nour enemies what techniques we are going to use.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. If I may, let me ask another question. All of us agree we \ndon't want to torture anybody. Waterboarding is not the way to get good \nintelligence. Not only is it not the right thing to do, it is just not \nthe wise thing to do. But we believe we have gone too far the other \nway; that when the President said no interrogation technique is \navailable to our intelligence community other than the Army Field \nManual, does my colleague agree that, for the first time in American \nhistory, we are advertising to our enemies what we can do to them if we \ncapture them, and no more can be done?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I would say the Senator is absolutely right. I appreciate \nthat the Senator from South Carolina has cosponsored this amendment, as \nhas Senator Lieberman, and I appreciate Senator Lieberman's leadership. \nI would like to say while we are in this colloquy that Senator \nLieberman has also been a mentor to me in the Senate, and I appreciate \nthat as well as his leadership on these issues.\n  Really, it comes down to this: We should not be telegraphing, we \nshould not be advertising to our enemies what techniques our \nprofessional interrogators will use. This amendment is limited to the \ngroup of professionals who will focus on these issues and who will be \ngathering intelligence from terrorists.\n  We have to protect our country. Why would we do this? It just doesn't \nmake sense.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. My good friend from Connecticut is aware there is a \nproposal pending on the floor of the Senate that would say, for the \nfirst time in American history, if a U.S. citizen decides to \ncollaborate with an enemy, they cannot be held as an enemy combatant. I \nthink the Senator is very familiar with the history of the law in this \narea. Unfortunately, during the entire history of our country, during \nother conflicts, American citizens have, on occasion, collaborated with \nthe enemy, one of the most famous cases being the In re Quirin case, \nwhere an American citizen in New York and other places was helping Nazi \nsaboteurs try to sabotage America.\n  In that case, the Supreme Court ruled an American citizen could be \ndetained as an enemy combatant because the decision to collaborate with \nthe enemy was a decision to go to war with their country, not a common \ncrime, and that the law to be applied was the law of war. I am certain \nthe Senator is familiar with the Hamdi case, where an American citizen \nseized in Afghanistan was allowed to be held as an enemy combatant. The \nHamdi decision reaffirmed In re Quirin, and the Padilla case involved \nan American citizen captured in the United States accused of \ncollaborating with al-Qaida.\n  All of those cases reaffirm the law of the land is, if someone \nchooses to help al-Qaida, they have committed an act of war against \ntheir fellow citizens, and they can be held as an enemy combatant for \nan indeterminate period of time so that we can gather intelligence \nabout what they may have done or about what they know about the enemy.\n  Does the Senator from Connecticut agree that now would be a very bad \ntime for the Congress to say, for the first time in American history, \nif an American citizen decides to help al-\n\n[[Page S8053]]\n\nQaida attack us, to kill us, our military can't hold them as an enemy \ncombatant and find out what they were up to?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from South Carolina \nfor participating in our colloquy, and, of course, I totally agree with \nhim, first of all, on the principle. As he has said very well, and he \nknows the law very well or better than anyone around here, the Supreme \nCourt has made clear an American citizen, who by his or her acts has \ndeclared themselves to be an enemy of the United States, can be treated \nas an enemy combatant. If we change that now, it is not only wrong on \nprinciple, but it is absolutely the wrong time to do this.\n  Let me speak now for a moment--and I am privileged to be the chair of \nthe Senate Homeland Security Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 10 minutes allocated for the colloquy has \nexpired.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an \nadditional 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Very briefly, the great concern we have now in terms of the security \nof the homeland is from so-called homegrown terrorists, radicalized \nAmericans who effectively have joined al-Qaida or other terrorist \nenemies to attack the United States.\n  It is a sad and painful reality that, since 9/11, the only Americans \nkilled on American soil by Islamist extremists and terrorists have been \nkilled by other Americans who have been radicalized, who have become \nenemy combatants. I am speaking particularly of MAJ Nidal Hasan who \nkilled 13 people at Fort Hood, and then an American named Bledsoe, who \nwalked into an Army recruiting station in Little Rock, AR, and killed \nan Army recruiter just because he was wearing a uniform of the U.S. \nArmy.\n  So these people have taken sides. They have joined the enemy. So to \nhave this body at this time, as the threat of homegrown terrorism \nrises, say: No, they can't be treated as enemy combatants, not only \ndoes it not make sense and is totally unresponsive to the facts I have \njust described, the fact is, it is also dangerous.\n  So I couldn't agree with the Senator more. I wish to thank Senator \nAyotte, as we come to the end of this colloquy, for her initiative, \nfrankly, for swiftly establishing herself in the Senate as one of our \nimportant leaders on national security matters. I am a little biased \nabout this, but I know her experience as a former State attorney \ngeneral has helped as well as what I have noted is her active and \ninformed participation on the Armed Services Committee.\n  I must say that as I am about to enter my last year privileged to be \na U.S. Senator, it gives me great comfort to know Senator Ayotte is \ngoing to be here to carry on these fights for American national \nsecurity and for freedom.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I thank Senator Lieberman very much. Again, I appreciate \nthe Senator's leadership and all he has done for our country, to \nprotect our country. I dare say no one has been more focused on \nprotecting our country, and we deeply appreciate his leadership.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 1067 Withdrawn\n\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Before I yield the floor, I need to briefly discuss the \nwithdrawal of an amendment I have, which is amendment No. 1067, \nregarding notification of Congress with respect to the initial custody \nand further disposition of members of al-Qaida and affiliated entities.\n  I have received assurances from the Armed Services Committee majority \nand minority staff that these comments and steps which are outlined in \nthat amendment will be addressed when the Defense bill goes to \nconference.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment \nNo. 1067 be withdrawn. But I also understand that the Armed Services \nCommittee will take up my amendment when the Defense bill goes to \nconference as part of the conference on this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, some people are wrongly suggesting that the \nNational Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2012, this \nlegislation will allow the military to capture and indefinitely detain \nany American citizen, and that the U.S. Armed Forces would be able to \nperform law enforcement functions on American soil because of the \nauthority conferred under sections 1031 and 1032 of the act.\n  Several people have asked about my votes on the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for fiscal year 2012. In particular, some people are \nwrongly suggesting that this legislation will allow the military to \ncapture and indefinitely detain any American citizen, and that the U.S. \nArmed Forces would be able to perform law enforcement functions on \nAmerican soil because of the authority conferred under sections 1031 \nand 1032 of the act. While I do have other serious concerns with this \nlegislation, those particular assertions could not be further from the \ntruth. I want to take this time to explain what the law actually does, \nwhat my position is on these issues, and why I joined with Senators \nDemint, Coburn and Lee to vote for those specific sections but against \ncloture on the final bill.\n  Section 1031 of this act merely affirms the authority that the \nPresident already has to detain certain people pursuant to the current \nauthorization for use of military force. In fact, this same section of \nthe bill specifically states that nothing stated in section 1031 is \nintended to expand the President's power. In addition, this section \nsets specific limits on who can be detained under this act to only \nthose people who planned or helped carry out the 9/11 attacks on the \nUnited States or people who are a member of, or substantially support, \nal-Qaida, the Taliban, or their respective affiliates. There is no \nlanguage that could possibly be construed as repealing the Posse \nComitatus Act and allowing the U.S. military to supplant your local \npolice department in carrying out typical law enforcement activities.\n  In particular, some folks are concerned about the language in section \n1031 that says that this includes ``any person committing a belligerent \nact or directly supported such hostilities of such enemy forces.'' This \nlanguage clearly and unequivocally refers back to al-Qaida, the \nTaliban, or its affiliates. Thus, not only would any person in question \nneed to be involved with al-Qaida, the Taliban, or its surrogates, but \nthat person must also engage in a deliberate and substantial act that \ndirectly supports their efforts against us in the war on terror in \norder to be detained under this provision. There is nothing in this \nbill that could be construed in any way that would allow any branch of \nthe military to detain a law-abiding American citizen if they go to the \nlocal gun store or grocery store. What this section of the bill does is \nhelp provide for our national security by giving clarity to the \nmilitary in regard to its authority to detain people who have committed \nsubstantially harmful acts against the United States. This is extremely \nimportant given that there are al-Qaida cells currently operating \nwithin our borders. I would not leave the risk of a terrorist attack \nthat could claim the life of a member of my family up to chance, and I \nwill not leave that risk for your family either.\n  Section 1032 of this bill concerns a smaller group of people who \nCongress believes are required to be detained by the U.S. military \nbecause people who fit within this criteria are a more serious threat \nto our national security. Any person detained under section 1032 must \nbe a member of, or part of, al-Qaida or its associates and they must \nhave participated in the planning or execution of an attack against the \nU.S. or our coalition partners. Simply put, the application of this \ndetention requirement is limited to al-Qaida members that have tried to \nattack the U.S. or its allies. However, this detention requirement is \nclearly limited by a clause that states that the requirement to detain \ndoes not extend to U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents.\n  Together, these two sections do the following: They affirm the \nauthority of the executive branch to act within our national interest, \nand they provide the Federal Government with the tools that are needed \nto maintain our national security. This bill does not overturn the \nPosse Comitatus Act; the military will not be patrolling the streets. \nThis bill does not take away our rights as citizens or lawful permanent \nresidents; the authority under this act does not take away one's habeas \nrights. These sections do not take\n\n[[Page S8054]]\n\naway an individual's rights to equal protection under the 14th \namendment to the U.S. Constitution, nor do they take away one's due \nprocess rights afforded under the 5th or 14th. If this bill did such a \nthing, I would strongly oppose it.\n  I want to thank everyone for reaching out to the office to voice \ntheir concerns on this bill. I want to assure them that I always have, \nand always will, listen to their concerns and address them in a timely \nfashion. I know this bill is not perfect. In fact, I proposed two \namendments to prevent the President from transferring foreign \nterrorists to the U.S. to be prosecuted in the Federal court system, \nand I joined with Senators DeMint, Coburn, and Lee to vote against \ncloture. However, in regard to the assertions that this bill allows the \nU.S. military to supplant our local police departments or that it \nallows the Federal Government to detain otherwise law-abiding citizens \nfor simply carrying on in their daily lives, those assertions are \nentirely unfounded. As always, if anyone has any other questions, \nplease feel free to contact me.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/30/senate-section/article/S8054-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I would like to do a colloquy with my good friend from \nConnecticut.\n  Senator Lieberman said something that I think we need to sort of \nabsorb. As the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, does the \nSenator believe the likelihood of American citizens being recruited, \nenlisted, and radicalized on behalf of al-Qaida is going up? Is that \nwhat the Senator is trying to tell us?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I say to my friend from South Carolina, \nI not only believe it, but it is shown by the facts.\n  I wish I had the numbers exactly in front of me. But if we chart \nattempts at terrorist attacks on the United States--and here I am \nlimiting it to people who are affiliated with the global Islamist \nextremist movement--there were a few after 9/11, but in the last 2 or 3 \nyears, the numbers have gone up dramatically.\n  I hasten to say these represent a very small percentage of the \nMuslim-American community. But of course it doesn't take too many \npeople to cause great havoc. We have been effective at law enforcement \nand, frankly, we have been lucky that all but two of these attempts \nhave been stopped. But I think we would find law enforcement officials, \nHomeland Security officials saying the toughest and most dangerous \nthreat right now to the homeland security of the American people comes \nfrom homegrown terrorists who have been self-radicalized or radicalized \nby somebody else.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I think that is important for us to understand. Does the \nSenator agree with me that when we look at the war on terror, the \nUnited States is part of the battlefield?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Well, there is no question our enemies have declared \nit part of the battlefield. The very official commencement of the war \nagainst Islamist terrorism, 9/11, was an attack on America's homeland, \non civilians.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. So let's just go with that thought for a moment.\n  Let's say our intelligence community, our law enforcement community, \nand our military/Department of Defense are all monitoring al-Qaida \nthreats at home and abroad; does the Senator agree with that?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Absolutely true. Al-Qaida and like Islamist terrorist \ngroups.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Under the Posse Comitatus Act, the military cannot be \nused for domestic law enforcement functions. Does the Senator agree \nwith me that tracking al-Qaida operatives--citizen or not--within the \nUnited States is not a law enforcement function; it is a military \nfunction?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. It is a combination, truthfully.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. But our military has the ability to defend us against al-\nQaida attacks at home, such as they do abroad.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Right.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. So if the Department of Defense somehow intercepted \ninformation about an al-Qaida cell, let's say in Connecticut or South \nCarolina, could they be involved in suppressing that cell?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I would say what has happened here since 9/11, and \nwhat we needed to have happen, is that the old stovepipes have \ndissolved and we have military, civilian, CIA, FBI, each with a focus, \nworking together.\n  For instance, the Army doctor who killed 13 people at Fort Hood, our \ncommittee did an investigation in that case. He was actually \ncommunicating with the radical cleric Awlaki in Yemen over the \nInternet. That was picked up by international intelligence operatives. \nPart of the story is it wasn't transferred effectively to the Army so \nthey could grab him before he committed the mass murder at Fort Hood.\n  But I have to say for the record, the primary responsibility for \ncounterterrorism now in the United States is with the FBI that has \ndeveloped an extraordinary capability since 9/11. But it works very \nclosely with the CIA, gathering international intelligence, NSA, \nhomeland security, and the military.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. As a team effort.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Right.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Let's imagine a scenario next week where we find an al-\nQaida cell exists that is planning a series of attacks against the \nUnited States, and within that cell we have some American citizens and \nwe have people who have come here who are noncitizens.\n  Would the Senator agree with me, since Congress has designated \ncooperating or collaborating with al-Qaida to be an act of war, that \nentire cell could be held as enemy combatants and questioned by our \nintelligence community as to what they know about the attack and \nquestioned on future attacks?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. That certainly should be the case, and we have had \nthis circumstance in reality. They are all part of the same enemy. In \nthe case the Senator posits, they have all been part of the same plot \nto attack the American people.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. So would the Senator agree with me that the current law \nis very clear that anytime an American citizen joins the enemy force, \nthey can be held as an enemy combatant; that is the law?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. That is the law. As the Senator has said and Chairman \nLevin has said several times in the debate, there may be some in the \nChamber who don't like it, but that is what the U.S. Supreme Court has \nsaid very clearly.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. If we capture an American citizen as part of this cell \nand we can't hold them as an enemy combatant for intelligence-gathering \npurposes, does domestic criminal law allow us to hold someone for an \nindefinite period of time to gather military intelligence?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. No.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Does domestic criminal law focus on the wrongdoing of the \nactor, based on a specific event, when we are trying to resolve a \ndispute between the wrongdoer and the victim?\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Yes, it does. The Senator is making a very important \npoint. It goes back to the colloquy the Senator from New Hampshire and \nI had, which is, when we capture an enemy combatant, we do so for two \nreasons: One is to get that enemy off the battlefield, the second is to \ngather intelligence. Sometimes the second purpose is more important \nthan the first because it can lead us to other plots against the \nAmerican people.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Does the Senator agree with me the reason the Supreme \nCourt has recognized that an American citizen could be held as an enemy \ncombatant if they collaborate with an\n\n[[Page S8055]]\n\nenemy is that the Court views that as an act of war; and under the \npowers of the Commander in Chief, he can suppress all the enemies, \nforeign and domestic, that are at war with us?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I do. There has been a lot of talk about the \nConstitution. The Constitution makes very clear that the primary \nresponsibility we have in the Federal Government is to provide for the \ncommon defense, to protect the security of the American people.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. So our courts have recognized that during a time of \nhostilities, the executive branch has the authority to detain an \nAmerican citizen who is helping the enemies of the Nation. The question \nis, Does the Congress want to change that for the first time ever?\n  I would like to add something that my good friend from Rhode Island \ngot me thinking about. I have always tried to explain indefinite \ndetention, what are we trying to do here? Clearly, in war, there is no \nrequirement to let the enemy prisoner go back to the fight after the \npassage of time. We don't want to let any enemy prisoner go back to the \nfight because that makes no good sense. The problem with this war is, \nthere is no definable end. That is the reason we have a habeas review, \nbecause we will never know when hostilities are over. So an enemy \ncombatant determination could be a de facto life sentence, and that is \nwhy our Supreme Court said we want a judicial check on the executive \nbranch.\n  So every enemy combatant will have their day in Federal court, and \nthe government has to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence to an \nindependent judge, that the decision to hold this person is warranted \nunder the law. That was what the Hamdi case was about. I think that \nmakes sense because it will not be the traditional war; it will be a \nwar without a definable end.\n  The idea of continuing to hold them, if the judge says to the \ngovernment: You are right, there is compelling evidence this person was \ninvolved with al-Qaida, tried to get involved with a hostile act; you \nare right, they are part of the enemy, you can hold them forever. But \nwe have come up with an annual review process to make sure they will \nhave a chance every year to have their case looked at.\n  Senator Whitehouse got me thinking. In our own law, under the civil \njustice system--such as Hinckley, the man who shot President Reagan, he \nwas acquitted in court, by reason of insanity, of shooting President \nReagan. He has been in a psychiatric hospital ever since, and he can be \nheld away from the community because he is a danger to himself or \nothers.\n  I think what Senator Whitehouse is saying is, the idea that we can \nhold someone--the Court has agreed with the government--as part of the \nenemy force as a continuing threat is not an unknown concept. We just \nhave to have a review.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator asked to be notified at 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the President.\n  I would suggest to our colleagues, let's think this thing through. \nLet's realize that if the enemy is coming to our homeland, the enemy is \nrecruiting American citizens; and if we find an American citizen who \nhas, in fact, joined forces with al-Qaida, our No. 1 goal should be to \ngather intelligence to prevent future attacks and to find out what that \nperson knows about what the enemy is up to. Our secondary concern \nshould be prosecution. When we interrogate somebody as the enemy \ncombatant, the best thing we have on our side is time. I don't want to \nwaterboard anyone, but I want to keep them in a controlled environment \nwhere time is on our side, and I will argue that the best information \nwe have from Guantanamo Bay detainees did not come from waterboarding, \nit came from the fact that we could hold them for an indeterminate \nperiod of time, and through time, they began to cooperate and tell us \nvaluable information.\n\n  Does the Senator agree that is the concept we need to hold onto in \nthis war?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend. I absolutely agree. I talked to \nprofessionals in this business of interrogation, and they say some of \nthe most effective interrogation takes time. I have had people describe \nto me detainees who were totally uncooperative, and they were asked \nover and over for days and weeks and months, and then finally broke and \nbegan to give information that was critically important for the \nprotection of our country. So I do agree.\n  I want to stress two things the Senator from South Carolina has said \nbecause it is very relevant to the attempt to give special status to \nAmericans deemed to be enemy combatants in the contravention of \nexisting U.S. Supreme Court rulings that say if you are an American and \nyou are found to have joined the enemy, then you can be treated as an \nenemy combatant, which common sense tells you is what you are.\n  Here is what I want to say, and this is important to what we are here \nfor. There are two kinds of due process that are put into the bill, the \nunderlying language and the compromise that has been adopted on the \ntreatment of detainees. One, for the first time there is a judicial \nprocess to determine the status of the detainee, whether evidence shows \nthat the detainee should, in fact, be treated as an enemy combatant. \nThe second is that while the enemy combatant is subject to indefinite \nincarceration, that indefinite incarceration is subject to annual \nreview now. So we can determine, according to a stated series of \nstandards, whether that person----\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Wouldn't the Senator agree that under domestic criminal \nlaw, that indefinite ability to question about enemy activity doesn't \nexist?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. That is absolutely right. The Senator stated earlier--\nand it is an important point--this is the danger we get into as we \nstart to treat people who are terrorists as common criminals, or even \nuncommon criminals, which is that the criminal law aims at imposing a \npenalty, doing justice, incarcerating somebody as a result. The law of \nwar is aimed at making sure that enemy combatants, prisoners of war, \nare taken off the battlefield----\n  Mr. GRAHAM. And to my colleagues----\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Until the war is over.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I acknowledged in the Christmas Day Bomber case, in the \nTimes Square attempted bombing, that they were put in Federal court. I \nam okay with that. I do believe in the ``all of the above'' approach. \nOur Federal courts can handle cases involving transnational terrorists \nand al-Qaida members and so can military commissions. The idea of \nreading somebody their Miranda rights may be the best interrogation \ntechnique. I know that we were able to get some good information after \nreading Miranda rights.\n  I guess the point I am trying to make is I acknowledge that the \npeople doing the interrogation are better suited to make that decision \nthan I am. I just don't want the Congress by legislation to say for the \nfirst time in the history of the country in this war--unlike any other \nwar you no longer have it available to you, the U.S. Government, the \nability to hold somebody as an enemy combatant if you believe that is \nthe best way to gather intelligence. I am not saying the other system \ncannot be used. Let's leave it up to the professionals.\n  But the Senate is suggesting through the legislation being proposed \nthat the idea of holding an American citizen who is suspected of \ncollaborating with al-Qaida that they can no longer be held as an enemy \ncombatant is not only changing the law, it is taking off the table a \ntool that I think we need now more than ever. I don't want us to lose \nsight of the fact of what we are doing here and what it would mean to \nour country and our ability to defend us. No one in World War II would \nhave tolerated the idea that someone who collaborated with a Nazi \ntrying to kill us on our own soil would have any other disposition than \nto be considered an enemy of the American people.\n  My question for this body is: Do you think al-Qaida is an \norganization that doesn't present that same kind of threat? Is it the \nSenate's desire to say during these times that an American citizen can \ncollaborate with al-Qaida to kill us on our own soil and that is no \nlonger considered an act of war? I would argue that that would be one \nof the most irresponsible decisions ever made in a time of war by an \nelected body. It not only would change the law as we know it, it would \ncreate an opportunity and a hole in our defenses at\n\n[[Page S8056]]\n\na time when, as the Senator has indicated, the threat is growing.\n  I say to Senator Lieberman, thank you for being a steady, stern, \nconsistent voice along the line that since 9/11 our Nation has been in \nan undeclared state of war. The enemy still roams the globe. They have \nas their hope and dream hitting us again here at home. And, for God's \nsake, let's not weaken our defenses in a way that no other Congress has \never chosen to weaken the executive branch in the past. I thank the \nSenator for his service.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend from South Carolina for his \nexpertise in this area and also his sense of principle. We have \ncolleagues on the floor who want to speak. I want to say a final word. \nI know the Senator from South Carolina is particularly worried about \npending amendments that would alter the way in which the underlying \nbill now treats enemy combatants who are citizens of the United States.\n  The underlying provision in the bill on detainee treatment fills a \ngap in our law that has been harmful and difficult for our military to \ndeal with because there is no law about how to treat detainees. Senator \nGraham worked very closely with Senator Levin and Senator McCain to \ndraft this compromise, and it is a good compromise. As he knows, if I \nhad my preference, there would be no waiver in this because I believe \nanybody who is an enemy combatant is an enemy combatant and as a matter \nof principle ought to be held in military custody and tried by a \nmilitary tribunal according to all the protocols of the Geneva \nConventions, according to the Military Code of Justice.\n  Incidentally, if these tribunals are good enough for American men and \nwomen in the military who face charges, they ought to be good enough \nfor enemy combatants who face charges.\n  But here is my point: The Levin-McCain-Graham provision in this bill \non detainees is a compromise. It is a reasonable, effective, bipartisan \ncompromise. It is the kind of compromise that doesn't happen here \nenough, and so I support it because even though I might have wished it \nwould have gone further, so to speak, it is a lot better than the \nstatus quo. And I say that at this moment because I urge our colleagues \nwho now want to come in with other amendments, to essentially undo this \nbipartisan compromise can do great damage. I am saying myself, yes, I \nwish it had not given the President the power to waive that he has \nunder the bill and take somebody who is an enemy combatant to a normal \narticle III Federal court, but this provision is a real step forward \nfrom the status quo, and I think if we can say that, then we ought to \nsupport it. So I hope our colleagues will think twice before trying to \nundo the compromise, and that if they do go forward with it, that our \ncolleagues on the floor will defeat those amendments.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I will wrap this up. I know we have \ncolleagues who want to speak. Let me reiterate what Senator Lieberman \nsaid. There is a stream of thought that every member of al-Qaida, \nAmerican citizen or not, is an enemy of the people of the United States \nin a military sense, not a criminal sense, and they should be in a \nmilitary tribunal. That is the way we have handled most cases in the \npast.\n  Here is what I believe: I believe that the choice of venue should lie \nwith the executive branch, and I think there is a very robust role for \narticle III courts. So I don't want to say from a congressional point \nof view that every member of al-Qaida has to be tried by a military \ncommission all the time, because, quite frankly, sometimes article III \ncourts could be the better venue. When it comes to telling the \nexecutive branch that you have to put a noncitizen in military custody \ninside the United States, I think that is the right way to do it, but I \ndon't know enough, so if there is a reason to waive that provision, the \nexperts can waive it.\n  I have been very cautious about micromanaging the executive branch \nbecause they are the ones fighting the war. We have a role to play, we \nhave a voice to be heard, and here is what I am urging some my \ncolleagues. This compromise is not what some of our friends wanted, \nsuch as Senator Lieberman and, quite frankly, it is not what the ACLU \nwants, because they don't buy into the idea that al-Qaida operatives \nare anything other than common criminals. So you have two poles here. I \nbelieve an al-Qaida operative is not a common criminal, and if an \nAmerican citizen joins al-Qaida they should be treated as an enemy \ncombatant as one possibility. But if you want to go down the other \nroad, you can go down that road. I just don't want us to take off the \ntable, for the first time in the history of America, that an American \ncitizen trying to help the enemy kill us here at home somehow can no \nlonger be talked to by our military to gather intelligence. That is a \ncrazy outcome.\n  I think we have a good bill that gives maximum flexibility to the \nexecutive branch but preserves the tools we are going to need now and \ninto the future. And to my colleagues, please ask yourself: If in World \nWar II we could hold an American citizen who tried to help the Nazis \nblow up America as an enemy combatant, why wouldn't you want to help \nhold an American citizen who is helping al-Qaida--which did more damage \nto the homeland than the Nazis--as an enemy combatant? Why would you \nwant to take off the table the ability to hold that person, humanely \ninterrogate them to find out why they joined, who they talked to and \nwhat they know? Because what they know and who they talked to may save \nthousands of lives. For us to say you cannot do that for the first time \nin the history of the country would be a colossal mistake.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The Senator from Kansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/30/senate-section/article/S8056-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8056-S8057]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         COMMUNITIES FIRST ACT\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I am here to speak on another topic, but it \nhas been my privilege to hear the discussion between the Senator from \nSouth Carolina, Mr. Graham, and the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. \nLieberman, about what I think is a very serious debate; that is, the \njuxtaposition of our constitutional rights as U.S. citizens in light of \nour desire to make sure Americans' lives are protected. I have always \nstruggled with trying to find that right balance, and I found tonight's \nconversation on the Senate floor very valuable.\n  I wish to turn my attention and bring to the attention of my \ncolleagues in the Senate a pending piece of legislation, a bill I have \nintroduced dealing with our country's economy and particularly as it \nrelates to financial institutions and particularly our community banks.\n  There are, as we know, so many Americans who are looking for work. I \nwould say our government's first priority is to defend our country, and \nwe have been having a debate about how we do that, but we also have a \nsignificant responsibility to create an environment where businesses \ncan grow and put people to work. I want to point out tonight a piece of \nlegislation I have introduced that I believe is part of the solution. \nIt is called the Communities First Act, and it is a compilation of what \nI would say are commonsense tax and regulatory relief ideas for our \nNation's smallest financial institutions.\n  We constantly hear about Wall Street. I want to worry tonight about \nMain Street. These banks in communities across Kansas and in States \nacross our country were not the cause of the financial crisis from \nwhich we are still struggling to emerge, but unfortunately they have \nbecome the victims. They have become casualties of the crisis on Wall \nStreet. Hundreds of community banks have been allowed to fail, and the \nsurvivors are left waiting for the next burdensome regulation to come \nfrom Washington, DC.\n  Until banks are willing and able to make prudent loans to \ncreditworthy hometown customers, job creation will remain stifled and \nour economic recovery will continue to lag.\n  The evidence seems clear to me that the current regulatory \nrequirements impose a disproportionate burden on community banks \nbecause they do not operate on the scale to spread the legal and \ncompliance costs. When a bank with, say, just 40 employees requires 4 \ncompliance experts, I believe something is terribly wrong.\n  This expensive overregulation diminishes the ability of a community \nbank to attract capital and to support the credit needs of customers. \nWhat that means is that someone who wants to be\n\n[[Page S8057]]\n\na stockholder or the owner of a community bank, because regulatory \nrequirements increase the cost of capital, will decide there is a \ndifferent way to earn a living, a different place to invest that \ncapital. So, in short, these burdens prevent a community bank from \nserving the community, and they avoid, therefore, the resulting job \ncreation that comes when a community bank invests at home.\n  All of the regulations being piled on community banks might be \njustified if the failure of a community bank could pose a serious risk \nto our Nation's financial system, but that is clearly not the case. It \nwas not the failure of several hundred community banks that left our \neconomy in such poor condition; it was the financial condition of a \nhandful of the largest firms in America that grew so large and so \ncomplex that their failure or bankruptcy could not be tolerated and the \nconsequences would affect every American. We need a tailored approach \nto regulation.\n  Ross Wilson, one of my constituents in LaCrosse, KS, a banker, wrote \nto me. He says his bank will no longer make home loans, real estate \nloans. This is his quote:\n\n       As a community banker, I really hate this decision, but the \n     complexity of the new regulations have forced us to make this \n     decision. It appears that the powers that be in Washington \n     don't understand the importance of a small community bank.\n\n  When your hometown bank won't make a home loan to one of its \ncustomers not because the loan won't be repaid but because the \nregulatory costs are far too significant, our regulations have far \nexceeded their value.\n  How does the Communities First Act that I have introduced change this \ntrend and restore some level of sanity to our financial regulations? \nThis bill would strip away outdated and unnecessary regulations, such \nas the Gramm-Leach-Bliley annual privacy notice requirement. Under \ncurrent law, every bank and credit union is required to disclose their \nprivacy policies on an annual basis even if that bank's policy has \nnever changed during the year. So you can have a customer of a bank who \nhas been a customer forever, and the bank has a policy in place that \nnever changes, but every year the bank has to send out a significant \nmailing to every customer explaining their policy in regard to privacy. \nWhile that burden maybe doesn't sound too significant, it is a costly \nrequirement of questionable benefit.\n  Blake Heid of the First Option Bank in Paola, KS, tells me:\n\n       Very little of what the regulations have us do is \n     productive or helps us take care of our customers better. \n     Just the privacy notices alone cost our small bank in excess \n     of $13,000 annually. We haven't changed it . . . we never \n     sold our customer information, and we still don't.\n\n  The Communities First Act would also address an issue regarding SEC \nregistration by community banks. The number of shareholders which \ntriggers a registration has not been updated in a long time and remains \na burden that discourages community bankers from raising capital and \nmaking loans.\n  The Communities First Act would also reform which banks are required \nto comply with the costly burdens of Sarbanes-Oxley. Current law \nexempts banks with market capitalizations under $75 million from \ncompliance under section 404. The benefits of that section do not \nappear to be worth the cost, so my legislation raises that threshold.\n  Another commonsense provision would encourage Americans to save by \nreducing the tax on longer term certificates of deposit. It would also \nallow for individuals under the age of 26 to invest in Roth IRAs \nwithout regard to their income level. We desperately need Americans to \nsave money for their long-term retirement benefits.\n  The Communities First Act would also reform the new Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau so that the National Credit Union \nAdministration, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve, and the other regulators \nwould have a meaningful role in the creation of consumer protection \nrules. Dodd-Frank provides these regulators insufficient input, and \nreview of the CFPB and the results of poorly written regulations could \nmean less credit and, again, fewer jobs.\n\n  There seems to be some disagreement here in Washington, DC, today \nabout the effects of burdensome regulations on our economic recovery. \nBut back in Kansas, Jay Kennedy of the First National Bank of Frankfurt \nindicates:\n\n       Our staff of 7\\1/2\\ people are busy taking care of our \n     customers and serving our communities. The extra burden from \n     things like tracking escrow payments, sending privacy \n     notices, and filing call reports that take a month to \n     complete all create undue stress and busy work for us.\n\n  Kansans don't know what the words ``busy work'' mean.\n\n       The relief of those three things alone would allow us time \n     to teach financial literacy that our schools can no longer \n     afford to do and create new products to better serve our \n     customers.\n\n  The provisions of the Communities First Act are just a first step in \nunleashing the ability of small banks to do what they do best--provide \ncapital that results in jobs.\n  Congress has created a regulatory monster, and I urge my colleagues \nto join me in removing unnecessary burdens from our financial system \nand cosponsor S. 1600, the Communities First Act. While this \nlegislation may directly benefit our Nation's community banks--our \nsmall financial institutions--the real beneficiaries are the \nentrepreneurs, the Main Street small business men and women, and \nfarmers and ranchers who, with access to credit, can help put Americans \nback to work.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have come to the floor this evening to \ncongratulate the president of the International Association of \nMachinists union, Tom Buffenbarger, and Boeing's CEO, Jim McNerney, on \ntheir agreement today to extend their current contract for 4 years. \nThis is a good deal. It reflects a strong and commendable commitment by \nBoeing to continue having their top-quality products made by top-\nquality workers. It provides real job security and fair treatment for \nthe company's valued employees. It will also resolve the current labor \ndispute between the company and the union that is pending before the \nNational Labor Relations Board. This settlement is a step forward for a \ngreat company--Boeing--a step forward for a great union--the machinists \nunion--and a step forward for our great Nation. Again, I commend the \nCEO of Boeing, Mr. Jim McNerney, and the president of the machinists \nunion, Tom Buffenbarger, for working out this agreement.\n  This agreement is also a compelling demonstration of the fact that \nthe NLRB--the National Labor Relations Board--process works for all \nconcerned. When an alleged unlawful activity happens, a charge is filed \nwith the NLRB. That is what is supposed to happen. While the NLRB's \nprocess was playing out, the parties were able to sit down, negotiate, \nand strike a deal, which they announced today. As a matter of fact, \nthat is what happens to most unfair labor practice charges filed at the \nNLRB. It is all a part of the process at that independent agency. Just \nas in our court system, cases settle to the benefit of both parties. \nThat is what happened here. It also settled to the benefit of our \nNation.\n  What should not have happened was the unprecedented level of \npolitical and congressional interference in this case. It wasn't just \nthat Republican elected officials attempted to try this case in the \npress, they went far beyond that. House Republicans attempted to \neliminate the board's funding entirely because of this case. Senate \nRepublicans have blocked the nominees for the board and the General \nCounsel of the NLRB. House Republicans tried to subpoena the \nprosecutor's case file so they could obtain documents that the company \nhad been unable to obtain in the litigation. A Member of this body \ncalled the NLRB Acting General Counsel, Mr. Lafe Solomon--an \nindependent prosecutor and a 30-year career veteran of the agency, not \na political appointee--a Member of this body called him and threatened \nto come after Mr. Solomon ``guns ablazing'' if he brought charges \nagainst Boeing. I am informed that the House Oversight Committee \nactually threatened to try to revoke the bar licenses--the bar \nlicenses--of\n\n[[Page S8058]]\n\nindividual career attorneys at the National Labor Relations Board \nbecause of this case.\n  I have never, in all my years in public office, seen such a brazen \nand inappropriate interference with the business of an independent \nagency, and I hope to never see it again. The time and attention that \nHouse Republicans have devoted to their attack campaign against the \nNational Labor Relations Board is nothing short of astonishing.\n  What is even more absurd and shameless is the fact that they claim \nthis attack campaign was intended to save jobs. What saved jobs was the \nnegotiations between the great company, Boeing, and the great union, \nthe machinists union. That is what saved the jobs.\n  I am mystified by the suggestion by some Republicans that gutting the \nNLRB would somehow revive our economy. In survey after survey, business \nleaders agree about what is hurting the economy. It is not government. \nIt is not regulation. It is not the NLRB. It is the lack of consumer \ndemand. Workers don't have enough money to buy things, and the economy \nwon't pick up until they do. Weakening workers' rights and taking away \ntheir ability to speak up for fair treatment will only make the problem \nworse.\n  Attacking American workers and the agency that protects them is a \npoor substitute for a real job-creation strategy. Americans know that \nthe National Labor Relations Board is not remotely responsible for our \ncountry's economic woes. Incapacitating this agency will not put food \non people's tables, help them keep their homes, find jobs, or send \ntheir kids to college. It will, however, send a strong message to those \nfew--few--unscrupulous employers who want to take advantage of this bad \neconomy to mistreat hard-working people. Fortunately, that is not the \ncase with Boeing. Without the NLRB, there would be no watchdog, and it \nwould be open season on workers' rights. At a time when decent jobs, \ngood wages, and fair treatment are getting harder and harder to find, \nthis would be a step in the wrong direction for our country.\n  The National Labor Relations Board is an independent Federal agency \ncharged with an important mission. In fulfilling that mission, the \ndedicated professionals at the board are doing their jobs as the law \nintended.\n  Now it is time for the Republicans in the House and the Senate to do \nthe same. Instead of continuing to pursue this pointless and \ndistracting partisan crusade to dismantle and do away with the National \nLabor Relations Board, it is time to put this episode behind us. It is \ntime to recognize the NLRB is doing its job, that companies and unions \nwill sit down and work things out and settle things out without the \nSenate and the House and Governors--and Governors--of other States \ntrying to interfere and make it a political football.\n  Again, I congratulate the Boeing Company and the International \nAssociation of Machinists in doing what is best for America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank you for the opportunity to spend a \nfew minutes here on the Senate floor. And I want to thank the previous \nspeaker, Senator Moran from Kansas, for his timely comments, \nspecifically regarding housing, the ability for small institutions, \ncommunity banks to be able to produce the capital they need to help \nthese small businesses and these homeowners, but, specifically, for the \nability to create jobs. It dovetails into what I want to talk about \ntoday; that is, solutions, solutions for the American people.\n  This week, Congress has an opportunity to come together to help hard-\nworking Americans, those taxpayers, and extend the payroll tax cut \nholiday. No State needs Congress to put aside political bickering more \nthan the great State of Nevada.\n  Right now, as a percentage, more Nevadans are looking for jobs than \nin any other State. Right now, more Nevadans are having difficulty \nholding on to their homes than in any other State. And right now, more \nNevadans are filing for bankruptcy than in any other State.\n  There was a report released yesterday that named Nevada the toughest \nplace in the country to find a job.\n  Our No. 1 priority in this Congress should be to turn this economy \naround and get people working again. Yet here I am standing on the U.S. \nSenate floor today trying to convince the majority not to raise taxes \non small businesses.\n  I am proud of my State. I am confident that, with the right policies \nin place, Nevadans can find job opportunities and overcome these \ndifficult times. But in order for that to happen, Congress must put \npartisanship aside and come together to pass meaningful legislation \nthat benefits Americans who need help in this tough economy and expand \nopportunities for employers looking to hire.\n  Extending the payroll tax cut will allow Americans to hold on to \nwages they worked hard to earn. Under my plan, hard-working American \ntaxpayers will not see a tax increase. Under my plan, we will prevent a \ntax increase on those already receiving the payroll tax credit. And \nunder my plan, employers can continue to invest in their businesses, so \nthey can grow, expand, and hire more workers without the fear of a tax \nincrease.\n  Americans need jobs desperately. Congress should be focused on \npolicies that create jobs and drive long-term economic growth. The \nlegislation I have proposed allows Congress to responsibly extend the \npayroll tax cut and treat taxpayers' dollars appropriately.\n  There is no question Congress should extend the payroll tax cut. \nRepublicans, Democrats, Independents, everyone agrees on that. But we \nshould not do it by turning around and raising taxes on employers \neverywhere.\n  Nevadans are looking for jobs. Increasing taxes on small businesses \nin Nevada is bad economic policy, and taking away the capital they \ncould use to invest makes little sense.\n  Rather than finding a solution for hard-working Americans, the \nmajority has chosen to go down a path that is engineered purposely to \nfail. They know there is little chance a tax increase on hard-working \nAmerican taxpayers and their businesses will pass the Senate, and they \nknow there is no chance their tax increase will pass in the House. So \ninstead of success and reaching bipartisan agreement, the majority has \nchosen to focus on failure and scoring political points.\n  Honestly, these are the games the American people are tired of: the \n``my way or the highway'' mentality, proposals that have no chance for \nsuccess, bickering at the expense of our economy.\n  We have a divided Congress. That means to ensure 160 million \nAmericans receive an extension of this tax cut, we need to move beyond \npetty politics of this majority.\n  As a Senator from the State that is leading the Nation in \nunemployment, I am particularly disturbed by this determination to play \nthe political game rather than focus on solutions that work for all \nAmericans.\n  With a little common sense, we can pay for the payroll tax cut \nwithout raising taxes on job creators, we can reduce government \nspending where it is no longer needed, and require the richest \nAmericans to pay higher premiums for Medicare. This will allow us to \nstrengthen and preserve Medicare for those Americans who rely on the \nprogram the most. And since my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle frequently talk about how the richest Americans should be doing \nmore, I believe this is an approach that both Democrats and Republicans \ncan support.\n  By voting for this alternative plan, Congress can put political \ngamesmanship aside and support a workable solution for all Americans. \nThe bipartisan veterans jobs bill, along with the 3-percent withholding \nbill Congress passed earlier this month, is proof that when Congress \nhas the will to work together, we can find a pathway forward.\n  My proposal provides Congress with another opportunity to break the \npolitical gridlock here in Washington, DC, and vote for a solution that \ncan pass Congress and be signed into law. I am hopeful Congress can \nwork together to extend the payroll tax cut and preserve opportunities \nfor job growth. It is past time Congress put aside politics and focused \non policies that work for Nevadans and all Americans already struggling \nin this difficult economic environment.\n\n[[Page S8059]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak in regard to the \nNational Defense Authorization Act, and in particular to certain \nsections of that bill which target a serious but often underaddressed \nproblem facing the men and women of our Armed Services. This is the \nissue of sexual assault.\n  I introduced this legislation on this issue in the spring with \nSenator Susan Collins, and I remain deeply concerned about the subject.\n  Many of our colleagues are aware that sexual assault is a persistent \nproblem within our Armed Forces. In fact, reports of trauma have risen \nin recent years.\n  In March, the Department of Defense put out its annual report on \nsexual assault in the military. According to the estimates, there were \nmore than 3,000 reports of sexual assault in the military last year. \nThat includes reports by both male and female victims, exposing attacks \nperpetrated both by and against members of our military. And those are \njust the reported attacks. Since the Department of Defense estimates \nthat only 13 percent of victims actually come forward, we can assume \nthe real number of sexual assaults is much higher--upwards of 19,000.\n  The Department of Veterans Affairs has reported similarly disturbing \nfigures: More than 20 percent of female servicemembers seen at VA \nmedical facilities say they were sexually assaulted or harassed during \ntheir service.\n  Let me make this clear. We know the vast majority of the men and \nwomen serving in our military would never be involved in a sexual \nassault. They have the toughest jobs out there. They are on the front \nlines every day. But when we have a problem, we cannot put our heads in \nthe sand and pretend it is not happening.\n\n  In 2008 alone, VA medical personnel reported nearly half a million \nencounters with veterans that focused on sexual assault and harassment. \nOur servicemembers are already dealing with the stress of battle. They \nare fighting two wars, and they are responding to other conflicts and \nneeds around the globe.\n  The idea that an American in uniform--who is out there on the front \nlines, serving our country--may also suffer the physical and emotional \ntrauma of sexual assault is simply unacceptable. It is also \nunacceptable that the records of that assault would be destroyed.\n  According to the VA, women who experience sexual assault or sexual \nharassment in the military have a 59-percent higher risk of developing \nmental health injuries.\n  Sexual trauma does not just hurt the victims. It can also take a huge \ntoll on the soldiers who serve by their sides. It has been shown to \nseverely undermine military cohesion, team morale, and overall force \neffectiveness.\n  The Department of Defense is well aware of this problem, and over the \nyears it has taken some positive steps to address it.\n  For example, the Pentagon has created positions for personnel \nspecially trained to handle reports of sexual trauma. It has improved \ncounseling services for victims. And it has implemented new training \nprocedures for commanders. But despite these important improvements, \nthe Defense Department continues to fall short in one very key area: \nensuring the lifelong preservation of victims' records from reports of \nsexual assault.\n  As a former prosecutor, I know firsthand how important it is to \npreserve the data connected to crimes like sexual assault. That is why \nI am so troubled by the gaps we have seen at the Defense Department.\n  As of now, there is no coordinated, cross-service policy for ensuring \nthe preservation of medical records and other information that is \nrelated to sexual assault. In this day and age, it seems a little \ncrazy. Some of the branches have 5 years; some of them have 10 years. \nThere is no policy, and many of these records are destroyed. These are \nrecords of sexual assault.\n  Across the board, these policies--or lack thereof--are bleak. In a \nsignificant number of cases of sexual assault, the data is destroyed \nwithin 1 year. It is simply shredded.\n  The problems this can cause for servicemembers are extensive. Within \n1 year, the servicemember loses the proof that he or she experienced a \nsexual assault connected to their military service.\n  As a prosecutor, if you have someone who is maybe accused of a \ncrime--or maybe no one followed through on it, and then later they go \non and they commit an actual crime and there is a trial--you want to be \nable to access the records from the past.\n  Also, for the individual victim, it means they no longer have access \nto the evidence necessary for pursuing criminal action against their \nperpetrator.\n  It also means if the victim experiences depression or any other \nailment, either mental or physical, relating to the assault, they may \nnot be able to prove it was caused during their service, meaning they \nwill not be able to seek VA disability benefits.\n  There are far too many examples of this out there--of servicemembers \nbeing denied compensation from the VA for disabilities caused by \nmilitary sexual assault. There are far too many examples of \nservicemembers who have been told to ``find a witness.'' And when there \nare no witnesses, they have been told to ``get their attackers to \nattest to the assault.'' This is not the way we should be treating our \nservicemembers.\n  This year, my office was contacted by a group of Minnesota women \nveterans--veterans of all ages--who have bonded together to share their \nstories of sexual assault and to advocate for stronger protections from \nthe Department of Defense and the VA.\n  These women signed up to serve. They performed well and honorably. \nAnd if in the course of their service, they experience an assault--an \nassault that would not have been experienced if they had not \nvolunteered--then we owe them the basic decency of keeping their \nrecords. That is all we are talking about here.\n  We have appreciated that the Department of Defense is open to it, \nthat the leaders of this bill are working with us on this issue.\n  I originally introduced this bill with Senator Collins, Senator \nMurkowski, and Senator McCaskill. We were able to get 23 cosponsors on \nthis bill, including every single woman in the U.S. Senate.\n  The Support for Survivors Act also is endorsed by several key \nveterans service organizations, including the American Legion, the \nVeterans of Foreign Wars, the Disabled American Veterans, and the Iraq \nand Afghanistan Veterans of America, as well as the Servicewomen's \nAction Network.\n  The Support for Survivors Act is straightforward. Quite simply, it \nrequires the Department of Defense to ensure lifelong storage of all \ndocuments connected with reports of sexual assault and sexual \nharassment in the military, while also maintaining full privacy for \nthose involved.\n  Likewise, the purpose and motivation of this legislation is also \npretty simple. It is about supporting our veterans.\n  I have always believed that when we ask men and women to sacrifice \nfor us in defense of our Nation, we make them a promise that we are \ngoing to give them the support when they come home. As Abraham Lincoln \nsaid: We need to care for those who have borne the battle.\n  Well, protecting our servicemembers' personal records, protecting \ntheir rights is just about that. This week, Senators are considering a \ncritically important bill, the National Defense Authorization Act. I am \nhappy to say this year the Defense authorization bill already includes \na significant majority of the provisions of my Support for Survivors \nAct.\n  This summer, the Senate Armed Services Committee saw fit to address \nthe issue of military sexual assault during its markup of the bill. I \nam grateful for the time and effort my colleagues have invested in \nreviewing this issue. Already, the National Defense Authorization Act \nrequires the Department of Defense to collaborate with the Department \nof Veterans Affairs in developing a comprehensive policy for ensuring \nretention and access to sexual assault records.\n  Importantly, the bill ensures protection of the privacy of the \nrecords. It\n\n[[Page S8060]]\n\nalso calls on the Defense Department and the VA to address access to \nthe records not only for victims but also to the VA, law enforcement, \nand other entities that may need to access them. The bill also seeks to \nmake the policy uniform across all service branches so members of the \nAir Force, the Army, the Navy, and the Marines are given fair \ntreatment.\n  Why would you have records destroyed of sexual assault in one branch \nafter a year and another branch after 5 years and another after 10 \nyears? It is my position they should not be destroyed at all. The one \nprovision which was not included in the Defense Authorization Act, \nwhich I believe is vitally important, was the requirement that records \nbe stored throughout the life of the victim. Storing records for a \nperson's lifetime is, in my mind, common sense. All other critical \nrecords, such as our health records, insurance records, banking records \nare stored throughout our lives. So I believe the case should be the \nsame here. Unfortunately, the Defense Authorization Act does not \nrequire lifelong storage. Instead it put this question entirely in the \nhands of the Defense Department, requiring only that the records be \nstored for 5 years and otherwise allowing the agency to determine its \nown timing.\n  Five years is not enough. Yes, it is five times the length of time \nthe records are currently stored, and in that respect it is a good \nstep. But it is not enough, not in a modern day where we store records \nand we have ways of storing records in a way--and certainly the Defense \nDepartment knows how to store these records--that is private.\n  That is why I have filed an amendment that would ensure that almost \nall sexual assault records are stored for an estimated 50 years. This \nsolution is one that I have discussed personally with Senator Levin. It \nis also something my office has worked on closely with the Department \nof Defense. Although 50 years is not necessarily the life of the \nvictim, it gets us a long way and is certainly better than what we have \nnow.\n  I thank Chairman Levin for his willingness to work with me on this \nimportant issue and for his efforts to include this amendment in the \noverall bill. I also thank the Republicans, the other side of the \naisle, for working with us and the fact that this was a bipartisan \namendment from the beginning. Again, the sponsorship on the underlying \nbill included the sponsorship of all women Senators in the Senate.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment as well as the strong \nprovisions in this bill that address sexual assault protections for \nmilitary members. The problems with sexual trauma within the military \nare broad. But the provisions included in the bill, including my \namendment, are important advancements. I intend to monitor the Defense \nDepartment's implementation of these provisions. Although I was not \nable to secure the full lifelong record preservation, I am going to \nkeep fighting this fight. But 50 years for most of the records is a \npretty good result given what we have in place right now.\n  This year, the Department of Defense has finally placed a military \nofficer in charge of its Sexual Assault Protection and Responsive \nOffice, GEN Mary Kay Hertog. I believe she has not only a good grasp on \nthe importance of preserving records but also the rank and weight \nnecessary to forge real change in the Department's policy.\n  I intend to continue my communication with General Hertog, and I look \nforward to finding a policy that ensures that victims have lifelong \naccess to their personal records. When our men and women signed up to \nserve there was not a line, and there should not be a line when they \nget back--not for jobs, not for education, and not to receive the \nmedical benefits or health protection they have earned.\n  I see my colleagues, the leaders on this bill, Senator Levin and \nSenator McCain, are here. I again thank them for working with me on \nthis amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota for her \nstrong efforts on behalf of the men and women in the military and their \nwelfare and benefits. She is an advocate and a person who is committed \nto making sure that not only those who are now serving but those who \nhave are cared for by our society and by our military and our veterans \nfacilities.\n  So I thank the Senator. I appreciate the very eloquent statement she \njust made.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/30/senate-section/article/S8060-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8060-S8062]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2012--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the amendment is to require the Secretary \nof Defense to consult with the Armed Services Committee in \ncommissioning an independent assessment of U.S. security interests in \nEast Asia and in the Pacific region. It has been cleared on both sides. \nI urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is modified.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Before the amendment is adopted, I just wanted to indicate \nour support of the amendment. It is in a very significant area which \nhas to do with our force structure in the Pacific. Senator McCain has \nbeen very active wanting to look at that because we have to look at it \nin depth. He has agreed that this study, which will be done in \nconsultation with people who have knowledge, can be done independently \nand in a prompt way with an independent study.\n  I think he has reached that conclusion. I think he is right. I \nbelieve Senator Webb, if he were here, would want to indicate his \nstrong support because the three of us have worked together for this \nkind of an effort.\n  With that, I would indicate my strong support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment, \nas modified.\n  The amendment (No. 1246), as modified, was agreed to, as follows:\n\n       On page 439, line 18, insert ``, in consultation with the \n     Chairman and Ranking Members of the Committees on Armed \n     Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives,'' \n     after ``Secretary of Defense''.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would ask my friend, the chairman, if \nperhaps we could give our colleagues a brief update on where we are. \nThere are not that many amendments remaining. There are a couple of \nrather serious amendments concerning detainees that are still \noutstanding. But overall I think we can tell our colleagues that we are \npretty well moving along.\n  We still have a pending package of amendments that have been agreed \nto by both sides that, unfortunately, we are unable to move forward. \nBut, hopefully, we will be able to do that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we indeed have been making progress, No. 1. \nWe made significant progress today both on the pending amendments that \nneeded to be addressed by the full Senate, as well as a major package \nof amendments which has been cleared on both sides.\n  There is another package of amendments to which there has been no--\nthey have been cleared, which means they are available to everybody, \nand\n\n[[Page S8061]]\n\nthere is no objection by anybody to the substance of those amendments. \nIf there is any objection, then they are not going to be cleared. They \nwould then have to be brought up to the whole body.\n  Tomorrow we have a number of significant amendments to address, \nincluding the Feinstein amendments, the Menendez-Kirk amendment on Iran \nsanctions, just being a few of them. But there are a number of other \nones as well. In a moment, what I am going to be asking for is \nunanimous consent that when we come in tomorrow the first amendment \npending be my amendment, No. 1293, on high-speed ferries, which \napparently will require a rollcall vote.\n  So I just want to alert everybody that while we are preparing a \nunanimous consent agreement laying out what the order will be for \ntomorrow, what we will start with, that is our intention. I have talked \nalready, of course, to Senator McCain about that. He is agreeable that \nwe start with that amendment, No. 1293.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we think we can get wrapped up tomorrow. \nBut there are serious amendments remaining. The Menendez-Kirk amendment \nis a very serious amendment and one that probably is going to deserve \nsome debate time as well as the Feinstein amendment. The Sessions \namendment also is one as well. So I think our colleagues should be \nprepared for a pretty interesting day tomorrow.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1185, as Modified\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my \namendment No. 1185 be modified with the changes at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. This amendment would simply require the Department of \nDefense to include the discussion of the feasibility and advisability \nof establishing a missile defense site on the east coast of the United \nStates in its Homeland Defense Hedging Strategy Review.\n  I hope my amendment can be accepted by voice vote. I thank Senator \nLevin and Senator McCain for working with me to get language I believe \nall can agree to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Sessions amendment, as modified, has \nbeen reviewed. I know it has cleared on this side. I am confident it \nhas been cleared by both sides of the aisle.\n  The amendment would require the Department of Defense to report to \nCongress on the findings and conclusions of the Department's Homeland \nMissile Defense Hedging Strategy Review, including a discussion of the \nfeasibility and advisability of establishing a missile defense site on \nthe east coast of the United States.\n  The administration officials have committed to providing Congress \nwith the results of its Hedging Strategy Review. This amendment would \nmake it clear that the Department is required to do exactly that, and I \njust want to thank the Senator for his amendment, for modifying it, and \nI hope now we can adopt it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment, \nas modified.\n  The amendment (No. 1185), as modified, was agreed to, as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle C of title II, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 234. REPORT ON THE UNITED STATES MISSILE DEFENSE HEDGING \n                   STRATEGY.\n\n       (a) Report Required.--Not later than 180 days after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense \n     shall submit to the congressional defense committees a report \n     setting forth the findings and conclusions of the homeland \n     missile defense hedging strategy review, including a \n     discussion of the feasibility and advisability of \n     establishing a missile defense site on the East Coast of the \n     United States.\n       (b) Form.--The report required by subsection (a) shall be \n     submitted in unclassified form, but may include a classified \n     annex.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Now I believe we have one other, Senator Inhofe's \namendment, which now I think is agreeable on both sides.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1098, as Modified\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have amendment No. 1098, as modified. I \nask that it be considered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is modified.\n  The amendment (No. 1098), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle E of title VIII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 889. REPORT ON IMPACT OF FOREIGN BOYCOTTS ON THE DEFENSE \n                   INDUSTRIAL BASE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than October 1, 2012, the \n     Department of Defense shall submit to the appropriate \n     congressional committees a report setting forth an assessment \n     of the impact of foreign boycotts on the defense industrial \n     base.\n       (b) Element.--The report required by subsection (a) shall \n     include a summary of foreign boycotts that posed a material \n     risk to the defense industrial base from January 2008 to the \n     date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Foreign boycott.--The term ``foreign boycott'' means \n     any policy or practice adopted by a foreign government or \n     foreign business enterprise intended to penalize, \n     disadvantage, or harm any contractor or subcontractor of the \n     Department of Defense on account of the provision by that \n     contractor or subcontractor of any product or service to the \n     Department.\n       (2) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term \n     ``appropriate congressional committees'' means--\n       (A) the congressional defense committees; and\n       (B) the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and \n     the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of \n     Representatives.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Inhofe for the modification \nof his amendment. It is agreeable on our side.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I appreciate that. First of all, I don't \nrecall seeing the majority and minority working so closely together and \nin the right way for a while. Several of my amendments have been \naccepted. I think they agreed to this one. It directs DOD to have a \nreport on the effect of boycotts against our domestic contractors. It \nis modified, and I ask for its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to the amendment, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 1098), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I believe Senator Inhofe may wish to be \nrecognized to talk about another amendment or a couple amendments that \nhe has. We will not take any further action on those amendments now.\n  I think we are perhaps, hopefully, ready soon to offer a unanimous \nconsent on what I described a moment ago--how we will begin in the \nmorning. We will wait for that to be prepared.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have two amendments that I believe are \nvery significant. However, I don't believe they will clear, and that is \nthe reason I will not be bringing them up. But it is important we do \naddress the problems. The Military Leasing Act prohibits military \ninstallations from receiving any revenues from mineral exploration of \nthese lands. Exploration has taken place in Oklahoma and other places, \nwhere we have, with the new horizontal drilling, been able to get at \nsome of these reserves. The problem is that this incurs an expense by \nthe military operations. The one I am talking about right now happens \nto be the depot in McCallister, OK. Under the Mineral Leasing Act that \ngoverns oil and gas leasing on Federal lands, it gives the \nresponsibility to the Bureau of Land Management.\n  The problem is, we want to explore it and accommodate others who are \ngoing after these tremendous reserves and not just in Oklahoma but \nelsewhere. But there is not a mechanism by which they can be paid for \nexpenses incurred by the local installation. We are going to be working \non this and coming up with some kind of a solution. I will not be \noffering this as an amendment.\n  The second one I will not be offering is one that is very \nsignificant, which is treating what we refer to as the sub-S, or \nsubpart-S carriers, nonscheduled carriers, that are currently taking \nmateriel and personnel into areas such as Afghanistan. We have crew \nrest responsibilities, saying they cannot be--a\n\n[[Page S8062]]\n\ncrew cannot be working for more than 15 hours. The problem is this: 95 \npercent of the military personnel going into Afghanistan and some of \nthese other areas go in by subpart-S operators. They are exempt from \nthe crew rest. Right now, there is legislation that is pending that \nwould make them fall under the crew rest requirements.\n  Military can take them in, but military doesn't have the capacity. \nThat is why 40 percent of all materiel and 95 percent of personnel are \nbeing brought into these zones. As an example, if they are going from \nthe logical place, which would be in Germany to go into Afghanistan, \nthey would carry it in, but they would not be able to offload whatever \ncargo or personnel and then get back and go to Stuttgart or whatever \nlocation it is in Germany because that would exceed crew rest.\n  On the other hand, they are precluded from having civilian aircraft \nstaying in places such as Afghanistan. So there is no solution to it. \nWe want to address this. We are going to try to do it. We feel this \nwill not clear as it is now. So I will not be offering it tonight, but \nit is one I think is very significant.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n\n          Amendments Nos. 1094, 1095, 1096, and 1101 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wonder if while the Senator from Oklahoma \nis here--we are trying to get a current list of amendments. Is it his \nintent to withdraw amendment No. 1101 on C-12 aircraft?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I don't have that one with me. I would rather wait until \nI get the amendment. There is one other I will want to have passed--\nseveral amendments are on Guantanamo Bay detention. This is on long-\nterm, high-value detainees. It is my intention to offer that tomorrow.\n  I have currently four amendments that I will withdraw at this time so \nwe can unclog some of this.\n  I ask unanimous consent to withdraw amendments Nos. 1094, 1095, 1096 \nand 1101.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for \nhelping us to get our list of amendments whittled down to where we can \nhopefully have a manageable group for tomorrow. We are going to have a \nvery busy day tomorrow. We have a lot of amendments to address and \ndispose of. It is doable because we have had the cooperation of \nSenators. It is our goal--we must finish this by 6 o'clock.\n  Everybody has a right to a vote if their amendment is germane. We \nhope we will have a chance to debate all these amendments as well as \nvote on them. I believe we will be coming in at 9:30. That is the \ncurrent plan, and we will be back on the bill at 11. We have to start \noff immediately. I hope we will vote on my amendment within a few \nminutes after it is offered. There will be some debate in opposition to \nmy amendment, I understand.\n  Hopefully, the Senators who oppose it will be notified tonight that \nmy amendment is first up and we are going to be prepared to debate this \nat 11 o'clock.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate resumes \nconsideration of S. 1867, the Defense authorization bill, tomorrow, \nDecember 1, 2011, the pending amendment be the Levin amendment No. \n1293, relative to high-speed ferries.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, I \nthank the chairman for the progress we have made and also again point \nout that we have some very serious issues that deserve debate and \ndiscussion. But when cloture expires--the 30 hours--there will be an \nautomatic vote triggered at that time. We look forward to working with \nour colleagues to make sure they have sufficient time to debate the \namendments.\n  It would be regrettable, as important as some of these amendments \nare, that we back up to the expiration of the cloture time and that \nwould trigger an automatic vote. I am sure we will get the cooperation \nof all our colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/30/senate-section/article/S8062-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8062]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. President, I want to take a few moments to thank a \nremarkable woman on my staff. Sylvia Gillespie, in my Springfield \noffice, is retiring after 12 years. When you walk into that office in \nSpringfield, Sylvia is the first person you see, and her smile has made \nthousands of people feel welcome. Her heart is as warm as her smile.\n  Sylvia is from the South Side of Chicago. She likes to say, ``The \nsame as Michelle Obama.'' She went to Austin O. Sexton Elementary \nSchool on South Langley Avenue and grew up on the same streets where \nthat infamous street gang, the Blackstone Rangers, made a lot of \ntrouble. But she survived that experience and went on to make a life in \nthe service of others.\n  When she looks back at her life, Sylvia gets a little choked up and \nshe says, how did I go from being that little girl from the ghetto to \nworking for a Senator. Well, the answer is very simple. Sylvia \nGillespie cares about other people. She has helped countless people \nduring the 12 years she has worked in my office. From helping people \nget their passports so they wouldn't miss a family wedding in some \nforeign country to speaking on behalf of constituents who ran into \ntrouble with Federal agencies such as the Internal Revenue Service, \nSylvia has been such a positive force in the lives of so many people.\n  The work she is most proud of, and the one thing she will talk to you \nabout, is what she has been working on for the last 2 years--helping \nfamilies in Illinois stay in their homes. Sylvia has helped dozens of \nfamilies stay in their homes during the mortgage crisis when they \nthought they had lost everything through foreclosure. She would sit on \nconference calls with banks for hours at a time, refusing to take no \nfor an answer. You don't want to cross Sylvia Gillespie when she is \nfighting for someone she believes in.\n  Ask her why and she explains:\n\n       I just felt like we just couldn't lose one more home. If I \n     can prevent a family from losing their home by being on the \n     phone with the bank for 3 hours, I would do it.\n\n  And she would do it. Sometimes she would persevere long after the \nhomeowners had given up. In one particular case, a hardworking mom with \ntwo kids had done everything right.\n  She played by the bank's rules, but she was still only days away from \nwatching the home she loved be auctioned off, and she was ready to give \nup. But Sylvia wasn't. Sylvia asked:\n\n       Have you ever seen a mustard seed? That's all you need: \n     Faith the size of a mustard seed to get through this.\n\n  That was Sylvia. And after a long and grueling process, guess what. \nSylvia prevailed. The woman received her loan modification. With \nSylvia's help, that mother and her children will be spending this \nholiday season right where they want to be--in their own home.\n  That mom is just one of the many Illinoisans who are going to join me \nin being sad when Sylvia decides to retire.\n  When Sylvia is not working hard in my office, she spends a lot of \ntime at the Abundant Faith Christian Church. She loves that church. She \nhas invited me there on Sundays, and she really gets into it. She is a \nwoman of faith, and she is a great singer. She throws herself, heart \nand soul, into their services. Every Sunday morning she and a few \nothers cook up a breakfast for the community people who live near the\n\n[[Page S8063]]\n\nchurch. They serve the families of patients in a nearby hospital and \nhomeless people who come over from the neighborhood shelters.\n  Let me tell you another thing about Sylvia. She is a great cook and a \ngreat baker. If you ask anyone in my Springfield office, they will tell \nyou that her cookies and cakes are the best.\n  We have seen Sylvia dressed up in full regalia as a clown, which she \ndoes once a while to bring cheer and fun to parties and events in her \ncommunity. She is a happy person and it is a joy to be around her.\n  She also has a great talent for decorating. One of her last \nresponsibilities in my office, before her official last day before \nretirement, was setting up the Christmas decorations. Thanks to her, \nour office in Springfield is in full swing for the holidays.\n  We are going to miss Sylvia in our office. I speak for everyone there \nand countless people when I thank Sylvia for the outstanding 12 years \nof service she has dedicated to helping people in Illinois.\n  Sylvia is the mother of two beautiful grown daughters, Danette and \nGenaire. She is a proud grandmother of three grandchildren, ages 15, \n13, and 11. She now has to make the tough choice of which daughter she \nwill join and live with. They both want her. She has to decide whether \nto go with Danette in Portland, OR, or stay with Genaire in Davenport, \nIA. Whatever her choice, she told me there is one thing she wants to \nmake sure of--that she has a reservation for the ticket of Barack \nObama's second inaugural. She made the first, and she wants to be at \nthe second one too. I made that promise to her.\n  Wherever she goes, I know Sylvia Gillespie will continue to be an \ninspiration to everyone she meets, and will, as long as she lives, \nreach out a helping hand to people who need a little assistance, a \nlittle encouragement, and that great Sylvia Gillespie smile.\n  Sylvia, thanks for 12 years of wonderful service in our office in \nSpringfield. I wish you and your family the very best for many years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/30/senate-section/article/S8063-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8063]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO HELEN J. STEWART\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Helen J. Stewart, a \nbrave and extraordinary Nevadan who lived during the early days of Las \nVegas. On December 3, 2011, there will be a dedication of the statue \nerected in her honor at the Old Las Vegas Mormon Fort State Historic \nPark.\n  In 1882, Helen arrived in the Las Vegas Valley with her husband \nArchibald and their three young children. After her husband died of a \ngunshot wound in 1884, she managed their isolated ranch while caring \nfor five young children. A business-savvy woman, Helen sold 1,832 acres \nof the ranch to the railroad in 1902 for $55,000. This land became the \narea from which the City of Las Vegas developed.\n  Helen had a pioneering spirit, and she is considered to be the \n``First Lady of Las Vegas.'' Among her numerous accomplishments in the \ncommunity, she was the first Postmaster, the first woman to serve on a \nSchool District Board, and the first woman to serve on a jury. In \naddition, she was an advocate of women's rights, a charter member of \nthe Mesquite Club, one of the founders of the Christ Episcopal Church, \nand the president of the Las Vegas chapter of the Nevada Historical \nSociety.\n  Helen also developed strong friendships with the Southern Paiutes. \nThey were her neighbors and some were workers on her ranch. In 1911, \nshe deeded 10 acres of her land to the Federal Government for use as an \nIndian school. That land established what is now known as the Las Vegas \nIndian Colony for the Las Vegas Paiute Tribe.\n  I am pleased to stand today to recognize Helen's outstanding \nachievements. She was a remarkable mother, rancher, businesswoman, and \ncommunity leader, and she serves as an inspiration to us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/30/senate-section/article/S8063-2", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8063]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HOLD ON H.R. 3012\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to inform my colleagues that I am \nplacing a hold on H.R. 3012, the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants \nAct. This bill would eliminate the per-country numerical limitations \nfor employment-based visas and increase the numerical cap for family-\nbased immigrants.

MILLER\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I would like to recognize and honor the \nservice of Thomas H. Miller as he retires as the executive director of \nthe Blinded Veterans Association. Mr. Miller has been an outstanding \nservant to his country and an advocate for his fellow veterans. He is \ntruly an example of courage and perseverance. He has demonstrated \nthroughout his career that the blindness he sustained through combat \ninjuries does not impede his ability to have an impact here at home.\n  Mr. Miller served his country honorably in Vietnam and lost his \neyesight during a 1967 combat mission. He was honorably discharged a \nyear later and returned home to find limited resources for veterans \nsuffering from blindness. Following his own struggle to adjust to life \nat home, Mr. Miller dedicated himself to ensuring that all blinded \nveterans share in the resources, services, and support than can bring \nnew hope and opportunities.\n  As executive director of the Blinded Veterans Association, Mr. Miller \nhelped dramatically improve the lives of blinded veterans nationwide. \nIn 2006 he helped launch Operation Peer Support a program aimed at \nending the isolation suffered by many blinded veterans returning from \ncombat in Iraq and Afghanistan. This program provides veterans with \nvaluable information regarding rehabilitation, employment, and self-\nhelp activities. Most importantly, Operation Peer Support has provided \nmany blinded veterans with the opportunity to interact with one another \nand make lifelong friendships here at home.\n  Mr. Miller was also instrumental in raising awareness for blinded \nveterans. During his time with the Blinded Veterans Association, Mr. \nMiller worked with the Veterans Health Administration to improve care \nfor the vision impaired. He testified before the House Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs about the challenges facing blind veterans and served \nas the chair of the Federal Advisory Committee on Prosthetics and \nSpecial Disabilities Programs. In 17 years of leadership, the Blinded \nVeterans Association made vital contributions to legislation that has \ngreatly expanded benefits and services for vision impaired veterans.\n  Our Nation is fortunate to have veterans as selfless and dedicated as \nMr. Miller. While he could have allowed his combat injuries to slow his \ncareer, Mr. Miller instead saw his experience as an opportunity to help \nimprove the lives of thousands of his fellow veterans. He has given \nhonest and faithful service to his country and those wounded veterans \ntransitioning to life back at home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/30/senate-section/article/S8063-4", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8063-S8064]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          WALL STREET PROTESTS\n\n  Mr. LEE.

With \n     vague goals of combating corporate greed and calls to rectify \n     all manner of social and economic inequality, this movement \n     seems, to the press at least, to capture a mood of deep \n     discontent among the American people.\n       But if you think a thousand protesters on Wall Street is a \n     trouble sign for our nation, wait until you see the civil \n     unrest that follows the reforms and cuts to government \n     programs needed to bring our national debt under control. \n     Just look at Greece, where government is being reformed, \n     drastic cuts are being made--and the society is unraveling. \n     In Greece a series of severe austerity measures has been \n     imposed as conditions for recent bailouts by the \n     International Monetary Fund and the other members of the \n     single European currency, the euro. Yet the economy continues \n     to spiral downward.\n\n[[Page S8064]]\n\n       And with each new round of reforms in Greece, misery and \n     unrest are on the rise. Strikes and angry street protests are \n     a daily occurrence, as unions fight decreases in pay and \n     benefits for their workers, students protest the lack of \n     opportunity and ordinary citizens resist reforms and tax \n     increases. The confrontation with authorities is impeding \n     business and destroying tourism, deepening the crisis \n     further.\n       Some of that struggle is for naught. The Greek government \n     couldn't reduce austerity measures if it wanted to. Fiscal \n     policy is now out of its hands and likely to remain so for \n     decades, perhaps generations.\n       And while most Greeks agree the bloated state must be \n     streamlined, they're stiffening their resistance to reform. \n     That's why many in the euro zone believe Greece must default \n     in order to rebuild a more efficient government.\n       America isn't in that predicament--yet. But there are \n     cautionary lessons to be lifted from the outraged streets of \n     Athens. As the Greek example shows, government largesse is \n     easy to expand but difficult to cut back without inflaming \n     people.\n       For years our politicians have framed increases to \n     government benefits as compassionate and obligatory. Now all \n     that overspending must be pared back and government programs \n     reformed to curb the federal deficit. But each round of \n     needed cuts and reforms will likely cause misery--in an \n     amount substantially greater than the happiness generated by \n     spending increases.\n       Behavioral economics, which uses social and psychological \n     factors to predict a population's decision-making behavior, \n     captures this paradox in two fundamental principles.\n       First, the principle of ``loss aversion'' explains that \n     people hate to lose something more than they value receiving \n     something. So, even if many Americans don't value existing \n     government programs and spending very highly, they will \n     likely be very unhappy about the loss of those same goods and \n     services.\n       Second, even if you streamline our government and make \n     programs more efficient, the ``endowment effect'' predicts \n     that people will still oppose changes to the benefits they \n     receive. This is because people tend to value the goods and \n     services they have more than they do equivalent replacement \n     goods and services. The endowment effect makes it very \n     difficult to exchange existing benefits for new ones and thus \n     to ``reform'' government programs.\n       Whether we cut spending and make reforms now or later, \n     course correction will be difficult and even potentially \n     dangerous to our nation's stability. Just look at the \n     resistance of public employees in Wisconsin, Indiana and \n     elsewhere to relatively minor cuts to see how people will \n     contest vigorously any decreases to their benefits and \n     programs.\n       Behavioral economics teaches us that any time we make \n     changes and reduce government benefits and programs, we can \n     expect people to be very upset about those decisions--and \n     likely resist them. Still, we need significant reforms and \n     deep cuts to put the U.S. on track toward a balanced budget.\n       Paring back government will undoubtedly cause misery and \n     social dislocation. However, ``death'' by a thousand small \n     cuts will intensify civil unrest and may produce \n     revolutionary fervor unlike anything we've seen in America in \n     our lifetime. Our nation will be better off by reforming our \n     system radically, in a single dramatic turn, rather than \n     piecemeal--or face something very like the furious streets of \n     Athens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/30/senate-section/article/S8064-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8064-S8065]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      PREMATURITY AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, November is Prematurity Awareness \nMonth, but as the month comes to an end, our fight against preterm \nbirths and complications caused by prematurity continues daily in \nhospitals, homes, and research facilities across the country.\n  Each year in the United States, more than half a million babies are \nborn prematurely. More startling, over the last 25 years, the rate of \npreterm birth has increased more than 36 percent. Today, prematurity is \nthe leading cause of newborn death in the United States.\n  Additionally, a preterm baby is four times more likely to have at \nleast one medical condition, such as cerebral palsy and learning and \nbehavioral problems. And the life-long health complications caused by \npre-term birth also have a serious financial burden on the child and \nparent. A premature birth costs, on average, $51,000 in the first year \nalone; premature births cost our nation $26 billion annually. Yet, \ndespite the costs in lives lost and families burdened, medical research \nand innovation continues find new cures and therapies.\n  On the Federal level, beginning in 2003, the National Institutes of \nHealth (NIH) invested approximately $21 million in research for a \ndrug--progesterone or 17P--to prevent preterm birth. 17P was found to \nreduce preterm births by 37 percent in high-risk pregnancies, and \ncompounding pharmacists were able to provide compounded 17P to women \nfor a mere $10-$20 a dose. Earlier this year, however, a pharmaceutical \ncompany received exclusive rights to manufacture the drug and increased \nthe price by 14,900 percent to $1,500 a dose. But because of the \nadvocacy of Ohio's leading children's hospitals from Cleveland to \nCincinnati--because of the stories of pregnant women I met in airports \nand community halls, we raised the public's awareness to the \nastronomical price gauge and increased public demand against the \ncompany to reconsider its pricing. The company eventually reduced the \ncost of its branded version of 17P, Makena, from $1,500 a dose to \n$690--still significantly more expensive than the compounded version. \nGiven the public and Congressional outcry and the importance of the \nmedication to pregnant women and their babies, the Food and Drug \nAdministration (FDA) announced that compounding pharmacies would still \nable to offer women the more affordable version of 17P. Our work \ncontinues to make such a life-saving drug more affordable and available \nto millions of women who depend on it.\n  But despite the success of 17P in preventing preterm births, more \nneeds to be done. Every year March of Dimes grades each state on their \nrates of premature birth. While Ohio is improving, the current 12.3 \npercent premature birth rate--or 500,000 children annually--leaves Ohio \nwith a C grade. Fortunately, hospitals, patients groups, and public-\nprivate partnerships are working to reduce preterm births in Ohio.\n  In 2009, central Ohio's four hospital systems--Nationwide Children's \nHospital, The Ohio State University Medical Center, OhioHealth, and \nMount Carmel Health System--as well as the Columbus Public Health \nDepartment, Franklin County's Board of Commissioners, and non-profit \ngroups came together through Ohio Better Birth Outcomes (OBBO) to \nreduce the number of preterm births in Franklin County. OBBO's efforts \ninclude home nurse visits to low-income mothers from the 28th week of \ngestation through the child's second birthday and education and \ncounseling for mothers about ``safe spacing'' of pregnancies. By \nallowing their bodies at least 18 months to fully heal between \npregnancies, their subsequent pregnancies will be healthier. Through \nthis work, OBBO was able to increase gestation time by an average of \nsix weeks and two days. For each week a woman is able to carry her baby \nbetween 36 weeks and 39 weeks, the baby has a 23 percent decrease in \nrespiratory diseases, seizures, brain hemorrhages, and other \ncomplications.\n  Ohio is also home to the Ohio Perinatal Quality Collaborative, which \nconsists of 45 clinical teams from 25 Ohio hospitals. The \nCollaborative, based at Cinncinati Children's Hospital Medical Center, \nincludes all of Ohio's children's hospitals as well as regional \nhospitals such as Akron's Summa Health System, the Toledo Hospital, the \nMount Carmel Hospital System, St. Elizabeth's Health Center in \nYoungstown, and Miami Valley Hospital in Dayton. Twenty-four teams are \nfocusing on reducing catheter associated infections in preterm babies \nand the other 21 teams are focusing on reducing the number of \ndeliveries that occur between 29 and 36 weeks gestation.\n  In my hometown of Mansfield in Richland County, Ohio, the Community \nHealth Access Project (CHAP) stepped in after discovering that certain \ngroups of women were three times more likely to give birth to a low \nbirth weight infant. Through a series of community outreach \ninitiatives, CHAP community health workers and local volunteers were \nable to identify and break down barriers, such as transportation needs \nand cultural differences, to better address the health needs of at-risk \npregnant women. In its first three years, the number of low birth \nweight babies in the region showed a decline from 22.7 percent to 8 \npercent and CHAP has become a national model in community health \nservices.\n  At University Hospitals (UH) in Cleveland, the MacDonald Women's \nHospital and Rainbow Babies & Children's Hospital implemented a \nCentering Pregnancy Program in 2010. This unique, group-based program \ntargets socially at-risk women who are least likely to receive \nconsistent prenatal\n\n[[Page S8065]]\n\ncare and have the greatest risk of having a low birth weight baby or \ndelivering prematurely. The program has enabled UH to dramatically \nreduce incidences of preterm births and low birth weight babies by 8 \npercent and 8.7 percent below the national average respectively.\n  November has come to an end, but I look forward to continue working \nwith organizations and health systems in Ohio and across the country to \nreduce premature births and ensure a healthy start in life for our \nNation's children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/30/senate-section/article/S8065-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8065]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         REMEMBERING JIM CAPOOT\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

I \nextend my deepest condolences to his loving wife Jessica and three \ndaughters. My thoughts and prayers are with them. We are forever \nindebted to him for his courage, service, and sacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/30/senate-section/article/S8065-2", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8065]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO RANCOURT & CO. SHOECRAFTERS\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, my home State of Maine boasts \ncountless entrepreneurs who are working to ensure that our State and \nNation have a vibrant, growing economy for years to come. Michael and \nKyle Rancourt, a dynamic father and son duo, exemplify this vibrant \nentrepreneurial spirit. Through ingenuity and hard work, they have \ndeveloped and maintained a thriving shoemaking business based in the \ncentral Maine city of Lewiston, which was once a hub for the industry. \nToday I wish to commend and recognize the founders of Rancourt & Co. \nShoecrafters for their success and commitment to their business and \nlocal community.\n  The Rancourt family has provided superb quality shoes for three \ngenerations. The family began its business in 1964. However, 11 years \nago, Mike Rancourt sold the small family shoe business to Allen-\nEdmonds, which at the time was its largest client. Soon after, due to a \nstruggling economy, the U.S. shoe industry experienced tremendous \ndifficulties, and it became necessary for Allen-Edmonds to reduce its \nstaff and close the Lewiston factory originally owned by the Rancourts.\n  Aware of these developments and reluctant to see the shoe factory \nwhich provided so many throughout the community with jobs, Michael and \nKyle Rancourt decided to buy the factory back from Allen-Edmonds in \n2009, reviving their passion for shoe making. The Rancourts began anew \nwith just 20 employees but quickly found success in what many \nconsidered to be a dying domestic industry as more shoe manufacturers \nexpanded overseas. A shifting demand for domestically made, quality \nproducts provided the company with a growing consumer base and a steady \nsource of revenue.\n  This small business uses resources purchased from around the world to \nhand-make men's dress and casual shoes using the traditional method \nknown as ``last.'' This meticulous process involves employees hand-\nfitting leather into a shoe form, tacking the leather pieces in place, \nand then hand-stitching them with waxed threads and needles. The result \nof this process is a shoe that is recognized around the world for its \nsuperior quality and genuine comfort.\n  Looking at the new Rancourt & Co. today, it is difficult to imagine \nthat it once faced extinction. The company has grown to over 50 \nemployees today and has increased the number of men's shoes it \nmanufactures on a weekly basis from 250 to 1,000. These fine-crafted \nproducts are sold throughout the United States as well as in \ninternational locations such as Hong Kong, India, the United Arab \nEmirates, and Japan. This small firm continues to expand, and in July, \nthe company launched an online store which already grosses between \n$8,000-$10,000 each week.\n  Small businesses like Rancourt & Co. Shoecrafters are critical to the \neconomic health of our country and our local communities. During a time \nof heightened global competitiveness, Michael and Kyle Rancourt were \nable to revive and renew their business and compete in an environment \nthat many thought was simply too difficult and taxing for domestic \nmanufacturers. As a result of their efforts, the company has prospered, \npreserving jobs in a local Maine community while showing the world what \nAmerican small businesses are truly capable of.

Mr. President, the Benton County Drug Treatment \nCourt is a shining example of our Nation's drug court system. As one of \nonly 10 mentor courts in the Nation, the Benton County Drug Treatment \nCourt serves as a model program for the over 2,500 treatment courts in \nthe United States. This achievement is especially significant given \nthat the Benton County Drug Treatment Court started as an ambitious \npilot program only 10 years ago.\n  The positive impact drug treatment courts have on individuals, \nfamilies, and communities throughout our country is remarkable. Due to \ntireless efforts underway since the first drug court was established \nover 20 years ago, there is now a system in place which, if completed, \nreduces the likelihood of drug relapse for individuals, provides \nincreased housing stability, and brings families together. The positive \noutcomes from completion of drug courts are well documented and benefit \nthose outside the system as well by reducing costs to the taxpayer.\n  Congratulations to the Benton Country Drug Court on their 10th \nanniversary. Because of innovative solutions like drug courts, our \ncountry is one step closer to breaking the cycle of addiction which has \nplagued our country for far too long.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/30/senate-section/article/S8065-4", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8065]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/30/senate-section/article/S8065-5", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8065]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/30/senate-section/article/S8065-6", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8065-S8066]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:25 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1801.

 By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mr. Crapo):\n  S. 1925. A bill to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act of \n1994; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, I am proud to introduce the \nbipartisan Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2011 and to be \njoined by Senator Crapo in doing so. For almost 18 years, the Violence \nAgainst Women Act, VAWA, has been the centerpiece of the Federal \nGovernment's commitment to combat domestic violence, dating violence, \nsexual assault, and stalking. We should reauthorize and strengthen \nthese programs.\n  Since VAWA'S passage in 1994, no other law has done more to stop \ndomestic and sexual violence in our communities. The resources and \ntraining provided by VAWA have changed attitudes toward these \nreprehensible crimes, improved the response of law enforcement and the \njustice system, and provided essential services for victims struggling \nto rebuild their lives. It is a law that has saved countless lives, and \nit is an example of what we can accomplish when we work together.\n  As a prosecutor in Vermont, I saw firsthand the destruction caused by \ndomestic and sexual violence. Those were the days before VAWA, when too \noften people dismissed these serious crimes with a joke, and there were \nfew, if any, services for victims. We have come a long way since then, \nbut there is much more we must do.\n  Over the last few years, the Senate Judiciary Committee has held \nseveral hearings on VAWA in anticipation of this reauthorization. We \nhave heard from people from all around the country, and they have told \nus the same thing I hear from service providers, experts, and law \nenforcement officers in Vermont: While we have made great strides in \nreducing domestic violence and sexual assault, these difficult problems \nremain, and there is more work to be done.\n  The victim services funded by VAWA play a particularly critical role \nin these difficult economic times. The economic pressures of a lost job \nor home can add stress to an already abusive relationship and can make \nit even harder for victims to rebuild their lives. At the same time, \nstate budget cuts are resulting in fewer available services. Just this \nsummer, Topeka, Kansas, took the drastic step of decriminalizing \ndomestic violence because the city did not have the funds needed to \nprosecute these cases. We can and must do better than that. Budgets are \ntight, but we cannot simply turn our backs on these victims. For many, \nthe programs funded through the Violence Against Women Act are nothing \nshort of a life line.\n  In Vermont, VAWA funding helped the Vermont Network Against Domestic \nand Sexual Violence provide services to more than 7,000 adults and \nnearly 1,400 children last year alone. These women and men, and girls \nand boys, received shelter, counseling, legal advocacy and access to \ntransitional housing--lifesaving services to help them recover from \nunspeakable trauma and abuse.\n  In one case, a mother of three children living in rural Vermont \nendured a long and abusive marriage in which she was not allowed to get \nan independent job or even a driver's license. For most of her adult \nlife, she was subjected to physical, sexual and emotional abuse by her \nhusband. After she summoned the courage to call a domestic violence \nhotline, her husband was arrested. Advocates helped her find temporary \nhousing and gain access to a lawyer who helped her navigate the \ncriminal process and establish supervised visitation for her children. \nBecause of funding provided by VAWA, she and her children are safe and \nliving independently. The lives of this woman and her children are just \na few examples of how VAWA is having a real impact in our communities.\n  I have heard stories like this time and again from victims and \nadvocates in Vermont and across the country. Without this critical \nfunding, state and local programs like the Vermont Network Against \nDomestic and Sexual Violence will not be able to provide their services \nto victims in desperate need.\n  The reauthorization bill that I am introducing with Senator Crapo \nreflects Congress's ongoing commitment to end domestic and sexual \nviolence. It seeks to expand the law's focus on sexual assault, to \nensure access to services for all victims of domestic and sexual \nviolence, and to address the crisis of domestic and sexual violence in \ntribal communities, among other important steps. It also responds to \nthese difficult economic times by consolidating programs, reducing \nauthorization levels, and adding accountability measures to ensure that \nFederal funds are used efficiently and effectively.\n  The Violence Against Women Act has been successful because it has \nconsistently had strong bipartisan support for nearly two decades. \nToday, we build on that foundation. I hope that Senators from both \nparties will join us to quickly pass this critical reauthorization, \nwhich will provide safety and security for victims across America.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n  S.J.

Mr. President, I have introduced this resolution to prevent \nthe labor dispute between our Nation's railroads and their labor unions \nfrom delivering a knockout punch to the U.S. economy just before the \nholiday season. The contract renegotiation that has been ongoing for \nsome time has been through the National Mediation Board process and \nrecommendations put forth by the Presidential Emergency Board selected \nby President Obama have been accepted by the majority of the unions. In \nfact, 10 of the 13 unions have reached agreement, and I congratulate \nboth sides for coming to the table and working it out. Unfortunately, \nthe threat of a nationwide rail strike still remains and that is \nsomething our economy simply cannot bear at this time.\n  I have heard from numerous U.S. manufacturers about the negative \nconsequences this strike will have on them. They are concerned not just \nfor their companies but for the employees who may have to be laid off \nif they are unable to ship product and for the customers who will not \nbe able to get supplies they need. A rail strike may start on December \n6, but the impact of this threat is already being felt. As someone who \ncomes from a State that relies on commercial rail for much of its \neconomy, I know how serious this is and that is why I have introduced \nthis resolution.\n  I urge the Senate, the House and the President to act quickly to \navert this manmade national disaster.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/30/senate-section/article/S8075-2", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8075]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              APPOINTMENT\n\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER.
