Madam President, yesterday my friend the majority \nleader unveiled what he rather misleadingly referred to as a compromise \non the payroll tax. I say it was misleading because we had to find out \nabout it from reporters.\n  This was not a compromise. This was nothing more than another bill \ndesigned to fail so Democrats can have another week of fun and games on \nthe Senate floor while tens of millions of working Americans go another \nweek wondering whether they are going to see a smaller paycheck at the \nend of the year.\n  I have said I support this extension. I don't think working Americans \nshould\n\n[[Page S8346]]\n\nhave to suffer any more than they already are for the President's \nfailure to turn this jobs crisis around. Unfortunately, the majority \nleader has yet to introduce legislation that can actually pass the \nSenate or the House. One would think if that is one of the President's \ntop priorities, then the Democratic leader of the Senate would put \ntogether a proposal that is designed to actually pass. But we haven't \nseen it yet. We all know what a successful bill would look like. So I \nhope the majority leader comes forward with a real proposal soon \nbecause time is running out. It makes absolutely no sense at a moment \nwhen 14 million Americans are looking for jobs to raise taxes on the \nvery people we are counting on to create them. That is why the Senate \nrejected the idea last week on a bipartisan basis.\n  Look, the Democrats know as well as we do that this is a terrible \nidea. They have seen the same letters I have. The National Association \nof Manufacturers says this tax hike would seriously impair the ability \nof their members to put unemployed Americans back to work. The \nDemocrats know as well as I do that four out of five of those who would \nbe hit by this are business owners, people who create jobs. The only \nreason--the only reason--we even went through this exercise is because \nit obviously polls well.\n\n  So this is what Washington has been reduced to: a President and a \nSenate who would rather spend their time doing cheap political theater \nthan giving people the certainty they want. What we need to do is to \nstep back and realize that the only reason we are talking about a one-\nshot stimulus measure nearly 3 years into this Presidency is because of \nthe President's failure to turn this jobs crisis around. We need to get \nbeyond the temporary fixes and start talking about fundamental tax \nreform that puts the American worker in charge of this recovery, not \nWashington.\n  But for now, it is perfectly clear that the path to an accomplishment \non this issue does not run through tax hikes. Yesterday, the President \nwarned Congress to keep its word to the American people and ``don't \nraise taxes on them now.'' I wish to remind my colleagues and the \nPresident that the Republican plan is the only plan that meets the \nPresident's standard. The President just warned us: Don't raise taxes \non the American people. The proposal we offer is the only one that \nmeets that standard.\n  If our friends are serious about passing this extension of the \npayroll tax cut, they have a choice: We can have an accomplishment or \nwe can have additional partisan show votes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/06/senate-section/article/S8346-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8346]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, later this week the Senate will vote \non whether the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau should move \nforward with a director before addressing concerns that have been \nraised about the bureau's lack of transparency or accountability to the \nAmerican people.\n  I understand through press reports that the President plans to make a \nbig push for this nominee to the CFPB. Let me tell my colleagues \nsomething the President hasn't done when it comes to this position: In \nthe 7 months since 44 Republicans sent the President a letter outlining \nsome very serious and very reasonable concerns about it, he hasn't done \na thing to address these concerns--not one thing. If he picked up the \nphone to talk these issues over with anybody in our conference, I \nhaven't heard about it. If he has put some thought into how he could \nensure the perfectly legitimate concerns we raised in that letter are \naddressed, he hasn't let us in on the game plan.\n  Here is what we asked for in that letter, which has now been signed \nby 45 Republican Senators--not 44, 45: All we asked for before we vote \nto confirm anybody to run the CFPB--regardless of their party \naffiliation, regardless of who the President is--are three clear, \nsimple, commonsense reforms that would make sure this new agency is \naccountable to the American people.\n  No. 1, replace the single director with a board of directors that \nwould oversee the bureau. Under the deeply flawed Dodd-Frank bill, the \nDirector of the CFPB, by design, is set to lead one of the least \naccountable and most powerful agencies in Washington. What we are \nsaying is no single person who is unaccountable to the American people \nshould have that much power. We are asking for the same structure as \nthe SEC, the CFTC, the FDIC, the FTC, the NLRB, and the Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission--the same structure we use anytime we give \nunelected bureaucrats new powers that need to be checked to protect \nagainst abuse.\n  No. 2, subject the bureau to the congressional appropriations \nprocess. Subject this new CFPB to the congressional appropriations \nprocess. Currently, the CFPB is housed at the Federal Reserve and \nfunded through a percentage of their annual budget, giving it a funding \nstream that is completely unique in government, entirely without a \ncheck from the American people and making it one of the least \ntransparent agencies in Washington. If one likes the level of \naccountability over at the Fed, one will love the CFPB.\n  A journalist who wanted some information about the Fed's lending \npractices recently had to sue to find it out. This is information not \neven Congress could have gotten on its own.\n  If my colleagues ask me, the American people should be getting more \ntransparency out of this administration, not less. We don't need any \nmore unelected, unaccountable czars in Washington.\n  No. 3, we asked for a safety and soundness check for the prudential \nfinancial regulators who oversee the safety and soundness of financial \ninstitutions. This would help ensure that we are not inadvertently \ncausing bank failures through excessive regulations.\n  Our proposal would do nothing more than give congressional committees \na proper level of oversight and accountability over this new bureau and \nensure that its decisions were subject to the checks and balances that \nwere meant to be inherent in our system--something we owe the American \npeople.\n  Everybody supports strong and effective consumer protection, but the \nCFPB, in its current form, cannot stand. In its current form, the CFPB \ncould easily be used for political purposes at the expense of access to \ncredit, job creation, economic growth, and financial stability.\n  What is needed is transparency and accountability. That is all we \nhave asked for, and the President has done nothing to address these \nconcerns. Instead, he has ignored these perfectly legitimate concerns, \nand now he is suddenly making a push to confirm his nominee because it \nfits into some picture he wants to paint about who the good guys and \nthe bad guys are in Washington.\n  So once again he has used the Senate floor this week to stage a \nlittle political theater. He is setting up a vote he knows will fail so \nhe can show up afterward and say he is shocked. This is what passes for \nleadership right now in the White House, and it is truly unfortunate.\n  Look, we all believe Americans need access to financial products that \nare not rigged against them. We just think nobody should be above \noversight, including the overseers. We do not think a bureau designed \nto watch Wall Street should have the ability to squeeze out hiring on \nMain Street. Frankly, the President's refusal to even consider our \ncalls for oversight and transparency only serve to deepen our concerns \nabout this agency. So, once again, we call on the President to take \nthese concerns seriously and work with us on achieving something \npositive.\n  The fact is the CFPB needs a drastic overhaul before any nominee can \nbe confirmed. This will not come as a surprise to anybody at the White \nHouse, and our doors remain open.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/06/senate-section/article/S8346-2", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8346-S8347]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NOMINATION OF CAITLIN HALLIGAN\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Now, Madam President, on yet another topic--there are \na number of things going on this week--today the Senate will vote on \nthe nomination of Caitlin Halligan to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nDC Circuit. I will be opposing this nominee, and I would like to \nexplain why.\n  First and foremost is Ms. Halligan's record of advocacy for an \nactivist view of the judiciary and a legal career that leads any \nreasonable person to conclude that she would bring that activism right \non to the court. As I have said many times before, the proper role\n\n[[Page S8347]]\n\nof a judge is that of an impartial arbiter who gives everybody a fair \nshake under the law as it exists. The role of a judge in our system, in \nother words, is to determine what the law says not what they or anybody \nelse wants it to say. Yet looking over Ms. Halligan's record, it is \npretty clear she does not share that view.\n  In Ms. Halligan's view, the courts are not so much a forum for the \nevenhanded application of the law as a place where a judge can work out \nhis or her own idea of what society should look like. As she herself \nonce put it: The courts are a means to achieve ``social progress,'' \nwith judges presumably writing the script.\n  Well, my own view is that if the American people want to change the \nlaw, then they have elected representatives to do that, and these \nelected representatives are accountable to them. This also happens to \nbe how the Founders intended it, and it is what the American people \nexpect of their judges: to be fair, impartial arbiters. But that is not \nwhat they would get from a Judge Halligan.\n  So how do we know this? Well, it is true that like many of this \nPresident's other judicial nominees, Ms. Halligan repudiated President \nObama's own off-stated ``empathy standard'' for choosing judges and \ndisclaimed an activist bent in her confirmation hearings. But her \nrecord belies this now familiar confirmation conversion.\n  Let's take a quick look at her record to see what it does suggest \nabout the kind of judge she would be.\n  On the second amendment: As solicitor general of New York, Ms. \nHalligan advanced the dubious legal theory that those who make firearms \nshould be liable for third parties who misuse them criminally. The \nState court in New York rejected the theory, noting it had never \nrecognized such a novel claim. Moreover, the court called what Ms. \nHalligan wanted it to do to manufacturers of a legal product ``legally \ninappropriate.''\n  So let me say again, the New York Appellate Court termed Ms. \nHalligan's activist and novel legal theory to be ``legally \ninappropriate.'' The Congress passed legislation on a wide bipartisan \nbasis to stop these sorts of lawsuits because they were an abuse of the \nlegal process. Undeterred, Ms. Halligan then chose to file an amicus \nbrief in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in another frivolous case \nagainst firearms manufacturers. Not surprisingly, she lost that case \ntoo.\n  What about her views on enemy combatants?\n  In 2005, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld that the \nPresident has the legal authority to detain as enemy combatants \nindividuals who are associated with al-Qaida. Yet despite this ruling, \nMs. Halligan filed an amicus brief years later--years after that--\narguing that the President did not possess this legal authority.\n  On abortion: Ms. Halligan filed an amicus brief in the U.S. Supreme \nCourt arguing that pro-life protesters--protesters--had engaged in \n``extortion'' within the meaning of Federal law. The Supreme Court \nroundly rejected this theory 8 to 1.\n  On immigration: Ms. Halligan chose to file an amicus brief in the \nSupreme Court arguing that the National Labor Relations Board should \nhave the legal authority to grant backpay to illegal aliens even though \nFederal law prohibits illegal aliens from working in the United States \nin the first place. Fortunately, the Court sided with the law and \ndisagreed with Ms. Halligan on that legal theory too.\n  The point is that even in cases where the law is perfectly clear or \nthe courts have already spoken, including the Supreme Court, Ms. \nHalligan chose to get involved anyway, using arguments that had already \nbeen rejected either by the courts, the legislature or, in the case of \nfrivolous claims against gun manufacturers, by both. In other words, \nMs. Halligan has time and time again sought to push her own views over \nand above those of the courts or those of the people as reflected in \nthe law.\n  Ms. Halligan's record strongly suggests that she would not view a \nseat on the U.S. appeals court as an opportunity to evenhandedly \nadjudicate disputes between parties based on the law but instead as an \nopportunity to put her thumb on the scale in favor of whatever \nindividual or group cause in which she happens to believe.\n  So, Madam President, we should not be putting these kinds of \nactivists on the bench. I have nothing against the nominee personally. \nI just believe, as I think most Americans do, that we should be putting \npeople on the bench who are committed to an evenhanded interpretation \nof the law so everyone who walks into a courtroom knows he or she will \nhave a fair shake. In my view, Ms. Halligan is not such a nominee. On \nthe contrary, based on her record and her past statements, I think she \nwould use the court to put her activist judicial philosophy into \npractice, and for that reason alone she should not be confirmed. So I \nwill be voting against cloture on this nomination, and I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I would like to speak in morning \nbusiness, and I would like to respond to several things said by the \nRepublican leader of the Senate. The first relates to Caitlin Halligan, \nwho is a nominee to serve on the DC Circuit Court. The DC Circuit Court \nis the appellate court in the District of Columbia which, I would \nargue, next to the U.S. Supreme Court is one of our most important.\n  The decisions of government are often sent to this court for review. \nAt the current time, there are eight who are sitting on that court, and \nthere are three vacancies. Of the eight who are on the court, five are \nRepublican appointments. So it is clear that any effort now to bring a \nnew nominee to the court may tip that political balance. I am afraid \nthat has a lot more to do with the fate of Caitlin Halligan than \nanything that has been said on the Senate floor this morning.\n  It is mystifying to me that Senate Republicans would filibuster her \nnomination. She is extraordinarily well qualified. She served for 7 \nyears as the solicitor general of the State of New York and currently \nserves as the general counsel at the New York County district \nattorney's office.\n  She has argued five cases before the U.S. Supreme Court and has \nserved as counsel of record in dozens of other cases before that Court.\n  The American Bar Association looked at the qualifications of Caitlin \nHalligan, and here is what they said: She is unanimously ``well-\nqualified'' to serve in this position.\n  Ms. Halligan's legal views are well within the judicial mainstream. \nShe has received widespread support from across the political spectrum.\n  What I have heard this morning from the Republican leader are \nisolated examples of cases she may have argued, but he certainly does \nnot speak to the fact that the National District Attorneys Association, \nthe district attorneys from the State of New York, including \nRepublicans Derek Champagne, Daniel Donovan, William Fitzpatrick, James \nReams, and Scott Burns have all publicly endorsed her nomination. \nRaymond Kelly, police commissioner for the City of New York; Robert \nMorgenthau--one of the most respected district attorneys who ever \nserved in this country; served New York County for 34 years--endorses \nher; the New York Association of Chiefs of Police; and the New York \nState Sheriff's Association.\n  When you listen to these endorsements, you wonder: Is that the same \nwoman the Senate Republican leader just questioned as to whether she \nwas serious about stopping terrorism? I listened to some of these \nthings, and I wonder how people of her quality would ever consider \nputting their name in nomination--that there could be suggestions on \nthe Senate floor that perhaps she is not as strong as she should be in \nkeeping America safe.\n  There is simply nothing in the background of Caitlin Halligan that \nsuggests we have any extraordinary circumstances that warrant the \ndefeat of the cloture motion on her nomination.\n  A moment in history, please. When there was a suggestion of \nfilibustering judicial nominations years ago, and the so-called nuclear \noption was being discussed, a Gang of 14, a bipartisan group of \nSenators, came up and said: Unless there are extraordinary \ncircumstances, we should vote on these nominees on the Senate floor.\n  There are no extraordinary circumstances in the case of Caitlin \nHalligan. The only thing that is extraordinary is how many people from \ndifferent walks of life have endorsed her candidacy and the American \nBar Association finding her unanimously ``well-qualified.''\n  There are no legitimate questions about her competence, ethics, \ntemperament, or ideology. All she has done throughout her career is \nserve as an excellent lawyer on behalf of her client.\n  The Republican arguments against Ms. Halligan's nomination boil down \nto just two: First, it does not matter if there are vacancies on the DC \nCircuit; and, in fact, in the past, they have argued to fill those same \nvacancies when they had an opportunity to install Republicans. Their \nsecond argument: Republicans are not happy with how certain nominees \nwere treated years ago, and they see no problem taking out their \nunhappiness on this nominee.\n  This is a dangerous path. I believe our country needs excellent \njudges. Time and again--in the Acting President pro tempore's State of \nNew Hampshire, in my State of Illinois--you go to people who are \nsitting on the bench in a State court or in private practice and ask \nthem if they would consider serving their Nation on the Federal court, \nand they know it is a big decision: whether they are going to change a \ncareer. But they know just as well that by submitting their name to the \nprocess, they are subjecting themselves to criticism, which many people \njust do not care to withstand.\n  In this case, the criticism against Caitlin Halligan is baseless. If \njudicial nominees cannot be considered fairly by the Senate on their \nown merits, good lawyers are simply going to stop putting their name \ninto the process for consideration and our country will suffer as a \nresult.\n  We should give Ms. Halligan an up-or-down vote on her merits. On that \nstandard, she should clearly be confirmed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/06/senate-section/article/S8348-2", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8348-S8349]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JOAQUIN LUNA\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I come to the floor today with a sad \nstory for my colleagues. On the day after Thanksgiving, a young man \nnamed Joaquin Luna committed suicide in the town of Mission, TX. This \nis a picture of Joaquin Luna with his mother--a handsome young man full \nof promise. He took his own life on the day after Thanksgiving.\n  He was a senior at Juarez-Lincoln High School, where he was a \nstraight-A student, in Mission, TX. He had a passion for architecture. \nIn fact, he designed the home where his family lives. He was an \naccomplished musician, played guitar in his church choir. His family \nsaid he loved helping his neighbors with their landscaping, and he \nalways had a smile on his face.\n  Joaquin Luna dreamed of becoming an engineer. He had been accepted \ninto a number of excellent schools, including Rice University and Texas \nA But Joaquin Luna was struggling with a problem most American kids \ndo not even imagine. Joaquin was brought to the United States of \nAmerica when he was 6 months old by his parents. He came here as a \nbaby, lived his entire life in the United States, and was undocumented. \nBecause of his immigration status, Joaquin Luna was unable to obtain \nfinancial aid to attend the universities that accepted him. He was \nunable to find a legitimate job. Joaquin's brother said his world just \nclosed. He saw that everything he was doing was for nothing. He was \nnever going to be able to succeed.\n  Joaquin's death is still under investigation, so I do not want to \njump to any conclusions about why this tragedy took place. But I felt \nit was important to come to the floor today to pay tribute to this \nyoung man's all-too-brief life and to deliver a message to other young \npeople like Joaquin Luna.\n  There are tens of thousands of young people in this country facing \nthe same challenges as Joaquin. They were brought to the United States \nas children. They grew up every single day--just as we did a few \nmoments ago in the Senate--pledging allegiance to the only flag they \nhave ever known, our American flag. They would sing the only national \nanthem they ever knew. It was not their decision to come to America. \nCertainly Joaquin did not make any decision at the age of 6 months. But \nAmerica is their home. And for tens of thousands of others in his \nstatus, America is their home and their future, but they are \nundocumented and their future is uncertain.\n  I have a message today for all of the young people like Joaquin. Do \nnot give up hope. Keep your dreams alive.\n\n[[Page S8349]]\n\nAmerica is a generous and caring country. We can and we will find a \nway--a fair and just way--to give you a chance to be part of our \nNation's future. If you or someone you know is feeling hopeless because \nof the failure of the DREAM Act to pass in the Senate, there are people \navailable to help and talk to you. You can call the National Suicide \nPrevention Lifeline. The number is 1-800-273-TALK. That is 1-800-273-\n8255.\n  Today, my thoughts and prayers are with Joaquin Luna's family. I send \nthem my sympathy and condolences and assure them I will honor his \nmemory by continuing to fight for all of the young people in America \nwho are just like Joaquin.\n  I never dreamed 10 years ago when I introduced the DREAM Act that I \nwould be standing on this floor 10 years later with that bill still not \nenacted into law. Time and again, we have had a majority vote in the \nSenate stopped by a Republican filibuster. Time and again, we have \nbrought this issue to the floor and argued the cases of young people \njust like Joaquin Luna. We are only asking that they be given a chance \nto earn their way to legal status. That is it. They have to graduate \nhigh school. They cannot have any serious criminal issues. They have to \nbe willing to either serve 2 years in the military or graduate from \ncollege. Those requirements say that they have to be people who are \ndetermined to make America a better place.\n  We just had a debate going on now about bringing in talented people \nfrom all over the world to work in the United States. Think about that. \nWe are going to bend the immigration laws so that more talented \ngraduates from other countries can come to our country and help build \nit into a better nation, creating more jobs and opportunity. At the \nsame time as that is being proposed, we are saying to tens of thousands \nlike Joaquin Luna: There is no place for you in America because your \nparents brought you here when you were a child, and therefore you are \nforever banished from being part of America's future. That is a cruel \noutcome and one we should not accept as Americans. This is a great and \ncaring nation. It is a nation of immigrants.\n  Madam President, 100 years ago, in 1911, a ship arrived in Baltimore, \nMD. A woman walked down the stairs, two little children by her side and \na baby in her arms. She did not speak a word of English. She came from \nLithuania. She was bringing her children to America and trying to find \nout how to get from Baltimore, MD, to East St. Louis, IL, where my \ngrandfather lived. He was there waiting for her, had a job and a place \nthey could call home. I do not know how she possibly made it, but she \ndid. That baby in her arms, that 2-year-old infant, was my mother. I am \na first-generation American. I have the honor of serving in this \nSenate. I do not know if my mom was legal or not legal. Later in life, \nafter she was married and had two children, she became a naturalized \ncitizen. Upstairs in my office, her naturalization certificate is right \nbehind my desk as a reminder about who I am.\n  That is my story. That is the story of many families in America. It \nis the story of America. If we cannot open our arms and our hearts to \nthose who will come here and work hard to make this a stronger nation, \nwe will have lost one of the core elements of America's strength and \nAmerica's future. We are great in our diversity. We are great in the \nfact that so many people are willing to work hard to come to this \nNation and make it a better place to live.\n  Sadly, Joaquin Luna will not be part of America's future, but I hope \nhis story will inspire others to step up and speak up for those who are \npromoting the DREAM Act. I want to bring this to the floor again. I \nwant to pass it. I want to make sure that the hopelessness and despair \nthat many young people feel is replaced by the hopeful belief that if \nthey continue to work hard in their lives and continue to be dedicated \nto America, they can make this a better and stronger nation.\n  In honor and memory of Joaquin Luna, I ask my colleagues to \nreconsider their position and join us in passing the DREAM Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/06/senate-section/article/S8349-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8349-S8350]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  EXTENDING THE PAYROLL TAX DEDUCTION\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, there was a question raised this morning \nby the Republican leader about where we stand in the closing 2 weeks \nbefore the holiday recess. We have a lot of important issues left. One \nof the most important is the payroll tax cut. Here is what it means. If \nyou have a job in Illinois, an average job in Illinois that pays about \n$50,000 a year, currently you have a break on your payroll taxes that \nare collected of about 2 percent. So what that means for those families \nis that they have an additional $100 a month to spend.\n  For some Members of the Senate and the House of Representatives, $100 \na month might not make much of a difference, but for a lot of families \nstruggling from paycheck to paycheck, $100 can make a big difference. \nWhen gasoline prices go through the roof, you can fill the gas tank in \nyour car or pickup truck and make it to work. You might have a little \nextra money left for a utility bill when the natural gas prices and oil \nprices go up during the course of a cold winter. You might be able to \nafford some Christmas gifts for your kids, maybe even some clothes for \nthem to go to school, a warm jacket for cold weather. So $125 dollars \nis important.\n  If we do not act, and act before we leave at Christmas, as of January \n1 that payroll tax will go up 2 percent on working Americans, and they \nwill have less money to spend. As they spend less money, our economy \nstruggles. When they buy things, goods and services, it creates more \neconomic activity in businesses small and large and creates \nprofitability and jobs--job opportunities we desperately need with our \nhigh unemployment.\n  Now, we have taken a position with Senator Bob Casey's bill here when \nit comes to the payroll tax cut that it is not unreasonable to ask that \nthe wealthiest people in America, the top 0.2 percent in America, pay a \nlittle bit more in taxes so that we do not add to our deficit with this \npayroll tax cut.\n  There were times in the past, as the President noted yesterday, when \nthe Republicans actually argued: You never have to pay for a payroll \ntax cut or a tax cut. Now they have taken a different position--it has \nto be paid for. Well, we do pay for it. We pay for it with a surtax on \nmillionaires. Unfortunately, some Republicans opposed that.\n  Senator Kyl said yesterday on the floor, in a statement relative to \nan exchange we had, that it is hard to say the rich are not paying \ntaxes. I am not arguing that point. They are paying taxes. But, \nfrankly, under our system of government, with a progressive tax system, \nthose who are well off--Members of Congress and the Senate--those with \nhigh salaries should pay more than those who are struggling from \npaycheck to paycheck.\n  The people we are talking about, the top 1 percent wage earners in \nAmerica, will have an average annual income in 2013 of $1.4 million a \nyear--$1.4 million a year. By my calculation, that is a paycheck of \n$28,000 a week. To say that those people cannot afford to pay a little \nmore in taxes is hard for most families to understand--it is hard for \nme to understand. The Bush tax cuts, incidentally, which the \nRepublicans support making permanent have been very generous to those \npeople. If the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans are extended, \nthose in the top 1 percent, making more than $1.4 million a year, are \ngoing to see a tax cut in the year 2013 of $68,000--a tax cut at a time \nwhen we have Federal deficits and needs in our country to get beyond \nthis recession.\n  These people in the top 1 percent control almost 25 percent of the \nincome in America--1 percent of the population, more than 25 percent of \nthe income. That is up from 12 percent just 25 years ago. They control \n40 percent of all of the wealth in the United States. They are \ncomfortable. In 1986, they only controlled 33 percent. In fact, we can \nsay that in the last 25 years, the wealthy in America have become even \nmore comfortable, and to ask them to make even a small sacrifice for \nthe good of this Nation is not unreasonable.\n  Senator McConnell came to the floor and suggested that what we are \ndealing with on the floor here is political showmanship. Well, last \nweek we went beyond showmanship and we actually called a vote. We had a \nproposal--Senator Casey's proposal--to reinstitute this payroll tax cut \nand pay\n\n[[Page S8350]]\n\nfor it, as I mentioned, with a surtax on the wealthiest people in \nAmerica. At the end of the day, out of 53 Democratic Senators, 50 voted \nyes, and 1 Republican Senator joined us. We had 51 votes in favor. It \ntook 60 votes to pass, so it did not prevail.\n  Then Senator McConnell had his chance. He brought to the floor the \nRepublican alternative. They would extend the payroll tax cut by \neliminating jobs--over 200,000 jobs in the Federal Government at a time \nwhen, frankly, we need more workers in veterans hospitals and we need \nmore people working on medical research at the National Institutes of \nHealth and we need more involved in law enforcement to keep America \nsafe. But Senator McConnell said that the way to pay any tax cut for \nworking families is to eliminate Federal jobs. They called it for a \nvote. There are 47 Republican Senators on the floor. So how did the \nvote turn out when the Republicans called their proposal to extend the \npayroll tax cut? If I am not mistaken, only 20 Republican Senators \nvoted for that proposal. In fact, Senator McConnell was the only Member \nof the Senate Republican leadership who voted for the proposal.\n  So you have to ask, when it comes to the competition of ideas, who \nwon that exchange? The answer is, no one won because at the end of the \nday we did not extend the payroll tax cut.\n  Back home in Chicago this last week, I had a press conference with a \nlady, a single mom, three kids, struggling with three jobs, with an \nannual income--combined income of less than $25,000 a year. I cannot \nimagine how she gets by. But she said that $50 more a month--that is \nwhat the payroll tax cuts means to her--would be significant--$50. That \nis how close so many people live to the edge.\n  It is time for us, in the closing days of the session before \nChristmas, to reach a bipartisan agreement to make sure the payroll tax \ncut is extended, to make sure the unemployment benefits that are needed \nso desperately by so many people out of work are there to help them and \ntheir families. The only way we can achieve that is in a bipartisan \nagreement. We now know that the notion of just cutting away at Federal \njobs has been rejected soundly, even by the Republican side of the \naisle. Let's come to a reasonable conclusion on how to pay for this in \na manner that does not add to unemployment but adds more jobs to the \nAmerican economy, something which most Americans agree should be our \nhighest priority.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/06/senate-section/article/S8350-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8350-S8351]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NOMINATION OF CAITLIN HALLIGAN\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, soon we will be taking up the \nnomination of Caitlin Halligan to the DC District Court. I oppose the \nnomination. This is why the nomination should not be confirmed.\n  Nominations to the DC Circuit deserve special scrutiny. The Court of \nAppeals, DC Circuit, hears cases affecting all Americans. This court \nfrequently is the last stop for cases involving Federal statutes and \nregulations. Many view this court as second in importance only to our \nSupreme Court.\n  As we all know, judges who sit on the DC Circuit are frequently \nconsidered for the Supreme Court. So there is a lot at stake with any \nnominee appointed to the DC Circuit.\n  Ms. Halligan has an activist record. There are additional concerns \nregarding her judicial philosophy and her approach to interpreting the \nConstitution.\n  The second amendment, for instance, in 2003, Ms. Halligan gave a \nspeech where she discussed her role in suing gun manufacturers for \ncriminal acts committed with handguns.\n  At the time, Congress was debating the Protection of Lawful Commerce \nin Arms Act or, as most of us called it at the time, the gun liability \nbill. Those lawsuits, of course, were based on meritless legal theories \nand were specifically designed to drive gun manufacturers out of \nbusiness.\n  As it turns out, while many of us were fighting in Congress to stop \nthese nuisance lawsuits, Ms. Halligan was pursuing this precise type of \nlitigation, based on the same bogus legal theories on behalf of the \nState of New York.\n  In New York v. Sturm, Ms. Halligan argued that gun manufacturers \ncontributed to a public nuisance of illegal handguns in the State. \nTherefore, she argued that gun manufacturers should be liable for \ncriminal conduct of third parties. The New York appellate court, \nhowever, explicitly rejected her theory. The court explained that it \nhad ``never recognized [the] common law public nuisance cause of \naction'' that Ms. Halligan had advanced. Moreover, the court correctly \nconcluded that ``the Legislative and Executive branches are better \nsuited to address the societal problems concerning the already heavily \nregulated commercial activity at issue.''\n  While we were debating the gun liability bill, Ms. Halligan delivered \na speech where she expressed her strong opposition to that legislation. \nShe opposed it because it would stop the type of lawsuit she was \npursuing. She said:\n\n       If enacted, this would nullify lawsuits brought by nearly \n     30 cities and counties--including one filed by my office--as \n     well as scores of lawsuits brought by individual victims or \n     groups harmed by gun violence. . . . Such an action would \n     likely cut off at the pass any attempt by States to find \n     solutions--through the legal system or their own \n     legislatures--that might reduce gun crime or promote greater \n     responsibility among gun dealers.\n\n  Later in that same speech, she expressed her view of the law and \nlegal system. She said:\n\n       Courts are the special friend of liberty. Time and again, \n     we have seen how the dynamics of our rule of law enables \n     enviable social progress and mobility.\n\n  This statement is very troubling, especially as it relates to the \nnuisance lawsuit against gun manufacturers. Those lawsuits are a prime \nexample of how activists on the far left try to use the courts to \neffect social policy changes they are somehow unable or unwilling to \nfight to achieve through the ballot box. That is why I believe those \nlawsuits represent not only bad policy but, more broadly, an activist \napproach to the law.\n  I am also concerned about Ms. Halligan's views on the war on terror \nand the detention of enemy combatants. This is especially troubling \nbecause Ms. Halligan is the nominee for the DC Circuit Court, where we \nknow a lot of these issues are often heard.\n  In 2004, Ms. Halligan was a member of the New York City Bar \nAssociation that published a report entitled ``The Indefinite Detention \nof Enemy Combatants and National Security in the Context of the War on \nTerror.'' That report argued there were constitutional concerns with \nthe detention of terrorists in military custody. It also argued \nvigorously against trying enemy combatants in military tribunals. \nInstead, it argued in favor of trying terrorists in civilian article \nIII courts.\n  As I said, Ms. Halligan is listed as one of the authors of that \nreport. But when it came to testifying at her hearing, Ms. Halligan \ntried to distance herself from that report. She testified she did not \nbecome aware of the report until 2010. In a followup letter after her \nhearing, Ms. Halligan did concede ``it is quite possible that [a draft \nof the report] was sent to me,'' but she could not recall reading the \nreport.\n  I recognize memories fade over time. But as I assess her testimony, I \nthink it is noteworthy that at least four other members of the \ncommittee abstained from the final report. Ms. Halligan did not.\n  I also point out that she coauthored an amicus brief before the \nSupreme Court in a 2009 case of Al-Marri v. Spagone. Ms. Halligan's \nbrief in that case took a position similar to the 2004 report with \nrespect to military detention of terrorists. In that case, she argued \nthat the authorization for use of military force law did not authorize \nthe seizure and indefinite military detention of a lawful permanent \nresident alien who conspired with al-Qaida to execute terror attacks on \nour country.\n  The fact that Ms. Halligan coauthored this brief, pro bono, suggests \nto\n\n[[Page S8351]]\n\nme she supported the conclusions reached by the 2004 report. Again, \nthis issue is particularly troublesome for a nominee to the DC Circuit, \nwhere, as I have already said, many of these questions are heard.\n  There are a number of other aspects of her record that concern me. \nFor instance, she authored an informal opinion on behalf of Attorney \nGeneral Spitzer regarding New York's domestic relations law. That \nopinion invoked a theory of an evolving Constitution.\n  As New York's solicitor general, Ms. Halligan was responsible for \nrecommending to the attorney general that the State intervene in \nseveral high-profile Supreme Court cases. She filed amicus briefs that \nconsistently took activist positions on controversial issues, such as \nabortion, affirmative action, immigration, and federalism.\n  I will give you some instances. In Scheidler v. National Organization \nfor Women, she supported NOW's claim that pro-life groups had engaged \nin extortion.\n  In the twin affirmative action cases of Grutter v. Bollinger and \nGratz v. Bollinger, she argued that the use of race in college and law \nschool admissions was not only appropriate but constitutional.\n  In Hoffman Plastics Compounds v. NLRB, she argued that the NLRB \nshould have the authority to grant backpay to illegal aliens, even \nthough Federal law prohibits illegal aliens from working in the United \nStates.\n  Ms. Halligan represented New York in Massachusetts v. EPA, where a \nnumber of States argued that the Clean Air Act authorized and required \nthe EPA to regulate automobile emissions and other greenhouse gases \nassociated with climate change.\n  These are just some of my many concerns regarding the nominee's \njudicial philosophy and her approach to constitutional interpretation.\n  Based on her record, I do not believe she will be able to put aside \nher long record of liberal advocacy and be a fair and impartial jurist.\n  Yesterday, before the votes on the judicial nominations we confirmed, \nI made a few remarks regarding the history of this seat. So I will \nbriefly review again the approach I have been arguing for more than a \ndecade--and I had the support of other Senators--that there are too \nmany seats and it is an underworked circuit. It may come as a surprise \nto some, but this seat has been vacant for over 6 years. It became \nvacant in September 2005, when John Roberts was elevated to Chief \nJustice of our Supreme Court. But it has not been without a nominee for \nall that time.\n  In June of 2006, President Bush nominated an eminently qualified \nindividual for this seat, Peter Keisler. Mr. Keisler was widely lauded \nas a consensus bipartisan nominee. His distinguished record of public \nservice included service as Acting Attorney General. Despite his broad \nbipartisan support and qualifications, Mr. Keisler waited 918 days for \na committee vote that never came.\n  But Mr. Keisler was not the only one of President Bush's nominees to \nthe DC Circuit to receive a heightened level of scrutiny. In fact, when \nPresident Bush was President, his nominees to the DC Circuit did not \nsimply receive heightened scrutiny but were subjected to every \nconceivable form of obstruction.\n  Those of us who were here remember these debates very well: Estrada, \nRoberts, Griffith, Kavanaugh, Keisler, and Brown. All these nominees \nhad difficult and lengthy processes. This included delays, multiple \nfilibusters, multiple hearings, boycotting markups so we would not have \na quorum to vote on their confirmation, including even invoking the 2-\nhour rule during committee markup and other forms of obstruction.\n  I have not suggested we repeat all the tactics used by the other side \nemployed during the last Republican administration. I do believe, \nhowever, it is important to remind my colleagues of the precedents the \nother side established for nominees to this circuit.\n  There is one other relevant fact I would like to briefly discuss in \nconnection with this vote; that is, the workload of the DC Circuit. \nThat gets back to what I have already referred to--that it has been \nunderworked compared to other circuits.\n  When Peter Keisler was nominated to the same seat, my friends on the \nother side objected to even holding a hearing for the nominee, based \nupon concerns about the workload of the DC Circuit. So here is \nsomething we tend to agree on, which has gone by the wayside now that \nwe have a nominee from the President of the other party for this same \nseat. During Mr. Keisler's hearing, one of my Democratic colleagues \nsummarized the threshold concerns. He said:\n\n       Here are the questions that just loom out there: 1) Why are \n     we proceeding so fast here? 2) Is there a genuine need to \n     fill this seat? 3) Has the workload of the DC circuit not \n     gone down? 4) Should taxpayers be burdened with the cost of \n     filling that seat? 5) Does it not make sense, given the \n     passion with which arguments were made only a few years ago, \n     to examine these issues before we proceed?\n\n  So we have five very important questions that are applicable today \nfrom a Member on the other side of the aisle.\n  I have not heard these same concerns expressed by my friends on the \nother side with respect to Ms. Halligan's nomination. But that does not \nmean these issues have gone away.\n  Statistics from the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts show \nthat caseloads on the DC Circuit have decreased markedly over the last \nseveral years. This decrease is evident in both the total number of \nappeals filed and the total number of appeals pending. Specifically, \nthe total number of appeals filed decreased by over 14 percent between \n2005, when there were 1,379 appeals filed, and the year 2010, when only \n1,178 appeals were filed.\n  The workload decline is also demonstrated in the per-panel and per-\njudge statistics. Filings per panel and filings per judge show a \ndecline of nearly 7 percent during this period. Pending appeals per \npanel dropped over 9 percent.\n  When you examine the caseload statistics in relationship to other \ncircuit courts, the DC Circuit ranks last in nearly every category. For \ninstance, the DC Circuit has the fewest total appeals filed per panel \nand only half as many appeals filed per panel as the 10th circuit, \nwhich has the second fewest in the country. They have the fewest number \nof appeals terminated per judge. And again, they have roughly half as \nmany terminations per judge as the second least busy circuit--again, \nthe 10th circuit.\n  They have the fewest signed written decisions per active judge, with \n57. By way of comparison, the second circuit has 5 times as many, with \n270 per active judge. The 10th circuit has roughly 4 times as many, \nwith 240 per judge. They have fewest total appeals terminated per \npanel, with 347.\n  By way of comparison, the 11th circuit had over 4 times as many total \nappeals terminated in 2010, with 1,574. The ninth circuit had nearly 4 \ntimes as many, with 1,394. And the second and fifth circuits each had \n1,329.\n  Given these statistics, we should be having a discussion on reducing \nthe staffing for this court, not filling a vacancy. This seat is not a \njudicial emergency. And with our massive debt and deficit, I don't \nunderstand why we would be spending our time and resources, \nparticularly on a highly controversial nomination.\n  Given the concerns I have about Ms. Halligan's record on the second \namendment, the war on terror, and other issues, my concerns regarding \nher activist judicial philosophy and the Court's low workload, I oppose \nthis nomination, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I would note in closing the number of organizations expressing their \nopposition to this nomination: the American Conservative Union, the \nNational Rifle Association, Gun Owners of America, Citizens Committee \nfor the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, Committee for Justice, Concerned \nWomen of America, the American Center for Law and Justice, Heritage \nAction, Liberty Counsel, Family Research Council, Eagle Forum, and \nthere are others.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to executive session to consider the following \nnomination, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Caitlin Joan \nHalligan, of New York, to be United States Circuit Judge for the \nDistrict of Columbia Circuit.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there \nwill be time for debate until noon, equally divided in the usual form.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, some of the people I have heard who \noppose Ms. Halligan were also some of the same people who successfully \nopposed an effort in the Congress to actually protect police officers a \nfew years ago. So I want to put the opposition in context. It is \nprobably why so many law enforcement groups support Ms. Halligan, \nbecause she stood up for law enforcement, unlike some of the groups we \nhave heard about who oppose her, who sought to make the life of police \nofficers more dangerous.\n  Be that as it may, the Senate stands at a crossroads today. Voting to \nend the partisan filibuster of this judicial nomination is as important \nas it was when the Senate did so in connection with the nomination of \nJudge McConnell to the United States District Court of Rhode Island \nearlier this year. If we allow the partisan filibuster to go forward, \nthen the Senate will be setting a new standard that no nominee can meet \nif they wish to be confirmed to the DC Circuit.\n  Republican Senators who just a few years ago argued that filibusters \nagainst judicial nominees were unconstitutional and said that they \nwould never support such a filibuster, and those who care about the \njudiciary in the Senate, need to step forward and do the right thing. \nYou cannot say that filibusters against judicial nominees are \nunconstitutional when you have a Republican President but suddenly \nsupport a filibuster when you have a Democratic President. This goes \neven beyond the standards that have driven the approval rating of \nCongress to an all-time low for hypocrisy. We ought to end the \nfilibuster now and proceed to vote on this extraordinarily well-\nqualified nominee.\n  Ms. Halligan, nominated to fill one of three vacant seats on the \nimportant DC Circuit, is a highly regarded appellate advocate. She has \nthe kind of impeccable credentials in both public service and private \npractice that have been looked for in the past by both Democratic and \nRepublican Presidents. Her nomination reminds me of John Roberts, when \nhe was confirmed by every single Democrat and every single Republican \nto the DC Circuit in 2003. I certainly did not agree with every \nposition he had taken or argument he had made as a high-level lawyer in \nseveral Republican administrations, but I supported his nomination to \nthe DC Circuit, as I did to the Supreme Court, because of his legal \nexcellence and ability.\n  It is frustrating to have Senators tell me privately they know Ms. \nHalligan is just as qualified as John Roberts was, but this lobby and \nthat lobby are against her. Lobbyists come and go. The court is \nsupposed to be the epitome of justice in this country.\n  I trusted John Roberts' testimony that he would fairly apply the law \nif confirmed. If the standard we used for him is applied to Ms. \nHalligan, there is no question this filibuster will end and Caitlin \nHalligan will be confirmed.\n  By any traditional standard, Caitlin Halligan is the kind of superbly \nqualified nominee who should easily be confirmed by the Senate. Yet, \nthe Senate Republican leadership's filibuster of this nomination \nthreatens to set a new standard that could not be met by anyone. It \nwould not have been met by John Roberts. If this is the new standard, \nit is wrong, it is unjustified and it is dangerous. Overcoming it will \ntake a handful of sensible Senate Republicans willing to buck their \nleadership and some single-issue lobbyists. They have done it before \nand they should again now. Those who care about the judiciary--and as \nimportant, those who care about the Senate--need to come forward and \nend this filibuster.\n  From the beginning of the Obama administration, we have seen too many \nSenate Republicans shift significantly away from the standards they \nused to apply to the judicial nominations of a Republican President. \nDuring the administration of the last President, a Republican, they \ninsisted that filibusters of judicial nominees were unconstitutional. \nThey threatened the ``nuclear option'' in 2005 to guarantee up-or-down \nvotes for each of President Bush's judicial nominations.\n  Many Republican Senators declared that they would never support the \nfilibuster of a judicial nomination. Yet, only a few years later, \nSenate Republicans reversed course and filibustered President Obama's \nvery first judicial nomination, that of Judge David Hamilton of \nIndiana. They tried to prevent an up or down vote on his nomination \neven though he was nominated by President Obama after consultation with \nthe most senior and longest-serving Republican in the Senate, Senator \nDick Lugar of Indiana, who strongly supported the nomination. The \nSenate rejected that unjustified filibuster and Judge Hamilton was \nconfirmed with Senator Lugar's support.\n  With their latest filibuster, the Senate Republican leadership seeks \nto set yet another new standard, one that threatens to make \nconfirmation of any nominee to the DC Circuit virtually impossible for \nthe future. Caitlin Halligan is a well-qualified nominee with a \nmainstream record as a brilliant advocate on behalf of the State of New \nYork and in private practice. She served for nearly six years as \nSolicitor General of New York and has been a leading appellate lawyer \nin private practice, currently serves as General Counsel at the New \nYork County District Attorney's Office, and has served as counsel of \nrecord in nearly 50 matters before the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing five \ncases before that court and many cases before Federal and state \nappellate courts. She clerked for Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer \nand for Judge Patricia Wald on the DC Circuit, the court to which she \nhas been nominated. No Senator has or can question her qualifications. \nI have reviewed her record carefully in the course of the Judiciary \nCommittee's thorough process, including her response to our extensive \nquestionnaire and her answers to questions at her hearing and in \nwriting following the hearing. In my view, there is no legitimate \nreason or justification for filibustering her nomination.\n  Yesterday, I put into the Record some of the many letters of support \nwe have received from across the political spectrum for Ms. Halligan's \nnomination. These letters are a testament to both her exceptional \nqualifications to serve and to the fact that this should be a consensus \nnomination, not a source of controversy and contention. They attest to \nthe fact she is not a closed-minded idealogue, but is the kind of \nnominee who has demonstrated not only legal talent but also a \ndedication to the rule of law throughout her career. We should \nencourage nominees with the qualities of Ms. Halligan to engage in \npublic service. We should welcome people like her to serve on the \nFederal bench, not denigrate them. Concocted controversies and a \nblatant misreading of Ms. Halligan's record as an advocate are no \nreason to obstruct this outstanding nomination.\n  I also demonstrated yesterday that any so-called ``caseload'' concern \nis no justification for filibustering this nomination. This was not a \nconcern we heard from Republicans when they voted to confirm President \nBush's nominees to fill not only the 9th seat, but also the 10th seat \nand the 11th seat on this court a couple of years ago. They should not \nnow use caseload as an excuse to filibuster President Obama's \nnomination to fill the ninth seat when the DC Circuit's caseload has \nincreased. There are only two differences today than when President \nBush's nominees to the DC Circuit were confirmed in 2005 and 2006: One, \nthe caseload per active judge has increased, not decreased; and we have \na Democratic President, not a Republican President.\n  The DC Circuit is often considered the second most important court in \nthe land because of the complex cases that it handles, cases that have \ngrown in\n\n[[Page S8353]]\n\nimportance since the attacks of September 11. As noted in a recent \nWashington Post editorial: ``[Caseload numbers do] not take into \naccount the complexity and scope of the cases that land at the court. \nThey include direct appeals involving federal regulatory decisions and \nnational security matters, including cases stemming from the detentions \nat the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.'' I ask unanimous \nconsent that a copy of this editorial and one from today's Boston Globe \nbe printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks, along with \nletters to the editor of the Washington Post in support of Ms. \nHalligan's nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1)\n  Mr. LEAHY: Yet the DC Circuit is now more than one-quarter vacant, \nwith three judicial vacancies. The caseload per active judge has gone \nup since Republican Senators supported every one of President Bush's \nnominations to that court. According to the Administrative Office of \nU.S. Courts, the caseload per active judge has increased by one third \nsince 2005, when the Senate confirmed President Bush's nomination of \nThomas Griffith to fill the 11th seat on the DC Circuit. That is \nright--the DC Circuit's caseload has actually increased. By any \nobjective measure, the work of the DC Circuit has grown, and the \nmultiple vacancies should be filled, not preserved and extended for \npartisan purposes. The ``extraordinary circumstance'' that exists here \nis the more than one-quarter vacancy level on this court, with only \neight active judges.\n  If caseloads were really a concern of Republican Senators, they would \nnot be standing by while their leadership delays Senate consideration \nof the nominations of Morgan Christen of Alaska and Jacqueline Nguyen \nof California to the Ninth Circuit, and Judge Adalberto Jordan of \nFlorida to the Eleventh Circuit. These two circuits have the highest \nnumber of cases per active judge. The Ninth Circuit is burdened by \nmultiple vacancies and the largest caseload in the nation. Judge Nguyen \nis nominated to fill the judicial emergency vacancy that remains open \nafter the Republican filibuster of Goodwin Liu. I have repeatedly urged \nthe Senate to take up and consider these nominations, which are \nsupported by home state Senators, yet Republicans have refused to \nconsider them for months. Anyone truly concerned about courts' \ncaseloads should join with me to consider the other 20 judicial \nnominations still pending on the Senate calendar and awaiting final \naction.\n  Given Caitlin Halligan's impeccable credentials and widespread \nsupport, this should be the kind of consensus nomination supported by \nSenators of both parties who seek to ensure that the Federal bench \ncontinues to attract the best and the brightest. Certainly, by the \nstandard utilized in 2005 to end filibusters and vote on President \nBush's controversial nominees, this filibuster should be ended and the \nSenate should vote on the nomination. Those Senators who claim to \nsubscribe to a standard that prohibits filibusters of judicial nominees \nexcept in ``extraordinary circumstances'' should keep their word and \nnot support this filibuster. There are no ``extraordinary \ncircumstances'' to justify the filibuster.\n  In 2005, Senator Graham, a member of the ``Gang of 14'' described his \nview of what comprises the ``extraordinary circumstances'' justifying a \nfilibuster. He said: ``Ideological attacks are not an `extraordinary \ncircumstance.' To me, it would have to be a character problem, an \nethics problem, so allegations about the qualifications of a person, \nnot an ideological bent.'' Caitlin Halligan has no character problem, \nno ethics problem, and there is no justification for this filibuster. \nCaitlin Halligan is a superbly qualified nominee whose personal \nintegrity, temperament, and abilities have been attested to by the many \nleading lawyers who have worked with her and against her. They all \nattest to her integrity and temperament and abilities.\n\n  The signers of the 2005 Memorandum of Understanding, and the Senate, \ndemonstrated what they thought that agreement entailed when they \nproceeded to invoke cloture on a number of controversial nominations. \nThe Senate invoked cloture on the nominations of Janice Rogers Brown \nand Thomas Griffith to the DC Circuit, the circuit to which Caitlin \nHalligan has been nominated.\n  As a Justice on the California Supreme Court, Janice Rogers Brown was \na nominee with a consistent and extensive record, both on the bench and \noff, of using her position as a member of the court to put her views \nabove the law. This was not a question of one case or one issue on \nwhich Democrats differed with the nominee--I have voted for hundreds of \nnominees of Republican and Democratic Presidents which whom I differ on \nmany issues. But this was a nominee with views so extreme she was \nopposed not just by her home state Senators, but also by more than 200 \nlaw school professors from around the Nation who wrote to the Committee \nexpressing their opposition. Her record in numerous decisions as a \njudge showed that she was willing to put her personal views above the \nlaw on issue after issue, including a willingness to roll back the \nclock 100 years on workers' and consumers' rights, to undermine clean \nair and clean water protections for Americans and their communities, \nlaws providing affordable housing, zoning laws that protect homeowners, \nand protections against sexual harassment, race discrimination, \nemployment discrimination, and age discrimination. In fact, while \nserving on the California Supreme Court, Justice Brown had argued that \nSocial Security was unconstitutional, a position clearly at odds with \nwell established law. She went so far as to say ``today's senior \ncitizens blithely cannibalize their grandchildren.''\n  Despite her ideological extremism and willingness to implement her \nradical personal views as a judge without regard to the existing law, \nshe was confirmed to the DC Circuit. Her nomination was judged not to \npresent ``extraordinary circumstances'' supporting a filibuster. There \nis no justification under the standard applied to the nomination of \nJanice Rogers Brown for a filibuster of the nomination of Caitlin \nHalligan, a widely-respected nominee with a clear devotion to the rule \nof law and no record of ideological extremism.\n  The nomination of Thomas Griffith to the DC Circuit was also \ndetermined not to present ``extraordinary circumstances'' despite his \ndecision to practice law without a license for a good part of his \ncareer, which I felt should be disqualifying. He was confirmed to fill \nthe 11th seat on the DC Circuit. There is no question that under the \nstandard Republicans applied to the nomination of Thomas Griffith, \nCaitlin Halligan should be confirmed to fill the ninth judgeship on \nthat court.\n  I urge Republican and Democratic Senators to come together and end \nthis misguided filibuster of Caitlin Halligan's nomination to the DC \nCircuit. There is no basis under any appropriate standard for blocking \nher nomination from having an up-or-down vote. To the contrary, Caitlin \nHalligan's impeccable credentials and record as an accomplished \nadvocate make her nomination worthy of bipartisan support.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                 [From the Boston Globe, Dec. 6, 2011]\n\n                      Outrage Machine Grinds Away\n\n                              (Editorial)\n\n       Discrediting perfectly qualified nominees to the federal \n     judiciary is a dreary, familiar business--one whose latest \n     target is Caitlin Halligan, a former New York solicitor \n     general who once clerked for Supreme Court Justice Stephen \n     Breyer. Ever since President Obama nominated her for the DC \n     Circuit Court of Appeals last year, critics have been combing \n     her record for evidence of dangerous radicalism.\n       They haven't found any. But in the crude world of judicial-\n     nomination fights, a nuanced discussion of New York's \n     marriage laws becomes a self-evident slant toward same-sex \n     marriage. Others depict her as anti-gun because she signed a \n     brief in a liability suit against gun manufacturers. The \n     group Gun Owners of America has conveniently pre-written an \n     e-mail, which members can robo-send to their senators, \n     denouncing Halligan's nomination as ``inconceivable.''\n       Halligan may not be GOP senators' first choice for an \n     appellate-court seat. And if a Republican president had \n     chosen a former Texas solicitor general who'd clerked for \n     Antonin Scalia, some of the same groups now defending \n     Halligan would surely be scraping around for reasons why the \n     nominee was utterly unsuitable for the job. But the Senate \n     need not dignify these tactics.\n       In a way, Halligan is lucky; rather than stringing her \n     along endlessly, the Senate has scheduled a vote today to end \n     debate on her\n\n[[Page S8354]]\n\n     nomination. GOP senators--including Scott Brown--should \n     acknowledge that her views appear to be well within the legal \n     mainstream, and vote to end the filibuster against her. Her \n     nomination deserves, at the least, an up-or-down confirmation \n     vote.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 22, 2011]\n\n    Senate Should Confirm Caitlin Halligan to the D.C. Circuit Court\n\n                              (Editorial)\n\n       When Caitlin J. Halligan was nominated in 2010 to a seat on \n     the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, the \n     prestigious 11-member court had two vacancies. Today, there \n     are three, after Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg took senior status \n     this fall.\n       Yet some Senate Republicans argue that there is no need to \n     install Ms. Halligan because the court's caseload has shrunk. \n     Others look suspiciously on her purported views on \n     antiterrorism policy. GOP senators are grasping at straws to \n     block Ms. Halligan's ascension, perhaps in hopes of \n     preserving the vacancy for a Republican president to fill. \n     These lawmakers rightly objected to such tactics when \n     deployed by Democrats to stall or defeat well-qualified \n     Republican nominees; they should not revert to them now when \n     a Democrat controls the White House.\n       Ms. Halligan has had a distinguished career and deserves to \n     be confirmed. A graduate of the Georgetown University Law \n     Center, she clerked for D.C. Circuit Judge Patricia M. Wald \n     and later for Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer. She has \n     served as head of the appellate practice at a top New York \n     law firm, as solicitor general in that state and now as \n     general counsel for the New York County District Attorney's \n     Office in Manhattan. The American Bar Association gave Ms. \n     Halligan a unanimous well-qualified rating. The Senate \n     Judiciary Committee approved her nomination seven months ago; \n     she has been waiting for a floor vote ever since.\n       While it is true that caseloads have been inching downward \n     at the D.C. Circuit, the decline does not take into account \n     the complexity and scope of the cases that land at the court. \n     They include direct appeals involving federal regulatory \n     decisions and national security matters, including cases \n     stemming from the detentions at the U.S. naval base in \n     Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n       Critics note that Ms. Halligan's name appears on a 2004 \n     report by the New York City Bar Association that lambasted \n     the Bush administration for asserting the legal authority to \n     hold enemy combatants without trial until the cessation of \n     hostilities; the Supreme Court ultimately endorsed the \n     administration's position. Ms. Halligan acknowledges that she \n     was a member of the committee that wrote the report but \n     testified that she was not involved in its development or \n     writing and said she learned of it only in 2010, while \n     gathering material for the confirmation process. Ms. Halligan \n     testified that she did not agree with the report's \n     conclusions.\n       Some critics suggest that Ms. Halligan's repudiation is a \n     ``confirmation conversion.'' Yet no evidence to dispute her \n     account has emerged during the eight months since her \n     hearing. The report episode is odd but should not disqualify \n     Ms. Halligan, given the mountain of evidence that she is a \n     smart and well-qualified candidate.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              Franklin County,\n\n                                    Malone, NY, February 14, 2011.\n     Senator Patrick J.

Halligan, for \n     the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.\n       In my service as District Attorney of Franklin County in \n     rural upstate New York and as President of the District \n     Attorneys Association of the State of New York, I have had \n     the distinct privilege of working closely with Ms. Halligan \n     during the past year. In her position as General Counsel to \n     Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance, Jr., she has \n     consistently demonstrated her unconditional support of the \n     interests of law enforcement and has lent her exceptional \n     expertise as an advocate for the rule of law to the complex \n     issues that confront our state across its many varied \n     interests.\n       Having first heard of Ms. Halligan's remarkable legal \n     abilities during her tenure as Solicitor General of New York \n     State under Governor George Pataki, I am delighted now to \n     have learned firsthand that she is a consummate ``lawyer's \n     lawyer''. She has unparalleled legal reasoning skills and a \n     firm commitment to our constitutional values.\n       Thank you for this opportunity to express my support for \n     this exceptional judicial candidate.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                               Derek P. Champagne,\n     District Attorney.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                           County of Onondaga,\n\n                                  Syracuse, NY, February 16, 2011.\n     Re Caitlin Halligan.\n\n     Senator Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: I write this letter in support of the \n     President's nomination of Caitlin Halligan for the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n       By way of a brief introduction, I am a career prosecutor, \n     having served twenty years as the elected District Attorney \n     of Onondaga County (just under a half a million population) \n     in Upstate New York and ten years as an assistant district \n     attorney prior to that. I am the New York State \n     representative to the National District Attorneys Association \n     and serve on that body's Executive Committee. I am also co-\n     chairman of the American Bar Association's Criminal Justice \n     Section's Committee on Science and Technology and I have been \n     appointed by Governors Pataki, Spitzer and Cuomo to serve on \n     New York State's Forensic Science Commission. I am a past \n     President of the New York State District Attorneys \n     Association and currently serve on its Board of Directors. I \n     am also a life long Republican, but nobody's perfect.\n       Cy Vance is the current District Attorney of New York \n     county having succeeded the legendary Bob Morgenthau. Cy is a \n     good friend and has quickly established himself in New York \n     as an outstanding prosecutor and a resource for his sixty-one \n     other colleagues throughout the State. And one of the really \n     great things that Cy does is surround himself with quality \n     people. A perfect example of one of those quality people is \n     Caitlin Halligan, currently Cy's General Counsel at the \n     Manhattan District Attorney's Office.\n       Caitlin's resume makes it hard to believe she is only \n     forty-four years old. Educated at Princeton with a law degree \n     from Georgetown, Caitlin served as law clerk to two of \n     America's most illustrious jurists. Her service to my home \n     State of New York has been both distinguished and invaluable. \n     As a member of the Attorney General's Internet Bureau, \n     Caitlin helped develop initiatives to battle on-line fraud \n     and protect individual privacy. Many of those initiatives are \n     still employed by local offices. Rising through the ranks of \n     the Attorney General's Office, Caitlin for five years served \n     as our State's Solicitor General, arguing cases before all \n     appellate levels, including the United States Supreme Court. \n     Caitlin's reputation was nothing short of outstanding which \n     is one of many reasons my friend Cy Vance was lucky enough to \n     entice her back into public service as his General Counsel.\n       I fully understand the political give and take of the \n     nomination process, particularly when the position is of such \n     import. Words uttered and position papers written decades \n     earlier take on greater significance. Each party would prefer \n     to have a nominee whose judicial philosophy is most closely \n     attuned to their core beliefs. Ultimately, it is the \n     President's choice and frankly I do not think any President, \n     Democrat or Republican, could find a more qualified, a more \n     honorable or a finer candidate than Caitlin Halligan.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           William J. Fitzpatrick,\n     District Attorney.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              Richmond County,\n\n                             Staten Island, NY, February 25, 2011.\n     Re Caitlin J. Halligan.\n\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: I write in support of the nomination of \n     Caitlin J. Halligan for a seat on the United States Court of \n     Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Ms. Halligan's experience and \n     accomplishments as an appellate lawyer make her an ideal \n     appointee to that Court.\n       Ms. Halligan, currently employed by the New York County \n     District Attorney's Office as General Counsel, has served as \n     First Deputy Solicitor General, then Solicitor General of the \n     State of New York and as head of the appellate practice \n     section at the New York law firm of Weil, Gotshal and Manges \n     LLP. In her time as First Deputy and then Solicitor General, \n     she was responsible not only for briefing and arguing her own \n     cases, but for supervising the appellate litigation conducted \n     by New York State's Attorney General as well.\n       In her time in private practice and in the Office of the \n     New York State Solicitor General, Ms. Halligan has briefed \n     and argued cases at all levels of appellate courts in the \n     United States, ranging from the United States Supreme Court \n     to New York State's intermediate appellate court, the \n     Appellate Division and has also supervised briefs filed in \n     those courts. The cases in which she has been involved, \n     either as principal attorney or supervisor, span such diverse \n     areas as prisoner civil rights matters, environmental, voting \n     rights and free speech issues, and commerce clause matters. \n     This breadth of practice areas--both in terms of the courts \n     in which Ms. Halligan has appeared and the nature of the \n     cases in which she has been involved--certainly has provided \n     Ms. Halligan with the background necessary for success as a \n     Circuit Court judge, particularly in view of the wide variety \n     of matters that will come before Ms. Halligan should she be \n     confirmed to a seat on the D.C. Circuit.\n       In short, Ms. Halligan's experience as an appellate \n     practitioner and the wide variety of issues with which she \n     has dealt will serve her well in her capacity as a Circuit \n     Judge and I am pleased to offer my support for her \n     confirmation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Daniel M.

She has extensive experience as an \n     appellate lawyer and has worked on many important cases being \n     handled by the most senior courts in our judicial system.\n       Our Board of Governors who represent police agencies across \n     the State from the largest to the smallest have unanimously \n     voted to endorse her nomination.

It is with enthusiasm that we support the appointment \n     of Ms. Halligan, a person of nobility and integrity to this \n     honorable position.\n       Her vast experience arguing cases before both state and \n     federal appellate courts coupled with her rapid advancement \n     in her career speak to her elevated level of intelligence and \n     integrity. Her pro bono work on the memorial for the World \n     Trade Center demonstrates her noble commitment to doing what \n     is right for individuals in need.

Halligan for the position of United States Circuit Judge \n     for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n       A division of the Feminist Majority Foundation, the NCWP \n     has been working since 1995 to educate criminal justice \n     policy makers, the media and the public about the impacts of \n     increasing the representation of women in policing. Our goals \n     include ensuring that gender is always considered during the \n     analysis of contemporary policing issues, and that law \n     enforcement agencies strive for gender balancing their \n     departments. We take great pride in helping to advance the \n     cause of professional policing and take very seriously our \n     obligations to support individuals who we believe will serve \n     our nation's criminal justice system overall.\n       Ms. Halligan is clearly an individual we would want to \n     support to serve our criminal justice system at the national \n     level. Her extensive experience either representing cases \n     before the Supreme Court or arguing cases before the state \n     and federal appellate courts whether as the Solicitor General \n     for New York State, the Counsel for New York County's \n     District Attorney Office or for private practice is \n     impressive. Her pro bono work on the memorial for the World \n     Trade Center is honorable. She is clearly a person of solid \n     standing and integrity a person we would want serving the \n     people at one of our highest courts.\n       We are confident she would provide fair and equal justice \n     and therefore respectfully request your consideration for Ms. \n     Halligan for this critical appointment.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                   Margaret Moore,\n     Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               National Conference\n\n\n                                  of Women's Bar Associations,\n\n                                      Portland, OR, June 23, 2011.\n     Re Nomination of Caitlin J.

Charles Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley: On behalf \n     of the Women's Bar Association of the District of Columbia \n     (WBA), we write to express the WBA's enthusiastic support for \n     Caitlin J. Halligan's nomination to the United States Court \n     of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n       Ms. Halligan is exceptionally well-qualified for the \n     position to which she has been nominated. Her confirmation \n     would add not only superior intellect, but also much needed \n     diversity to the federal appellate courts.\n       The WBA's principal goal in supporting judicial candidates \n     is to ensure the appointment of qualified judges and, \n     consistent with that goal, to increase the number of judges \n     who support the mission of the WBA. We give priority in our \n     recommendations to candidates with extensive litigation \n     experience, a demonstrated commitment to the equality of all \n     litigants, and an attention to women's needs and concerns. \n     The WBA evaluates each candidate for endorsement by reviewing \n     his or her resume and other supporting documentation, and by \n     discussing, with references the candidate's qualifications, \n     integrity, temperament, experience, and commitment to the \n     concepts of equal opportunity and equal justice under law.\n       Ms. Halligan is without question eminently qualified to \n     join the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. Her academic and \n     legal credentials are of the highest caliber. Ms. Halligan's \n     legal career began at Georgetown University Law Center, where \n     she graduated Order of the Coif and was Managing Editor of \n     the Georgetown Law Review. She subsequently clerked for Judge \n     Patricia M. Wald on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, and \n     later for Justice Stephen G. Breyer of the United States \n     Supreme Court. The majority of her outstanding legal career \n     has been focused upon public service. From 2001-2006, she \n     served as Solicitor General of the State of New York, and she \n     currently serves as General Counsel to the New York County \n     District Attorney's office. In between, Ms. Halligan headed \n     the appellate practice at Weil, Gotshal and Manges, LLP. She \n     has served as counsel of record for a party or amicus at the \n     certiorari or merits stage in more than 40 matters in the \n     United States Supreme Court. She has also argued five cases \n     before the Court, including as recently as March 2011, and \n     won awards from the National Association of Attorneys General \n     in five consecutive years as New York's Solicitor General.\n       Ms. Halligan's contributions to the legal profession have \n     extended well beyond her day job. She has taught as an \n     adjunct professor at Georgetown University Law Center,\n\n[[Page S8356]]\n\n     and as a Lecturer in Law at Columbia Law School. Ms. Halligan \n     has also made significant pro bono contributions, serving as \n     a member of the Boards of Directors of the National Center \n     for Law and Economic Justice and the Fund for Modern Courts, \n     as pro bono counsel to the Board of Directors of the Lower \n     Manhattan Development Corporation, and as counsel for \n     Hurricane Katrina and Rita evacuees before the Fifth Circuit. \n     Through her activities, Ms. Halligan has demonstrated a \n     commitment to the concepts of equal opportunity and equal \n     justice under law both inside and outside the courtroom.\n       Given her record of achievement and breadth of experience, \n     it is not surprising that Ms. Halligan has received a \n     unanimous rating of Well-Qualified from the ABA's Standing \n     Committee on the Federal Judiciary, the highest rating \n     available. She has the support of numerous organizations, \n     including the District Attorneys Association of the State of \n     New York, the National District Attorneys Association, the \n     New York State Association of Chiefs of Police, the New York \n     State Sheriffs Association, the New York Women in Law \n     Enforcement, and the National Center for Women & Policing. In \n     addition, a bi-partisan group of prominent appellate \n     practitioners that includes Cliff Sloan, Sri Srinivasan, \n     Miguel Estrada, Carter Phillips and numerous others has \n     submitted an enthusiastic letter praising the abilities and \n     character of Ms. Halligan and expressing their unanimous \n     belief that ``Caitlin is an outstanding selection for the \n     D.C. Circuit.''\n       Beyond Ms. Halligan's obvious qualifications, we must note \n     that her confirmation would add much needed diversity to the \n     federal bench. Out of 179 seats on the federal appellate \n     courts, only 50 are currently held by women. The D.C. Circuit \n     has eleven authorized judgeships, with two current vacancies, \n     but only three women are among the active judges. Ms. \n     Halligan possesses impeccable credentials and would be a \n     worthy addition to the DC Circuit.\n       For all of these reasons, the WBA is proud to support \n     Caitlin Halligan's nomination, and strongly urges the Senate \n     to vote to confirm her to the United States Court of Appeals \n     for the District of Columbia Circuit. She is a superlative \n     lawyer with a broad range of experience, and her commitment \n     to fairness, stellar intellect, judicious temperament, and \n     principled nature make Ms. Halligan a superb nominee. If you \n     have any questions regarding this letter of support, please \n     contact the WBA office.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Monica G. Parham,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Dec. 5, 2011]\n\n          Put Caitlin Halligan and Others on the D.C. Circuit\n\n       The Nov. 23 editorial ``Time to Pass Judgment'' argued that \n     the Senate should confirm Caitlin J. Halligan to a seat on \n     the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. I fully \n     agree. Ms. Halligan has excellent qualifications and appears \n     to be an extremely bright and capable judicial candidate. It \n     seems, however, that Senate Republicans have one major \n     problem with Ms. Halligan: She looks too much like a future \n     Supreme Court nominee. That is the same problem Senate \n     Democrats had with Miguel A. Estrada when they blocked his \n     appointment to the D.C. Circuit.\n       The Halligan and Estrada nominations are just two examples \n     of the petty and unnecessary charade that is the current \n     Senate judicial confirmation process. Though this problem is \n     decades old, perhaps President Obama could make a bold effort \n     at bilateral disarmament and prove his bipartisan bona fides \n     at the same time.\n       Assuming Ms. Halligan is confirmed, the D.C. Circuit will \n     still have two open seats, to which Obama should nominate Mr. \n     Estrada and Goodwin Liu. Both Mr. Estrada (a Bush nominee) \n     and Mr. Liu (an Obama nominee) are brilliant lawyers, and \n     both were blocked by tit-for-tat Senate politics. Such a move \n     by Mr. Obama could soften the gridlock that has plagued \n     judicial nominations for so many years.\n                                                       Jeff Luoma,\n                                                   North Bethesda.\n\n       In addition to all of the reasons that The Post's editorial \n     cited in urging that the Senate confirm Caitlin J. Halligan, \n     one other important factor is that this outstanding nominee \n     would be only the sixth female judge in the 118-year history \n     of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, thus \n     adding to the court's diversity.\n       Eight months is far too long to deprive the D.C. Circuit of \n     a nominee of Ms. Halligan's talents; the Senate should vote \n     Tuesday to cut off debate on her nomination and vote \n     immediately afterward to confirm her.\n                                            Marcia D. Greenberger,\n                                                       Washington.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I \nask unanimous consent that the time during the quorum be equally \ndivided.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I see the distinguished Senator from New York on the \nfloor, and I have a feeling that she will have a statement of support \nof this superb nominee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam President, I am very proud to support the \nnomination of Caitlin Halligan to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia.\n  Caitlin Halligan has distinguished herself through her commitment to \nfairness, reasoned intellect, personal ethics, and a profound respect \nfor the law. Unfortunately, it appears that some of my colleagues are \ndetermined to criticize her, regardless of the facts or her record. The \nmajor concern seems to be the workload demands for the DC Circuit. This \nis not a reason to oppose this candidate's nomination.\n  In 2008, the Senate acted to reduce the number of seats on the DC \nCircuit from 12 to 11, increasing the caseload for each of the judges. \nCurrently, there are only eight active judges on the DC Circuit, \nleaving the bench more than 27 percent vacant. That means the U.S. \nCircuit Court currently has three vacancies--three vacancies on a court \nthat is currently handling more than 1,200 cases; three vacancies on a \ncourt that handles some of the most complicated decisions, including \nterrorism cases.\n  Today we have the opportunity to fill one of these vacancies on the \nDC Circuit, often called the second most important court in the entire \nUnited States. The caseload of the DC Circuit has remained consistent \nsince 2005, while the number of cases per judge has increased by 33 \npercent. If Ms. Halligan is confirmed, it will reduce that caseload \nfrom its current level of approximately 161 pending cases to \napproximately 143 per judge, still substantially higher than during the \nprevious administration.\n  The DC Circuit Court of Appeals reviews complicated decisions and \nrulemaking of many Federal agencies and in recent years has handled \nsome of the most important terrorism and detention cases since the \nhorrific attacks on September 11. These cases are complex, requiring \nadditional time to allow for the consideration they demand.\n  Many of my colleagues have raised concerns with positions Ms. \nHalligan advocated while solicitor general of New York. She filed \nbriefs at the direction of the Attorney General. She was not promoting \nher own personal views. Many of these cases focused explicitly on New \nYork State's rights to govern in traditional State law areas.\n  Caitlin Halligan is a woman of superb intellect, a history of \nlaudable achievements, and a record of outstanding public service. Not \nonly does she deserve an up-or-down vote, but on the merits she \ndeserves the full support of the Senate. I ask my colleagues to allow \nfor an up-or-down vote on Caitlin Halligan's nomination. Let's debate \nMs. Halligan on her merits. She deserves nothing less.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, I rise to speak today in opposition to the \nnomination of Caitlin Halligan to be a judge in the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the DC Circuit.\n  The DC Circuit is arguably the most important Federal appellate court \nin our Federal judicial system, with primary responsibility to review \nadministrative decisions made by countless Federal departments and \nagencies. It has also served in many instances as a steppingstone for \njudges who are later appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court. As a result, \nthe Senate has historically very closely scrutinized nominees to the DC \nCircuit.\n  When evaluating particular nominees, we have also carefully \nconsidered the need for additional judges on that court.\n  In July 2006, President Bush nominated an eminently qualified lawyer, \nPeter Keisler, to fill a seat on the DC Circuit. Mr. Keisler is among \nthe very finest attorneys in the country. Because of his nonideological \napproach to the law, Mr. Keisler enjoys broad bipartisan support \nthroughout the legal profession. Despite these unassailable legal \nqualifications, Democratic Senators blocked his nomination. He did\n\n[[Page S8357]]\n\nnot receive any floor consideration whatsoever, not even a cloture \nvote, and his nomination languished in the Judiciary Committee. At the \ntime, a number of Democratic Senators sent a letter to the Judiciary \nCommittee chairman arguing that a nominee to the DC Circuit ``should \nunder no circumstances be considered, much less confirmed, before we \nfirst address the very need for that judgeship''--the judgeship he \nwould occupy. These Senators specifically argued that a DC Circuit's \ncomparatively moderate caseload in 2006 simply did not justify the \nconfirmation of an additional judge to that court.\n  Five years have now passed and Ms. Halligan has been nominated to \nthat very same seat on the DC Circuit. But the court's caseload remains \nas minimal as it did then. According to the Administrative Office of \nU.S. Courts, the DC Circuit caseload per judge is approximately one-\nfourth that of most other Federal courts of appeals. In each of the \npast 2 years, the DC Circuit has cancelled regularly scheduled argument \ndates due to lack of pending cases. For several years the court has \nexperienced a decline in workload in terms of total filings, actions \nper active judge, and pending appeals. Almost every metric indicates \nthe same direction. Indeed, since 2006, when Democrats blocked Mr. \nKeisler's nomination, the total number of appeals filed in the DC \nCircuit has decreased--decreased--by 12 percent.\n  According to the Democrats' own standards, and particularly when \nthere are judicial emergencies in other courts across the country, now \nis not the time to confirm another judge to the DC Circuit. It is most \ncertainly not the time for us to consider confirming a controversial \nnominee with a record of extreme views of the law and the Constitution. \nMany of my colleagues have discussed these views, so I will limit \nmyself this morning to one example.\n  In 2003, while serving as solicitor general of New York, Ms. Halligan \napproved and signed a legal brief arguing that handgun manufacturers, \nwholesalers, and retailers should be held liable for criminal actions \nthat individuals commit with those guns. Three years later, in 2006, \nMs. Halligan filed a brief alleging that handgun manufacturers were \nguilty of creating a public nuisance--that they, themselves, were \nguilty of creating a public nuisance. Such an activist approach is both \nbewildering and inconsistent with the original understanding of the \nsecond amendment and the rights under the second amendment that \nAmerican citizens enjoy.\n  In conclusion, as measured by the Democrats' own standards and their \nprior actions, now is not the time to confirm another judge to the DC \nCircuit, and it is certainly not the time to consider such a \ncontroversial nominee for that important court.\n  For these reasons, I cannot support Ms. Halligan's nomination, and \nurge my colleagues to oppose her confirmation.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEE. I ask unanimous consent that the quorum call be divided \nequally.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEE. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I believe \nwe have a set number of minutes left to discuss the nominee, Caitlin \nJoan Halligan, which is the subject here?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. How much time does the majority have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask that the final 8 minutes before we \nvote be reserved for that and that the Senator from Illinois be allowed \nto speak as in morning business for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                            Social Security\n\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I wish to speak as in morning business to \ntalk about the big issue pending before the Senate, which is the \npotential legislation by Republicans or Democrats to cut contributions \nto Social Security. I am very worried because in the legislation we \nconsidered last week, we had proposals to cut contributions to Social \nSecurity by $250 billion. This was legislation proposed by Democratic \nleaders and then a separate piece of legislation by Republican leaders. \nI think that legislation was a mistake on both sides.\n  We have precious few bipartisan institutions or contacts in this \nSenate. Senator Manchin and I--one Democratic and one Republican \nSenator, both freshmen--meet every Thursday for lunch. At our Thursday \nlunch last week, Senator Manchin initially said: I am having \ndifficulty. I don't think I am going to be able to vote for the \nDemocratic bill to cut Social Security contributions.\n  I said: I join you in that because I am not going to be able to vote \nfor the Republican bill that cuts Social Security contributions.\n  So the two of us voted pro-Social Security and against the \nlegislation before us.\n  I am very worried that we are forgetting the lessons that are \ncurrently playing out in Europe on this subject. As Margaret Thatcher \nsaid, ``Eventually socialists run out of other people's money.'' The \ncollapse of European socialism underscores the lesson that you cannot \nrun a retirement system without contributions.\n  We know already that the Social Security system is running slightly \nin the red. Contributions into the system are going to run $10 billion \nbehind the cost of honoring benefits to seniors. But under this \nlegislation we would underfund Social Security by $250 billion. We \nwould increase the tide of red ink to Social Security by 20 times. I \nthink that is a mistake.\n  AARP tells us that Social Security is not a welfare program, it is a \nretirement security program paid by the contributions of workers and we \nshould run this program with the contribution of workers.\n  Remember, if we make this decision to cut contributions to Social \nSecurity, we replace those contributions with government bonds, but the \ngovernment bonds we would ask seniors to trust no longer have a triple-\nA credit rating from Standard & Poor's. It is basically asking seniors \nto trust us.\n  When you look at the details of the Democratic bill and the \nRepublican bill, you see another disturbing trend. The Democratic and \nRepublican bills both depend on revenue streams that take many years to \nrepay what is lost to Social Security. Under the Republican bill, there \nare promised cuts which could be reversed by a future administration or \nCongress. It takes until 2018 to repay the senior citizens what has \nbeen lost in Social Security contributions under the trust fund. Under \nthe Democratic bill, there was a political tax on millionaires, and it \ntakes until 2021 to repay seniors.\n  The message that Senator Manchin and I had, as one Democrat and one \nRepublican, is, how about not charging seniors? How about not causing a \ntide of red ink to Social Security? How about making sure we maintain \ncontributions to that program? Seniors have enough to worry about right \nnow. They should not have to worry about the future solvency of Social \nSecurity.\n  One analyst described how, under the legislation, it requires \ntemporary borrowing of an additional $240 billion for the Federal \nbudget. I am worried that kind of borrowing could trigger an earlier \nloss of the debt limit of the United States, so we could trigger the \nbattle we all expect for next January to actually happen--ominously for \nthe President, prior to the election--if this legislation would pass.\n  Common sense should prevail, that we should run a retirement security\n\n[[Page S8358]]\n\nsystem with adequate contributions to maintain benefits, that we should \nagree on a bipartisan basis that Social Security is one of the most \nsuccessful Federal programs ever signed, that we should say to seniors: \nAmong all the other worries you have, you should not worry about \nCongress underfunding the trust fund for Social Security. We should say \nto seniors: We are not replacing solid contributions coming in from \nworkers with bonds that no longer have a AAA credit rating from \nStandard & Poor's.\n\n  I urge members of AARP to reach out to their leaders and say: We urge \nyou to forcefully advocate for maintaining adequate contributions to \nSocial Security; that we don't think promises of a millionaire's tax \nthat repays the debts until 2021 or spending cuts that repay the debts \nuntil 2018 are something we can fully trust.\n  So I urge Members of this body to maintain adequate contributions to \nSocial Security, to defeat both the Republican and Democratic bills, to \nlearn the lessons of Europe that we need to maintain a retirement \nsecurity system with adequate contributions, and that we should not \nsink the Social Security trust fund in a wave of red ink on gimmick \nlegislation which already would impinge the credit of the United States \nto a degree that it should not be impinged any further.\n  With that I yield the floor, and I thank my senior colleague from New \nYork.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the nomination \nof Caitlin Halligan to be a judge of the U.S. Circuit Court for the \nDistrict of Columbia.\n  I have carefully considered the background of this nominee and \nundertaken a full review of her public record as well as the records of \nthe Judiciary Committee hearings. I have also looked closely at the \nactual staffing needs of the court to which she has been nominated. \nWhile my review leads me to conclude that Ms. Halligan is well \nqualified, I am not convinced that the workload of the court justifies \nfilling the seat, and on that basis, I oppose the nomination.\n  This vacancy has existed since 2005 when then-Judge John Roberts was \nelevated to the Supreme Court. In June 2006, President Bush nominated \nPeter Keisler to fill the seat. Despite Mr. Keisler's strong \nqualifications, Democrats held up his nomination for a total of 918 \ndays; it eventually had to be withdrawn.\n  Central to their objection to Mr. Keisler's nomination was their \ncontention that the court's caseload did not justify filling the \nvacancy. As expressed by a Democratic Judiciary Committee member during \nMr. Keisler's confirmation hearing and later reiterated by all eight \ncommittee Democrats in a letter to the chairman urging the nomination \nbe put on hold:\n\n       We are putting the cart before the horse here. . . . Here \n     are the questions that just loom out there. Is there a \n     genuine need to fill this seat? Has not the workload of the \n     D.C. Circuit gone down? Should taxpayers be burdened with the \n     cost of filling that seat? . . . We have been told repeatedly \n     that to fill this seat would be a waste of taxpayer money and \n     a shameful triumph of big government. Why then are we \n     speeding towards confirmation here?\n\n  Since that statement, even with this seat still vacant, statistics \nfrom the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts show that the \ncaseload of the DC Circuit has actually continued to decrease markedly \nover the last several years and that, with a smaller court, more \nappeals were terminated during this same period\n  This decrease is evident in both the total number of appeals filed \nand the total number of appeals pending. Specifically, the total number \nof appeals filed in the DC Circuit decreased by more than 14 percent \nbetween 2005, when 1,379 appeals were filed, and 2010--the latest \ncomplete year for which statistics are available--when 1,178 appeals \nwere filed. Meanwhile, with a smaller court, more appeals were \nterminated during this period. The total number of appeals pending was \nreduced from 1,463 appeals to 1,293 appeals. This is a decrease of \nnearly 12 percent.\n  The shrinking workload is also demonstrated in the per-panel and per-\njudge statistics. Filings per panel and filings per judge show a \ndecline of nearly 7 percent during this period as well. Pending appeals \nper panel dropped over 9 percent. Interestingly, the DC Circuit ranks \nlast among the circuit courts in 2010 in this category. That means it \nhas the lightest workload per panel.\n  Given the declining workloads, the Senate should be debating reducing \nthe staffing for this court, not filling a vacancy. With our massive \ndeficit, belts being tightened everywhere, and critical vacancies \nexisting on other Federal courts, why should we spend the resources--\nestimated at over $1 million a year--to fill this seat? Why are we \neating up legislative time debating a nominee we likely don't need, \ninstead of moving forward to nominees for vacancies that have become \njudicial emergencies and demand more immediate attention?\n  It is discouraging to note that now that the candidate for this seat \nis a Democratic nominee and not a Republican, all of my friends on the \nother side of the aisle seem to have forgotten their concerns about the \ncaseload, even though the court's own statistics show it has markedly \ndeclined. In fact, when the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, recently \nsought to amend a judicial staffing bill before the Judiciary Committee \nthis last October to cut a seat on the DC Circuit, Committee Democrats \nvoted it down.\n  Mr. President, given the facts, I firmly believe that filling this \nvacancy before we determine whether the position is or is not \nsuperfluous to the court's needs, is indeed, as Judiciary Committee \nDemocrats noted in 2006, ``putting the cart before the horse.'' Until \nthat determination is made, I cannot support filling this vacancy \nregardless of the nominee's qualifications. Consequently, I will oppose \ncloture on the nomination.\n  Mr. HATCH. I rise today in opposition to the nomination of Caitlin \nHalligan to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. I reached \nthis conclusion after applying the same standard I use for all judicial \nnominations. The Senate owes some deference to the President regarding \njudicial nominees who are qualified by virtue of their legal experience \nand, more importantly, their judicial philosophy. I want to briefly \nmention a few of the reasons why this controversial nominee fails to \nmeet this standard.\n  One hallmark of an activist judicial philosophy is trying to use the \ncourts to solve problems or address issues that properly belong in the \nlegislative branch. Both as solicitor general of New York and in \nprivate practice, Ms. Halligan argued that gun manufacturers should be \nheld liable for the illegal use of their products. She argued that \nillegally possessed handguns are a so-called public nuisance for which \nmanufacturers should be held responsible. The New York Court of Appeals \nrejected this radical theory and properly concluded that such social \nproblems should be addressed by the legislative or executive branches \nrather than the judicial branch.\n  Undeterred, Ms. Halligan next went to Federal court to challenge the \nconstitutionality of the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. \nCongress enacted that statute so that manufacturers would not be held \nliable for the illegal use of their products. That measure passed the \nHouse and the Senate by at least a 2-to-1 margin. In this body, 14 \nDemocrats voted for the bill, including 10 who still serve today. As \nhad the New York Court of Appeals, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nSecond Circuit rejected Ms. Halligan's position, upholding the statute \nand dismissing the litigation.\n  Ms. Halligan has also taken extreme positions regarding the war on \nterrorism. I know that liberals do not even want to call it that today, \nbut the reality is that we remain at war against foreign terrorists \nbent on murdering American civilians. Ms. Halligan would give captured \nterrorists, who are making war on the United States, access to civilian \ncourts, a right never before recognized in American history. Ms. \nHalligan was a member of a New York City bar committee that issued a \nreport on the indefinite detention of enemy combatants. This is \nparticularly important because the DC Circuit, to which Ms. Halligan \nhas been nominated, is the most important lower court for terrorism \ncases. She did not abstain from signing the report, as four other \ncommittee members did, and so its content and conclusions can be \nattributed to her.\n  She argued in that report that the authorization for use of military \nforce,\n\n[[Page S8359]]\n\nor AUMF, does not authorize long-term detention of enemy combatants and \nthat alien terrorists should be tried in civilian courts rather than in \nmilitary commissions. The Supreme Court and the Obama administration \nhave since rejected or abandoned such positions. After the Supreme \nCourt held, in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, that the AUMF does authorize military \ndetention of resident aliens, Ms. Halligan coauthored a brief arguing \notherwise. Not until her Judiciary Committee hearing this year did Ms. \nHalligan even try to distance herself from these extreme positions, \nsomething that my friends on the other side of the aisle would call a \nconfirmation conversion if she were a Republican.\n  Unfortunately, this was not the only example of Ms. Halligan getting \nbehind novel rights that have no grounding in our Constitution or legal \ntraditions. Ms. Halligan filed a brief in Roper v. Simmons arguing that \nevolving standards of decency today forbid the execution of individuals \nwho committed murder before the age of 18. This is judicial activism at \nits worst, giving judges complete control of the Constitution that they \nare supposed to follow. America's Founders insisted that the meaning of \nthe Constitution does not change until the people change it and that \neven judges are bound to follow that meaning. Today, in contrast, the \nSupreme Court says that the meaning of the Constitution is evolving and \nthat judges are in charge of that evolution.\n  The fact that Ms. Halligan appears to be solidly in that judicial \nactivist camp is bad enough and is alone grounds to oppose her \nnomination. Perhaps sensing that such activism is deeply unpopular \namong the American people and their elected representatives, she did an \nabout-face at her confirmation hearing and said that the Constitution \nshould be interpreted based on the people's original meaning rather \nthan on judges' evolving understandings. So it is legitimate to ask \nwhich Ms. Halligan is the real Ms. Halligan--the Ms. Halligan who would \ncreate new rights, while ignoring the clear language of the \nConstitution that protects the right to bear arms, or the Ms. Halligan \nwho at the last minute has become a convert to originalism?\n  I think her record speaks for itself.\n  Ms. Halligan also filed a brief in Scheidler v. National Organization \nfor Women arguing that pro-life protesters should be prosecuted under \nthe Federal racketeering statute because they somehow commit extortion. \nHer argument would require the courts literally to rewrite both the \nracketeering statute and the extortion statute and is another example \nof Ms. Halligan seeking to pursue her political agenda in the judicial \nrather than in the legislative branch. I believe instead that the \npolitical ends do not justify the judicial means and, thankfully, the \nSupreme Court voted 8 to 1 to reject her position.\n  In addition to her troubling record, it is worth noting that the \nposition to which Ms. Halligan has been nominated hardly fits the \ncategory of a judicial emergency. The Senate has this year already \nconfirmed nearly 20 percent more judges than the annual average over \nthe past couple of decades, with, I am sure, more to come. We have paid \nparticular attention to filling long-term vacancies in jurisdictions \nwith heavy caseloads. Yet, between 1993 and 2010, annual case filings \nin the DC Circuit decreased by twice the percentage that filings \nincreased in other circuits. The DC Circuit's caseload per judge is \nliterally one-fourth what it is for other circuits. It has ranked last \nfor years among all circuits in the number of appeals filed per three-\njudge panel, even after one of its seats was transferred to the Ninth \nCircuit and even with multiple vacancies. The DC Circuit's caseload is \nlower today than when Democrats used this caseload argument to block \nthe nomination to this court of Peter Keisler, who waited more than 900 \ndays without a committee vote.\n  As my colleagues know, I do not oppose judicial nominees often or \nlightly. While Ms. Halligan appears to be an experienced lawyer and I \nam sure is a fine person, those are insufficient qualifications for \njudicial service. The most important qualification is her judicial \nphilosophy, or the kind of judge she would be. The record shows that \nshe embraces the activist judicial approach that I believe is \nincompatible with the power and proper role of judges in our system of \ngovernment under a written Constitution. For these and for additional \nreasons that my colleagues will discuss further, I cannot support her \nappointment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to express my support for Caitlin \nHalligan, who has been nominated to the Court of Appeals for the DC \nCircuit. Ms. Halligan has an impressive background and broad support, \nand I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture and allow this nominee to \nreceive an up-or-down confirmation vote.\n  Ms. Halligan has had a distinguished career in both the private and \npublic sectors. She has served as the solicitor general of New York and \nas general counsel of the New York County District Attorney's Office. \nShe has also been a senior appellate lawyer at the nationally \nrecognized law firm of Weil Gotshal. She has argued five cases before \nthe Supreme Court, where she also clerked after law school. It is no \nwonder the ABA unanimously rated her ``well-qualified''--the highest \nranking to serve on the DC Circuit.\n  In addition to impressive credentials, Ms. Halligan has broad \nsupport. The National District Attorneys Association and district \nattorneys from the State of New York, including Republicans Derek \nChampagne, Daniel Donovan, and William Fitzpatrick, support her \nnomination. She is also supported by the New York Association of Chiefs \nof Police and the New York State Sheriff's Association.\n  Confirming a well-qualified nominee like Ms. Halligan would also be \nanother step toward expanding the diversity of our Federal bench. \nToday, women hold 30 percent of Federal judicial seats--from district \ncourts to the Supreme Court--the most at any time in this Nation's \nhistory. While this progress is to be celebrated, these words from \nJustice Sandra Day O'Connor remind us there is more to do:\n\n       About half of all law graduates today are women, and we \n     have a tremendous number of qualified women in the country \n     who are serving as lawyers. So they ought to be represented \n     on the Court.\n\n  I am proud to support the nomination of Ms. Halligan and hope that my \ncolleagues will join me in voting for cloture today.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today Republicans filibuster a judicial \nnominee whose colleagues call her a ``brilliant legal mind'' with an \n``abiding respect for the law.''\n  This nominee to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, Caitlin \nJoan Halligan, has outstanding credentials and strong support from \nacross the political spectrum.\n  She enjoys the support of a bipartisan group of appellate lawyers, \nformer judges, law enforcement officials, and more than 20 former \nSupreme Court clerks. And she has been endorsed by the National \nDistrict Attorneys Association, the New York Association of Police \nChiefs and the New York State Sheriffs Association.\n  She graduated with honors from Princeton and Georgetown University \nLaw, where she was managing editor of the Georgetown Law Journal. She \nserved as a law clerk to Judge Patricia Wald on the DC Circuit, the \ncourt to which she was nominated, and to Justice Stephen Breyer on the \nSupreme Court.\n  She has served New York and this Nation well as a public servant for \nmore than a decade.\n  Yet Republicans filibustered her nomination.\n  I ask my colleagues, if this truly exceptional candidate isn't \nqualified to be a judge in the United States of America, who is?\n  In 2005, a bipartisan group of Senators came to an agreement to \nprotect the Senate as an institution and the right of the minority to \ninfluence debate. Democrats and Republicans averted the so-called \nnuclear option by agreeing that the minority's right to block judicial \nnominees would be preserved but it would be exercised only in \nextraordinary circumstances.\n  I am concerned that today the Senate is backing away from that \nagreement. Ms. Halligan's nomination does not meet the standard of an \nextraordinary circumstance that agreement envisioned.\n  Republicans, now in the minority, will block a talented, experienced \nnominee with broad bipartisan support to please a few ideological \nextremists.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n\n[[Page S8360]]\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nfor the remainder of the time if no one from the minority side is here \nto speak against this nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise this morning in support of the \nPresident's first and only nominee to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia Circuit.\n  Caitlin J. Halligan is a nominee any president of any party would be \nproud of. I know from speaking to her and from getting to know her over \nthe last year--and it has been over a year since she was nominated--\nthat she has earned this honor. She has earned it through dint of hard \nwork and native intelligence. Importantly, Halligan has dedicated most \nof her professional life to government service.\n  I challenge anyone in this Chamber to think hard about what we are \nlooking for in a judge to the second most important court in the land. \nIf they do, they must conclude that Caitlin Halligan deserves an up-or-\ndown vote.\n  Does the President have to nominate a political conservative to clear \nthe hurdle? Halligan is clearly a moderate--far more moderate than many \non my side would choose if they were nominating on their own without an \nadvise-and-consent process. Does the President have to nominate a \nlawyer who has practiced law in the shadows, never addressing a major \nlegal issue of importance to the Nation in her entire career? Because \nthe only arguments against Caitlin Halligan are ``gotcha'' arguments \nthat simply take little snippets of what she did in past law practice \nrepresenting clients, not her own views, and say ``gotcha.''\n  In 2005, 14 of my colleagues formed what was called the Gang of 14. \nIn order to reduce filibusters and overcome the push to change Senate \nrules to get rid of the filibuster, this bipartisan group agreed not to \nfilibuster any nominees who did not present ``extraordinary \ncircumstances.''\n  Now, ``extraordinary circumstances'' was not defined. But my \ncolleague, Senator Graham, a leader in that Gang of 14 effort, to his \ncredit, said on the floor at the time--completely reasonably--that it \nmeant no ideological attacks. Senator Graham said:\n\n       Ideological attacks are not an extraordinary circumstance. \n     To me, it would have to be a character problem, an ethics \n     problem, so allegations about the qualifications of a person, \n     not an ideological bent.\n\n  Caitlin Halligan does not have a character problem or an ethics \nproblem. No one has alleged she does. It is that simple. So if this \nbody cannot invoke cloture on her nomination today, the Gang of 14 \nagreement, it would seem to me, would be violated.\n  The approach taken by Senate Republicans will have lasting \nconsequences beyond this one nomination. It seems to me that a vote \nagainst this nominee is a vote that declares the Gang of 14 agreement \nnull and void. I was not a party to that agreement, but it would be \nimpossible to deny that it has guided this body's consideration of \njudges since 2005 under both Democratic and Republican Presidents. If \nRepublicans are going to suddenly junk that 6-year armistice, it could \nrisk throwing the Senate into chaos on judicial nominees. Senate \nRepublicans seem to want to declare open season for filibusters again--\nat least at the court of appeals level. Admittedly, and gladly, things \nas of late have gotten much better at the district court level. But the \ndefeat of Caitlin Halligan would throw into chaos nominations at the \ncircuit court level for a long time to come.\n  Any attempt to paint Caitlin Halligan as so far out of the mainstream \nthat she presents an ``extraordinary circumstance'' is twisting her \nrecord far beyond recognition. Any attempt to do so would make any \nnominee, by a Democratic or a Republican President, susceptible to that \nunfair charge.\n  I have always said ideology matters, but I have also said candidates \nneed only to be mainstream--not too far right, not too far left. I \ndon't like nominees who are at the extremes, left or right, because \nthey tend to be ideologues who want to make law not interpret and \nfollow law. Well, Halligan fits the bill of a moderate, mainstream \nnominee precisely, to a ``T.''\n  Halligan has spent her career in government in both political and \nplenty of nonpolitical positions. She has worked as a lawyer's lawyer \nand has expressed few views on public issues. She has written virtually \nnothing, but at her hearing she did answer questions. She acknowledged \nthat Executive power extends to indefinite detention of enemy \ncombatants during time of war--something that might be disputed among \nmainstream Members of this body, particularly if they were citizens \npicked up on American soil. We just had that debate.\n  She acknowledged she would act with fealty to text and original \nintent in interpreting laws and the Constitution. She acknowledged she \nbelieves the second amendment protects an individual's right to bear \narms, thereby vindicating the Heller case, and she acknowledged that \nthe eighth amendment protects the constitutionality of the death \npenalty.\n  Some of my colleagues have tried to paint Halligan because she has \nfiled briefs on behalf of clients, and they say that somehow indicates \nshe would be an activist judge. First, I wish to point out that she is \nnot the first nominee to come before the Senate and state that the \nviews in the briefs she writes of her clients are not her own. Guess \nwho did it regularly and repeatedly. Now-Chief Justice Roberts.\n  Did Democrats filibuster Justice Roberts because he did that? Did we \nsay the views he wrote on behalf of clients had to be attributed to his \nown views? Of course not.\n  I wish to rebut some of the things I heard on this floor this morning \nabout particular cases. First, while she did represent the State of New \nYork against gun manufacturers, those cases were made moot by \ncongressional law. In her hearing, Halligan recognized this and said \nunequivocally that she supports the individual right to bear arms.\n  Second, it is simply wrong to suggest that Caitlin Halligan is \nsomehow outside the mainstream on immigration because she filed a brief \nadvocating that businesses should not be rewarded for hiring illegal \nimmigrants by getting out of the requirement that backpay should be \nawarded when the workers are exploited. Again, this was a brief filed \non behalf of a client, not representing her own view.\n\n  Third, in the case of al-Marri, there is no argument that Halligan \ndid anything other than make arguments on behalf of a client that were \nwell within the mainstream. The administration abandoned the case and \nthen charged al-Marri in civilian court--no different than the argument \nHalligan was making.\n  Why are we arguing about whether she deserves an up-or-down vote? \nBecause, frankly, as with the Supreme Court, this is part of the \nattempt of the far right to pull the DC Circuit further and further \naway from the mainstream. Many conservatives tend to decry ``liberal \njudicial activism.'' But what they really want is judicial activism of \nthe right. They don't want lawyers to be down the middle and interpret \nlaw; they want to change the way the whole government has operated for \ndecades through the one unelected body, the article III body, the \njudiciary.\n  A truly moderate judicial philosophy shows respect for Congress, for \nexecutive agencies that interpret the law, and for well-settled \nunderstandings that the American people commonly hold about democracy. \nThere is not a single question that Halligan adheres to these \nprinciples. She has extensive government experience. She understands \nthe demands and rolls of the other branches.\n  She has been a responsible and rigorous advocate for all of her \nclients, including the people of New York. I have no doubt that as a \njudge she will be a responsible and rigorous advocate for the rule of \nlaw. Anyone who has listened to her answer an hour of questions in the \ncommittee and read her responses to the 150 questions that were \nsubmitted for the record cannot doubt but that she has an even and \nmodest temperament and philosophy in her approach to legal questions.\n  Let me cite one example: When she was asked by Senator Grassley her \nview of deference to the legislative branch, here is how she responded:\n\n       I think that the job of a judge is to examine the \n     constitutionality of a statute when a\n\n[[Page S8361]]\n\n     constitutional challenge is presented, but I think that \n     authority has to be exercised very sparingly and very \n     carefully.\n\n  Time and time again she answered similarly with clear and unambiguous \nanswers.\n  Some of my colleagues have accused Halligan of lacking candor in her \nanswers. Well, I have sat through a lot of hearings for nominees to \nFederal courts of appeals, and I know evasion when I see it. Halligan \nwas not evasive. Some of the same people who say she lacked candor \nstill defend Miguel Estrada who didn't answer a single question because \nhe might come before them as a judge.\n  She answered questions thoughtfully and forthrightly and explained \nthe context of any past statements that might have seemed to have \ncontradicted her current views.\n  This morning, some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \npointed to two things that she did not write to try to indicate she has \nactivist views. First, she gave a speech in 2003 on behalf of her boss, \nElliott Spitzer, that she did not write herself. In fact, she stepped \nin at the last minute to give the speech when he could not make it. She \ndid not write it, and she clarified at the time that it did not reflect \nher personal views.\n  Second, she was a member of a committee that issued a report on \nExecutive power and enemy combatants. She explained in the committee \nshe hadn't seen the report and didn't agree with either its content or \nits tone. In her hearing she clearly stated her views on Executive \npower. This should have cleared up any doubt about her ability to \nrecognize and respect the current state of law.\n  Finally, I wish to say a word about a red herring argument that has \nbeen raised today--that the workload of the DC Circuit is too low to \nconfirm Halligan. I have expressed this concern, too, and, in fact, in \n2008 we voted to take away one of the seats in the DC Circuit. It now \nhas 11 judges rather than 12; but I, as well as many of my colleagues \non both sides of the aisle have in the past reserved our concern for \nnominees of the 11th seat and what was then the 12th seat. Halligan has \nbeen nominated for the 9th seat. There are only 8 members on that court \nwhich now has a roster of 11. The 10th and 11th seats remain vacant. No \none ever until now, on either side of the aisle, has ever argued that \nthe DC Circuit should have only eight judges.\n  I wonder, if control of the body changes, which I don't think it \nwill, or we get a Republican President, which I don't think we will, \nhow quickly our colleagues on the other side of the aisle will abandon \nthat foolish and specious argument.\n  I am concerned that we are hearing it now for the first time because \nthe current makeup of the court happens to have five Republican \nappointees and three Democratic nominees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be given \n1\\1/2\\ more minutes to finish this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. When we confirmed President Bush's nominee to the 11th \nseat in 2005, Thomas Griffith, his confirmation resulted in there being \n121 pending cases per judge. We did not hear a peep out of the other \nside that that was too low. Yet today there are 161 cases per judge. \nWith Halligan's confirmation, it would go down to 143--far more than \nthe 121 when all my colleagues on the other side of the aisle voted for \nMr. Griffith, the Republican nominee of President Bush. So there is no \nreason to argue about caseload.\n\n  The fact is, if we cannot confirm Halligan, this will not go down as \na vote about caseload, this will be recorded as a new bar for nominees.\n  In conclusion, when Caitlin Halligan drove with her father from her \nhome in Kansas City to Harvard or when she was a standout student at \nGeorgetown Law School or when she started her work for the New York \nAttorney General's Office, I am sure she could not have imagined that \nsomeday she would be the topic of a debate in the U.S. Senate about \nwhether she was too radical or lacked the candor to be a judge.\n  I hope that when we vote and the debate is over, my colleagues \nrecognize the truth here: Halligan is a sterling example of a public \nservant who has worked hard, earned every honor she has received, and \nfits squarely within the mainstream of judicial thought. She deserves \nan up-or-down vote today, and I will be proud to cast my vote for \ncloture on Caitlin Halligan's nomination.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, pursuant to rule \nXXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, \nwhich the clerk will state.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the nomination \n     of Caitlin Joan Halligan, of New York, to be United States \n     Circuit Judge for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n         Harry Reid, Patrick J.

Mr. President, I wanted to share with the \nSenate today what should be a collective outrage because an American \ncitizen has now been held behind bars in Cuba for exactly 2 years.\n  Alan Gross was working in Cuba under a contract with the U.S. Agency \nfor International Development. He has devoted his career to helping \nthousands of people around the world, working in development for over \n25 years in more than 50 countries.\n  In Cuba, Alan Gross was trying to make a difference in the lives of \npeople who share his Jewish faith by bringing them modern communication \ntools. For that simple act, he has now languished in a Cuban prison for \n2 years. His health worsens each day and his family, of course, misses \nhim. His wife Judy spoke to him just days ago and said that Alan \nsounded ``more hopeless and more depressed,'' as one would expect.\n  The release of Alan Gross must remain front and center in any \ndiscussion with or about the Cuban regime. That is why many of us in \nthis Chamber have joined in writing to the Ambassador of Cuba here--and \nsince we don't have diplomatic relations, that individual is called the \nChief of the Cuban Interests Section--and asking the Castro regime to \nimmediately and unconditionally release Alan Gross as a humanitarian \ngesture and a sign of compassion for his family. We have been met, \nhowever, with stonewalling silence.\n  While we remember Mr. Gross and we keep pressure on the Castro \nregime, the Senate must also fulfill its duties toward the rest of the \nWestern Hemisphere. A case in point: Four countries in Latin America--\nVenezuela, Bolivia, Nicaragua, and Ecuador--are currently without a \nU.S. Ambassador. That is the job of the Senate--to confirm appointments \nof the President. In the case of Venezuela, it is not because we don't \nhave a nominee, it is because, in fact, we are having some trouble with \nthe Chavez government. We have been without an Assistant Secretary of \nState for Western Hemisphere Affairs since July. It isn't in the \ninterest of the United States not to have these people in place.\n  The Senate has basically 2 weeks to go if we get out a week before \nthe Christmas holiday--and that is an ``if,'' by the way. During this \ntime, while we go through all of what we have to do in the next 10 \nlegislative days--such as solving the doctors problem, extending this \npayroll tax cut, appropriations bills, extending unemployment \ncompensation for people who desperately need it, and extending a lot of \nthe tax extenders--we must also fulfill our constitutional duty to \nconsider these important Presidential appointments.\n  There is one in front of the Senate right now; that is, the \nAmbassador to El Salvador. Mari Carmen Aponte is the U.S. Ambassador to \nEl Salvador. She is well known all over the United States in Hispanic \ncircles because she has held, as a Foreign Service officer, a number of \nposts. During the August 2010 congressional recess, the President named \nher Ambassador to El Salvador. That recess appointment is going to \nexpire at the end of this year.\n  Before joining the State Department, Ms. Aponte served as Executive \nDirector of the Puerto Rican Federal Affairs Administration and \npresident of the very respected Hispanic National Bar Association.\n  Typical of the sentiment in Florida, an editorial in a recent Miami \nHerald editorial expressed support for her confirmation, saying that \n``her diplomatic success has earned her the unprecedented support of \nthe private sector and of the most prominent political leaders in El \nSalvador.'' It was unprecedented that three former Presidents of El \nSalvador came all the way to Washington to show their support during \nher nomination hearing.\n  My wife Grace and I were recently visited by the First Lady of El \nSalvador. She pointed out all of the terrible events that have taken \nplace in her country: struggling to recover from the tropical \ndepression that made landfall this past fall, the heavy rains that have \ncaused major damage throughout Central America, and the 70,000 \nSalvadorans still living in shelters. That little country faces many \nchallenges. So if for no other reason than those I mentioned, we do not \nwant to continue into next year without our having an ambassador there. \nWe need to confirm Ms. Aponte as soon as possible so that she can \ncontinue exercising the necessary U.S. leadership.\n  Latin American countries continue to be America's fastest growing \ntrade partners. We need to continue to promote that trade. It helps our \neconomy. It deepens the economic linkages. We can explore clean energy \ninitiatives, and we can help them as they continue to strengthen \ntransparency in government and the rule of law. We need to pay more \nattention to Latin America, not less. Disengagement is not the answer. \nThis is just another reason we need to confirm this nomination as \nquickly as possible for Ambassador to El Salvador.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor a gentleman by \nthe name of John Katz. John is a longtime public servant to the State \nof Alaska who is set to retire at year's end. John has served Alaska \nfor more than 40 years, working for eight different Governors, \nRepublican and Democratic, liberals and conservatives. He once said he \nwas comfortable serving so many different Governors because the issues \nfor Alaska were consistent. Whether they be responsible resource \ndevelopment, State sovereignty, or Federal assistance with \ninfrastructure, the one constant figure connecting one administration \nafter the next over eight administrations has been John Katz.\n  John started his career as a high school teacher and coach in \nBaltimore City public schools back in 1966, following his graduation \nfrom Johns Hopkins University. In 1969, he earned his law degree from \nthe University of California at Berkeley. He then moved to Alaska to \nwork as a legislative and administrative assistant to Congressman \nPollock and then later for Senator Ted Stevens.\n  John has truly played many crucial roles for the State of Alaska. He \nserved for several years as the counsel to the Joint Federal-State Land \nUse Planning Commission for the State of Alaska. He served as special \ncounsel to Gov. Jay Hammond back in 1979, advocating the State's \nposition on the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, or \nANILCA, to Congress. Two years after that, he was appointed \ncommissioner of natural resources by Governor Hammond. Then, in 1983, \nJohn was sent by Gov. Bill Sheffield to head Alaska's Washington, DC, \noffice, and he has served as the liaison between the State and the \nFederal Government for the past 28 years--a pretty remarkable record, \nif you would consider it. As Alaskans, we know how important his role \nhas been in bridging the very considerable gap between our State and \nthe Federal Government--a key role when more than 60 percent of \nAlaska's land is controlled by the Federal Government.\n  You could refer to John as Alaska's fourth Congressman--his 40-year \ntenure in the league of the late Senator Stevens and Representative Don \nYoung. John's breadth of knowledge and understanding of Alaska's issues \nhave guided him in his very unique role.\n  Since entering public service, John has been involved in key issues, \nsuch as the passage of the landmark Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act \nback in 1971, the legislation in 1976 which extended America's fishery \nzones to 200 miles which allowed for the Americanization of Alaska's \nfishing fleet. There was also the passage back in 1980 of the Alaska \nNational Interest Land Conservation Act, the Nation's largest \nconservation lands measure. There was the Alaska Railroad Transfer Act \nback in 1983, the Tongass Timber Reform Act in 1990 and 30 other major \npieces of legislation and hundreds of amendments that have greatly \naffected the lives of all Alaskans.\n\n[[Page S8363]]\n\n  What is so remarkable about John is that there is no Alaskan public \npolicy issue he did not master, a pretty incredible feat there but no \nAlaska public policy issue that he did not have his fingerprints on, \ninvolved with or have a mastery of.\n  In 1972, for example, he served for 2 years on the Executive Advisory \nCommittee of the Federal Power Commission, making decisions on \nelectricity generation during a period of rapid population growth in \nAlaska. In 1974, he published a legal analysis of the Alaska Native \nClaims Settlement Act and how it should impact Native Alaskans for the \nJoint Federal-State Land Use Planning Commission. Five years later, he \nserved on the Hard Rock Minerals Commission of Alaska, helping to chart \na course for the rebirth of our State's mineral industry. There is \nseemingly no Alaskan issue too complex or daunting for John Katz.\n  When I first met John, it was probably somewhere in the early 1980s. \nAt the time, I was a staffer in the office of the speaker of the Alaska \nHouse of Representatives in Juneau, and I was immediately taken by the \nkindness of this gentleman, extraordinarily polite to a very young \nstaffer, but also his intellectual prowess that was shown whether it \nwas a casual conversation or whether it was a detailed policy analysis.\n  Former Gov. Tony Knowles called him ``one of the most remarkable \npublic servants I've ever dealt with.'' Governor Hammond, during the \nlengthy debate over ANILCA, called him truly indispensable. Senator \nStevens once said: ``He's as near a genius as I've seen.'' I would \nclearly agree with that. Some of his coworkers have even jokingly \ncalled him their own human Google machine, noting that in many cases it \nwas more efficient, it was easier to walk down the hall and ask John \nfor legal and policy background, saving them hours of research, and \nJohn had it all there, instant recall and as precise as it could \npossibly be.\n  Throughout his career, John served effectively and quietly, always \npreferring to work in the background, never seeking that limelight. He \nalways presented every side of the issue, never telling any of his \nsuperiors simply what they might have wanted to hear. He truly was the \nconsummate professional, a man who never got a fact wrong in a \nbriefing, in a discussion or in a political strategy session. That may \nhave been at least one of the many reasons why he has been so honored \nduring his career, receiving the highest honor of the Alaska Federation \nof Natives, which is the Denali Award, winning Commonwealth North's \n2008 Walter J. Hickel Award for distinguished public policy leadership \nand receiving more resolutions, commendations, and praise than most in \nAlaska's history.\n  John has built a reputation as an Alaskan institution, always loyally \nserving our beloved State. He has championed oil exploration in the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge, noting the potential benefits for not \nonly Alaska's economy but, more important, for America's overall \neconomic and national security. While John has listed the failure, so \nfar, to persuade Congress to open ANWR as perhaps one of his biggest \ndisappointments, he has always stood by the factually solid arguments \nfor opening ANWR, never letting his passionate advocacy of opening the \ncoastal refuge get in the way of objectively presenting arguments to \nMembers of Congress.\n  I think it is important to note John's statement in his resignation \nletter to Governor Parnell. He stated the following:\n\n       Professionally, I have become increasingly discouraged by \n     the polarization and deterioration of the public policy \n     process at the Federal level. It's the worst I've seen during \n     my 43-year career.\n\n  That was the statement in John's resignation note. As someone who has \nrelied on John's wise counsel and his wisdom during my 8 years in the \nSenate, I think this is a poignant remark about the state of affairs in \nCongress. The debate surrounding our politics has grown more caustic, \nwhile ignoring the fact that while we all may take different positions, \nwe all ultimately have our Nation's interests at heart.\n  John leaves an esteemed legacy that will benefit Alaska for decades \nto come. We can learn so much from his example of what a public servant \nshould be, and Alaska will deeply miss his presence. I know I speak for \nall Alaskans in sincerely thanking John for his years of dedicated \nservice and his pragmatic approach to faithfully serving the State of \nAlaska. I wish him nothing but the best in the future for all his \nendeavors.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise about the most important job that \nfaces the Senate in the remainder of the year; that is, extending the \nunemployment benefits for millions of unemployed Americans struggling \nto find a job.\n  I wish I didn't have to be down here talking about this today. I wish \nit weren't necessary to debate whether we should continue the Federal \nunemployment insurance program. I wish everyone in this Chamber would \nacknowledge that the recovery is still a work in progress and that we \nwould agree about the critical need to continue to support struggling \nworkers and their families. We have never failed to extend benefits in \nthe past when unemployment was this high. But, unfortunately, in \ntoday's hyperpartisan atmosphere, even the most commonsense policies \ncan turn into political footballs, and the unemployment insurance \nprogram seems to be no exception.\n  The extreme right is on the attack, blaming the victims who have been \nthe hardest hit by this economic crisis. In the same breath that they \npush for more cuts in corporate taxes and cuts in taxes to high-income \nindividuals, Republican leaders argue we can't afford to extend \nunemployment benefits for people who are struggling to find a job. \nCongresswoman Bachmann, a candidate for President, recently went so far \nto say: ``If anyone will not work, neither should he eat.''\n\n  In an economy where there are four unemployed workers for every \navailable job, the cruelty of that comment is simply astonishing. There \nare 13 million unemployed Americans right now. Actually, I think the \nfigure is probably a little bit higher than that. They are desperately \nlooking for any job they can find, many relying on unemployment \nbenefits to put food on the table for their children.\n  Six million Americans will be cut off this last lifeline if Congress \ndoes not renew the benefits for the long-term unemployed--6 million who \nwill be cut off right after the holiday season. I hope no one in this \nbody on either side of the aisle will say they deserve this additional \nhardship during this holiday season.\n  There are real people and real families behind these numbers. They \nare our friends and neighbors. I have heard from so many of these hard-\nworking people from my home State of Iowa and across the country. Their \nstories are truly heartbreaking.\n  A woman from Des Moines recently wrote me:\n\n       I was laid off in July 2011. I recently attended a class at \n     the unemployment office in Des Moines, where I was informed \n     that my unemployment will cease as of December the 31st if \n     any extensions that are currently in place are discontinued. \n     The average person is currently unemployed for 40 weeks, \n     which is much longer than the 26 weeks that is available \n     [without] any extensions. I was the main breadwinner in our \n     family and if my unemployment would cease before I find a \n     job, we would forced to be on welfare, food stamps, and other \n     government subsidies. We would also lose our home. I hope \n     that you consider the many other people that are probably in \n     the same situation as I am and hope that you will keep the \n     current extensions in place.\n\n  A woman from Stanton, IA, writes:\n\n       I lost a great job in June of 2010 and have been receiving \n     unemployment benefits since then. . . . If not for the \n     unemployment [benefits], I don't know how we would make it. I \n     continue to look for a better paying job but as you probably \n     know, Montgomery County, Iowa has had the highest \n     unemployment rate in Iowa. It's been tough. . . . Will \n     appreciate your support in extending unemployment benefits as \n     I continue my quest for a new position.\n\n  The main reason folks need their benefits to continue is they simply\n\n[[Page S8364]]\n\ncannot find new work, even after exhausting their benefits. There are \nsimply not enough jobs in this struggling economy. How can we even \nthink about abruptly terminating these benefits right now, cutting off \nthe last lifeline to Americans in dire need?\n  A man from Estherville, IA, wrote:\n\n       I woke up last week to find my benefits exhausted but no \n     closer to finding a job. I do everything possible to find \n     work but nothing materializes. Age-discrimination is rampant \n     and there is nothing an individual can do about it. . . . \n     Right now, after working since I was 12 years old, I'm facing \n     hunger and hopelessness at 57 years of age.\n\n  A man from West Des Moines wrote:\n\n       I'm a home designer/architect and have been laid off three \n     times since 2007, after working almost 16 years at one firm. \n     I have now decided to go back to school to try to find a \n     different career in information technology. I hate not having \n     a job, and want to work but there's just not anything out \n     there in architecture. Everyone seems to have circled the \n     wagons and are not hiring. Please help.\n\n  A woman from Madrid, IA, writes:\n\n       I lost my job (of 32 years) 2\\1/2\\ years ago. I lived off \n     my severance for the first year. Then savings and then went \n     on unemployment. Now my unemployment has run out. I have had \n     a few interview[s] without any luck. I have been working part \n     time for minimum wage and I only get 15 hours a week in. It's \n     the only job that I could find.\n\n  This is just a sampling of the letters we get in our office. But it \nis clear people want to work. They desperately want to work.\n  Later this week, the committee I chair, the Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions Committee, will hold a hearing to look at the reasons so \nmany millions of workers who want to work are unable to get back to new \njobs quickly. We will hear from experts, workers, and community leaders \nabout the barriers facing the long-term unemployed, especially those \nover the age of 50.\n  But there are some things we don't need an expert to tell us. We know \npeople can't find new jobs because there are so few jobs out there. As \nI said, right now, more than 13 million people are officially counted \nas actively looking for work. But that is an understatement. There are \nmillions more people with part-time jobs, of necessity, who want full-\ntime work, millions more on top of that who have basically stopped \nlooking for work because they think a job search will be fruitless. \nThey have already tried time and time again and they have given up. But \nif they had a job, if they got a job, they would take it.\n  When we add up all that, with a number of young people who have not \nentered the workforce--maybe they have looked for work, they can't find \nit, they are young, and especially if they are young and African \nAmerican, the unemployment rate soars to 30 to 40 percent. They can't \nfind a job. If we add that all up, we are talking about nearly 28 \nmillion unemployed and marginally employed people in America.\n  There are many other barriers to reemployment. I have talked about \nolder workers. Not only have many of them gone through their retirement \nsavings, many have lost their home that they spent decades paying a \nmortgage on, they have been unable to send their kids to college, and \non top of that, they face the indignity of being passed over in favor \nof younger workers simply because of their age.\n  Again, it is not to say that younger workers have an easy time. I \nhave also many stories of young people, many with college degrees, who \ncan't find work. They are piecing together a meager existence on part-\ntime service jobs that waste the time, effort, and money they have \npoured into an expensive education. I can't tell you how many young \npeople I have talked to who have a college degree, they are not working \nin their chosen profession, but they are working at mostly part-time \nwork or at service-oriented jobs that they know will not last them a \nlifetime, and service-oriented jobs that pay them a pittance compared \nto what they should be earning with their college degree. Still other \nworkers hear they cannot be considered by employers because they have \nbeen unemployed for too long. This is so, even when a recruiter tells \nthem they are perfectly well qualified for the job.\n\n  More workers want to move in order to take advantage of a new \nopportunity they have heard about elsewhere but, guess what, their \nhouse is underwater. Not physically. That means they owe more on their \nmortgage than the house is worth and they cannot sell it. Or they have \nbeen out of work so long they have no money left to even afford to \nmove. They cannot even afford to pack up the U-Haul and move someplace.\n  Still other workers have trouble with transportation or childcare or \nother day-to-day issues that make it much harder to get an employer to \ntake a chance on them. Someone came up and said to me one time: You \nknow, for people who do not get a job, there are places in this country \nwhere there are jobs. They can move. It is a free country.\n  I said: What about a single mother who has two kids and she relies \nupon her mother as a babysitter, as a childcare person to take care of \nthe kids when she is out working on a minimum wage job, maybe part \ntime? How is she going to pack up and move those kids when she has, \nfrankly, free help from her mother? These are real barriers that real \npeople face every day of their lives.\n  These problems illustrate why the long-term unemployed who are \nworking hard and playing by the rules still cannot get a job because of \nthe factors beyond their control. Rather than chastising the victims, \nwe should be giving a hand up to people in their hour of greatest need \nand help them to get back into the workforce.\n  This support is critical, not only for the workers and families \naffected but for our economy overall. Research shows that for every \ndollar of unemployed benefits that is spent, we generate $2 in economic \nactivity. Why is that? Because this money is not saved, it is not put \ninto a shoe box, it is spent on essentials, helping businesses up and \ndown Main Street in communities across the country. In addition, if \nunemployment benefits are extended, we will save about 560,000 jobs, \naccording to the Economic Policy Institute.\n  By contrast, if we fail to renew these benefits, our economy will be \ndeprived of many billions of dollars of economic activity next year. In \nthe end, this will have a negative impact on overall gross domestic \nproduct. On the one hand, with benefits we boost our economy with a \npotent return on investment, we help people in their hour of need, and \nwe meet our moral obligations as a society. But without benefits, we \nhurt our economy by shrinking consumer demand, by destroying jobs, and \nwe do not meet our moral obligation as a caring government and a caring \npeople.\n  There is a strong economic case for renewing unemployment insurance, \nbut I also say there is a strong human case for extending the benefits. \nWhere is our basic human compassion? The thought of letting these \nbenefits expire is unconscionable, especially during this Christmas \nseason. After looking for work for at least 6 months but often more, \nmany of these people already have lost their jobs, their homes, their \nsavings, and they are now at risk of losing their last lifeline, the \nroughly $300 a week they receive in unemployment benefits.\n  The bills do not stop coming when someone loses his or her job. The \nrent or mortgage, the electricity, car payments--all have to be made. \nThe family still has to buy food, gasoline, medicine, school supplies, \nclothes. Unemployment benefits are a lifeline for the millions of folks \nwho are living without an income and trying to survive. These benefits \nkept more than 3 million people from falling into poverty last year.\n  We have a moral obligation, those of us privileged to serve in the \nSenate and the House, to continue the Federal unemployment insurance \nprograms while the economy continues to slowly recover. We cannot allow \nthese benefits to expire. We cannot allow millions of our friends, \nneighbors, and relatives to sink into absolute poverty and desperation. \nWe cannot fail to take action because that failure will result in \nfamilies being put out on the street, children going to bed hungry, \nfamilies left to shiver in the cold of their unheated homes.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote on this matter as soon as possible. \nDuring this holiday season, it is cruel to put millions of unemployed \nAmericans in the position of wondering how they are going to survive \ncome January 1 of next year. Let us renew these benefits for another \nyear. Let us spend the next year doing everything we can to rebuild our \neconomy, create jobs, and\n\n[[Page S8365]]\n\nprovide employment to everyone who wants to work in this great Nation.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin).

Mr. President, today I rise to note some good news about \nthe state of our American economy. Hard work clearly remains. We are \nstill recovering from the deepest slump since the Great Depression. But \nI think it is time to appreciate our recent progress.\n  Over the past few days and weeks, there has been plenty of positive \neconomic news. Listen to some of these headlines. From the New York \nTimes: ``Jobless Rate Dips to Lowest Level in More Than 2 years.'' From \nCNN: ``Dow closes with largest gain since March 2009.'' From Reuters: \n``Private-sector jobs soar, payroll forecasts rise.'' From the Wall \nStreet Journal: ``Online Sales Reach Record $1.25 Billion on Cyber \nMonday.''\n  I know it is far too early to start to celebrate, but I want to tell \nyou a little bit about some of the details of this news. I know back in \nmy State of Alaska, just like everywhere else in this country, people \nare still struggling to balance their checkbooks; that they face tough \ndecisions about the cost of groceries, basic health care, college \ntuition for their kids, and just the basic expenses to live. Yet the \nrecent news about our economy is very encouraging.\n  I want to give those specific examples. On unemployment and jobs, the \nBureau of Labor Statistics says total payrolls increased by 120,000 \njobs in November as the unemployment rate dropped to 8.6 percent--as \nthe headline said, the lowest level in more than 2 years. Also, the \nlatest news also marked 21 consecutive months of private sector job \ngrowth.\n  I know some will come down and claim, well, that is not good enough. \nWell, I remember when I first came here, prior to me serving in the \nSenate, we were averaging about 500,000 jobs being lost every month.\n  Let me repeat this one statistic: There have been 21 consecutive \nmonths of private sector job growth--not led by government job growth \nbut private sector job growth. So it is not robust, but it is growing. \nAgain, that is positive news.\n  Manufacturing activity climbed in November, according to the \nInstitute for Supply Management. Its indicators tell us manufacturing \nis continuing to expand--another strong signal of overall economic \ngrowth.\n  The American automotive industry is coming back strong. Think about \nit again. In 2009, it was literally flat on its back trying to recover. \nIn November of this year, light vehicle sales were up 11.4 percent \ncompared to a year ago. That is the highest sales rate since the 2009 \nCash for Clunkers Program, which many here supported.\n  There is more good news about the automobile industry. Ford says its \nNovember sales rose 13 percent. Chrysler Group reported a breathtaking \nNovember sales jump of 44.5 percent from a year ago. General Motors \nreported it sold 7 percent more new cars and trucks in November than it \ndid a year earlier.\n  On investments and the markets, again, we have an important signal. \nIt is not something you should always judge the economy on, but it is \nan important piece of it, and so much of middle class-America is tied \nto the market--maybe your 529 account or your 401(k) retirement program \nor the personal management of your account or, if you are self-\nemployed, your SEP account. We are all tied to it to some degree.\n  The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed over 12,000 last Friday and \ngained 7 percent--just in 1 week. Let me take a moment to describe \nwhere we have come from in the market. Last week's closing numbers \nrepresent a gain of about 33 percent since early January of 2009--when \nseveral other Members and I were sworn in to the Senate. In January of \n2009, the market still kept going down. In March of 2009, it dropped to \nits lowest level, a little over 6,600. Last week's numbers represent a \nwhopping 81 percent increase since 2009. If you take the next step and \nlook at the S index, it reflects a very similar gain--up 36 percent \nsince 2009 and, since the dark days of March when it really crashed \nout, an 82-percent increase. It is important because so much of our \nretirement is tied to it.\n  If you read or hear the pundits and politicos here, it is always doom \nand gloom. I wanted to come to the floor and talk about some of these \nissues because we are moving in the right direction. We are moving in a \npositive way, but we don't hear this in the news because good news is \nnot necessarily reported. It may show up one day and then disappear. \nWhen a bad thing happens, we hear about that for a week and a half and \nwe are here talking about why it is so bad. But the overall numbers \ntell us the fundamentals are changing in a positive way.\n  The other piece, which is consumer confidence, is important because \nif people and businesses are not confident about the future, they will \nnot invest, spend, or participate in the economy. But it is better.\n  Last month, the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index rose to \n56.0 percent, its highest level since July. Americans spent $52.4 \nbillion over the four-day Thanksgiving Day weekend, according to the \nNational Retail Federation. That is the highest total ever recorded \nduring the traditional start of the holiday shopping season. When I was \nback home for Thanksgiving, I heard this good news from many shop \nowners. The new Apple store in Anchorage saw record sales, with \nthousands of shoppers coming through the door, and it was a cold \nweekend. Sales on Cyber Monday--the first online shopping day after \nThanksgiving weekend--rose 22 percent from a year ago. Americans spent \nanother record--$1.25 billion--on that Monday, setting again record \nsales for Cyber Monday.\n  On trade, the U.S. trade deficit narrowed from $44.9 billion in \nAugust to $43.1 billion in September. That is the smallest trade gap \nsince last December and the biggest 1-month improvement since July, \naccording to the Commerce Department.\n  Housing is a critical piece of our overall economy, and some say we \nare in the recession because the housing market collapsed, but there \nare also many other pieces to the equation. We never hear good news, we \nhear negative news. There is a lot of work to get new home starts and \ncurrent inventory off the market, help people who are underwater, and \nmake sure they can stay in their homes and receive the benefit.\n  The Pending Home Sales Index, a forward-looking indicator based on \ncontract signings--people who are looking at a home to purchase and \nmaybe have entered into a contract and said: I will be purchasing this \nhome in 30, 60, or 90 days from now--was up 10.4 percent in October \nfrom the month before. The National Association of Realtors says home \nsales are up more than 9 percent from the same time last year. Again, \nis it as robust as we want? No. Is it better than where it was? \nAbsolutely.\n  Many of the policies that my colleagues and I have fought for on the \nfloor--a lot of times, we make decisions and we move on. We go to the \nnext issue, and we don't have time to reflect on the results of the \nwork we are doing. In the last 2\\1/2\\ years, since the great recession \ncame into play, there have been a lot of good things happening.\n  As for residential construction--this is, again, people building \nhomes, providing construction jobs, providing a new tax base for \ncommunities around the country that need it so they can hire police, \nfirefighters, and teachers--the Census Bureau says it was at a \nseasonally adjusted annual rate of $239 billion in October, up roughly \n3.5 percent from the previous month.\n  For Alaska--again, while spending time back home, I tried to spend \ntime with the small business community, asking them: What is happening? \nWhat do you sense? And what is your confidence level? I had a meeting \nwith a group of small business owners, and one got a loan from the SBA \nrecently. He took advantage of the low cost we were able to implement \nthrough legislation we pass here. It helped him get into a new \nrestaurant. Now he employs\n\n[[Page S8366]]\n\n120 people in my community in Alaska--Anchorage. Another owner of a \nvideo production company had one of the best years ever, and he is \ndoing work for corporate clients who are willing to spend money.\n  These are all very positive developments. Now, as we approach the end \nof the year, we in this Chamber need to do our part to keep the \nmomentum moving forward. People watch us, and we squabble over many \nissues. As I mentioned, all this good news is because of the work a \nslim majority did over the last 3 years in this body because we believe \nin the future, in what the potential is of this great country in which \nwe live. Maybe some had different views on what could happen. We \nbelieved in what is possible. These statistics show us that belief is \nnow paying off.\n\n  As I look at where we are today, we need to continue to make these \nsmart public policy decisions that create a sound economy. We need to \ndo it as best we can in a bipartisan way. What I am talking about now \nis extending the tax cut for middle-class American families, continuing \nthe tax relief, giving a reduction in our payroll taxes, which is due \nto expire at the end of the year.\n  Before any of us leave Washington later this month for the holidays, \nwe clearly have to resolve this issue. In my opinion, we have no \nchoice, and here is why: Unless Congress takes action, the average \nmiddle-class family will be hit by a $1,000 tax increase starting \nJanuary 1.\n  Economists of all political stripes have called this tax cut critical \nfor America's continued economic growth. They say that letting it lapse \ncould push us back into a deep recession. Truly, that would be \nunforgivable based on where we are today and how far we have come in a \nshort time--almost 3 years now.\n  Some on the other side of the political aisle seem unsure about \nrenewing the tax relief--the tax cut aimed at middle-class families and \nsmall businesses--this after fighting for massive tax cuts for the \nwealthy in our deficit reduction talks. If they block this tax cut, \nabout 160 million families will get the news during the holidays that \ntheir taxes are going up on January 1. That is simply not fair. It \nmakes no sense just when the economic indicators, as I mentioned, are \nlooking so positive.\n  As I said, if we don't act, a typical family making $50,000 a year \nwould see their taxes increase about $1,000. But if we pass the middle-\nclass tax cut in 2011, for the 2012 tax year, that same family will get \na total tax cut of $1,500. Not only would they see the thousand, but \nthey would get something additional because of the way we drafted this.\n  Most of that money will go directly into the economy. In Alaska, \nroughly 400,000 people benefited from the tax cut this year, and they \nused it to pump about $300 million into the State and local economies--\nagain, the small businesses that I traveled to, a couple of them with \nmy son and his cousin, House of Hobbies and the Bosco store. While they \nwere playing all the games for free, playing the race cars and all that \nstuff and looking at baseball cards, I was asking the clerk: What does \nit feel like? There is no question that they said there is a change in \nthe economy in the positive. That is because in Alaska, for example, \nthese 400,000 people had $300 million in their pockets--not the IRS \nputting it into the Treasury, but they had it and they spent it. And I \nwill be frank about it--after my son and my nephew, his cousin, spent \nthat time on the free road there playing with toys, I spent some money \nto help my small businesses and the economy. That is what it is about.\n  This tax cut put $110 billion into the American economy this year. \nLet me say that again--$110 billion. It is money that could go to the \nIRS or to middle-class Americans. I think the choice is very clear as \nto who should benefit from those dollars.\n  We were elected--as I was from Alaska--to represent all Americans, \nnot just those at the top end but the people who work every day, those \nwhom we see on a regular basis when we go back home or walk out of this \nbuilding or actually in this building, the people spending time every \nday working hard to move this economy forward. It is our obligation to \ncontinue to do what we can to make their lives a little bit better by \nlessening their burden of taxes and giving them the tax relief that \nthey deserve and that we should be able to give to them as January 1 \nrolls around.\n  I hope that, as we move toward the holiday season, we can continue to \ngive the gift of tax relief to the middle-class Americans--to my \n400,000 folks back in Alaska and all of the small businesses in Alaska \nthat have benefited. Let's do what is right and do it in a bipartisan \nway and move forward in giving continued tax relief to middle-class \nAmericans.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken).

Madam President, I understand the President made \nanother speech today, and the speeches he has been giving lately are \nclever political documents. It is pretty clear his focus has shifted \nfrom governing to campaigning, with about a year from now until \nelection day. But our Nation is in a serious financial condition. Our \ndebt is larger than we like to acknowledge it is. Our European friends \non the other side of the Atlantic are wrestling with their debt \nproblems, and many of those nations--most of those nations--have debt \nless than we do as a percentage of GDP. We know, from every expert we \nhave heard testify before the Budget Committee, on which I serve as \nranking member, that we must change our path. We are on an \nunsustainable path, and we cannot continue on it.\n  Time after time we have had hearings and have heard from experts \ntelling us we have to alter our debt trajectory. We have to get on a \nsound path. Perhaps it will be a tougher path for a few years, a harder \nroad, but it is the right road, and the road that will lead to \nsoundness in our economy. Prosperity and growth is what we need.\n  The debt commission President Obama appointed, headed by Mr. Erskine \nBowles and Senator Alan Simpson, told us we are on a path to the most \npredictable financial crisis the Nation has ever been on. They were \nsaying that the unsustainable trajectory of the this country's debt \nwill lead us to some sort of economic catastrophe. It will knock us \nback into a recession, put us back to where we were in 2007 or 2008, or \nlike what Europe is facing right now. They pleaded with us to do \nsomething about it.\n  The debt commission laid out a plan. I don't agree with everything in \nthe plan, but it said, at a minimum--and there was bipartisan agreement \non this--the debt should be reduced. The added debt we incur over the \nnext 10 years should be reduced by at least $4 trillion. They said we \nshould reduce the growth of our debt by at least $4 trillion.\n  So in the last two meetings in the Budget Control Act, it looks as if \nwe achieved about $2.1 trillion, not $4 trillion, but they all said we \nneeded more than that, because the increase in our debt over the next \n10 years would be about $8 trillion to $10 trillion. That is the \nincrease on top of the $15 trillion we have already incurred. This past \nfiscal year, which ended on September 30, we will have added $1.23 \ntrillion to our debt; the year before that, $1.3 trillion, the year \nbefore that, $1.2 trillion--the only three times in history we have had \ndeficits over $1 trillion. It is a very serious situation.\n  So we have a speech. I just have to say, we tried to look at the \nspeech to see what it is that the President has proposed. He is our \nleader, our Commander in Chief. We only have one Chief Executive, one \nGovernor, one mayor. I see Senator Manchin here. He was a Governor. He \nhad to manage the State and exercise leadership.\n  So what is it this Executive, our President, is proposing that we do? \nWell, it is pretty clear. It appears that he is proposing that we spend \nnext year $324 billion more than we planned to spend. He calls it a tax \ncut or maintaining a tax cut. In truth, it is a holiday from paying \ninto our Social Security pension that all Americans pay\n\n[[Page S8367]]\n\ninto as they work. It is a holiday from that.\n  Well, where does the money come from? We have a trust fund, Social \nSecurity, that we pay into, and we have a promised benefit when we \nretire. We want to honor that and make sure the Social Security trust \nfund is able to honor that. How do we not pay into it without hurting \nor damaging the Social Security trust fund?\n  They say: Well, don't worry. We will put the money in. Who is ``we''? \nWell, ``we'' is the United States Treasury. The United States Treasury \nwill put the money in. But the Treasury is projected by the \nCongressional Budget Office to run a $1 trillion deficit this year, a \nlittle bit better than the $1.23 trillion deficit that we ran last \nyear.\n  So we are running a $1 trillion deficit. We don't have any money in \nthe Treasury to pay to Social Security. So how do we honor the Social \nSecurity trust fund? How do we put the money in? Well, we give bonds. \nJust an IOU. The United States Treasury, as easy as pie, signs a \ndocument, an IOU, gives it to Social Security, and says: You are made \nwhole. Don't worry; no problem. What? Me worry? We have it under \ncontrol. Where does this come from?\n  Social Security is on a trajectory that is going to call this debt. \nThe trustees are going to need this money to pay our beneficiaries, and \nthey are going to call the debt to the United States Treasury and the \nUnited States Treasury is going to have to pay it, in my opinion, \nunless we totally abandon our responsibility to the seniors in America. \nI don't think we will. So we are going to pay that money, and it is \nadded to the debt. This year, under the President's plan, beginning in \nJanuary, he will add $324 billion in debt.\n  What the Bowles-Simpson Commission was all about was laying out a \nplan to reduce our debt, not increase the debt. The first thing we have \nto do to confront a surging debt in America is to quit digging the hole \ndeeper, quit asserting new programs to spend larger and larger amounts \nof money. It would also add $155 billion the second year. So it would \ntotal $479 billion over the first two years.\n  So they say: Well, we have the Treasury figured out. We will have a \ntax increase. We will raise taxes, and over 10 years that will pay for \nthe $479 billion that is added to our debt right now. There will be \nenough money coming in--don't worry--over 10 years from this new tax.\n  Well, I will just say a couple things about that. If we are going to \nraise taxes, what the bipartisan Debt Commission told us was, use it to \npay down debt. Don't use it to fund a new spending program of $479 \nbillion. If we are going to cut spending somewhere in the program to \nsave money, let's begin to reduce our debt. Don't just cut spending so \nwe can create a new spending program.\n  We have to watch what we are doing. I don't believe it has been \nthought through carefully where we are headed, and I don't see anything \nin this speech today that will lay out a 2-year, 5-year, 10-year plan \nfor making America a stronger and better place.\n  But, we are told, the President cares about the middle class; and if \nwe question any of these schemes, then we don't care about working \nAmericans. I reject that. That is offensive to me. I totally believe \nthat I represent the cross-section of people in my State and America. I \nlove and respect the working people of this country, and they are \nentitled to better. They are entitled to leadership that tells them the \ntruth. The truth is that we are endangering their future and their \nchildren's future by allowing the most incredible debt increases that \nthe Nation has ever seen, and that has to be brought under control.\n  It is offensive to suggest that if someone has a different view about \nhow to create jobs and wealth in America, they don't care about the \npeople who make America great, people who go to work every day, people \nwho send their children to defend this country and pay their taxes and \nobey the law and do things right and support those who are in trouble \nand need help.\n  I would propose this, more specifically--and I think the Republican \nplan touches these very issues in an effective way that would, in fact, \nincrease and enhance job creation and economic growth in America.\n  First, we need policies that reduce the cost of energy for Americans. \nWe have an Energy Department and an Interior Department that seem to \nbelieve their goal in life should be to drive up the cost of energy: to \nmake coal and natural gas harder to produce, make oil more hard to \nproduce, make us have to buy it from abroad when we could produce more \nat home, creating jobs in this country, creating wealth in this \ncountry, creating taxpayers in this country.\n  We need more American energy. We need more energy at lower prices. \nThe idea that somehow we are going to be better off because of carbon \nor other issues to have higher energy prices so we use less of it is \ntotally unjustified, and it is creating an incredible burden on working \nAmericans.\n  We need to end the health care proposal that is clearly driving up \nhealth care costs. It is causing businesses not to hire. I have talked \nto small businesses in my State. They assure me with absolute \nconfidence that the health care bill that will be taking effect, and is \nbeginning to take effect, will cause them to hire fewer people. We need \nmore people hired. We need more people working. We need to eliminate \nunnecessary, counterproductive governmental regulations that drive up \nthe costs of our products, making them less competitive in the world \nmarketplace. We need to do that. It will not cost the Treasury any \nmoney, but it will make America more productive and create jobs.\n  I supported and worked with my Democratic colleagues, and we passed \nin this Senate--but the President didn't support it--legislation to \ndemand that China treat its currency in a fair way to eliminate the \ncurrency manipulation they have been participating in and to eliminate \nthe unfair hammering, savaging of American industry that is occurring \nin this country as a result of unfair trade. That is very real. It has \nto end, and the President needs to be leading on that. It would create \njobs in our country without adding to our debt.\n  Finally, the greatest threat to our economic growth and to our job \ncreation in America is the debt itself. It is the cloud over our \neconomy. We have to do more about it.\n  There is one more thing I would mention; that is, tax simplification \nand tax alteration. Not to necessarily get less taxes but to create the \ntax revenue that the government takes in in a way that does not damage \nthe economy. Create a tax simplification plan that would encourage \neconomic growth and prosperity and not pull down economic growth and \nprosperity. So once we have done those things, we begin to focus on \nreducing our surging debt. If we do it steadfastly, like Governors all \nover America--Governor Bentley in Alabama is having to face challenges \nand is making tough decisions. But the State is still operating. It \nhasn't sunk into the ocean. Neither has New Jersey. Neither have other \nStates. Even New York and others are beginning to confront their debt \nsituation and make tough choices.\n  We are not doing it here. Our President is proposing more spending--\nnot just this $324 billion plan for this year, he is proposing to spend \n10 percent more on the Education Department next year, 10 percent more \non the Department of ``anti-Energy,'' 10 percent more for the State \nDepartment at a time when the country is in its most severe debt crisis \nin its history. That is not responsible. This debt is a threat to us.\n\n  If we talk to the financial experts and the wizards who move money \naround the world, they are worried about it. If we talk to government \nexperts such as the Secretary of the Treasury or the Federal Reserve \nChairman or the head of the Congressional Budget Office, they tell us \nwhat we are doing is dangerous, that we are on an unsustainable path. I \ndo not see in this speech today any commitment, any leadership from the \nPresident on this fundamental issue. The most fundamental failure of \nhis leadership is not to look the American people in the eye and to \ntell them honestly and truthfully that we are spending too much.\n  Back in Marion, AL, I was at a town meeting at somebody's house with \n30 or 40 people there. The oldest gentleman there spoke last. He had \nfought in World War II. He grew up during the Depression. He told us, \nin his view, it was not the high cost of living that was\n\n[[Page S8368]]\n\ngetting us in trouble but the cost of living too high.\n  I do believe we have been living too high, and we have been spending \ntoo much. The President--our leader--should be talking directly and \nhonestly to us and laying out a 2-year, 5-year, 10-year plan that will \nbring this deficit down. He should be explaining to the American people \nwhy we are all going to have to tighten our belts; why there is \nnothing--defense or anything else--that is going to avoid having to \ntighten its belt. We can do this and put our country on a sound path \nwithout having a debt crisis that would be a tragedy of monumental \nproportions.\n  Madam President, I just wanted to share those thoughts today. This \nCongress is going to have to do more than tread water for the next \nyear. We are going to have to do more than just play clever political \ngames. We are going to have to deal with the threat we face directly \nand honestly.\n  The proposal I see that was floated again today from the White House \nmay sound good politically. But for me, as one who has been looking at \nthe numbers, it does one thing: it increases the debt over the 2 years \nby $479 billion. That means probably this year's deficit will not be $1 \ntrillion but probably $1.35 trillion--1,350 billion dollars--this \nyear's deficit. We are promised that there will be a tax increase that, \nafter 10 years, will somehow pay for this.\n  That is the kind of thinking and action that has allowed this country \nto get out of control financially, and I hope we can do better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I rise today to mark a truly important \nday for my State, and indeed this entire nation.\n  December 6 is National Miner's Day, a time when we stop to honor our \nnation's coal miners and remember those who have done so much to make \nthis great country what we are today. These brave men and women work \nevery day to meet the challenge of keeping our great nation free and \nstrong, and although the history of mining has been marked by hardship \nand tragedy, the bravery of our miners has never faltered.\n  It is so fitting that today we also learned--just this morning--of a \nlandmark settlement of more than $200 million in one of the worst \nmining tragedies our State has faced.\n  April 5, 2010, 29 miners lost their lives in the Upper Big Branch \nmine, which was then owned by Massey Energy. Today, the U.S. Attorney \nfor the Southern District of West Virginia, Booth Goodwin, announced an \nagreement with Alpha Natural Resources, the company that purchased the \nMassey mines.\n  This comprehensive and forward-looking settlement takes the right \nsteps to truly protect our miners. By investing more than $120 million \nof this settlement in mine safety--including improvements to existing \nmines, a new West Virginia safety training facility and a research \ntrust--this agreement demonstrates that the government and the company \nare serious about creating a true legacy of mine safety.\n  While nothing can replace the beloved miners who we lost that \nterrible day, today's agreement shows that we all have zero tolerance \nfor anything corporations do--or don't do--that leads to a mine \nfatality.\n  As I have always said, at the heart of this tragedy is the simple \nfact that we must do everything in our power to never, ever allow any \nworker to be in the position where this could happen to them or their \nfamily. Especially since today is National Miner's Day, my thoughts and \nprayers are with the families of the 29 miners who died at Upper Big \nBranch--and I want to assure the families that the loss of their loved \nones will not be in vain. Every worker should know that when they kiss \ntheir children goodbye in the morning that they will return home at the \nend of that shift or the end of the day to kiss them goodnight.\n  I thank U.S. Attorney Goodwin and his entire team for their skill and \ndedication in negotiating this settlement that focuses on safety and \ntraining in the future. I also thank Alpha Natural Resources for rising \nto this occasion and meeting these terms. Even though Alpha did not own \nthe Upper Big Branch mine at the time of the disaster, I applaud the \ncompany for taking responsibility for both the mistakes that were made \nand for investing in the future of mining to help prevent another \ntragedy like this from ever taking place. I encourage them--and all our \nmining companies--to continue to take steps to protect our miners.\n  In addition, I am pleased that this agreement does not impede the \nfamilies from pursuing additional civil remedies and does not prevent \nthe authorities from prosecuting individuals whose actions may warrant \ncriminal charges. There should be no immunity for anyone who is \ndetermined to be responsible in any way for the tragedy at Upper Big \nBranch.\n  April 5, 2010 was one of our State's most heartbreaking days. I hope \nand pray that we will never again endure a tragedy like the Upper Big \nBranch deaths, and I will work every day to make sure that we don't.\n  Today we also remember the 104th anniversary of the Monongah Mine \ntragedy, our Nation's worst mining disaster--one that took 362 brave \nsouls.\n  So on this day, it is fitting to pay our respects and show \nappreciation for the miners of yesterday and today. We need to \nrecognize the contributions of past miners who have led us to where we \nare now, and today's miners who keep traveling deep into the darkness \nto provide millions of Americans with the electricity that powers our \nlives and the steel with which we build our Nation.\n  Without these men and women, our world would look very different. \nThey are the true backbone of our country. Our miners extracted the \ncoal that powered military ships in World War I and World War II--and \nevery conflict since.\n  Coal provided the steel to make our country the greatest industrial \npower in the world, ushering in prosperity that built our \ninfrastructure and developed a quality of life that became and is still \nthe envy of the world. Coal provides nearly half of the electricity in \nour country and every day millions of homes are warm, safe and full of \nlight thanks to coal.\n  Think for a moment. Try to imagine our country if there had been no \ncoal. It is almost inconceivable.\n  Coal is mined all over our great Nation. I thank all men and women \neverywhere who work in this industry, but I can speak personally about \nour brave and hardworking miners in West Virginia. The miners of West \nVirginia and their families are the heart and soul of the Mountain \nState and truly an inspiration for me.\n  Extracting minerals from the earth is not for the faint of heart. \nThis work requires engineering brilliance, nerves of steel and fearless \ndedication. West Virginia coal miners continue to set the bar for \nproductivity, quality, and innovation. Their work ethic is second to \nnone. Coal miners are not looking for a handout. All they want is a \nwork permit so they can go to work, earn a good wage, and provide for \ntheir families.\n  And coal miners are much more than just the work they do--they are \nsome of the most loyal, brave, trusted, and patriotic folks that you \ncould ever meet. Like their fellow West Virginians, these folks can \nshake your hand, look into your eyes, and touch your heart. Our coal \nminers love their families, the outdoors, their communities and their \nState. These miners work hard every shift, but if they get home and \nfind a person in need, their day begins again. If you are hungry, you \nwill be fed; if you are lost, you will get directions and then an \nescort to your destination. That's just the kind of people we are, and \nthat makes me so proud every day to be a West Virginian and have the \nhonor of representing them.\n  I will continue to tell our State's story when it comes to 'coal. And \nI will constantly work with my colleagues on both sides of aisle to \ndevelop technology that allows us to continue to use American coal to \nhelp achieve energy independence for our great country--which will \nensure our national security and grow our economy. The simple fact is: \nThis country needs coal and our coal miners are still willing and able \nto do the job.\n  So today it is my privilege to say thank you for the job that our \nbrave coal miners perform. This Nation was\n\n[[Page S8369]]\n\nbuilt on the backs of our coal miners, and all of us should thank them \nnot only today but every single day of the year, and every year to \ncome.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I came to the floor to speak \nabout Richard Cordray's nomination to lead the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau, but I wish to acknowledge the remarks of Senator \nManchin. We have coal miners in my great State of Colorado. They are \nparticularly located in the northwestern section of our State. They are \nhardworking. They are patriotic.\n  We have some of the cleanest coal in the world. It is used all over \nour country and exported to many countries around the world.\n  I thank him for his remarks and for drawing attention to their \naccomplishments and their contributions to America.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I thank my colleague.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/06/senate-section/article/S8369-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8369-S8370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NOMINATION OF RICHARD CORDRAY\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I come to the floor to put in \na word for Richard Cordray, who has been nominated to lead the Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau, which is otherwise known as the CFPB. \nNearly 2 months ago, I urged our leaders to prioritize a vote on the \nnominee because without a Director of the CFPB, there is important \nconsumer protection work being left undone. It is work that would \nbenefit hard-working Coloradans, those citizens of New Hampshire, and \nfamilies all across our Nation.\n  I wish to begin my remarks by thanking both the majority leader and \nthe Republican leader for moving to this important nomination. After \nhaving done that, I wish to turn and speak directly to Coloradans and \nany other Americans who may be listening. We get up here as Senators, \nand we will talk about this agency or that agency. Frankly, at times it \nsounds as if an alphabet soup. But this agency is not just another \nalphabet agency. The CFPB may be one of the most important Federal \nagencies we have, and it should be allowed to open its doors fully and \nbegin the important work of protecting our consumers. The CFPB was \ncreated in the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act to \nprotect American consumers from predatory and unfair financial \npractices. It was chartered to prevent the same kinds of abuses banks \nand other large financial firms engaged in as they drove our economy \ninto the ditch just a few short years ago.\n  When we look back at the financial collapse in 2008, many of us still \ncannot believe the largest banks and financial institutions in our \ncountry were able to put our economy at such risk. As drastic measures \nhad to be taken and billions of dollars invested in these firms, it \ncertainly didn't seem fair that banks and other financial institutions \nshould get taxpayer help after having taken advantage of the good \nintentions of American consumers and, as a result, tanking our economy.\n  The truth is we were forced to act in the Congress or even worse \nfinancial troubles awaited us--in fact, potentially a worldwide \nfinancial depression. That is why the Congress created the CFPB, to \nensure that kind of abuse never happens again. When we passed the Wall \nStreet Reform Act, Congress made clear its intent to create a watchdog \nwith the responsibility to make the financial marketplace safe for \nconsumers.\n  I think the Presiding Officer would agree that is something we should \nall want, to make sure Americans are not being taken advantage of by \nbig businesses and Wall Street bankers, to ensure someone is looking \nout for the little guy, to ensure there is slightly more of a level \nplaying field for the Americans who play by the rules.\n  Unfortunately, it is not. Many of our colleagues are raising a host \nof issues related to one central argument, that the CFPB will not be \naccountable to Congress and it will go hog wild in its efforts to look \nout for hard-working Americans. Yes, that is right. They argue the CFPB \nwill have too much power to protect consumers. I know that seems \nstrange to hear, especially after the banking sector abuses nearly sent \nour economy down an irrecoverable path and millions of Americans saw \nmany of their investments and much of their net worth disappear \novernight. But, yes, some of our colleagues actually want to weaken the \nconsumer protections that were included in the Wall Street reform bill \nwhich, by the way, is the law of the land. In order to make sure that \nhappens, they vow to block, to filibuster all nominees to head the \nCFPB, regardless of who they are. There have been blanket statements \nmade at the front end of this effort that whoever the nominee is, that \nperson will be blocked.\n  It strikes me that by doing that, they think they are going to deny \nthe CFPB a Director and that will erode the Bureau's effectiveness and \nmake it easier for banks to operate without limitation. That is \nprecisely why we have to overcome the filibuster that is being waged \nagainst Mr. Cordray right now. Without his leadership and a strong CFPB \nto look after the interests of consumers, we are going to put the \nfinancial security of hard-working American families at risk and the \ncountry's economic recovery at risk. By failing to give the CFPB a \nDirector, a confirmed Director, we are actually reducing oversight of \npredatory lending and deceptive banking practices. These are practices \nthat in no way help our economy or our economic recovery.\n  I do not think I am stretching the facts saying this. Deceptive \nfinancial practices continue to threaten Americans every day, and we \ncan do more to ensure these abuses are brought to an end. Let me focus \non one particular area.\n  Credit reporting agencies continue their deceptive ads on Web sites \nwith misleading names such as www.freescore.com and \nwww.freecreditscore.com that lure people into a costly credit \nmonitoring service. They do not offer free credit scores at all. \nInstead, what they do is they take the person's credit card number and \nthen they begin charging them a monthly fee. It is a similar hustle \nthat many other too-good-to-be-true Web sites offer. The problem is \nthis deceptive ad strikes at the heart of America's personal financial \nhealth. A person starts by doing the responsible thing--trying to check \ntheir credit score--but the next thing they know their credit card is \nbeing charged and they don't have that important data tied to their \ncredit score.\n\n  The point I am trying to make is without a confirmed director, the \nCFPB has diminished power to investigate the actions of the major \ncredit reporting agencies and pull down these kinds of deceptive ads. \nThat doesn't make any sense to me. It is sort of what Coloradans have \nbeen asking me, along these lines: When are you guys in DC, when are \nyou guys in the Senate going to side with us and stop always looking \nout for the big banks?\n  In these tough economic times, we need to do all we can to block such \ndishonest advertisements and help empower consumers to avoid these \nfinancial traps. The CFPB is the best way to accomplish these important \ngoals, but it needs a director to be able to act.\n  As some watching today know, and I hope Coloradans know, the Wall \nStreet reform bill contained a bipartisan provision I authored that now \nrequires lenders and other creditors to actually provide consumers a \nfree credit score when their score is used to deny them credit or they \nare offered credit with less favorable terms.\n  I authored this provision because credit scores are the most \nimportant and influential measure of a consumer's creditworthiness. As \nmillions of Americans continue to work to repair their credit status in \nthe wake of the Nation's worst financial collapse since the Great \nDepression, it is my belief that the CFPB must fully implement its \ncongressionally appointed oversight of consumer credit scores and \nrelated products to stop deceptive advertisements and other setups. So \nI will say it again: In order to carry out this mission, the Senate \nmust confirm a director to head the CFPB.\n\n[[Page S8370]]\n\n  The Consumers Union--one of the leading consumer advocates in the \nUnited States--is urging Congress to confirm Mr. Cordray so the \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau can tackle other critical consumer \nprotections such as reducing the penalty fees and punitive interest \nrates banks can charge, requiring credit rating agencies to maintain \naccurate consumer credit files, and investigate and fix errors reported \nby consumers. I know the Presiding Officer has heard stories about \nconsumers who are operating in good faith and then they come to find \nout their credit files are not accurate and they are penalized because \nof that situation. The CFPB could require credit agencies to maintain \naccurate files.\n  Finally, the CFPB could police the mortgage market to stop scams \nagainst consumers and prevent the return of the toxic loans and the \ndangerous lending practices that led to the foreclosure crisis and, \nultimately, the recession.\n  I don't think I am overstating the situation when I say there are \nstill a slew of unsafe financial products and services in the \nmarketplace. When consumers are lured into those traps, they then can \nget into a high-interest debt situation, and then that affects all of \nus. It affects our economic health more broadly. So the CFPB would be \ngiven the capacity to tackle these abusive and deceptive practices and \nthen be on the lookout for the next breed of financial scam.\n  For these reasons, it is my hope the Senate will take action quickly \nto confirm Mr. Cordray's nomination and then put in place an effective \nconsumer financial watchdog to ensure Americans get the tools they need \nto take control of their own financial destinies.

Madam President, a few weeks ago, in November, in \ncommunities across our country, our Nation's men and women in uniform \nwere honored on Veterans Day for their service to our Nation. I wish to \nshare a story with my colleagues of one exceptional Kansas veteran who \nis no longer with us but whose story stands as a lasting tribute to the \nmembers of our Armed Forces whose courage and sacrifice preserve our \nfreedoms.\n  Father Emil Kapaun was born in Pilsen, KS, in 1916 and served as a \nCatholic priest in the diocese of Wichita for 4 years before \nvolunteering for the U.S. Army in 1944. During the Korean war, he \nserved as a chaplain for the 8th Calvary Regiment of the First Army \nDivision.\n  His courageous actions in the Korean battlefields saved countless \nlives as he ran under enemy fire to rescue wounded soldiers. When \nFather Kapaun was taken prisoner in 1950, he continued to live out the \nArmy chaplain motto: ``For God and country.''\n  In the bitter cold of winter, Father Kapaun carried his injured \ncomrades on his back during forced marches through snow and ice, gave \naway his meager food rations, and cared for the sick who were suffering \nalongside him in the prison camp. When all else looked hopeless, this \nsimple priest from Kansas rallied his comrades, regardless of their \nfaith, to persevere, until his own death as a prisoner of war in 1951. \nThis good man distinguished himself by laying down his life for the \nsake of others.\n  Earlier this year, Senator Roberts and I introduced legislation to \naward this Kansas war hero the Medal of Honor for his acts of valor in \nthe Korean war. The legislation would request and provide the \nDepartment of Defense and the President with the authority to grant \nthis important honor. By waiving the 3-year statute of limitations--the \ntimeframe in which it can be awarded--Father Kapaun would be eligible \nto receive the Medal of Honor.\n  Senator Roberts and I offered this legislation recently as an \namendment to the Senate Defense authorization bill and the amendment \nwas unanimously approved by the Senate. I thank Senators Levin and \nMcCain for their support. My Kansas colleagues in the House were also \nsuccessful in including this language in the House version of the \nNational Defense Authorization Act, and I ask that with such strong \nsupport from both Chambers this provision be included in this year's \nfinal Defense authorization bill.\n  Father Kapaun is most deserving of the distinguished award and I am \nhopeful the Secretary of Defense and President Obama will use the \nauthority outlined in this legislation to give Father Kapaun his long \noverdue recognition.\n  At this special season of the year, we are reminded that there are \nsaints and heroes throughout the history of our Nation who put others \nabove themselves and live by God's plan for their lives. May we be \ninspired by their example and live our lives accordingly. Father Kapaun \ndemonstrated that one person can make a difference and help change the \nworld.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/06/senate-section/article/S8370-2", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8370-S8371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           WORK WELL TOGETHER\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I wish to speak this afternoon about \na lesson that Washington, DC can learn from Maryville, TN, which is my \nhometown. It is a lesson that most of us learned in kindergarten and I \nlearned in my mother's kindergarten, which was in a converted garage in \nour backyard, and it was three words: ``Work well together.''\n  The latest example of that was all over the sports pages of my \nhometown on Sunday: ``Historic Championship: Maryville Wins the 13th \nState Title--Most Ever.'' Our football team has learned to work well \ntogether. They earned their second consecutive State championship, as \nthe newspaper said. They beat Memphis Whitehaven. I watched the game on \nstatewide television. Their record this year was 15 and 0. It was their \nninth State title and ninth perfect season under an extraordinary \ncoach, George Quarles, who has won 179 games and lost 13 in his career \nin Maryville. This is the most State titles of any school in \nTennessee's history. The team scored 35 or more points in 109 of Coach \nQuarles' first 191 games. Maryville has averaged 30 or more points in \n12 of its 13 seasons under coach Quarles and its senior quarterback \nthis year, Patton Robinette, who has scholarships from good schools \neverywhere, was named the Gatorade Tennessee Football Player of the \nYear, part of which has to do with his academic credentials. He has a \nstraight A-plus average.\n  This leads me to the second thing they work well together on in \nMaryville, TN. The Maryville city schools were named the best overall \nschool district in the State, based on their academic performance, by \nthe State Collaborative on Reforming Education. The Maryville city \nschools recently received all As on their State math, reading, social \nstudies, science, and writing assessments. According to the Tennessean, \nMaryville city schools have the second highest test scores in the State \nin reading and math. The high school was selected as one of three \nfinalists in the prized category of high schools ``based primarily on \nstudent achievement gains and progress over time.'' More than 80 \npercent of Maryville High School students were proficient or advanced \nin math, 88 percent in reading/language arts. More than 90 percent \ngraduated in 2010 from the high school. Four seniors were National \nMerit semifinalists. 48 percent of Maryville High School students who \ntook the ACT college prep test last year met all four benchmarks for \ncollege and career readiness--English, math, reading, and science--\ncompared to 15 percent Statewide and 25 percent nationally. So the \nfootball team and the students have learned to work well together, \nacademically and athletically, at Maryville High School.\n  How did this all happen? I know a little bit about this. I am a proud \ngraduate, as the Presiding Officer may have suspected by now, of \nMaryville High School. I have wondered about this for a long time: How \ncould it have had such success in so many things? It is not the richest \ntown in the State by a long shot. Most families in Maryville would \ndescribe themselves as middle income.\n  One indicator of why they succeed and why they achieve so much \nexcellence in so many ways in their schools\n\n[[Page S8371]]\n\nis that the town devotes about 70 percent of its budget to its schools. \nIt is in a county where about half the citizens--50 percent of the \ncitizens of 100,000 in Blount County--have a library card. It is a \nplace where--at least it was when I was there--if you get in trouble at \nschool, you get in trouble at home. I can remember being called to the \nprincipal's office and administered pretty stern discipline when I was \nin the eighth grade, and I received the same treatment when I got home, \neven though my father was chairman of the school board. So there was \nnone of this business about parents blaming the teacher and the \nprincipal for what the child had done.\n  But I think the school principal, who is new to the town--Greg \nRoach--said it best. I saw him being interviewed at half time during \nthe football game last Saturday night.\n  He was asked: How did this happen? How did you have this champion \nfootball team more than any other school in the State and then you are \nnamed the best school district in the State? How can you do that all at \nonce?\n  He said: Well, it is a town school and when something happens, \neverybody shows up.\n  Well, they showed up at Tennessee Tech for the football game last \nSaturday night, but they also show up at the annual academic awards \nbanquets. I have been to those, and over the last several years it is \nmore like a sporting contest, with this student winning the Spanish \nchampionship and this one doing well in Latin and getting the same \nkinds of honors, awards, scholarships and pats on the back that \nfootball players do.\n  This emphasis on excellence in education and athletics is not \nsomething new to Maryville, TN. My grandfather sold his farm in the \ncounty to move into town so that my father could go to school, and my \naunt said my father felt as though he had died and gone to heaven when \nhe had that opportunity. My father, who was an elementary school \nprincipal after World War II, ran for the city school board with four \nother men and women and they stayed on the board as a ticket. They were \nelected every year as a ticket. They stayed there for 25 years, with \nthe whole objective of improving the quality of the education in the \nMaryville city school system.\n  While all that was going on, my mother taught in the preschool \nprogram--really the only one in our county at that time, although I \nthink Mrs. Pesterfield also had a preschool program. But Mrs. \nAlexander's--I used to call it lower institution of learning--had 25 3- \nand 4-year-olds and 25 5-year-olds in the afternoon. She was lobbying \nthe whole time to the school board on which my father served to put her \nout of business and start a public kindergarten, which they eventually \ndid in our State.\n  I used to talk about the Maryville schools and the community of \nMaryville when I was running for President 20 years ago, and my friend, \nBill Bennet, who was also a U.S. Education Secretary, was chairman of \nmy campaign. He would say to me: Lamar, not every community in America \nis Maryville, TN, and I know that. I know that. But I think a lot more \ncould be. There are a lot of theories about what makes a good school, \nbut I think Principal Roach may have it about right. It is a town \nschool, and when something happens, everybody shows up.\n  I think our new speaker of the house in Tennessee, Beth Harwell, had \nit right too when she observed that our State legislature finished work \nearly. They had some disagreements but worked well together, got some \nresults, and she said they learned in kindergarten to work well \ntogether, and that maybe that would be a good lesson for Washington, \nDC.\n  Well, I think Speaker Harwell is right. The example of the Maryville \nfootball team and the Maryville students is also right. When everybody \nshows up when something is going on, and when people work well \ntogether, good things happen. Working well together--in our case, \nbipartisanship--is not a goal, just as working well together was not \nthe goal of the football team. They wanted the championship. It was not \nthe goal of the students. They wanted the scholarship. But they knew \nthey had to work well together as a community to get a result.\n  They got a championship football team. They got the best school \ndistrict in the State. Perhaps that is a lesson for the Senate as we \nseek to take the very difficult responsibilities we have and earn the \nrespect of the men and women of this country who hired us and sent us \nhere to solve problems.\n  That is why today I would like to celebrate the success of the \nchampionship football team of Maryville High School and the \nchampionship school district of Maryville, TN, and suggest their lesson \nof working well together might be a good lesson for us.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/06/senate-section/article/S8371-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     PRESERVING ELECTRONIC RECORDS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I was pleased to see that the President of \nthe United States has issued a memorandum directing executive branch \nagencies to reform their records management. The goal is to improve \nperformance, promote accountability, and increase government \ntransparency by better documenting agency actions and decisions. The \nPresident's memorandum noted that the current Federal records \nmanagement system is based on an outdated approach involving paper and \nfiling cabinets, and it outlines a framework for moving the records \nmanagement process into the digital age by including plans for \npreserving electronic records. This issue was highlighted in a recent \nreport of the National Archives and Records Administration, which \nwarned that Federal agencies have done a poor job of managing the \nincreased volume and diversity of information that comes with advances \nin information technology.\n  I commend the President for taking this action, and I am pleased to \nsay that the U.S. Senate is already carrying out the practices for its \nown records that he has recommended for the executive branch. Over the \nlast 10 years, the Senate has preserved an average of 3,000 to 4,000 \nfeet of textual records for each Congress. Those paper records have \nbeen supplemented by 2.5 terabytes of electronic records. The Senate's \nelectronic records are being preserved at the Center for Legislative \nArchives within the National Archives.\n  With guidance provided by the Secretary of the Senate, 75 percent of \nall Senate committees are now engaged in archival preservation of their \ndigital records. Several Senate committees have responded to the \nincreased volume and complexity of electronic records by hiring \nprofessionally trained archivists to appraise, describe, and transfer \nthese materials.\n  The operations of every Senate office have been transformed over the \nlast decade. Our greater reliance on electronic communication and \nrecords systems has increased the need for preservation planning. Just \nas the paper records of the U.S. Senate, dating back to 1789, have been \ncarefully archived, records generated digitally in the 21st century \nwill require diligent attention if they are to survive for future use.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/06/senate-section/article/S8371-2", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8371-S8372]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO EARL AND OPAL WILLIAMS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I stand today to pay tribute to a fine \nand blessed couple, Mr. and Mrs. Earl and Opal Williams of Laurel \nCounty, KY.\n  Earl Williams and Opal Morgan grew up less than 20 miles apart Earl \nattended Bush High School located east of London, KY, and Opal attended \nHazel Green High School west of London--yet their paths never crossed \nat the time.\n  However, when Earl was 24 years old he set out for Kinzua, OR, some \n2,500 miles away where he began working for the Kinzua Pine Mills \nCompany. ``In those days you could not get any work locally, you had to \nleave home and usually go a long ways to find work,'' Earl recalls.\n  As fate would have it, a short time later Earl and Opal met after \nOpal traveled to Kinzua to visit her father, who was also employed by \nthe Kinzua Pine Mills Company. Eventually, Opal took a job in a local \nfactory and decided to stay in Kinzua. ``Our courtship was about \nnormal,'' Opal says. ``We dated for about a year and got married \nDecember 22, 1949, in Goldendale, Washington.''\n  In December of 1954, Earl and Opal returned home to Laurel County, \nKY, after spending 2 years in Indianapolis, IN. Earl began a career \nwith Water\n\n[[Page S8372]]\n\nSoftener Rental, a company Earl bought into and then later purchased \noutright from his partners, while Opal stayed busy making a wonderful \nhome in the house the couple built on the ``Old Williams' Farm,'' a \nhouse Earl is especially proud of. ``This farm belonged to the Williams \nfamily during the Civil War,'' he boasts.\n  Earl and Opal were married for 7 years before they were blessed with \nfour children, sons David, Joe, and Phillip, and daughter Amber. The \ncouple is not shy about explaining that their children have been the \nhighlight of their lives. ``We enjoyed our boys,'' the couple says, \n``but we were ready for a girl when Amber came along.''\n  These days Earl and Opal stay busy tending to their three \ngrandchildren and one great-grandson several days a week, and Earl \nstill drops by the office daily to ``check on'' his sons. The couple, \nwho have been married for over 61 years, claim that their faith and \ndedication to their church, Lick Fork Community Missionary Baptist, has \nplayed a major role in the success of their lives and marriage over the \nyears--the two have been members of the church for over 50 years. ``It \nhas been a good life,'' Opal says. ``We got married 61 years ago to \nstay married. We never thought of divorce like young couples do \ntoday.''\n  Mr. President, Earl and Opal Williams have shared an incredible \njourney together, and their faith in each other, their family, and \ntheir church has given them a wonderful story to share. Earl and Opal's \nlife together serves as an inspiration to the people of Kentucky, and I \nwish them many years of further happiness. The Laurel County-area \npublication the Sentinel Echo recently published an article to share \nthe Williams' story with the rest of our great Commonwealth. I ask \nunanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Sentinel Echo, Winter 2011]\n\n                    Finding Love in a Far Off Place\n\n                            (By Sue Minton)\n\n       Earl and Opal were not high-school sweethearts. They did \n     not know each other as teenagers. Both grew up in Laurel \n     County, on opposite ends of the county and attended rival \n     high schools.\n       Earl Williams grew up east of London and attended Bush High \n     School. Opal Morgan grew up west of London and attended Hazel \n     Green High School.\n       Less than 20 miles separated the two. They may have seen \n     each other at box suppers, the movies or social gatherings, \n     but did not take notice.\n       ``In those days you could not get any work locally, you had \n     to leave home and usually go a long ways to find work,'' Earl \n     said.\n       For 24-year-old Earl this was Kinzua, Oregon.\n       And it was in this lumber company-built town, 2,500 miles \n     from home, that Earl did take notice of Opal.\n       The couple met in Kinzua where Earl was working for the \n     Kinzua Pine Mills Company.\n       ``Kinzua, Oregon, was built by and for the Kinzua Pine \n     Mills Company,'' Earl said. ``It was a company town, \n     everything was owned by the company, all the stores, even the \n     houses we lived in.''\n       Opal went to visit her father, who also worked for the \n     company, and stayed on after meeting Earl, getting a job in a \n     local factory.\n       ``Our courtship was about normal,'' Opal said. ``We dated \n     for about a year and got married Dec. 22, 1949, in \n     Goldendale, Washington.''\n       ``About all there was to do in this little town was go to \n     the movies,'' she said. ``They showed the same movie all \n     week. So we went once a week.''\n       Opal recalls the company having a community building called \n     ``The Pass Time.''\n       ``On Saturday nights they had dances and on Sunday mornings \n     the building was cleared out for church,'' she said. ``We \n     didn't care much about dancing; it was just being together in \n     each other's company.''\n       The couple returned to Laurel County in December 1954 after \n     leaving Kinzua and spending about two years in Indianapolis, \n     Indiana.\n       After returning home Earl went to work with Water Softener \n     Rental. ``I bought into the company in 1957 and later \n     purchased the company from my partners,'' he said.\n       While Earl was building a successful business, Opal was \n     making a home for the couple in the house they built on part \n     of the Old Williams' Farm.\n       ``This farm belonged to the Williams family during the \n     Civil War,'' Earl said proudly.\n       Although their marriage and life was good, the couple \n     wished for a baby.\n       ``We were married seven years before this happened,'' Opal \n     said.\n       ``We were beginning to think we were not going to have any \n     children.''\n       When asked `what was an important milestone or event in \n     their lives?' they answered simultaneously, ``the boys.''\n       ``That was probably the highlight of our marriage,'' Earl \n     said, ``when the boys, David, Joe and Phillip, were born.''\n       ``Everyone said we changed completely when David was \n     born,'' Opal said. ``I don't know how we changed or how much, \n     but Earl's mother said we did.''\n       With only two years between the births of Joe and Phillip, \n     Opal referred to this almost like raising twins.\n       ``It would have been nice to have had a girl,'' Opal said. \n     ``But little boys are nice too, and I enjoyed my boys.''\n       ``But, we were ready for a girl when Amber came along,'' \n     Earl said.\n       ``We have three grandchildren, Amber, James and Matthew, \n     and a great-grandson, Will,'' Opal added.\n       Earl and Opal said their marriage had not been different \n     from most couples who have been married for many years. They \n     don't have a magic formula to explain the success of their \n     marriage. They just took their wedding vows seriously.\n       ``We never thought of divorce like young couples do \n     today,'' Opal said. ``We got married 61-years ago to stay \n     married. You have your differences but you work through \n     them.''\n       ``They should try to work their problems out,'' Earl added.\n       ``Couples should not be so quick to get a divorce. If \n     everything does not fall into place for them, they'd get \n     divorced,'' she added. ``But there are some situations when a \n     divorce is the only way.''\n       Opal feels it is important for young wives to develop their \n     own lives and interests. ``Married couples should be able to \n     work together, but women need their independence.''\n       Their faith and dedication to their church, Lick Fork \n     Community Missionary Baptist, where they have been members \n     for more than 50 years, has contributed to and played a major \n     role in the success of their lives and marriage.\n       Although both are in good health, Earl has slowed down some \n     since retiring, but still goes into the office daily `to \n     check on the boys.'\n       ``It is nice having him home,'' Opal said. ``Before he was \n     always working at the business or the farm.''\n       Opal spends three days a week enjoying and caring for \n     great-grandson Will, the latest boy in the Williams' family.\n       When Will's mother, Amber, was asked to comment on her \n     grandparents she said, ``Eric and I were like them (referring \n     to her grandparents), we were married seven years before Will \n     came along. I think it is amazing to have been married for so \n     many years and raised three sons that have been very \n     successful. They were taught good work ethics (which) they \n     are passing on to their children.''\n       ``It has been a good life,'' Opal said.\n       ``We have had a good married life. It does not seem like 61 \n     years; it has went by fast,'' Earl added.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/06/senate-section/article/S8372-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8372-S8373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  COMMEMORATING THE 70TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE JAPANESE ATTACK ON PEARL \n                                 HARBOR\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, on December 7, 70 years ago, just before 8 \nin the morning local time, the first wave of 183 Japanese imperial \naircraft descended upon the United States naval base at Pearl Harbor. A \nsecond wave of 170 aircraft followed to make sure that as much damage \nwas done as possible. Within 2 hours, this unwarranted act of \naggression left four U.S. Navy battleships, three cruisers, three \ndestroyers, an anti aircraft training ship, one minelayer and 188 U.S. \naircraft destroyed. The attack left devastation and havoc in its wake, \ntaking the lives of 2,402 Americans and wounding 1,282. The Imperial \nJapanese Navy conducted this attack in order to limit U.S. military \nintervention capabilities in respect to Japanese imperial ambitions in \nthe Pacific arena.\n  On that day that President Roosevelt so aptly said would ``live in \ninfamy,'' the Japanese Empire left something behind amongst the \nsmoldering ruins of our Navy. They left behind a unified people in \nwhich they ``awakened the beast.'' Out of the ashes of Pearl Harbor was \nreborn an even stronger American Navy, economy, and people.\n  For the younger generations of today, Pearl Harbor was a remote event \nin an era long gone. But to people like Army PFC. Merle Berdine, of \nValparaiso, IN, who was sitting in the warm Hawaiian sunshine in front \nof his barracks at Fort Kamehameha that fateful Sunday morning, this \nact of aggression was an attack on the present. Pearl Harbor wasn't \njust part of his collective history that he shared with his nation, it \nbecame part of his personal history, shaping and defining him. At 7:54 \na.m. Merle was a soldier going through his daily routine and finishing \nup his 1-year rotation at Pearl Harbor. At 7:55 a.m. he was a man under \nattack in a nation at war, digging a trench to withstand the \nbombardment and wondering whether he\n\n[[Page S8373]]\n\nwas going to see his family again. By 11 a.m., he was dealing with a \nnew reality, one in which he was saying goodbye to more than 2,000 of \nhis brothers. Within 24 hours, he was a soldier for a nation at war \nwith Japan, within 48 hours, that war had grown.\n  We as a nation oftentimes take the sacrifice Merle and his fellow \nservicemembers have made for granted. They sacrificed their time, their \npersonal health, and far too often their lives to let us as a nation \nlive free and prosper. Without their sacrifices we would be living in a \nvery different world today and no amount of gratitude can ever be \nenough. But we must try, and we must, most importantly, remember.\n  I am proud to say that, at last count, 60 of these heroes who \nexperienced the horror of Pearl Harbor call Indiana home. But, as with \nall World War II veterans, this proud generation is shrinking. Just \nlast year, six Pearl Harbor veterans passed away in our State. \nAccording to the Pearl Harbor Survivors, only 25 of them are able to be \nactive members of their community. The rapid decline and increasing \nimmobility of this generation poses many dangers to the memory of Pearl \nHarbor.\n  Today, we remember their sacrifice, we discuss the events of the day, \nthe lessons of history are reviewed, we collectively remember, and, if \nyou know a veteran of Pearl Harbor, we should slow down and listen \nbefore the opportunity passes.\n  Since 2002, I have been leading the effort in Indiana to record oral \nhistory interviews with Pearl Harbor survivors and all veterans as part \nof the Library of Congress Veterans History Project. In addition to the \nstories of 104 Hoosier Pearl Harbor survivors already archived at the \nLibrary of Congress, I have submitted the histories of over 10,000 \nveterans for permanent inclusion in our national history. As a veteran \nof the U.S. Navy, I know the memories and life changing experiences \ngained from serving our country, and I am pleased to help ensure that \nHoosier veterans are able to record their personal stories so that we \ncan all learn about and appreciate their tremendous sacrifice.\n  One of the most important lessons of Pearl Harbor was that the \nadversaries of the United States are multiple and active. We learned \nthat we must always be prepared. On September 11, 2001, we were \npainfully reminded of these lessons.\n  As we recognize these historical events, I call attention to the \n97,800 military personnel who today are on the ground in Afghanistan, \nwith a total of 129,200 deployed to the region aboard ships at sea, on \nbases, and at air stations in the region supporting Operation Enduring \nFreedom. We are down now to only about 12,500 military personnel \ndeployed to Iraq, yet some 79,105 are still deployed to the region \naboard ships at sea, on bases, and air stations in support of the \nredeployment of that force. Since 2003, 4,474 have been killed in Iraq \noperations, and 1,733 have been killed in Afghanistan since 2001.\n  These men and women continue to answer the call to serve a cause \ngreater than themselves, as those men did that fateful day in Pearl \nHarbor 70 years ago. I ask my colleagues to join me in humbly honoring \nPrivate First Class Berdine and all those who have and continue to \nserve our Nation in uniform for their inspirational service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/06/senate-section/article/S8373-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   RECOGNIZING THE MISSION CONTINUES\n\n Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, on Veterans Day, November 11, 2011, \nI was fortunate enough to attend a service project at Walnut Grove \nElementary School in St. Louis, MO, alongside nearly 100 veteran and \ncivilian volunteers. These volunteers recognized that Veterans Day is \nnot just an opportunity to thank veterans but also an opportunity to \nrecognize them as the civic assets they are and to demonstrate that \ntheir skills and leadership are very much needed in our communities. \nThis group spent nearly 7 hours working on a wide variety of academic \nand artistic projects that will improve the learning environment at \nWalnut Grove Elementary.\n  This experience was only possible through a Missouri organization \ncalled The Mission Continues, headquartered in St. Louis. Founded in \n2007 after CEO Eric Greitens returned home from service in Iraq as a \nNavy SEAL, The Mission Continues is the only national nonprofit \ndedicated to empowering post-9/11 veterans to rebuild purpose through \ncommunity service. They have recognized that many veterans struggle to \nfind purpose at home without the structure, mission, and camaraderie of \na military unit. The Mission Continues challenges our veterans to apply \ntheir military skill sets to address critical needs within our \ncommunities by serving as citizen leaders. This unique approach gives \nveterans renewed purpose and strengthens our communities for future \ngenerations.\n  The Mission Continues engages post-9/11 veterans to serve in their \ncommunities through 28-week service fellowships at nonprofit \norganizations. This fellowship program provides our former military men \nand women with the opportunity to translate their military experience \ninto civilian skills. To date, The Mission Continues has awarded nearly \n200 successful fellowships in 30 States and the District of Columbia. \nAdditionally, the organization recognizes our veterans as civic assets \nand brings veterans and civilians together to serve their country by \nleading in their local communities.\n  We must remind ourselves that while our veterans are often told \n``thank you,'' they also need to hear, ``we still need you.'' Through \ntheir work, The Mission Continues is fundamentally changing the way our \nNation welcomes home our servicemembers. In addition to the fellowship \nprogram, they are contributing to comprehensive academic research, have \nestablished innovative partnerships between public and private \norganizations that support our veterans in their transition, and \nprovide an experienced voice as the Nation tackles veterans' issues.\n  I encourage my colleagues in the Senate to recognize the work that \nThe Mission Continues performs every day. As a nation, we are all \ninvested in the post-military careers of the men and women in uniform \nwho have defended our country. I encourage all Members to stand with \nThe Mission Continues as they challenge our veterans to be citizen \nleaders in their communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/06/senate-section/article/S8373-2", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8373-S8374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            CELEBRATING THE PUBLIC SERVICE OF DR. HAL COHEN\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I rise to celebrate the \ndistinguished career of Dr. Hal Cohen, an internationally renowned \neconomist and professor, devoted husband, father, and grandfather, and \nmy good friend.\n  Harold Allen Cohen was born in New York on April 21, 1938. After \nearning his B.A. from the college that is now known as SUNY-Binghamton \nand his M.A. from Cornell University, Hal began his career in health \ncare financing and public policy by earning a Ph.D. from Cornell \nUniversity in 1967. After completing his education, he was awarded a \nprestigious fellowship with the National Science Foundation from 1969 \nto 1971, which he followed with a year-long stint as an associate at \nthe Danforth Foundation while teaching economics at the University of \nGeorgia, first as an assistant and then as an associate professor.\n  Hal then took a position that would come to define his career. In \n1972, he moved to Baltimore to become the executive director and \nfounding member of the Health Services Cost Review Commission, or \nHSCRC, the State agency that regulates hospital rates in Maryland. As a \nmember of the Maryland House of Delegates, I worked closely with Dr. \nCohen during the formative years of the HSCRC, and while he is quick to \nsay that he was surrounded by a tremendous group of colleagues, it was \nhis leadership that cemented the HSCRC as a Maryland institution. His \ninsight was and continues to be invaluable in containing hospital cost \ngrowth. Dr. Cohen worked to ensure that hospitals could provide \nefficient, high quality care to every Marylander as he focused on \nensuring that hospital financing options were fair, accessible and \nequitable. Since 1976, the HSCRC has financed nearly $1 billion in \nuncompensated care, improving access for underinsured and uninsured \nMarylanders, and supporting hospitals' social mission while providing \nthem greater financial stability.\n\n[[Page S8374]]\n\n  Since 1977, Maryland hospitals have been paid on the basis of the \nrates established by the HSCRC, ensuring that Maryland's health costs \nare kept low, and that its health system is tailored to the needs of \nits citizens. Under Hal's leadership, the State of Maryland has saved \nover $47 billion since 1976. The HSCRC has been essential in ensuring \nthat each hospital in Maryland provides comprehensive care that \nincludes assistance for the underinsured, as well as incorporating \nteaching and research programs into the structure of the hospital \ncenter.\n  As Executive Director of the HSCRC, Dr. Cohen ushered the \norganization through its first 15 years. He worked to ensure that the \nagency would work well with Maryland hospitals, the Maryland State \nLegislature, and most importantly, for Maryland's citizens in a \ntransparent and accountable fashion. The independent nature of the \nHSCRC allows the agency the ability to advocate for and support a \nlegislative agenda, and Dr. Cohen used this ability over the length of \nhis career to fight for fair and sustainable pricing structures that \nsupport hospitals and patients.\n  The system set up by the HSCRC was so well-conceived that it has \nsucceeded for nearly 35 years. All-payer rate setting is now being \ndiscussed by many leading health economists as an effective way to \ncontrol the unsustainable growth in health care costs.\n  Dr. Cohen's base of knowledge has been widely sought. He has served \non three Federal committees, and he was a founding appointee to the \nProspective Payment Assessment Commission--ProPAC. He has also served \nas a member of the National Committee on Rural Health, the National \nCommittee of Vital and Health Statistics, and he served as Commissioner \nof the Maryland Health Care Access and Cost Commission from 1993 to \n1998. As Commissioner, he played a key role in improving quality and \nexpanding health care access, by initiating HMO report cards to \nevaluate quality and establishing a small group market system to make \ninsurance more affordable for small businesses.\n  In 1985, 2 years before he would step down as the Executive Director \nof HSCRC, he founded Hal Cohen, Inc., a health care consulting firm \nlocated in Baltimore, MD to offer consulting services in the areas of \nhospital financing and public policy. He has served clients from every \ncorner of the industry and all over the country, from the Federal \nGovernment to private insurers, from HMOs to self-insured companies.\n  In addition to his significant and long-lasting professional impact, \nDr. Hal Cohen is known throughout Baltimore as a loving husband and \nfather. Hal and his wife, Jo, have been married for more than 50 years, \nand their family has grown to include their children--Robb, Gail, \nDavid, Heather, and Amy--and their five grandchildren--Lizzie, Alex, \nMax, Zhi, and Olive.\n  Dr. Cohen's extensive work will continue to make Maryland a better \nplace to live. His essential leadership was crucial in building the \nHSCRC as a force for fairness in health care pricing and for expanding \npatient access to health care. I thank him for his long service, and I \ncongratulate him on his many years of putting the people of Maryland \nfirst--he is a public servant of the highest caliber, and I am proud to \ncall him my trusted advisor and dear friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/06/senate-section/article/S8374-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO NANCY BERGMANN\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, my colleague Senator Jim Risch joins \nme today in recognizing Nancy Bergmann's retirement after 26 years of \ndedicated and effective service.\n  For the past 18 years, Nancy has represented the Idaho National \nLaboratory, INL, in promoting economic development, expanding \ntechnology business sectors and creating understanding about the \nnuclear and energy missions at INL. Nancy is a well-known and endearing \nfigure in Idaho's high-technology business community. During her \ncareer, she has made a significant impact in helping small businesses, \nnurturing entrepreneurs, and aiding communities in increasing their \ntechnology business base. Previously, she initiated Idaho's Hispanic \nYouth Symposium while managing INL's diversity program in human \nresources, which also was recognized by President George H.W. Bush for \nexcellence. With more than 30 years of involvement in serving United \nWay and community service, Nancy also has been appointed to more than \n25 boards and commissions, including the Idaho Rural Partnership, Idaho \nTechConnect, and many more.\n  Nancy has also been instrumental in organizing regional economic \ndevelopment offices throughout Idaho. In addition to serving on the \nNational United Way Board of America, Nancy has been named INL's Woman \nof the Year, Idaho's Business Woman of the Year, and 2008 Idaho \nBusiness Review Woman of the Year. On November 18, 2011, the Southern \nIdaho Economic Development Organization honored Nancy for a decade of \nsupport by establishing the Nancy Bergmann/INL Math & Science \nScholarship, managed by the College of Southern Idaho Foundation.\n  We wish Nancy an enjoyable retirement and a wonderful time with her \nfamily, including five granddaughters. We hope that retirement will \nprovide Nancy with more opportunities to enjoy Idaho's magnificent \nsunsets. Congratulations to Nancy for achieving this milestone, and \nthank you, Nancy, for your outstanding service to Idaho \ncommunities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/06/senate-section/article/S8374-2", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECOGNIZING THE CHILDREN'S HOME SOCIETY\n\n Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise to give a voice to the \ncountless children in need of good homes all across this country and to \nrecognize an organization in my State that helps provide these children \nwith a safe environment and a nurturing family.\n  The Children's Home Society has served West Virginia for 115 years. \nThis organization has 12 locations all across our State that work to \nmeet one critical mission: finding homes for children who don't have a \nloving place to live.\n  I have always said the best investment we can make in our country is \nan investment in the next generation, and that starts with making sure \neach of our children has a place to call home. That is why the work of \nthe Children's Home Society is so important.\n  More than 400 children in my home State of West Virginia are \ncurrently living in a foster home. For many of them, it is the first \ntime they have received a safe place to live and loving care. The \nChildren's Home Society has worked tirelessly on their behalf. Their \nprograms range from emergency shelters to foster and adoption services \nand mentoring. The organization exists to help care for, protect, and \nnurture children, as well as strengthen and protect families.\n  The Children's Home Society has also worked vigorously to build \nawareness throughout our State. This fall the organization hosted the \nFootsteps for Foster Kids Festival, an event created to illustrate the \nneed for foster families in West Virginia and recruit families who can \nprovide loving homes for children. All day long, children and families \nhad opportunities to participate in various activities at the festival, \nincluding paddle boat races and fishing competitions. More than 400 \npeople attended, and the Children's Home Society was able to reach out \nto new families interested in opening their homes to children in need.\n  In fact, the idea for the Footsteps for Foster Kids Festival first \ncame from our young people, when 10 area youth called the Band Together \nOrganization worked with the Children's Home Society to make the day a \ntrue success. They are an inspiring group, and we are all proud of \ntheir efforts and service to the community.\n  I would like to congratulate the Children's Home Society for their \nlegacy of impressive and meaningful work and thank the Band Together \nOrganization for the commitment they have demonstrated to improving the \nlives of children. Your example serves our State and our Nation \nwell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/06/senate-section/article/S8374-3", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8374-S8375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          Enrolled Bill Signed\n\n  At 12:12 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker has \nsigned the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 2192.

which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                               S.Res. 344\n\n       Whereas in January 2007, President Daniel Ortega was \n     inaugurated to a second 5-year presidential term, having \n     served as President from 1985 to 1990;\n       Whereas as a result of widespread electoral fraud during \n     the November 2008 municipal elections, Nicaragua lost more \n     than $100,000,000 in international assistance and a \n     $175,000,000 Millennium Challenge Compact was suspended;\n       Whereas Article 147 of the Constitution of Nicaragua states \n     that a candidate cannot serve consecutively as President and \n     that a President cannot serve more than 2 terms;\n       Whereas on October 19, 2009, the Sandinista-controlled \n     Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Nicaragua \n     issued a controversial ruling that partially annulled Article \n     147 of the Constitution of Nicaragua and allowed Daniel \n     Ortega to run for a third presidential term;\n       Whereas the Department of State called the October 2009 \n     Supreme Court ruling ``. . . part of a larger pattern of \n     questionable and irregular governmental actions, beginning \n     before the flawed municipal elections of November 2008, that \n     threatens to undermine the foundations of Nicaraguan \n     democracy and calls into question the Nicaraguan government's \n     commitment to uphold the Inter-American Democratic Charter'';\n       Whereas the Constitution of Nicaragua gives the National \n     Assembly sole power to elect Supreme Court magistrates, \n     Supreme Electoral Council magistrates, and other national \n     public officials;\n       Whereas in January 2010, President Ortega issued a decree \n     that circumvented the National Assembly and indefinitely \n     extended\n\n[[Page S8378]]\n\n     the terms of 25 incumbent public officials, including members \n     of the Supreme Court and the Supreme Electoral Council;\n       Whereas in August 2011, the Supreme Electoral Council \n     announced that all international and national observers will \n     be a part of the election and monitor the process under the \n     mandate of an ``accompaniment ruling'', which included 25 \n     articles, establishing, among other restrictions, who can \n     participate, what their functions may be, the limits of their \n     actions, and the process of accreditation to become an \n     official observer;\n       Whereas on November 10, 2011, the Department of State noted \n     ``. . . the Nicaraguan Government's failure to accredit \n     certain credible domestic organizations as observers, \n     difficulties voters faced in obtaining proper identification \n     and pronouncements by Nicaraguan authorities that electoral \n     candidates might be disqualified after the elections'' and \n     agreed that ``the Supreme Electoral Council did not operate \n     in a transparent and impartial manner'';\n       Whereas the European Union Election Observing Mission to \n     Nicaragua noted that elections had been supervised by \n     ``electoral authorities with very little independence and \n     equanimity'' and it further deemed a ``grave reversal to the \n     democratic quality of Nicaraguan elections'';\n       Whereas during the 2011 general elections in Nicaragua, the \n     Mission of Electoral Accompaniment of the Organization of \n     American States noted several ``situations of concern'', \n     including problems providing identification cards to voters, \n     the accreditation of observers, and imbalances in the \n     political parties present at polling stations;\n       Whereas the Organization of American States called upon \n     Nicaraguan authorities to investigate acts of violence \n     perpetrated on election day; and\n       Whereas as a member of the Organization of American States \n     and signatory to the Inter-American Democratic Charter, the \n     Nicaraguan Government has the legal responsibility to abide \n     by the principles of constitutional, representative \n     democracy, which includes free and fair elections and \n     adherence to their own constitution: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the democratic aspirations of the people of \n     Nicaragua;\n       (2) deplores the interruption of constitutional order in \n     Nicaragua that led to the fraudulent reelection of Daniel \n     Ortega on November 6, 2011, elections;\n       (3) condemns the acts of violence perpetrated on election \n     day and calls upon Nicaraguan authorities to fully \n     investigate and prosecute those responsible;\n       (4) urges President Barack Obama and Secretary of State \n     Hillary Clinton to take immediate and meaningful measures to \n     encourage the restoration of constitutional rule in \n     Nicaragua, including opposing loans by international \n     financial institutions to the Nicaraguan Government;\n       (5) urges the immediate issuance of a final report on the \n     Mission of Electoral Accompaniment of the Organization of \n     American States, including a detailed report on \n     constitutional irregularities impacting the preelectoral \n     phase in Nicaragua; and\n       (6) urges the United States Ambassador to the Organization \n     of American States to lead an effort to use the full power of \n     the organization in support of meaningful steps to restore \n     democracy and the rule of law in Nicaragua in accordance to \n     the Inter-American Democratic Charter, including formally \n     suspending the Nicaraguan Government under Articles 20 and 21 \n     of the Inter-American Democratic Charter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/06/senate-section/article/S8378-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8378]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARING\n\n\n          COMMITTEE ON HEALTH, EDUCATION, LABOR, AND PENSIONS\n\n  Mr. HARKIN.
