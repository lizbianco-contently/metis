Mr. President, Ronald Reagan's second inauguration was the \nfirst one I attended as a Member of Congress. It was bitterly cold that \nday. While the temperatures sank into the single digits, Reagan became \nthe first and only President to take the oath of office in the Capitol \nRotunda.\n  He said in an indoor inaugural address:\n\n       History is a ribbon, always unfurling. History is a \n     journey. And as we continue our journey, we think of those \n     that traveled before us.\n\n  Yesterday would have been President Reagan's 100th birthday. Today, \nwe think of President Reagan and how he steered America's travels \nthrough history's journey. I first met President Reagan when he was \nGovernor of California. I was the Lieutenant Governor of Nevada. We met \nin Heavenly Valley, on the Nevada side of Lake Tahoe, to watch the \nfirst annual ``hot-dogging'' skiing championship. As I said, I first\n\n[[Page S582]]\n\nmet him and we had a wonderful visit. I enjoyed that day very much.\n  His own travels took him not only to Lake Tahoe in my State but \nthrough the entire State. California's Ronald Reagan was a close friend \nof Nevada's. In his earliest days as an actor, he entertained crowds at \nthe Last Frontier on the Las Vegas strip. Decades later, the same week \nRonald Reagan became Governor of California, Paul Laxalt became \nGovernor next door in Nevada.\n  When Reagan first sought the Presidency, Laxalt managed his campaign, \nand when President Reagan worked down the street at the White House, \nPaul Laxalt worked here as Nevada's senior Senator. It was a special \nrelationship, a unique relationship, one so close that some called \nSenator Laxalt the First Friend, and he was that.\n  I was fortunate enough to see firsthand President Reagan's \nappreciation for Nevada. After talking to Nevadans in Ely and across \neastern Nevada, I came to the conclusion that I should drop some \nwilderness I was going to put in place and instead form a national \npark. Nevada did not have a national park, and we would call it the \nGreat Basin National Park. After I introduced that legislation and it \npassed, President Reagan's Secretary of Agriculture recommended that he \nveto what would be Nevada's only national park. The Agriculture \nSecretary did not much like the idea of a young Member of Congress from \nthe other political party putting such a bill on the President's desk.\n  I was worried about that. Word came to me that the President was \ngoing to veto this bill that was important to me. I asked for a meeting \nwith his Superintendent of Parks, the National Parks Director. He had \nbeen the Superintendent of Parks for Ronald Reagan when Reagan was \nGovernor of California. His name was Penn Mott. When he came to see me, \nhe had been in the service of our country in many different ways. He \nwas an elderly man when he came to see me. I explained to him what was \nhappening and that I was told that President Reagan, upon \nrecommendation of one of his Cabinet members, was going to veto my \nbill. That man looked at me and he said: President Reagan is not going \nto veto that bill. He said, when I was a young park ranger in 1928, Key \nPittman, who was a famous Nevada Senator, very close to President \nRoosevelt, sent me to Nevada to find a place for a national park. He \nsaid: That is my park. I am the one who said it would go there. That is \nwhere it should go, and it never made it legislatively. But because of \nthat meeting I had, and Ronald Reagan's understanding of what politics \nis all about, he did not veto my bill. He overruled his Secretary, and \ntogether, Harry Reid and Ronald Reagan created the Great Basin National \nPark.\n  It was not the last time President Reagan and I worked together to \npreserve our West. I introduced legislation that was important \nlegislation. It involved two Indian tribes, two endangered species, it \ninvolved Lake Tahoe, and it involved two rivers, the Truckee and Carson \nRivers--I think I mentioned the two Indian tribes--a huge wetlands that \nhad gone from a couple of hundred thousand acres to maybe less than a \nthousand very putrid acres. Birds died eating and drinking there. The \nwetlands basically had dried up.\n\n  It was a very important piece of legislation, but I got it passed. I \ngot it passed here. Then it went to the House and got passed. Again, \nPresident Reagan's advisers recommended he veto that bill. Part of it \nwas because of who pushed the legislation through. But President Reagan \nknew how important it was to Lake Tahoe, and one of his assistants, Sig \nRogich, talked to him. Sig is a long-time Nevadan, worked very closely \nwith President Reagan and with President Bush, and he talked to him \nabout this important legislation. It was not vetoed. He signed this \nbill in spite of people recommending that this not be signed.\n  President Reagan's help in ending this water war meant a lot to me \nbecause he knew that when Americans are all in this together, even \nlocal issues, even statewide issues, are all of our concern. I remember \nhow he signed my bill to establish this park because his view of that \nnational park embodied his vision of the Nation.\n  He never looked at the legislation as a map of red States and blue \nStates and purple States but as a landscape of States colored by green \nforests and brown deserts and clear waters.\n  My legislation, entitled the Negotiated Settlement, has changed that \npart of the country. Lake Tahoe is better off. The Indian tribes are \nbetter off. We preserved a lake, Lake Pyramid. It was landmark \nlegislation. It could not have been done without his signature.\n  He knew when the Sun breached the horizon each day, the morning that \ndawned in America was a morning for all Americans and for families of \nall backgrounds. He said in that second inaugural address, ``we have \nworked and acted together, not as members of political parties, but as \nAmericans.''\n  Ronald Reagan was a Republican President from the West, who cherished \na famously close friendship with Tip O'Neill, a Democratic Speaker of \nthe House from the East. Ronald Reagan was a patriot who created a \nfriendship with Mikhail Gorbachev, the leader of a nation he called an \nEvil Empire. He would make certain America could defend herself but \nquietly sent a diplomatic team to start negotiating with the Soviet \nUnion the minute he took office.\n  Ronald Reagan knew politics has always been and always will be about \ncompromise, and that compromise can only happen when politicians share \npersonal relationships. He knew public servants worked better as \npartners rather than partisans. And as much as he criticized \ngovernment, he knew it was not a faceless machine. He appreciated that \ngovernment exists, as Lincoln said, of, for, and by the people.\n  That is why he was more beholden to simple pragmatism than stubborn \nprinciple. That is why he, a staunch conservative, raised taxes 11 \ntimes when the economy needed revenue. It is why he viewed the \nchallenge of immigration through a practical lens. It is why he knew \nAmerica could be strong and would be stronger still in a world without \nnuclear weapons.\n  He was not perfect. I did not agree with many of his politics or \npolicies. But I always admired the way he captured our country's \nimagination. I always respected his honest assessment of his strengths \nand limitations alike. He was somebody who could look at himself and we \nwould all smile a little bit.\n  One time he was running for Governor of California and someone asked \nhim: Do you think you will be a good Governor? He said: I do not know. \nI have never acted the part.\n  That is who he was. He honestly assessed who he was, his strengths \nand limitations, and I admired the way he humbly surrounded himself \nwith good, smart people.\n  A century after his birth Ronald Reagan's legacy remains as enduring \nas anyone who has ever unfurled the long ribbon of our Nation's \nhistory. That legacy lives not merely in his policies, and to honor it, \nit is not enough to try to apply his solutions of 30 years ago to the \nproblems we confront today; rather, we should remember how he respected \nhis colleagues and his constituents. We should try to emulate the \nconfidence he communicated.\n  Ronald Reagan was a proud neighbor of Nevada, who united and \nmotivated us by reminding us that all Americans live in the same \nneighborhood. That is a lesson I still remember today. That is a lesson \nI remember best about our 40th President, Ronald Reagan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/07/senate-section/article/S582-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S582]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, earlier today, the President spoke to \nthe Chamber of Commerce in what some have described as an effort to \nmake nice with the business community. I will leave others to analyze \nwhat the speech means politically. The first concern of the American \npeople is what it will mean for the economy. As I have said before, \nwhat the President says matters a lot less than what he does.\n  So we will just have to wait and see whether the administration's \nactions support its rhetoric. And it is in that spirit that I would \nlike to suggest one thing the President could do immediately, with \nRepublican support, to show he is serious about jobs and the economy. \nHe could work with us to pass free trade agreements with Colombia and \nPanama that have been languishing for years now.\n  We welcome the President's support for the South Korea Free Trade \nAgreement which has earned strong bipartisan support. But by failing to \nshow the same commitment in passing these two other free trade \nagreements, the President is missing out on an important opportunity to \ndo something good for the economy and for jobs.\n  The President says he wants to double U.S. exports in 5 years. Free \ntrade agreements with Colombia and Panama would go a long way toward \nmeeting that goal--and creating jobs here in America--by opening \nmarkets in Latin America.\n  In my view, the time for delay on these two agreements is over. The \nPresident needs to do more than promise to ``pursue'' these agreements, \nas he did today. He should work with Congress to pass these two \nagreements and sign them into law.\n  This should be an easy one. Colombia is a strong strategic ally in \nSouth America, and it has made great strides in addressing the concerns \nof labor union critics here in the U.S. It has come a long way. We \nshould not walk away from Colombia now. As for Panama, our two nations \nhave had strong strategic and economic ties for years. This agreement \nwould only strengthen those bonds and build on them.\n  As America sits on the sidelines, our competitors around the world, \nincluding the EU and Canada, are moving forward to lower barriers to \ntrade and increase access for their businesses and workers. This is \nunacceptable, particularly for an administration that is claiming as \nits top priority to ``win the future.''\n  It won't be enough for Republicans and it shouldn't be enough for the \nbusiness community to allow the administration's trade agenda to start \nand end with South Korea. We should be passing all pending trade \nagreements and inking new ones on a bipartisan basis, even when it \nrequires the President bringing his own party along.\n  We have heard Secretary Clinton, Senator Baucus, and Ambassador Kirk \nall express support for submitting a Colombia FTA to Congress. But the \nPresident's own pronouncements continue to fall short. It is not enough \nfor the President to say good things about free trade while siding with \nlabor bosses over job creators and the vast majority of American \nworkers who do not belong to unions and who would largely benefit from \nopening markets overseas. We shouldn't allow labor union bosses to have \nveto power over economic policies that benefit us all.\n  So the question is: will the President allow our allies in South \nAmerica to continue waiting for us to move forward, or will he send the \nmessage that America stands by her allies and is prepared to do \nsomething good for American workers, good for the American economy, and \ngood for key allies. Congress is ready to pass these two deals today. \nIt is time for the President to commit to the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I compliment the minority leader on his \ncomments on trade. I wish to speak in morning business on the same \ntopic. I will not have to speak long because I have talked about this \nmany times since I joined the Senate over 2 years ago.\n  Today I will focus on the U.S.-Colombia trade agreement. This \nagreement was signed by both the United States and Colombia on November \n22, 2006. It has been around many years. It is expected to create \nseveral thousand jobs. Yet for 5 years, to the detriment of U.S. \nexporters and job seekers, policymakers have punted on this important \ntrade agreement. The Obama administration has been sitting on the \nsidelines watching other countries slowly chip away at U.S. \ncompetitiveness in the Colombian marketplace. Our friends to the north \nin Canada and to the south in Mexico wisely negotiated new agreements \nwith Colombia. They saw the void U.S. companies and workers should have \nbeen filling and acted to fill that void themselves. I believe it is \ntime we stop watching other countries make the moves that have been \nteed up for this country for about 5 years.\n  Implementing the agreement would increase U.S. exports by more than \n$\\1/2\\ billion annually and create almost 4,000 much needed jobs in the \nUnited States. Simply stated, passing this agreement would help to \nimprove our economy.\n  In last year's State of the Union Address, we heard our President \nsay:\n\n       If America sits on the sidelines while other nations sign \n     trade deals, we will lose the chance to create jobs on our \n     shores.\n\n  I applauded his comments. I applauded his desire to increase exports. \nBut, unfortunately, no action was taken on the President's words.\n  During this last year's State of the Union Address, the President \nagain acknowledged the need for the Colombia trade agreement by saying:\n\n       We will strengthen our trade relations with key partners \n     like South Korea and Panama and Colombia.\n\n  Once again, these words will ring hollow with no action. Yet again \ntoday, in a much touted speech to the Chamber of Commerce, the \nPresident talked about pursuing the Colombia trade agreement. I must \nadmit, I asked the question: What on Earth is left to pursue? The \nagreement was signed nearly 5 years ago. It is ready for approval. All \nthe President needs to do is submit it for our action. If the President \nthinks there was more pursuing to do, what have we been waiting for the \npast couple of years? Why has not the administration pursued whatever \nit is they think needs pursuing for now over 2 years?\n  Americans who are out of work know this administration is missing an \nopportunity to say to thousands of Americans: You have a job. Our job \ncreators are waiting. My hope is the President stands behind his \nremarks today.\n  This is a golden opportunity for the President to send a signal that \nhis words do have meaning and to show that we can, in fact, work \ntogether in a bipartisan way. He could submit the Colombia trade \nagreement to Congress for approval today and send an enormously \npowerful message that when he says ``pursue,'' he means action, not \nstall.\n  Folks from my State are anxiously awaiting approval of this agreement \nas are folks from around the country. We should all be reminded that \nworkers and businesses in our home States will benefit from the \nColombia trade agreement. Our farmers and ranchers would benefit from \nthe elimination of tariffs on more than 77 percent of agricultural \ngoods. American workers will see more of their products sold as 76 \npercent of Colombian tariffs on our industrial goods are eliminated \nimmediately. No doubt about it, this agreement will have a real impact \non Nebraskans and other Americans who work hard every day to make a \nbetter life for their families.\n  Let me share a couple of examples of Nebraskans who want to see the \nU.S.-Colombia trade agreement ratified. Take Nebraska-based \nmanufacturer Valmont Industries, for example. Valmont has loyal \ncustomers in Colombia who buy its irrigation pivots. Currently, \nColombia imposes a 15-percent duty or tax on those pivot systems. This \nwould be eliminated by the Colombia trade agreement. If the 15-percent \nduty is, in fact, eliminated, Valmont estimates they would gain market \nshare against European competitors and add 10 to 15 new jobs in \nNebraska alone.\n\n[[Page S584]]\n\n  Take Rick Larson of Potter, NE. He grows wheat and corn. He has a \nsmall livestock operation. Unfortunately, the market share of American \nfarmers is declining rapidly in Colombia. When we signed the agreement, \nAmerican farmers such as Rick Larson in Potter supplied 76 percent of \nthe wheat to Colombia. Today they sell 22 percent. For Rick that means \nhe has lost 15 cents per bushel of wheat. That impacts a real family.\n  It is a similar story with corn. He has lost 4 cents per bushel. In a \nplace where we throw around the idea of trillions, that may not sound \nlike much, but it means Rick's wheat and corn revenues were down $7,600 \nlast year just because the administration had not submitted those trade \nagreements for our approval. Farmers such as Rick cannot believe we are \nsitting on our hands while our market share is evaporating right before \nour eyes. He shudders to think what will happen to his sales prices \nonce Canada beats us to a free-trade agreement, even though it was \nsigned 2 years after ours.\n  It is not easy to regain lost market share once it is gone. It \nworries exporters when they see their government standing between them \nand a promising marketplace. Nebraska farmers and ranchers and those \nacross the country can compete with anyone. All they are asking for is \na level playing field and a fair shot.\n  We have been giving exporters from Colombia more than a fair shot \nthrough the Andean Trade Preferences Act, which is set to expire on \nFebruary 12. Under the agreement, a whopping 90 percent of goods and \nservices coming into our country to compete with our citizens enters \nabsolutely duty free.\n  I think we should extend the Andean Trade Preferences, but we should \nalso knock down the barriers for our own exporters and level the \nplaying field. We must give our workers that level playing field by \napproving the Colombia Free Trade Agreement.\n  American exporters have waited too long to realize the benefits of \nthis trade agreement. Isn't it time to get serious about beating our \nglobal competitors in the Colombian market? Don't we all realize U.S. \njobs depend upon this?\n  You see, we all represent people such as Valmont and farmers such as \nRick. Let's pay tribute to their entrepreneurial spirit by tearing down \nColombian trade barriers that inhibit economic growth in this great \nNation.\n  I urge the President to transmit the signed U.S.-Colombia trade \nagreement to Congress immediately. This is one Senator who is going to \nstand behind the President and do everything I can to try to get that \nagreement ratified in the Senate. It is time for Speaker Boehner and \nLeader Reid to call it up for consideration as soon as it reaches their \ndesks. But, most important, it is time for the President to lay it on \ntheir desks.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/07/senate-section/article/S584-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S584-S586]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ORPHANED EARMARKS ACT\n\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I rise to join my friend from Oklahoma to \ntalk about a commonsense piece of legislation. I come to the floor \npretty often to talk about the deficit, and I wish to talk about \nsomething very specific we can do to address this matter. The Orphaned \nEarmarks Act would rescind earmarks that remain 90 percent or more \nunused 9 years after being appropriated.\n  In early January, USA Today published an article examining 20 years \nof earmarks that have not been spent. According to the analysis: ``In \nat least 3,649 of those earmarks, not a single dollar had gone toward \nits intended purpose'' and ``Many of the orphan earmarks also count \nagainst a state's share of federal highway funds and have taken \nbillions of dollars away from state transportation departments across \nthe nation.''\n  During the past 20 years, orphan earmarks reduced the amount of money \nStates would have received in Federal highway funding by almost $7.5 \nbillion. That is $7.5 billion that States could have used to replace \nobsolete bridges, repair aging roads, and bring jobs to rural areas.\n  As all of us know, when lawmakers earmark money, even if it is never \nspent for pet highway projects, that money still reduces what States \nreceive from the Federal Government. In my own State of Alaska, $187 \nmillion in funding was lost out in the past 20 years because of \norphaned earmarks.\n  I know some of my colleagues are concerned about States losing out on \nmoney we all could use, especially these days, but let's not worry. I \ndon't want to take away your earmarks that help communities in need and \nhelp create jobs. We are talking about earmarks that have been \nabandoned for more than 10 years and are just sitting there like \nuncashed checks. Dr. Coburn and I have addressed this in our \nlegislation. We have built in a 12-month period--I repeat, a 12-month \nperiod--for agency heads to make sure earmarks can be used before \nrescinding.\n  On that note, I wish to make something else clear. I do not \npersonally support an earmark moratorium. I know my friend from \nOklahoma and I disagree on this earmark funding, but I believe it is \nvital to my home State of Alaska. We have unique needs and have relied \non this critical funding from day one to support health, safety, and \njobs. What I have a problem with is wasteful spending that could have \notherwise been used for a project or to cut the deficit.\n  Our legislation requires the Director of OMB to submit to Congress \nand publicly post on the OMB Web site an annual report that includes a \nlisting and accounting for earmarks with unobligated balances \nsummarized by agencies, including the amount of the original earmark, \nthe amount of the unobligated balances, and the year the funding \nexpires; the number of rescissions resulting from this section and the \nannual savings resulting from this section for the previous fiscal \nyear; finally, a listing and an accounting for earmarks provided to \nFederal agencies scheduled to be rescinded at the end of the current \nfiscal year.\n  Senator Feingold offered an amendment last March to the FAA bill to \nrescind any DOT earmarks that remained 90 percent or more unobligated \nfor 9 years after being appropriated, with the possibility of holding \nfunds 1 more year for earmarks the agency head believed would be funded \nwithin 12 months. Because Senator Feingold had modified the legislation \nto reflect concerns by Senator Boxer and Senator Murray, the Senate \nvoted 87 to 11 to pass this amendment. However, as we all know, the FAA \nbill did not pass last year.\n  The Coburn-Begich bill is modeled after a Bush administration \nproposal from 2008 and would have rescinded any highway and bridge \nearmark funds from the 1998 highway bill, TEA-21, that had less than 10 \npercent of the funds spent or obligated. That proposal would have saved \nabout $626 million, including $389 million in 152 earmarks that had no \nfunding obligated a decade after passing. The Coburn-Begich bill \ntargets all orphaned earmarks, not just those in the highway bill.\n  Let me conclude. I know my friend from Oklahoma is here to speak as \nwell. I will tell my colleagues that when I became mayor in 2003 in \nAnchorage, AK, we looked at what all of our bonds voters had voted on \nyear-in and year-out, and we looked at all the projects. What we found \nwas that sizable amounts were being spent on projects where they were \nintended, but there was another percentage that for years had just been \nlying there for a variety of reasons. Maybe the project didn't pan out, \nmaybe they didn't get enough money from another source or the project \njust vanished from the books because of public opposition to it. But \nwhat we found was we were passing bonds for projects that never went \nforward. So we cleaned the bonds up when I was mayor.\n  Then we did one other thing which I think this legislation now on the \nFederal level really focuses on, not only to make sure we clean up the \nbooks but also, when you have money, to make it very clear that we need \nto spend the money on the project for which it was identified. We made \nsure those projects that were on that bond, that voters voted for, that \nthey put their taxpayer\n\n[[Page S585]]\n\nmoney toward, that 75 percent or more of those projects would be \ncompleted or substantially underway by the end of the year. That was \nimportant to make sure taxpayers knew their dollars were being used--\nnot just forwarded or put away in an account somewhere and not having a \nproject that they thought was happening.\n  So I think this is a good piece of legislation. It brings fiscal \nresponsibility to the money that is out there. When we think about it, \nif we have a piece of legislation, an earmark, that has not been \nutilized--90 percent of it not utilized for 10 years or more--there is \nno reason we should have that money in some bank account in some agency \nsomewhere hidden away. It should come back and go toward the deficit.\n  So I yield the floor at this time for my colleague from Oklahoma. I \nam honored to be able to join him in this effort to bring--I will use \nmy words--fiscal sanity to this effort of trying to figure out how to \nmanage this Federal Government's budget in a better way.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. First of all, let me thank my colleague from Alaska. As \nsomebody who has been working on areas of fiscal management in our \nFederal Government for the last 6-plus years, this is one small step. \nWhether it saves $500 million or whether it saves $1 billion, it is \nimportant that America knows we need to do this 1,500 more times.\n  We hear a lot in the press now from the Republican appropriators, the \nRepublican budgeteers, about the battle of how much to cut. It is the \nwrong language. The deficit is $1.5 trillion this year. It was $1.4 \ntrillion last year. We have tons of areas, as my colleague knows full \nwell, as does our former colleague, the Senator from Wisconsin, Russ \nFeingold, where we don't effectively utilize the money that has been \ngiven to us or that we are borrowing against our kids' future.\n  So this is a great start. We need to do this every day on every bill \nthat comes before us. We can find it. We have identified 50 sets of \nduplication within the Federal Government, and they are not small \nduplications. There are 49 job-training programs across 9 different \nagencies. There are 105 science, technology, engineering, and math \nprograms--something the President, in his State of the Union Address, \nsaid he wanted to enhance. We don't have a metric on any of them. We \nalready have 105 programs. We are spending $18 billion on job training, \nand we don't know if it is working, and we don't know if the people we \nhave trained have gotten jobs in the areas in which they were trained. \nSo I am excited about my colleague joining with me. The hope is that we \ncan set a trend so that with every bill that comes out, we will start \nlooking.\n  By the way, we do have coming from the Government Accountability \nOffice the first third of all of the government programs. When we \ninquired 2 years ago to the Congressional Research Service and to the \nOffice of Management and Budget and the GAO, we said: Give us a list of \nall the programs. Do my colleagues realize that nowhere in the Federal \nGovernment do we have a list of all of the programs where we spend \nmoney? We are highly critical of the Defense Department because it \ncan't pass an audit, and we rightly should be, but we can't pass an \naudit because we don't even know what we are doing.\n  So this should not be controversial at all. It should save us close \nto $1 billion when it is all said and done, and that is $1 billion we \nwon't borrow from the Chinese. All we have to do is do that 1,500 more \ntimes. The fact is, we can. We are like that little engine. We can. We \ncan get up that hill. But what it is going to take is reaching across \nthe aisle, as the Senator from Alaska and I have done, and saying: Here \nis an area of common ground, it is based in common sense, and it is \nsomething that should be done and should be done now.\n  Just to show how silly this is, the data shows that in Atlanta there \nis still money for the 1996 Olympics. Fourteen years ago, there was \n$2.7 million sitting in a bank account. They can't spend it because the \nOlympics has already occurred, but we still have that money out there. \nThat is the kind of silly stuff that happens when the Federal \nGovernment reaches into areas where it shouldn't be reaching.\n  What we can do--not to lay blame, not to say it is about earmarks or \nnot about earmarks, but here is a commonsense solution that says: Here \nis a way to free up $1 billion or $500 million. If it is $500 million, \ngreat, but here is a way to do that.\n  I wish to also take some time on the floor now to elucidate that the \nPresident's fiscal commission outlined $4 trillion over the next 10 \nyears we could eliminate that would go a long way toward starting to \nsolve some of our problems.\n  So my hope is that with this amendment, we will start a trend where \nwe can grab hold of and capture the things that make sense, that most \nAmericans will never miss, and if they do miss it, it is because they \nare going to get something better instead and more efficient instead, \nand we start down this road. This is a great start.\n  I congratulate my colleague for his initiative in bringing this back \nup. What we need to do now is get on the phone and get our colleagues \nin the House to do the same thing and make sure, when this bill goes \nthrough and this amendment is adopted, it actually happens. Don't \nforget that the Bush administration wanted this to happen, and so does \nthe Obama administration. Think about the amount of labor we are \nspending taking care of details on things that can't get spent or won't \nbe spent and the amount of man-hours that goes into that.\n  I just thought I would finish with one of the recommendations of the \nfiscal commission, which is on the Federal workforce. There is a \nwonderful article that was published by Iain Murray on February 3 about \nhow many Federal employees we have. It is easy for us to think about \nthe fact that when we count true--just true--Federal employees, it is \n2.8 million. But that doesn't come close to the actual number of \nemployees the Federal Government has. When you add up what is actually \nthere and you add in postal employees, you add in military, you add in \ncontractors, we are at 11 million Federal employees.\n  We have a great Federal workforce. There are a lot of areas where we \ncan be efficient and downsize. We don't have to lay anybody off; we can \njust not add. What we can do is, through attrition, markedly decrease \nthe number of Federal employees we have, which will be that second, \nthird, and fourth billion dollars.\n  The other thing the Commission recommended, which the Obama \nadministration embraced, was a freeze on salaries, but most of us don't \nrecognize that we have $3 billion owed right now to the IRS in back \ntaxes by Federal employees that has already been adjudicated.\n  So there are all sorts of things we can do. We have lots of ideas. My \npledge is to work across the aisle with our colleagues to try to find \none of these every day or one of these every other day. If we do that \ntogether, we don't have to borrow 40 cents out of every dollar we spend \nin this country. We can take it down to 20 or 15 or down to zero so \nthat we can, in fact, ensure the future for our children.\n  Again, I thank my colleague, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from Oklahoma \nfor joining me. I will tell my colleague, whether you look at--you are \nright, this should not be controversial. It should be easy. I mean, it \nis like if you receive a check and it sits there for 10 years, I can \nguarantee my colleagues, if you are in private business, as I have \nbeen, you have written that off already. It is gone. In this situation, \nwhat we are saying is that there is $500 million--I think you are \nright; when it is all tallied up, it is probably closer to $1 billion--\nsitting out there. We did this once before. We had great support on a \nmuch more narrow focus. If we did this on a regular basis, the \nopportunity is unlimited.\n  I wish to thank the Senator. I have sat in the Presiding Officer's \nchair many times and listened to the presentations of the Senator from \nOklahoma regarding the budget. We may not always agree, but when we \nfind agreements, here is an opportunity. This is an easy one, by the \nway. There are others, as the Senator knows and I know, regarding \nsurplus property the Federal Government has that is under incredible \ndisrepair, not being realized. From my real estate experience, I have \nseen this, and there is an enormous amount\n\n[[Page S586]]\n\nof resources there that could be turned back to the private sector for \nfuture development. That could actually grow this economy.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, the Federal Government has $950 billion \nworth of property it is not using right now. We are spending $9 billion \na year taking care of it, and we have a budget gimmick that says an \nagency that needs a new building, because we are going to account for \nthe cost of that building in the year in which they buy it and charge \nit all to the agency--what are we doing? We are leasing buildings. I \nguarantee we could own them much more cheaply than we could lease them. \nWhat we should be doing is changing that and getting rid of the excess \nproperty, lowering our cost to maintain it--there is 9 out of the 1,500 \nwe have to do, right there, if we would just do that--and then change \nthe way we purchase buildings for the Federal Government so the agency \ncan own it instead of leasing it because it costs, over the life of the \nbuilding, about twice the lease.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, as someone who \nhas been in the real estate business for almost 30 years, there is \nenormous opportunity. I know that when I was mayor, we put more of the \nlands--we are not talking parks; we are talking about just surplus old \nbuildings and sites that are no longer in use--we put them back into \noperation because not only will it save the Federal Government money in \nthe sense of getting that surplus property off the books, but what we \nend up doing is turning that into economic development companies for \nthose communities. The private sector will come in and revitalize it \nand use it. There are many ideas out there.\n\n  I thank the Senator for the opportunity to sponsor this with him. As \nthe Senator said, $500 million is the minimum. I think it is close to \n$1 billion just on this one idea.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from West Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I have comments of my own, but I will \nyield to the Senator from Maryland. He has been down here waiting. He \nis interesting, provocative, thoughtful, and always right. I yield to \nhim such time as he may feel comfortable with, provided it doesn't go \npast 5 o'clock.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and congratulate him \non the reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration. It is a \nbill that we can all be proud of. I thank him for his good work.\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak today on the legislation to \nreauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration.\n  Our Nation's economy is recovering from the worst economic recession \nin decades. Critical to getting our economy moving forward and getting \nAmericans back to work is building an efficient and modern intermodal \ntransportation system built to handle growing commerce in the 21st \ncentury.\n  I am pleased to see that this legislation, which is estimated to \ncreate 280,000 jobs in airports around the country, is one of the first \norders of business for the Senate in the 112th Congress. It \ndemonstrates this body's focus on job creation and helping get \nAmericans back to work while updating the Nation's aviation \ninfrastructure to ensure that America is ready for business.\n  The airline industry accounts for nearly 11 million U.S. jobs and \n$1.2 trillion in annual economic activity. This bill provides the \nairline industry the essential infrastructure it needs to succeed and \nremain strong and competitive in the global airline industry.\n  Every day, the Federal Aviation Administration faces the daunting \ntask of marshalling thousands of airliners, and the air travelers on \nthose planes, across the country from airports and airfields both large \nand small located in nearly every corner of the United States. These \nmembers of the Federal workforce safely guide thousands of airplanes, \nserving tens of thousands of air travelers, across America's skies \nevery day.\n  I applaud Senator Rockefeller's dedication to getting this much \nneeded legislation to the floor of the Senate. I greatly appreciate his \nwillingness in the last Congress to incorporate a provision of mine \nthat is important to keeping small rural airports in Maryland and in \nother parts of the country in operation. I look forward to continue \nworking to build upon the great work he has done to get this important \nbill moving forward.\n  This bill is not just important to our big airports; it's important \nto all airports in this country. There are many challenges facing the \nFAA and air travelers. This bill sets a clear path towards addressing \nthese challenges, not the least of which is working to reduce the \nnumber of flight cancellations and the frequency of flight delays that \ncan range anywhere from 10 minutes to 9 or more hours that air \ntravelers experience.\n  This bill will reduce delays by more than 20 percent--save passenger \ntime, money and reduce airline fuel consumption, making our country \nmore energy secure and reducing harmful greenhouse gas emissions.\n  While air travel remains a safe and fast way to travel between \ndistant destinations, the technology is readily available to make \nessential improvements to our Nation's aviation infrastructure to make \nit even safer and faster.\n  The bill's authorization of facility and equipment funding reinforces \nthe FAA's commitment to overhauling the guidance systems used to direct \nflights across the country. The deployment of NextGen flight systems \nwill cut travel times and save energy by directing flights to take \nshorter routes that use less fuel.\n\n[[Page S587]]\n\n  Domestic commercial flight routes follow the same terrestrial based \nguidance air traffic control system that was put in place more than \nhalf a century ago. The paths planes follow between airports is not \nbased on the shortest most efficient routes, but instead based on the \nlocation of broadcasting points on the ground. That no longer makes any \nsense. We know that we now have a GPS system that could put our planes \non a much more direct route, which is faster and will save time and \nenergy.\n  For example, air travelers flying from National Airport, across the \nPotomac in Arlington, VA, to Boston's Logan International Airport \ncurrently follow a route north through central Pennsylvania, east \nacross New York State and the entire State of Massachusetts to Boston \nlocated on the Atlantic coast.\n  This flight pattern goes 537 miles, takes an hour and 15 minutes to \nfly, and burns 7,376 pounds of fuel.\n  Alternatively, NextGen's satellite-based guidance system, using \nglobal positioning systems, would guide that same flight on a 367 mile, \nnortheasterly route directly up the Atlantic coast, that takes less \nthan an hour, and use 5,883 pounds of fuel.\n  That's a 1,493 pound savings of expensive, carbon emission intensive, \njet fuel.\n  These are significant savings that benefit the environment and the \nconsumer. The Air Transport Association estimates that ``even a 6% \nfleet-wide reduction in fuel burn results in fuel savings of 1.16 \nbillion gallons of jet fuel and emissions savings of nearly 11 million \nmetric tons or 24 billion pounds of CO2.'' We would be \nsaving fuel and costs and would be polluting much less.\n  NextGen is essential to achieving these types of greenhouse gas \nemissions reductions from the aviation sector.\n  NextGen is also critical to meeting future air travel demands and \nwill go a long way to alleviating the actual ``air traffic'' that is \nresponsible for much of the delays air passengers experience when \ntravelling.\n  The research, engineering and development funding is set to advance \nundergraduate and technical school programs for aircraft maintenance \nfocusing on new technology job training for pilots and air traffic \ncontrollers. This includes essential job training programs for the next \ngeneration of air traffic controllers that will use NextGen systems to \nguide America's airline fleets.\n  Job training and education are important for preparing America's \nworkforce to advance into well paid and skilled jobs and are essential \nto the Nation's economic recovery.\n  The operations and maintenance, Airport Improvement Program and \nfacilities and equipment funding authorizations give the green light to \nhundreds of airports across the Nation to advance pressing maintenance, \nfacilities, security and new construction projects that will create \nthousands of jobs in the engineering, computer science, construction, \nand software development sectors and much more.\n  For example, at Baltimore Washington International-Thurgood Marshall \nAirport in Anne Arundel County, the Maryland Department of \nTransportation has nearly $400 million in Airport Improvement Program \nprojects that are ready to go. These projects will help improve runway \nsafety, tarmac capacity and terminal efficiency at Maryland's largest \nairport.\n  BWI-Thurgood Marshall served 21 million passengers in 2009 and was \nranked first out of 140 international airports, worldwide, that serve \n15-25 million passengers annually by the Airports Council \nInternational's Airport Service Quality survey. We are proud of that \nand want to maintain that service at BWI. The reauthorization of these \nprograms is critical to our doing that.\n  I appreciate the opportunity this bill gives me to show my support \nfor Maryland's flagship airport and the 35 other commercial, municipal, \nregional and general aviation airports across my State.\n  I mentioned earlier my colleague's willingness to work with me to \nincorporate an amendment to help small commercial airports. The program \nI am referring to is the Essential Air Service Program, which provides \nfunding to keep the small yet critical commercial airports serving \nrural communities viable.\n  This program assures that rural communities are provided a minimal \nlevel of service to preserve their connection to the national air \ntransportation system.\n  Western Maryland's Hagerstown Airport has benefitted greatly from \nthis program and has allowed the airport to secure service contracts \nwith Cape Air to fly four daily flights from Hagerstown to Baltimore. \nWithout Hagerstown's daily flights to BWI, western Maryland residents, \nas well as people living in eastern West Virginia and southern \nPennsylvania, would have to drive anywhere from 75 to more than 150 \nmiles to get to the nearest airport with commercial service.\n  There are many other rural communities where major commercial air \npassenger service is located at even greater distances and the \nEssential Air Service helps alleviate the travel isolation of these \ncommunities. I am pleased that this bill addresses the needs of \nHagerstown Airport and others like it.\n  Another issue critical to the success of Maryland's airports that \nwill surely come up during the debate of this bill is changing the slot \nand perimeter rule at Reagan National Airport. This is an issue that I \ncare deeply about because it has a specifically targeted effect on the \neconomic success and job growth potential at BWI-Thurgood Marshall \nairport and the surrounding area.\n  In the 111th Congress, the proposed changes to operations at National \nAirport were made by Senators representing States well beyond the \nGreater Washington region. Changing the slot and perimeter rule in this \nfashion subverts the established process for altering these rules and \nundermines the authority of local transportation experts.\n  Restricted service at National Airport lends itself to the steady \ngrowth at the region's major hub airports, which has been at the heart \nof the region's business communities' economic development plans.\n  Companies such as Northrop Grumman, L3, General Dynamics, IBM, \nDeloitte, and other major employers in the Baltimore-Washington area \nstrategically located themselves around BWI. The growth of that airport \nis critically important to our economic progress.\n  The steady growth in service at the region's large international \nairports helped create an attractive business climate for these major \ncompanies. This would not have been possible without Congress's \nagreement to maintain the status quo of service at National Airport \nthat, in turn, made Dulles and BWI the region's growth airports.\n  Based on existing service and prior historical evidence of the \nimpacts of increased slots at DCA, allowing flights to be converted \nfrom within the perimeter to beyond the perimeter would have a direct \nimpact on the service offered out of BWI Marshall.\n  Under any slot-change scenario, service reductions at BWI Marshall \nwill reduce the value and return on Federal and State infrastructure \ninvestments made at BWI. Maryland has invested more than $1.5 billion \nin the airport over the last 10 years and plans to invest $684 million \nin the next 6 years. I welcome a collaborative and open process should \nchanges in the region's airport operations be necessary.\n  In regard to another important provision in this legislation, I \nsupport the passenger bill of rights. No one should ever be forced to \nstay aboard a plane on a tarmac for extended periods of time.\n  I also applaud the provisions within the bill that provide customers \nwith better information about the wide range of fees airlines and \nairports place upon the flying public.\n  I understand that between high fuel costs and the current economy, \ntravelers are flying less and this has hurt the airline industry. As a \nresult, airlines have resorted to charging a variety of fees for \nservices on each flight. Airlines have counted on air travelers \nadapting to each change of policy so much that today's frequent fliers \nrarely expect a free meal or to check their bags for free.\n  Air travelers often have no choice but to pay the airlines' fees. The \nproblem is how these fees come at the customers, often by surprise. If \nthe fees are explained in advance, there is less with which to take \nissue.\n\n[[Page S588]]\n\n  Surprise fees have consumers upset and weary of flying. By the time \ntravelers reach the ticket counter, they are committed to getting on \nthat plane. At that point, the airlines have the clear upper hand when \nit comes to levying additional charges for baggage based on size, \nweight or type or even fees for simple onboard amenities such as \nrefreshments, headphones or blankets once passengers are in their \nseats. In some instances, particularly the at-the-counter baggage fees, \ntravelers have no choice but to pay the fee.\n  In the 111th Congress, I introduced legislation to ensure air \ntravelers were made well aware of the fees they were being charged to \nfly. I look forward to working with my colleagues to make sure this \nissue is adequately addressed in this bill.\n  I want the airlines to succeed. Working to improve access to \ninformation and require the honest disclosure of airline fees and \nimproved passenger treatment help public confidence in the airline \nindustry.\n  Currently, the airline industry can point at high fuel costs and a \ndownturn in the economy as the top reasons for why less people are \ntraveling by air. As the economy continues to improve and as more \nAmericans find work, both business and leisure travel will begin to \npick up. Whether the travelers look to the skies or the ground to get \nto their destination will largely depend on the users' experience.\n  The passenger bill of rights goes a long way to improving the users' \nexperience for air travelers.\n  Before concluding on this legislation to reauthorize the Federal \nAviation Administration, I think it is important that I comment on one \namendment that may be brought up. I wish to express my opposition to an \namendment that would exclude employees of the Transportation Security \nAdministration, TSA, from collective bargaining rights of Federal \nemployees. On June 23, 2010, more than 6 months ago, I spoke on the \nfloor of the Senate about the need for collective bargaining for more \nthan 60,000 TSA employees who work at BWI Marshall International \nAirport and airports around the Nation.\n  At that time, some Members of Congress opposed collective bargaining \nfor TSA employees because of their concern that we need to be able to \nadapt quickly and effectively to specific aviation threats. The \nunderlying premise of that argument is, we must choose between \nprotecting the Nation from threats to aviation and collective \nbargaining. As I said in my June 23, 2010, speech, that choice is a \nfalse choice because national security and what I called smart \ncollective bargaining are not mutually exclusive. Under a smart \ncollective bargaining agreement, where a true emergency exists, TSA \nwould be fully capable of deploying assets without there being any \nnegative impact from collective bargaining.\n  At his confirmation hearing, Administrator Pistole stated that ``we \nhave to be able to surge resources at any time . . . not only \nnationwide but worldwide.'' The smart collective bargaining agreement I \ncalled for would enable us to do exactly that. Moreover, I believed \nthen and I believe now that a smart collective bargaining agreement \nwould enhance national security because it would enable TSA to recruit \nand retain better employees.\n  Our Nation's history with labor unions clearly teaches us that \ncollective bargaining boosts morale, it allows employees to have a \nvoice in their workplace, and it allows them to increase stability and \nprofessionalism.\n  On the other hand, poor workforce management can lead directly to \nhigh attrition rates, job dissatisfaction, and increased costs, which \nlead to gaps in aviation security. In the past, there have been reports \nthat the TSA has had low worker morale, which can undermine the \nagency's mission and our national security.\n  I am now pleased to learn that after he was confirmed by the Senate, \nAdministrator Pistole did what he said he would do--he studied the \nissue and gathered all the facts and information he could from \nstakeholders, including TSA employees, TSA management, union \npresidents, and a variety of present and former leaders and experts in \nlaw enforcement agencies and organizations.\n  This past Friday, on February 4, Administrator Pistole decided that \nthe more than 60,000 TSA employees working at BWI Marshall \nInternational Airport and at airports around the Nation could vote on \nwhether they want or do not want representation for limited collective \nbargaining on nonsecurity employment issues.\n  Administrator Pistole's determination will provide a framework to \nprotect TSA's ability to respond to evolving threats, while allowing \nTSA's employees the right to join a union under clear definitions.\n  This is a smart decision and can lead to the kind of solution I was \ntalking about 6 months ago.\n  On issues of national security, we need to come together and reject \nthe either/or. We need to be smart on national security, and this \ncollective bargaining decision by Administrator Pistole is a smart \ndecision. The fact is, the Department of Homeland Security's Customs \nand Border Patrol officers, some of whom work at the same airports as \nTSA employees, as well as DHS Federal Protective Service and the \nCapitol Police, all operate under collective bargaining agreements.\n  As our late colleague, Senator Kennedy, noted in August 2009 when he \ncosponsored a collective bargaining rights bill for public sector \nofficers, tomorrow morning, thousands of State and local public safety \nofficers, police officers, and firefighters will awake and go to work \nto protect us. They will put their lives on the line, responding to \nemergencies, policing our neighborhoods, and protecting us in Maryland \nand in communities all across the Nation. These dedicated public \nservants will patrol our streets and run into burning buildings to keep \nus safe. No one believes for a moment we are less safe because they \nhave secured collective bargaining rights.\n\n  If opponents of Administrator Pistole's decision want to invoke 9/11 \nto support their views, they will soon discover that the legacy of 9/11 \nshows very clearly that national security will not be compromised by \nsmart collective bargaining. Before 9/11, New York Port Authority \npolice worked 8 hours a day, 4 days on and 2 days off. By the end of \nthe day on 9/11, however, vacations and personal time were canceled and \nworkers were switched to 12-hour tours, 7 days a week. Indeed, \nschedules did not return to normal for 3 years. The union did not file \na grievance, and everyone recognized it was a real crisis.\n  Administrator Pistole's decision will enhance our ability to recruit \nand retain the best TSA employees to protect us.\n  It will also lead to conditions that will improve our ability to \nrecruit and retain the best employees, such as the countless number of \nAmerican heroes who work every day to protect us and keep us safe, \nunder collective bargaining agreements.\n  In concluding, I wish to acknowledge in the reauthorization of the \nFAA bill the thousands of hard-working government workers, pilots, \nflight attendants, and other members of our Nation's flight crews. \nWithout their service, air travel would not be possible. I am pleased \nseveral of the labor organizations that represent so many hard-working \nAmericans in the aviation industry support this bill. I also note the \nimportant worker safety provisions this legislation provides workers in \nthe aviation industry.\n  Congress has passed 17 short-term extensions of this authorization. \nIt is time for a permanent fix. It is time to pass this bill. It will \nprovide stability, safety, and jobs for both the airline industry and \nits passengers.\n  It promotes jobs, consumer travel protections, homegrown \ntechnological innovation, and reductions of fuel consumption and \ngreenhouse gas emissions. This could not come at a more opportune time.\n  I congratulate the chairman for all the work he has done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I thank the good Senator from \nMaryland for his remarks.\n  I am sure, as I call on my vice chairman, Senator Hutchison will have \nremarks she will want to make. I simply wish to catch us up to where we \nare.\n  This is the Federal aviation bill. It has been deemed to be only the \nFederal aviation bill, which is good, because that means extraneous \namendments are not germane. We are trying to work our way through this \naviation\n\n[[Page S589]]\n\npolicy issue business, which actually is turning out, so far, to be \nquite smooth. People commented it is being done in a bipartisan \nfashion. That is the way Senator Hutchison and I work always and it is \nthe way the committee works and is probably why we put out more \nnominations and legislation than any other committee.\n  We have a number of pending amendments. I know my colleagues also \nhave others. Some will come to the floor this afternoon to get into the \nqueue and speak on those amendments. We are making progress resolving \nsome of the pending amendments. Others, I believe, will require votes. \nIf we can do something without a vote, that is great. If we have to \nhave a vote, that is also fine.\n  In addition, Senator Hutchison and I continue to work to resolve the \nissue of slots at National Airport. I thank all our colleagues for \nengaging in a constructive conversation on this very difficult issue. \nIt has been very heartening that people seem to understand that if we \ncannot work out this issue, the whole bill goes down and 11 million \njobs and over $1 trillion of the economy are at risk.\n  We have played with fire with this now for 17 consecutive extensions \nof the bill. It is a horrible way to do business, to send out a 3-year \ncontract for building an airport runway--it is awful. But we have not \nfaced up to this bill. Senator Hutchison and I are doing that.\n  I suspect we will be on the bill this week. We hope to finish it the \nfollowing week. I believe we can do that, but then again I am not sure. \nIt is how the Senate wants to work its will.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to speak with Senator Hutchison and \nmyself if they have amendments they would like to offer. That is what \nwe are here for.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I appreciate what the chairman has \nsaid. His message is the same as my message; that is, this is a very \nimportant bill. It is one--the authorization of the FAA--we have \nextended, since 2007, with 18 short-term extensions. Neither the \nchairman nor myself want a 19th short-term extension. That is, as he \nmentioned, not the way we ought to be doing business. We ought to be \nable to assure that a contract will be let for a new runway or a repair \non a runway and that it will be finished. I hope we can get through \nsome of the thornier issues, and there are several of those.\n  I ask my colleagues to come down and get their amendments pending \nbecause we want to close out amendments and then deal with the ones we \nhave and move on.\n  Senator Wicker and Senator Collins are going to be here very shortly. \nThey will be talking about the Wicker amendment. That is one I think \nthey have now agreed to sponsor together. They have made some good \nchanges. We have others that are also being worked on. It is time, if a \ncolleague wants to offer an amendment, to come down and do it.\n  We are continuing to work on the perimeter slot rule from Washington \nNational Airport, with the hope of coming to a consensus that will \nincrease the number of opportunities for people from the Western half \nof the United States to come into Washington National Airport. I will \nsay, I believe it is in everyone's interest to open Washington National \non a limited basis. We do not want to add to the congestion. The \nproposals that are being put forward would not add to congestion. They \nwould be mostly incumbent carriers already flying, just transferring to \nlonger haul flights but not with bigger airplanes.\n  So you can't make the argument that it is going to add to ground \ncongestion or air congestion because you are not going to add that many \nnew flights. It certainly is not a noise issue anymore, because we have \nStage III aircraft that have made a significant improvement in air \ntraffic noise for people who live near airports. I think it is in the \ninterest of the people who live around National to have that same \nconvenience--to be able to go to the western part of the United States, \njust as people who live farther away from the airports. So I think we \nare working through this. We need to come up with something that \neveryone would say is a fair compromise, and I hope we can do that.\n  The underlying bill is important because it does increase the safety \nmeasures we need to have. It certainly will modernize the air traffic \ncontrol system and put America in the forefront of putting our air \ntraffic control on a satellite-based system, rather than a ground-based \nradar system. That is the key reason for needing to go forward on this \nbill so we can start that transformation. It will take time, and it is \nsomething that needs to be done, but with a longer term authorization, \nwhich we are trying to do.\n  It will improve rural small town access to our aviation system. There \nare also good consumer protections. We don't think anyone should have \nto sit on an airplane for more than 3 hours on the ground with the door \nclosed, and that is provided for in this bill. If you are sitting on \nthe ground in an enclosed aircraft for more than 3 hours, the airline \nmust open the doors and let passengers get off.\n  There are a lot of things we need to put into law. We have made a \ngood start, and I would ask my colleagues to give us their amendments, \nif they have them, and let us work through them to move this bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Mississippi.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 14, as Modified\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment \nNo. 14 be modified with the changes I have sent to the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Secondly, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing two Senators be added as cosponsors to my amendment: Senator \nCollins and Senator Coburn.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I called up my amendment last week. This \namendment would prohibit TSA employees from entering into collective \nbargaining agreements. A lot has happened since I called up my \namendment. The Transportation Security Administrator announced his \nintent on Friday to proceed with allowing TSA security employees to \ncollectively bargain. That would reverse a decade of policy--since the \ninception of TSA, actually. Currently, TSA employees are not allowed to \ncollectively bargain. The 2001 law that created TSA gives this decision \nto the Administrator, and previous Administrators have understood that \ncollective bargaining agreements for TSA could compromise our Nation's \nsecurity. TSA employees have been treated like those of the FBI, the \nCIA, and the Secret Service for purposes of collective bargaining. \nThese personnel are treated very well by our government and taken care \nof in other ways. But because of the security concerns, collective \nbargaining is prohibited for those security personnel.\n  Frankly, I think many observers would conclude that the current \nadministration is intent on doling out rewards to campaign supporters \nand, therefore, is moving to reverse this decade-old decision and allow \nfor collective bargaining among TSA employees. On November 12, 2010, \nthe Federal Labor Relations Authority decided TSA employees will be \nallowed to vote on union representation, and then the decision came \nalong on Friday to allow them to have collective bargaining rights.\n  I don't believe our country needs 50,000 TSA screeners to be part of \na union. But the Obama administration does. Adding workers to union \nrolls has been a high priority of the administration since day one. As \nI pointed out, the FBI, the CIA, and the Secret Service do not have \ncollective bargaining rights because burdensome union demands could \nlimit the ability of those responsible for security at some of the most \nhigh-risk targets and hamper them in getting their job done.\n  Let me review a little bit of history. When a British airliner \nbombing plot was uncovered in 2006, the TSA overhauled security \nprocedures in a matter of 12 hours to deal with the threat of liquid \nexplosives. They had to act very quickly and flexibly. It is difficult \nto imagine that kind of flexibility under inflexible union rules.\n  In 2006, following a severe midwestern snow storm, local TSA \nemployees were unable to get to the airport, but TSA was able to fly \npersonnel in temporarily from other airports to cover these snowed-in \npersonnel. This helped keep the airport open and the security lines \nmoving. I wonder how injecting collective bargaining into this type of \nsituation would have impacted TSA's ability to be flexible, to be quick \non its feet, and to move personnel around.\n  There is also the issue of testing and rollout of software to protect \nthe privacy of passengers utilizing advanced imaging technology. This \nshould be done on the basis of national security and passenger safety \nand privacy concerns, and not delayed because of union concerns or \nintervention in the management of TSA employees.\n  I would reiterate, TSA has existed for almost 10 years without \ncollective bargaining, and there is no legitimate policy reason to \nchange this procedure at this time.\n  Working with Senator Collins, who I believe is prepared to also speak \ntoday, I have modified my amendment to make it clear that TSA employees \nhave the baseline protections that almost all our Federal employees \nhave, while preserving the flexibility needed to keep our Nation safe. \nThe modified amendment would codify the 2003 TSA policy that prohibits \ncollective bargaining agreements with security screeners. We do not \nneed to limit the flexibility to respond immediately to emerging and \nevolving threats.\n  My amendment would also allow the Merit Systems Protection Board to \nhear adverse employment actions, such as demotions or firings, so TSA \nemployees would have the same protections as other Federal security \nemployees.\n  Also, if these modifications are accepted unanimously today, they \nwould codify protections under the Whistleblowers Protection Act and \nwould create an employee engagement process for workplace issues. My \namendment simply adds these protections into the statute.\n  I would also point out that it is the public employees union \ncontracts that States are grappling with today. Several of our States \nare literally facing bankruptcy because of the expensive and burdensome \ngovernment union employee contracts--Illinois, New Jersey, California. \nThe Governors, on a bipartisan basis, are struggling to get out from \nunder these burdens and to free their States from these expensive \npublic employee union contracts. They are causing the bankruptcy of \nStates.\n  In the U.S. Government, we have the ability to deficit spend, and \nthat is quite a problem. We will spend $1.5 trillion this fiscal year \nthat we don't have, and the American public is demanding that we do \nsomething about it. It is unimaginable to me that under those \ncircumstances the Obama administration is taking action which can only \nmake TSA more expensive and make dealing with our employees there more \ncostly and add to the debt. I don't see any way around it.\n  As States and localities are moving in one direction, here comes the \nObama administration and, swimming upstream on this issue, proposing to \nadd to the public employee union collective bargaining regime some \n40,000 to 50,000 additional Americans. I don't see how we can afford \nthat. I don't see how it helps security or helps our Nation to adopt \nsome more burdensome requirements, and I don't see how it helps \nnational security.\n  I would urge my colleagues to vote in favor of Wicker amendment No. \n14. That vote may occur as early as tomorrow morning, but I would urge \nits adoption. This is an issue that is not going to go away. It is \ngoing to be taken up in the other body. We are going to be following \nthis issue, and it is something I think Americans feel strongly about.\n  At this point I would urge the adoption of my amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, first, let me thank my colleague and \nfriend from Mississippi for working with me over the past few days to \nmodify the amendment he originally proposed. I very much appreciated \nhis willingness to sit down and talk about the amendment, and I am \npleased to cosponsor Senator Wicker's modified amendment, which \nprovides additional workforce protections for transportation security \nofficers while ensuring the management flexibility that is absolutely \nvital to the operational efficiency of the TSA and to the security of \nthe American people. Our amendment would provide additional employment\n\n[[Page S591]]\n\nprotections to TSA employees while preserving the agency's ability to \nrespond quickly and effectively to security and operational challenges.\n  Through our committee's work on homeland security, I have become \nconvinced that the ability for TSA to respond quickly and effectively \nto changing conditions, to emerging threats, to new intelligence, to \nimpending crises, even to dramatic weather such as blizzards and \nhurricanes, is essential. From the intelligence community to our first \nresponders, the key to an effective response is flexibility--the \nability to put assets and personnel where they are needed, when they \nare needed, with a minimum of bureaucracy.\n  The TSA is charged with a great responsibility. In order to \naccomplish its critical national security mission, the Aviation and \nTransportation Security Act provided the TSA Administrator with certain \nworkforce flexibilities. These flexibilities allowed the Administrator \nto shift resources and to implement new procedures whenever needed--\ndaily, even hourly, in some cases--in response to emergencies, canceled \nflights, changing circumstances, or threats to our security. This \nauthority has enabled TSA to make the best and fullest use of its \nhighly trained and dedicated workforce.\n  I want to point out that this debate is not just theoretical. We are \nnot talking about having some theoretical flexibility. We have already \nseen the benefits of this flexibility. We have seen exactly why it is \nnecessary.\n  Let me give a couple of examples. In the aftermath of the thwarted \nairline liquids bombing plot that emanated from Great Britain, TSA was \nable to move quickly to change the nature of its employees' work and \neven the location of that work. With the liquids bombing plot, TSA, \novernight, had to retrain its employees, had to deploy them \ndifferently, and was able to do so precisely because of the flexibility \nof the current law.\n  Another example is the December 2006 blizzard that hit the Denver \narea. When many local TSA employees were unable to get to the airport, \nTSA was able to act quickly, flying in volunteer TSA employees from Las \nVegas to cover the shifts, and covering the Las Vegas shifts with \nofficers who were transferred temporarily from Salt Lake City. Without \nthat ability to deploy personnel where they were needed on a moment's \nnotice, the Denver airport would have been critically understaffed \nwhile hundreds, perhaps thousands of travelers were stranded. This \nflexibility is essential to maintain, and that is what the Wicker-\nCollins-Coburn amendment would do.\n  TSA also redeployed hundreds of screeners to Houston and New Orleans \nin response to hurricanes in 2008. These TSOs relieved local employees \nat those airports so that they could safely evacuate themselves and \ntheir families, and it helped to quickly resume screening operations \nafter the storms had passed.\n  These were challenging times for TSA. Evacuations in these cities \ncaused high volumes of airline passengers resulting in the TSOs in New \nOrleans screening more than 32,000 gulf coast residents within a 48-\nhour period.\n  TSA's announcement on Friday purports to preclude employees from \nbargaining over security policies and procedures. But if we look at \nprecisely what it says, it does allow bargaining over the selection \nprocess for special assignments and on policies for transfers and shift \ntrading--matters that could require very rapid resolution during an \nemergency. There will not be time for bargaining over those issues.\n  In addition, the very definition of what constitutes security \npolicies and procedures could be the subject of dispute and litigation. \nThat is exactly the point Secretary Chertoff made in a letter he sent \nto me in 2007 when the Senate was considering this very same issue. He \nwrote:\n\n       Although the administrator of TSA purportedly would not be \n     required to bargain over responses to emergencies or imminent \n     threats, it is inevitable that protracted litigation would \n     ensue over the meaning of these terms.\n\n  That is exactly what would happen if we allow to stand the decision \nof the Administrator of TSA. Instead of drastically changing the TSA \npersonnel system in a way that would interfere with TSA's ability to \ncarry out its mission, there is an alternative. We should make some \ntargeted but critical reforms in the personnel system to ensure that \nTSA's employees are treated fairly.\n  My point is there is a middle ground that we can reach, and that is \nwhat the modified amendment does. First, we should bring TSA employees \nunder the Whistleblower Protections Act, which safeguards the rights of \nwhistleblowers throughout the Federal Government. There is simply no \nreason to deny TSA employees that protection. Indeed, I would argue it \nhurts us to deny that protection because if there is a whistleblower at \nthis critical agency who does not feel fully protected and does not \ncome forward, that could hurt our security. So our amendment would \ncodify that coverage and make that protection clear.\n  Second, we should make clear that TSA members do have the right to \njoin a union. That is a different issue from collective bargaining. \nSome of them have chosen to be represented by a union now. Many have \nnot chosen to be. But they should have that choice. That allows, for \nexample, for them to get representation by a union if there is an \nadverse employment action. Our amendment specifically provides that we \nare not depriving employees of that choice.\n  Third, we should give TSA employees the right to an independent \nappeal of adverse personnel actions such as removals, suspensions for \nmore than 14 days, reductions in pay or grade, or certain furloughs. \nThe amendment would give TSOs the right to have those appeals heard by \nthe Merit Systems Protection Board. That is an independent board, \nseparate from the agency, separate from the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, that sits in judgment of appeals filed by most other Federal \nemployees. So I see no reason TSA screeners should not have that same \nright. That is an important protection because if a screener believes \nhe or she is being treated unfairly by a supervisor, there is an \nindependent arbitrator to whom that employee can appeal.\n  Here is the bottom line. We can provide TSA employees with important \nprotections enjoyed by other Federal employees, such as the right to \nappeal adverse employment actions to the Merit Systems Protection Board \nand the statutory right to whistleblower protections without disrupting \nTSA's proven personnel system that has served the agency and this \nNation well over the past decade. Previous Secretaries of Homeland \nSecurity and Administrators of TSA have described that personnel system \nin great detail to the Homeland Security Committee and to other \nentities, in the Senate in both classified briefings and open hearings, \nas necessary to accomplish the critical goals of TSA. Our amendment \nwould preserve these flexible personnel systems while ensuring that TSA \nemployees enjoy important legal protections available to other Federal \nemployees.\n  I have been trying since 2007 to achieve a middle ground on this \nissue. Frankly, the previous administration was reluctant on some of \nthe safeguards I have described. This administration has gone way \noverboard in the other direction, but a middle ground is exactly what \nthis modified amendment strikes. It charts that middle ground, \nproviding significant additional protections and rights to TSA \nemployees without burdening a system that is working well now and that \nis essential to our security.\n  We simply have to allow the TSA Administrator to retain exactly the \nsame kinds of flexibility to deploy personnel that he enjoys now and \nthat have been used in the past. That is the important point. This \ndebate is not theoretical. Those personnel flexibilities have proven \nabsolutely essential to meet the threat of a terrorist attack and to \ndeal with blizzards and hurricanes. I urge my colleagues to take a \nstrong, close look at the modified amendment. I hope they will support \nit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                    Nomination of Marco A. Hernandez\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee dealing with an exceptionally\n\n[[Page S592]]\n\nimportant bill. I appreciate his courtesy at this time.\n  Mr. President, later in the evening the Senate will confirm Judge \nMarco Hernandez, who has been nominated to serve as a U.S. district \ncourt judge for the District of Oregon. The vacancy that Judge \nHernandez will fill is one that Chief Justice Roberts has designated a \njudicial emergency. Given that, I thank Chairman Leahy, Ranking Member \nGrassley, Majority Leader Reid, and Minority Leader McConnell for \nbringing this nomination to the floor today.\n  I also note Oregon has another opening and another outstanding \nnominee, Mr. Michael Simon, whom I expect to be reported out of \ncommittee this week. I hope he, too, will be brought to the Senate \nfloor quickly.\n  It is no surprise that Judge Marco Hernandez was nominated to the \nFederal bench because his life could serve as a billboard for the \nAmerican dream. At the age of 17, Marco Hernandez moved to Oregon by \nhimself. Needing to support himself, he took a job as a dishwasher, \nlater found a better job as a janitor, and eventually Marco became a \nteacher's aide. At that point, Judge Hernandez began taking night \nclasses at a local community college with the hope of one day attending \na 4-year college. Finally, he was able to enroll at Western Oregon \nState College, and he quickly demonstrated his ability to excel.\n  Judge Hernandez earned the Delmer Dewey Award as the most outstanding \nmale student in his class. Following college, Marco went on to graduate \nfrom the University of Washington School of Law.\n  From the beginning of his legal career, Judge Hernandez demonstrated \na strong commitment to public service. After law school, Judge \nHernandez worked at Oregon Legal Services representing farm workers. He \nthen served as a deputy district attorney and was later appointed as a \nState court judge, a position he has served in for the past 15 years.\n  Judge Hernandez is so well regarded across my home State and across \nthe political spectrum that he has been nominated not by one but by two \nPresidents of different parties and at the recommendations of two \nSenators of different parties. Judge Hernandez was first nominated for \nthe district court by President Bush in 2008 when my friend and former \ncolleague, Senator Gordon Smith, led the nomination process. At that \ntime I supported the recommendation of Judge Hernandez.\n  Unfortunately, the 110th Congress was unable to act upon his \nnomination before adjourning. In the 111th Congress I recommended Judge \nHernandez's nomination to President Obama, and I am very pleased that \nSenator Merkley, who has joined me in the Senate, has been a strong \nsupporter of Judge Hernandez as well. I was very pleased when President \nObama announced that he, too, like President Bush, thought it important \nfor Judge Hernandez to serve on the Federal bench.\n  One of the reasons leaders from both political parties support Judge \nHernandez is that throughout his judicial career he has demonstrated a \nspecial affinity for creative solutions. He implemented an innovative \ndomestic violence program to aggressively pursue offenders and created \na new program for mentally ill defendants, which Judge Hernandez \ncontinues to oversee.\n  With a tremendous record of public service, innovation, and \ncommitment to justice, no one was surprised when Judge Hernandez was \nreported out of the Judiciary Committee unanimously. He has had the \nsupport of both Republicans and Democrats and a broad range of legal \norganizations. He has received the strong backing of the Hispanic \nNational Bar Association. In fact, Judge Hernandez would be the first \nHispanic article III judge in my home State.\n  It is good news for the people of Oregon, and it is good news for the \nFederal bench that today the Senate is taking up the confirmation of \nJudge Hernandez. I strongly urge all my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting an outstanding individual, Judge Marco Hernandez, for U.S. \ndistrict court judge.\n  I thank, again, Chairman Rockefeller, who is dealing with an \nextremely important bill for his courtesy for letting me make these \nremarks about Judge Hernandez.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal.)

Mr. President, I know we celebrated President Reagan's \n100th birthday this past weekend. I quote from him on many occasions. \nHe inspired many of us in many ways. President Reagan once stated:\n\n       Government programs once launched never disappear. Actually \n     a government bureau is the nearest thing to eternal life we \n     will ever see on this earth.\n\n  I do not know if President Reagan ever observed the Essential Air \nService program, but it certainly fits his description. This amendment, \nto repeal a $200 million government subsidy, may not be significant. \nAnd $200 million, in the light of a $1.5 trillion deficit this year, is \nprobably not a lot of money. But a lot of Americans on November 2 said \nthey wanted us to stop spending on things that are not absolutely \nessential. Although this program is called the Essential Air Service, \nin my view, it is far from ``essential.'' But the American people spoke \non November 2. They said, stop the spending. Stop programs that are \neither unnecessary, have grown too much, are unwise, or even make some \ntough decisions.\n  In this bill, we are not cutting the Essential Air Service, we are \nactually increasing it to some $200 million. My colleagues may be a bit \nconfused by this chart right here. But it shows--by this way, this \nchart came from the FAA--that 99.95 percent of all Americans--99.95 \npercent of all Americans--live within 120 miles of a public airport \nthat has more than 10,000 takeoffs and landings annually.\n  So, yes, there are some parts of America that represent the .05 \npercent of all Americans who live outside of 120 miles from an airport \nthat has 10,000 takeoffs and landings.\n  All the watchdog organizations--Citizens Against Government Waste, \nthe National Taxpayers Union, all of those organizations that watch \nwhat we do support this amendment. Earlier this month Citizens Against \nGovernment Waste President Tom Schatz said: The nonessential air \nservice has outlived its usefulness and is another reason why the \ncountry has a $14 trillion national debt.\n  A lot of Americans will be watching the vote on this amendment. It is \nnot the first amendment to try to cut back on spending, but it \ncertainly is, in my view, very symbolic of whether we are\n\n[[Page S593]]\n\nserious. Last week, in the President's State of the Union speech, he \nsaid: The only way to tackle our deficit is to cut excessive spending \nwherever we find it, in domestic spending, defense spending, health \ncare spending and spending through tax breaks and loopholes.\n  As House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan has told many, ``There \nare no sacred cows when it comes to spending cuts.'' To put it bluntly, \nthe Essential Air Service is not ``essential.'' The program was created \nin 1978 when Congress deregulated the airline industry and allowed \nmarket forces to determine the price, quantity, and quality of service. \nDeregulation allowed most airline carriers to focus their resources on \nprofitable, high-density markets. That is the way the market works. In \nresponse, Congress established the Essential Air Service to subsidize \nairline carriers that provide service to small communities at a loss, \nbecause, otherwise, no sane business would serve a market at a loss.\n  Again, as Ronald Reagan once eloquently stated, ``Government does not \nsolve problems, it subsidizes them.'' That is exactly what we did in \n1978 by creating the Essential Air Program.\n  As with so many programs we have created, as Congress initially \nenacted the program, it was supposed to last 10 years. It was only 10 \nyears that we enacted this program while markets adjusted and \ncommunities adjusted. In 1996, of course, we removed the 10-year limit, \nand like so many programs the government has created, it started with a \nfew airline carriers and a few communities, and now has grown to \nsubsidize a dozen airline carriers and over 100 communities. You cover \nenough communities, you get enough votes, you keep the program going, \nand then you increase the spending on the program.\n  In this bill, it increased costs of $200 million. Again, not much in \ncomparison to a $1.5 trillion debt, $14 trillion deficit--$1.5 trillion \ndeficit, $14 trillion debt. But it might be nice to start somewhere. \nLike so many other government programs, the program was initially \nfunded for several million dollars, now up to $200 million.\n  A July 2009 Government Accountability Office report questioned \nwhether the AES program has outlived its usefulness, stating:\n\n       Current conditions raise concerns about whether the program \n     continues to operate as it has. The growth of the air \n     service, especially by low-cost carriers, which today serve \n     most U.S. hub airports, weighed against the relatively high \n     fares and inconvenience of Essential Air Service flights can \n     lead people to bypass Essential Air Service flights and drive \n     to hub airports.\n\n  As I mentioned, 99.95 percent of all Americans live within 120 miles \nof public airports with more than 10,000 takeoffs and landings--in \nother words, fairly large airports. Let me give you a good example of \nthe kind of great expenditure of the taxpayers dollar this is.\n  Last year the Wall Street Journal published an article entitled, \n``John Murtha's Airport for No One,'' which reported on an airport in \nPennsylvania that has received more than $1.3 million over the past few \nyears under the Essential Air Service program. The article states:\n\n       The airport sees an average of fewer than 30 people per \n     day. There is never a wait for security, you can park for \n     free right outside the gate. And you are almost guaranteed a \n     row to yourself on any flight.\n\n  The article continues:\n\n       Tickets to fly to Johnstown are expensive, even though \n     every passenger flying out of John Murtha Airport has a $100 \n     subsidy behind the ticket, courtesy of the Federal Essential \n     Air Service Program, which provides support to struggling \n     airports. So far it has gotten $150 million of payments to \n     what is called the Airport for No One. There are a total of \n     18 flights per week, all of which go to Dulles Airport in \n     Washington, D.C.\n\n  The author goes on to say:\n\n       I was visiting the airport from Washington but because \n     flights cost a pricy $400, I drove. The drive took less than \n     three and a half hours and cost about $35 in gas--not to \n     mention that it was arguably faster than flying. And this \n     isn't a remote area of the state. Murtha airport is less than \n     two hours from the Pittsburgh airport. The airport has an \n     $8.5 million taxpayer-funded radar system that has never been \n     used. The runway was paved with reinforced concrete at a cost \n     of more than $17 million. The latest investment was $800,000 \n     from the $787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act \n     to repave half of the secondary runway. (Never mind that the \n     first one is hardly ever in use.)\n\n  Well, the list goes on and on. That is just an example.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the article \nfrom the Wall Street Journal entitled ``John Murtha's Airport for No \nOne,'' and the Los Angeles Times article entitled, ``Planes to nowhere? \nCongress plans to increase small-town airline subsidies,'' and the \nSeattle Times article entitled, ``Rural air subsidies test resolve to \ncut spending.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 3, 2009]\n\n                    John Murtha's Airport for No One\n\n\n                A monument to earmarks in Johnstown, Pa.\n\n                            (By Tyler Grimm)\n\n       If you hate the hubbub of crowded airports, you might want \n     to consider flying out of Johnstown, Pa. The airport sees an \n     average of fewer than 30 people per day, there is never a \n     wait for security, you can park for free right outside the \n     gate, and you are almost guaranteed a row to yourself on any \n     flight.\n       You might wonder how the region ever had the air traffic \n     demand to justify such a facility. It didn't. But it is \n     located in the district of one of Congress's most \n     unapologetic earmarkers: Democrat John Murtha.\n       In 20 years, Mr. Murtha has successfully doled out more \n     than $150 million of federal payments to what is now being \n     called the airport for no one. I took a trip to southwestern \n     Pennsylvania to explore how this small town received so much \n     money and whether the John Murtha Airport is a legitimate \n     federal investment.\n       There are many in Johnstown who see the airport as crucial. \n     Johnstown Chamber of Commerce President Bob Layo tells me: \n     ``If the airport isn't paying dividends now, it will in the \n     future.'' But those dividends appear to be a mirage.\n       There are a total of 18 flights per week, all of which go \n     to Dulles Airport in Washington, D.C. I was visiting the \n     airport from Washington, but because flights cost a pricey \n     $400, I drove. The drive took less than three and a half \n     hours and cost about $35 in gas--not to mention that it was \n     arguably faster than flying.

The runway was paved with \n     reinforced concrete at a cost of more than $17 million. The \n     latest investment was $800,000 from the $787 billion American \n     Recovery and Reinvestment Act to repave half of the secondary \n     runway. (Never mind that the first one is hardly ever in \n     use.)\n       Airport Director Scott Voelker admitted in an interview \n     that having a never-used unmanned radar system is ``dumber \n     than dirt.'' But he says the airport is necessary and blames \n     its current shortcomings on the economy. ``To get more \n     passengers, we need more flights. To get more flights, we \n     need more passengers,'' he says. Mr. Voelker believes the \n     ``economy has dictated to the airlines to cut back on \n     flights.'' In other words: The airport was not built in \n     response to passenger or airline needs.\n       The usually barren airport--there were several times during \n     the day I paced the building for 15 minutes and did not see \n     another human being--has a lot of unused advertising space. \n     But you can't miss the large picture of John Murtha among a \n     collage of Lockheed Martin workers at the airport's center. \n     It's a monument to earmarks: ``Partnerships Make a World of \n     Difference,'' the ad reads.\n       Tickets to fly to Johnstown are expensive, even though \n     every passenger flying out of John Murth Airport has a $100 \n     subsidy behind the ticket courtesy of the federal Essential \n     Air Service program, which provides support to struggling \n     rural airports. A woman who had just gotten off a flight told \n     me that there were only four people on her plane. ``The plane \n     could have held at least 30 passengers,'' she said.\n       In addition to the airport, Mr. Murtha's ability to corral \n     federal funds is apparent in the local medical research \n     center (named after his wife), the John P. Murtha Technology \n     Center, the area's thriving defense contracting industry, and \n     numerous other local landmarks. The unemployment rate in \n     Johnstown is currently below the national average of 9.4% \n     thanks to federal largess and the fact that so many have \n     moved away from the area.\n       Bill Polacek, a local businessman and a member of the \n     airport's board of directors, told me that the citizens of \n     Johnstown need Mr. Murtha's earmarks. ``Quite frankly, if he \n     didn't do that, we wouldn't elect him,'' he said.\n       I asked Mr. Layo of the Chamber of Commerce if he thinks \n     Mr. Murtha's earmarks should stop now that Johnstown has \n     emerged from the economic crisis it faced two decades ago. \n     ``I don't think you're ever finished,'' he replied. As long \n     as Mr. Murtha is in Congress, they never will be.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Los Angeles Times, Sept. 19, 2009]\n\n   Planes to Nowhere?

Located about a four-hour drive north of Las Vegas, \n     it is perhaps most famous as the birthplace of former First \n     Lady Pat Nixon.\n\n[[Page S594]]\n\n       Ely also is a beneficiary of Essential Air Service, a \n     federal program established in the 1970s after airline \n     deregulation to prevent small communities from losing access \n     to air travel. But opponents call the program wasteful \n     spending, noting that much of the money provides service to \n     areas with fewer than 30 passengers a day.\n       This week, the Senate passed a transportation bill that \n     includes a $38-million funding increase for the program, \n     which now stands to receive $175 million.\n       In 2008, according to Senate Appropriations Committee data, \n     Great Lakes Airlines received a subsidy of about $1.8 million \n     for the 414 passengers it flew to and from Ely--about $4,500 \n     per person.\n       Since the program requires companies to offer at least two \n     round trips most days, some subsidized flights were almost \n     certainly empty. Service contracts usually last two years.\n       Ely is just one of many communities receiving heavily \n     subsidized flights; in June 2009, 152 towns and cities \n     participated, according to the Department of Transportation.\n       Costs vary widely in part because of differences in \n     ridership. Glendive, Mont., saw a per-passenger subsidy of \n     more than $2,500 for each of the 418 people who flew last \n     year. The 23,581 passengers using the airport in Manhattan, \n     Kan., only cost the government $50.82 each.\n       Steve Ellis, vice president of the watchdog group Taxpayers \n     for Common Sense, said that the program ``was supposed to go \n     away over a period of time as we made the transition [from \n     deregulation]. . . . Congress made sure it hasn't.''\n       But residents of small towns defend the program.\n       ``We are very isolated,'' said Karen Rajala, coordinator \n     for the White Pine County Economic Diversification Council, \n     which covers Ely. ``The subsidy provides us a link to the \n     urban areas of our state and the West.''\n       But in a time of soaring deficits, Congress must be careful \n     with how it spends money, Ellis said. ``I'm not saying there \n     aren't people who benefit from this program,'' he said. ``But \n     the real question is, are the taxpayers as a whole getting \n     their money's worth?''\n       Attempting to scale back the program, however, is \n     difficult, as President George W. Bush learned when he \n     proposed cutting funding to $50 million in his 2006 budget. \n     His push, which also included a cost-sharing requirement for \n     cities receiving service, collapsed in the face of \n     congressional opposition.\n       The House's transportation bill also contains $175 million \n     for the program. The two bills will be sent to a conference \n     committee before President Obama signs a final version into \n     law.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Seattle Times, Feb. 3, 2011]\n\n            Rural Air Subsidies Test Resolve To Cut Spending\n\n                             (By Joan Lowy)\n\n       Washington.--A program that subsidizes air service to small \n     airports, often in remote communities, is shaping up as an \n     early test in the new Congress of conservatives' zeal for \n     shrinking the federal government.\n       Sen.

The \n     program pays airlines to provide scheduled service to about \n     150 communities, from Muscle Shoals, Ala., to Pelican, \n     Alaska.\n       In the House, the Republican Study Committee--a group of \n     conservative lawmakers--has also proposed killing the \n     program.\n       Subsidies per airline passenger as of June 1, 2010, ranged \n     as high as $5,223 in Ely, Nev., to as low as $9.21 in Thief \n     River Falls, Minn., according to Transportation Department \n     data for the lower 48 states.\n       The program was created to ensure that less-profitable \n     routes to small airports wouldn't be eliminated when airline \n     service was deregulated in 1978. But critics say the airports \n     often serve too few people to merit the amount of money spent \n     in subsidies. Urban growth over the past three decades has \n     also placed transportation alternatives--other airports, \n     trains and bus service--within a reasonable distance of some \n     communities receiving subsidies.\n       Studies show that in a lot of those communities people \n     drive to larger airports to get better service at a lower \n     cost than they can get at the smaller airport, even with \n     subsidized air service, said Severin Borenstein, a University \n     of California-Berkeley business professor who is an expert on \n     airline competition.\n       ``Some communities can make a credible claim they need the \n     service, particularly in Alaska, but I think those are a \n     relatively small part of the program,'' he said.\n       The program has been remarkably resilient, partly due to \n     the protection it receives from lawmakers from rural states \n     and districts. It has been proposed for cuts or elimination \n     many times over the years, but continues to grow.\n       ``It's exactly in the political sweet spot,'' Borenstein \n     said. Lawmakers don't feel it's worth upsetting the few \n     people the program serves to achieve what amounts to a modest \n     savings in federal budget terms, he said.\n       Supporters say the small airports and their air service are \n     important to the communities' ability to attract investment \n     and jobs.\n       Four Democratic senators--Mark Begich of Alaska, Ben Nelson \n     of Nebraska, Robert Casey of Pennsylvania and Joe Manchin of \n     West Virginia--are circulating a letter among their \n     colleagues for signature. It urges McCain to give up his \n     attempt to kill the program, citing potential economic \n     consequences.\n       ``Eliminating the program will have a devastating impact on \n     the economies of rural communities,'' their letter says.\n       ``At a moment when the nation's economic recovery is \n     starting to gain momentum, it makes little sense to reduce \n     personal and business travel volume by cutting off residents \n     of rural areas,'' the letter says. ``And at a time when jobs \n     are already so hard to come by in our rural communities, it \n     makes even less sense to enact cuts that will only make the \n     problem worse.''\n       One of the program's biggest supporters is Sen. Jay \n     Rockefeller, D-W.Va., chairman of the Senate Commerce, \n     Science and Transportation Committee and the main sponsor of \n     the pending aviation bill. It would increase rather than \n     decrease funding for the program and give the Transportation \n     Department more flexibility in structuring contracts with \n     airlines to improve it. Rockefeller would also let the \n     department adjust contracts to take into account rising fuel \n     costs. There are five communities in West Virginia with \n     subsidized service.\n       Several conservative senators from rural states declined to \n     discuss McCain's amendment when approached by The Associated \n     Press.\n       ``I'll have to see it first. I haven't seen the \n     amendment,'' said Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo. Two communities \n     in Wyoming--Laramie and Worland--receive subsidized service, \n     according to the Transportation Department.\n       ``I just don't know about that,'' echoed Sen. Orrin Hatch, \n     R-Utah. Three communities in Utah--Moab, Vernal and Cedar \n     City--receive subsidized service.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Los Angeles Times article entitled ``planes to \nnowhere,'' stated:\n\n       In 2008, according to Senate Appropriations Committee data, \n     Great Lakes Airlines received a subsidy of about $1.8 million \n     for the 414 passengers it flew to and from Ely Nevada, which \n     is about a 4-hour drive to Las Vegas. This amounts to a \n     $4,500 per-person subsidy. Since the program requires \n     companies to offer at least two round trips most days, some \n     subsidized flights were almost certainly empty.\n\n  The article says: Ely is a beneficiary of the Essential Air Service \nprogram established in the 1970s after airline deregulation, et cetera. \nCosts vary widely in part because of differences in ridership. \nGlendive, MT saw a per-passenger subsidy of more than $2,000 for each \nof the 418 who flew last year. The 23,581 passengers using the airport \nin Manhattan, KS, only cost the government $50.82 each.\n  Steve Ellis, vice president of the watchdog group Taxpayers for \nCommon Sense, said: The program ``was supposed to go away over a period \nof time as we made the transition [from deregulation]. . . . Congress \nmade sure it hasn't.''\n  Then, of course, I mentioned the Seattle Times article entitled, \n``Rural air subsidies test resolve to cut spending.''\n\n       A program that subsidizes air service to small airports, \n     often in remote communities, is shaping up as an early test \n     in the new Congress of conservative zeal for shrinking the \n     federal government.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       A program that subsidizes air services to small airports, \n     often in remote communities, is shaping up as an early test \n     in the new Congress of conservative zeal for shrinking the \n     Federal Government.\n       Subsidies per airline passenger as of June 1, 2010, ranged \n     as high as $5,223 in Ely, NV, to as low as $9.21 in Thief \n     River Falls, MN, according to Transportation Department data \n     for the lower 48 States.\n       But critics say the airports often serve too few people to \n     merit the amount of money spent in subsidies.

This program was put into being in \n1978. It was supposed to be there for 10 years. It was a few million \ndollars. Now, according to this bill, it will be $200 million.\n  It is about time we match our rhetoric with our votes. I believe this \nwill be a very interesting vote we will be taking on this amendment.\n  All of these red dots represent people served by large and major \nairports. There are some areas of the country that are not. Most of \nthese are very sparsely populated areas.\n  I hope my colleagues will vote in favor of eliminating this program \nthat was designed for 10 years of life and now has continued on for \nsome 30 years. And, as Ronald Reagan said, they are the hardest thing \nin the world to either reduce or eliminate.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to respond to the most \ninteresting facts pointed out by the Senator from Arizona and also the \ncollective bargaining matter. Senator Nelson is here with a \nparticularly good amendment. Before we get to the 4:30 hour, at which \ntime we will be debating judges, I wish to give him a chance to talk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, the \nchairman, for this opportunity to discuss an amendment to the FAA \nreauthorization bill which I will be offering shortly. We are currently \nworking with the minority on some language changes. This amendment will \nbe proposed before long. When it is, I will be seeking a rollcall vote.\n  The amendment, which I propose along with Senators Schumer, Akaka, \nMenendez, Whitehouse, Tester, and Shaheen, would make it a crime to \nphotograph, record, or distribute a body scan image taken by a body \nscan imaging machine at either an airport or any Federal building \nwithout express authorization to do so either by law or regulation. I \nhave heard from many Nebraskans who are concerned that the use of body \nscan imaging machines is overly invasive and their privacy is being \nignored. I, too, share these concerns. This isn't an abstract concern. \nAccording to news reports, the U.S. Marshals Service acknowledged last \nyear that some 35,000 images from a body scanner at a security \ncheckpoint at a Florida courthouse had been saved. That is despite \npromises from Federal agencies that these images would not be stored. \nOne hundred of the saved images were leaked, and some are now online \nfor anyone to view. So an invasion of privacy has already occurred.\n  Nebraskans and the American people understand that every step needs \nto be taken and every resource needs to be used to ensure the safety of \nour citizenry. Using technology to scan individuals for hidden weapons \nis a necessary, albeit sometimes unpleasant, aspect of making sure our \nairways and public buildings are safe. However, in the scope of doing \nsuch things, safeguards can and must be put in place to help deter \nindividuals from collecting and using those images inappropriately. \nThis is the goal of the amendment I and my colleagues are offering.\n  I am well aware Transportation Security Agency officials have said \nthe agency will not keep, store, or transmit images, but that has not \nand doesn't ensure compliance. If passing laws or directives ensured \ncompliance, there would be no speeders in America. What is needed is \nadditional consequences to make anyone considering keeping, storing, or \ntransmitting these scanned images think twice about the\n\n[[Page S596]]\n\nfact that they will be committing a felony. If the consequence is \nenough of a deterrent, we will have better compliance and the privacy \nof every American will be better protected.\n  Let me explain specifically what the amendment does. One, it makes it \nillegal to photograph, record, and subsequently distribute the images \ntaken by body scan machines in an airport or any Federal building.\n  Two, it imposes a penalty of up to 1 year in prison and up to a \n$100,000 fine for those who inappropriately collect and distribute \nthese images.\n  Three, it says that any individual who is acting within the course \nand scope of their employment is not breaking the law by saving these \nimages or sending them if the purpose for doing so is to use these \nimages in a criminal investigation or prosecution.\n  By adopting this amendment, we will be telling the American people \nand my constituents that we are not going to ignore or compromise their \nprivacy in the process of making sure we have safe airports and Federal \nbuildings. Our amendment takes a commonsense approach to addressing \nthis issue and why I am seeking its inclusion in the FAA authorization.\n  I thank the chairman and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, in that we have a short reception at \n4:30 and then we are going to judges, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/07/senate-section/article/S596-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S596]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nVISIT TO THE SENATE BY THE PRIME MINISTER OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA, \n                       THE HONORABLE BORUT PAHOR\n\n  Mr. HARKIN.

He is the sixth Prime Minister since Slovenia won independence \nin 1991.\n  As many of my colleagues know, the Republic of Slovenia holds a very \nspecial place in my heart. My mother came to America from the village \nof Siha in what is now Slovenia nearly 90 years ago, and I have been \ntremendously impressed with the great strides Slovenia has made since \nbreaking away from the former Yugoslavia. For the last 2 years, Prime \nMinister Pahor with great skill has continued to lead his nation on a \nsuccessful course of democratic and free market economics. So make no \nmistake, the success of independent Slovenia, like the success of the \nyoung American Republic two centuries ago, was no accident. It was \nsecured by visionary leaders and by a determined people. Nine decades \nago, my mother left Slovenia--a Slovenia that was impoverished, ruled \nby autocrats, and dominated by foreign powers; a nation that sent forth \nimmigrants desperate to find a better life. Today, a free, prosperous, \nand democratic Slovenia sends forth statesmen, diplomats, and \nhumanitarians helping to build a better world.\n  Again, on behalf of the Senate, I welcome our honored guest, Prime \nMinister Pahor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/07/senate-section/article/S596-2", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S596]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECESS SUBJECT TO THE CALL OF THE CHAIR\n\n  Mr. HARKIN.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nominations, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nominations of Diana Saldana, of \nTexas, to be United States District Judge for the Southern District of \nTexas, Paul Kinloch Holmes III, of Arkansas, to be United States \nDistrict Judge for the Western District of Arkansas, and Marco A. \nHernandez, of Oregon, to be United States District Judge for the \nDistrict of Oregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 1 hour \nof debate equally divided in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, the Senate will consider, and I \nanticipate confirm, 3 of President Obama's nominations to fill judicial \nvacancies on Federal district courts in Arkansas, Oregon, and Texas. \nAll 3 of the nominations--P.K. Holmes to the Western District of \nArkansas, Judge Diana Saldana to the Southern District of Texas, and \nJudge Marco Hernandez to the District of Oregon--will fill judicial \nemergency vacancies. Given the serious need on those courts, and the \nqualifications of these nominees, there is no reason they could not \nhave been confirmed when they were nominated and reported unanimously \nby the Judiciary Committee last Congress. There is every reason for the \nSenate to act promptly now that President Obama has renominated them, \nthe Judiciary Committee has reconsidered them, and they have again been \nreported to the Senate unanimously.\n  I am hopeful that our actions today signal a return to regular order \nin the consideration of nominations without unexplained and damaging \ndelays. I am hopeful that this signals a return to cooperation to \nconfront a judicial vacancies crisis that has put at serious risk the \nability of all Americans to find equal access to a fair hearing in \ncourt. Chief Justice Roberts commented on this in his most recent \nstatement on the judiciary. The White House counsel recently spoke to \nthe crisis. The President wrote us last year urging action. The real \ncosts of these unnecessary partisan delays fall on Americans who depend \non the courts. Last September, President Obama wrote that these delays \nin Senate consideration of judicial nominees are ``undermining the \nability of our courts to deliver justice to those in need . . . from \nworking mothers seeking timely compensation for their employment \ndiscrimination claims to communities hoping for swift punishment for \nperpetrators of crimes to small business owners seeking protection from \nunfair and anticompetitive practices.'' The President was, and still \nis, right.\n  The Attorney General warned us last year that ``the system on which \nwe all depend for a prompt and fair hearing of our cases when we need \nto call on the law--is stressed to the breaking point.'' The National \nAssociation of Assistant United States Attorneys, a group of career \nFederal prosecutors likewise wrote to us, stating that, ``Our federal \ncourts cannot function effectively when judicial vacancies restrain the \nability to render swift and sure justice.''\n  As we consider these nominations today, there are still more than 100 \nvacancies in the Federal judiciary. Unlike the progress we made during \nPresident Bush's first 2 years in office when the Senate confirmed 100 \njudges and sharply reduced judicial vacancies, during the first 2 years \nof President Obama's term, we were only allowed to consider 60 judicial \nnominations. Despite vacancies for nearly 1 out of every 8 Federal \njudgeships, last year the Senate adjourned without voting on 19 \njudicial nominations favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee. The \n3 judges we will confirm today were among those 19. They could and \nshould have been confirmed last year.\n  The Senate must do better. We can consider and confirm this \nPresident's\n\n[[Page S597]]\n\nnominations to the Federal bench in a timely manner. This President has \nreached across the aisle to work with home State Republican Senators. \nHis nominees, like the nominees from Texas and Arkansas before us \ntoday, are supported by their home State Republican Senators. They are \nnot controversial. They tend to be superbly qualified nominees with a \nstrong commitment to the rule of law and a demonstrated faithfulness to \nthe Constitution. The 3 nominees before us today, the 11 judicial \nnominees voted out of the Judiciary Committee unanimously last week, \nand the 4 other judicial nominations that will be considered on \nFebruary 17 are all nominees who were nominated last Congress and \nconsidered and approved by the Judiciary Committee with strong \nbipartisan support.\n  With judicial vacancies now at 104, nearly half of them judicial \nemergency vacancies, the Nation cannot afford further delays by the \nSenate in taking action on the nominations pending before it. Judicial \nvacancies on courts throughout the country hinder the Federal \njudiciary's ability to fulfill its constitutional role. They create a \nbacklog of cases that prevents people from having their day in court. \nThis is unacceptable. In order for the Senate to ensure that the courts \nare functioning at full capacity, we must restore regular order.\n  A return to regular order would mean that nominations sent by the \nJudiciary Committee to the Senate should be considered expeditiously, \nnot stalled interminably. Noncontroversial nominations should be taken \nup and approved on a regular basis. They should not be stalled for \nweeks and months for no good reason. We must return to the Senate's \nlongstanding practice of quickly considering well-qualified consensus \njudicial nominations reported by the Judiciary Committee. Senators \nshould not stall noncontroversial nominees. We should not have months \nand months of damaging delays for no good reason on virtually every \njudicial nomination.\n  If Senators want to debate a nomination, we should have one. But then \nwe should vote. Nominations that do have opposition should be taken up \non a regular basis for debate, with cloture votes if necessary, so that \nall nominations can be acted upon in a reasonable amount of time. The \nSenate must move beyond the petty partisanship that has resulted in \nthis vacancy crisis.\n  I thank Senator Grassley, the Judiciary Committee's new ranking \nmember, for his cooperation in helping us to report 11 of the \npreviously reported judicial nominations last week, and for working \nwith me to schedule our first confirmation hearing of the new Congress. \nI look forward to continuing to work with him, with Majority Leader \nReid and with Republican Leader McConnell to schedule votes on the many \nother nominees reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee so that we \ncan ensure that the Federal judiciary has the judges and resources it \nneeds to provide justice to Americans in courts throughout the country.\n  When I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee during 17 months of \nPresident Bush's first 2 years in office with a Democratic majority, we \nfavorably reported 100 of his Federal circuit and district court \nnominees. All 100 were confirmed. I continued to work hard to make \nprogress considering President Bush's circuit and district court \nnominations as ranking member during the President Bush's 3rd and 4th \nyears in office when Senator Hatch was the committee chairman, and the \nSenate confirmed another 105. That should be our benchmark. By the end \nof this Congress, we should consider and confirm 205 Federal judges, \njust as we did during President Bush's first term. That is how we can \nreduce vacancies from the historically high levels at which they have \nremained throughout these first 2 years of the Obama administration to \nthe historically low level we reached toward the end of the Bush \nadministration. With the three confirmations today our total will stand \nat 63.\n  Overall, judicial vacancies were reduced during the Bush \nadministration from more than 10 percent to less than 4 percent. During \nthe Bush administration, the Federal court vacancies were reduced from \n110 to 34 and Federal circuit court vacancies were reduced from a high \nof 32 down to single digits. Regrettably, this progress has not \ncontinued with a Democratic President in office. Instead, the minority \nhas allowed votes on only 60 of President Obama's Federal circuit and \ndistrict court nominees, judicial vacancies have skyrocketed and remain \nover 100 and over 10 percent.\n  Today the Senate considers 3 of President Obama's qualified nominees. \nPresident Obama nominated Paul K. Holmes, III, last April to fill an \nemergency vacancy on the U.S. District Court for the Western District \nof Arkansas. Mr. Holmes is currently Of Counsel at the Fort Smith, AR, \nlaw firm where he formerly worked for more than two decades as an \nassociate and a partner. Previously, he was the U.S. attorney for the \nWestern District of Arkansas. As U.S. Attorney, Holmes served for 2 \nyears on the Attorney General's Advisory Committee. Mr. Holmes earned \nthe highest possible rating--unanimously well qualified--from the \nAmerican Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary, \nand his nomination has now garnered the support of 3 Arkansas Senators, \nSenators Pryor and Lincoln last Congress, and also Senator Boozman. I \nthank the Senators from Arkansas for working with us. I am pleased that \nMr. Holmes will be confirmed without further delay.\n  President Obama nominated Diana Saldana last July to fill an \nemergency vacancy in the Southern District of Texas, the district she \nhas served as a magistrate judge since 2006. Before taking the bench, \nJudge Saldana served the Southern District for 5 years as a Federal \nprosecutor, and she previously was a lawyer in private practice and a \ntrial attorney in the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of \nJustice. The child of migrant farmworkers, Judge Saldana began working \nalongside her family in the sugar beet fields at age 10, and she \ncontinued to do so for more than a decade. After graduating from law \nschool, she served as a law clerk to then-Chief Judge George P. Kazen. \nIf confirmed, Judge Saldana will fill the vacancy created by Judge \nKazen's retirement. Judge Saldana earned the highest possible rating--\nunanimously well qualified--from the ABA's Standing Committee on the \nFederal Judiciary. She has the support of her two Republican home State \nSenators. Senator Cornyn called her ``one of the toughest law enforcers \nin South Texas,'' and Senator Hutchison added that Judge Saldana ``has \nsome of the finest qualities we expect in our judges.'' Her nomination \nhas twice been reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee. I am \npleased she will be confirmed without further delay.\n  Marco A. Hernandez was nominated last July to fill an emergency \nvacancy on the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon. He has \nserved as a State judge in Oregon for the last 15 years, first on the \ndistrict court and now as a circuit court judge. Previously, Judge \nHernandez was a deputy district attorney in Washington County, OR, and \na lawyer for Oregon Legal Services. Judge Hernandez has the support of \nhis two home State Senators, and he has now been nominated to this \nposition by Presidents of both parties. If confirmed, he will become \nthe first Latino to serve as a Federal judge in Oregon. His nomination \nwas reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee last Congress and \nagain this Congress. It was ironic that after Senator Sessions made \nquite a fuss that Judge Hernandez had not been considered and confirmed \nwhen nominated at the very end of the Bush administration, the Senator \nthen proceeded to delay committee consideration of his nomination last \nyear and then Republican objections prevented Senate action last year. \nI thank Senator Wyden and Senator Merkley for their consistent support \nfor Judge Hernandez's nomination and am pleased that he will be \nconfirmed without further delay.\n  I have often said that the 100 of us in the Senate stand in the shoes \nof over 300 million Americans. We owe it to them to do our \nconstitutional duty of voting on the President's nominations to be \nFederal judges. We owe it to them to make sure that hard-working \nAmericans are able to have their cases heard in our Federal courts.\n  All three branches of the Federal Government come together when the \nSenate considers a President's nomination to a lifetime appointment on \nthe\n\n[[Page S598]]\n\nFederal bench. The Senate has a constitutional duty to act responsibly \nto consider the President's nominees and to confirm members of the \nJudiciary. Most importantly, the Senate has a responsibility to the \nAmerican people to help ensure that Federal judges are there to protect \ntheir rights and administer justice.\n  I mentioned that one of the nominees is Judge Diana Saldana to the \nSouthern District of Texas. I see my good friends, both the Senators \nfrom Texas, are here, one of whom I have the privilege to serve with on \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee and one of whom I have the privilege to \nserve with in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee. I rise today to speak in support of the Diana \nSaldana confirmation to serve as a Federal judge for the Southern \nDistrict of Texas in Laredo.\n  Judge Saldana's career has given her a breadth of experience that I \nbelieve will serve her well on the Federal bench. She received her B.A. \nin history and government from the University of Texas and then went on \nto receive a J.D. from the University of Texas School of Law.\n  She was born in Carrizo Springs, TX, only a stone's throw from where \nshe is currently serving as a U.S. magistrate judge in Laredo, TX. \nPrior to that, Judge Saldana served 4 years as an assistant U.S. \nattorney. She handled as many as 350 active Federal criminal cases a \nyear, ranging from immigration to narcotics to health care. It was in \nthis capacity that she was selected coordinator for Chief Judge George \nKazen. Before her work in the U.S. Attorney's Office, Judge Saldana \nspent time as a lawyer for the U.S. Department of Justice in the Civil \nRights Division and the U.S. Department of Agriculture in the General \nCounsel's Office. She also served as a law clerk to Judge Kazen in the \nSouthern District of Texas.\n  Judge Saldana has been admitted to practice before the U.S. Southern \nDistrict of Texas Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and the U.S. Supreme \nCourt. Judge Saldana has good professional experience, and she is well \nrespected in the South Texas community. The American Bar Association \ngave her a unanimous ``well qualified'' rating, and I believe she will \nbe an effective Federal judge in South Texas.\n  In September, I introduced Judge Saldana before the Judiciary \nCommittee, and today I urge my colleagues in the Senate to support her \nnomination and confirm her as a Federal judge for the Southern District \nin Laredo, TX.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I wish to join my colleague, Senator \nHutchison, in commending to our colleagues the nomination of Judge \nDiana Saldana of Laredo, TX, who has been nominated, as we have heard, \nto be a U.S. district judge in the Southern District of Texas. This is \na busy docket, as one can imagine, being right on the U.S.-Mexico \nborder, with the unfortunate drug-trafficking and immigration-related \ncases and the like. So this is a very important nomination. I hope my \ncolleagues will join us in confirming her nomination.\n  Senator Hutchison and I, as do many Senators, have a bipartisan \ncommittee of lawyers in the State--people who are very respected in the \nlegal community who screen the people who apply for these positions, \nrecognizing the importance of them and that they are lifetime \nappointments. We do our very best to make this a depoliticized process, \nbelieving that whether one is a good judge doesn't depend on whether \none is a Republican or an Independent or Democrat as long as one is \nalways willing to enforce the law and not impose one's own personal \nbeliefs or any other type of agenda.\n  Diana Saldana really represents the manifestation of the American \ndream. I had the opportunity to introduce her at the hearing she had \nbefore the Judiciary Committee, along with her wonderful family. \nThroughout the process, the more I learned about Diana's personal \nstory, the more I grew to admire not only all she has accomplished but \nwhat she stands for in terms of our national guarantee that if you come \nto America, if you work hard, if you make the most of your God-given \ngifts, you can achieve anything. Judge Saldana represents that dream.\n  At the age of 10, she began traveling with her parents and siblings \nfrom her home in Carrizo Springs to Minnesota and North Dakota to work \nas migrant farmers in the soybean, sugar beet, and potato fields. \nBecause of the seasonal nature of migrant farm work, Diana and her \nsiblings would often leave South Texas before the school year ended and \nreturn after the next school year had begun. Of course, one can imagine \nhow tough that is on a young student. She traveled 1,500 miles north \nand worked with her family in the fields every summer through high \nschool and college, and she even worked in the fields during her first \nyear of law school as well.\n  Despite these challenges, Diana rose to the occasion, and she \nsucceeded in becoming the first person in her family to get a college \ndegree. She recalls that while working as a migrant farmer, her mother \ntold her that an education was the only way out of doing manual labor, \nand indeed she learned that lesson very well.\n  She was once asked what person had the greatest impact on her, and \nshe said, as many of us might answer, her mother. She said:\n\n       My mother has a third grade education, but she was able to \n     raise six children by working hard and having a deep faith in \n     God . . . I remember her working up to three jobs at a time, \n     taking naps in the family car, when our finances were \n     especially tight, to make ends meet . . . My mother instilled \n     in us a strong work ethic and encouraged us to dream for a \n     better life.\n\n  Today, Judge Saldana doesn't just receive the gifts she has gotten as \nbeing the child of a hard-working and dedicated and sacrificing mother, \nshe has turned it around and become a mentor to young people herself, \nusing her own story as an inspiration to others and saying: If I worked \nhard and I was successful, you can, too, even as improbable as that may \nseem at the time.\n  I could go on and on about Judge Saldana because her life story is \ntruly remarkable and quite an inspiration, but I will conclude with \nthis: Diana Saldana has been nominated to fill the vacancy left by her \nown mentor, Judge George Kazen, who is taking senior status. Judge \nKazen knows Diana better than just about anybody, other than her \nfamily. She served as his law clerk, appeared before him as a Federal \nprosecutor, and presided over many cases as a Federal magistrate judge. \nJudge Kazen described Diana as ``one of the finest law clerks'' he ever \nhad and a ``tough, no-nonsense prosecutor.'' He called her the \n``quintessential judge--intelligent, hard-working, fair, honest, and \ndecisive.'' Finally, Judge Kazen told us it would be his ``personal \nhonor'' if Judge Saldana was confirmed as his successor. I can't think \nof any higher praise.\n  In just a few minutes, the Senate will confirm Diana Saldana as a \nU.S. district judge for the Southern District of Texas. I know I speak \nfor many Texans when I say we could not be more proud.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, on the floor tonight we have three very \ndistinguished individuals whom President Obama has nominated to be \nFederal judges. I commend the committee for bringing them forward and \nSenator Leahy for his tremendous ongoing leadership on the Judiciary \nCommittee. I know, as my colleagues from Texas have indicated, these \nare extremely competent individuals. All three of them were reported \nout of the Judiciary Committee with unanimous approval. In light of the \ncurrent judicial emergencies, I urge my colleagues to confirm them this \nevening.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time used during the \nquorum call be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S599]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in addition to my support for Judge \nSaldana and Mr. Holmes, I rise in support of Marco A. Hernandez to be \nU.S. district judge for the District of Oregon.\n  I am pleased the Senate is finally turning to this nomination. This \nis the third Congress to consider Mr. Hernandez's nomination. President \nBush nominated Judge Hernandez to this seat in the 110th Congress. \nUnfortunately, his nomination stalled in the Judiciary Committee, \nalthough he had the full support of every Republican on the committee. \nAfter pending for over 5 months with no action, his nomination, at that \ntime, was returned to the President.\n  This vacancy has been designated a judicial emergency. Therefore, I \nwould have expected his nomination to have been made very early in the \n111th Congress. However, it was not sent to the Senate until July of \nlast year. Because of that delayed nomination, the Senate was unable to \ncomplete action on the nomination in that Congress. At the close of the \n111th Congress, the nomination was again returned to the President.\n  Mr. Hernandez has been rated ``qualified'' by the American Bar \nAssociation. He received his B.A. from Western Oregon State College and \nhis J.D. from the University of Washington School of Law.\n  After graduating from law school, he served as an attorney for Oregon \nLegal Services, where he represented migrant farmworkers. He later \njoined the Washington County district attorney's office as a deputy \ndistrict attorney.\n  Mr. Hernandez is a fine nominee under President Bush's standards but \nalso a fine nominee under President Obama's standards. I am pleased \nthis nomination is finally before the Senate. I am, however, \ndisappointed that we have a vacancy that could have been filled over 2 \nyears ago. With our vote today, the President can fill this judicial \nemergency seat with a qualified nominee.\n  Mr. President, I also support the nomination of Diana Saldana to be a \nU.S. district judge for the Southern District of Texas. She has the \nsupport of both home State Senators who spoke very highly of her at her \nSeptember 29, 2010, nomination hearing.\n  Judge Saldana received a BA in history and in government from the \nUniversity of Texas. She received her JD from the University of Texas \nSchool of Law. Upon graduation, she clerked for the Honorable George \nKazen.\n  She has had a very successful career. Judge Saldana has been a staff \nattorney in the Civil Rights Division at the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture, a trial attorney with the Department of Justice, and \nserved as an assistant U.S. attorney in the Southern District of Texas. \nShe was appointed to be a U.S. magistrate judge in 2006.\n  Judge Saldana was nominated by the President on July 14, 2010. She \nwas rated unanimously well qualified by the American Bar Association.\n  I am pleased to support Judge Saldana's nomination to this very \nimportant seat. Not only has it been deemed to be a judicial emergency \nbut it is also the seat to which her mentor, Judge Kazen, previously \noccupied.\n  Mr. President, I also support Paul Kinloch Holmes III, a nominee to \nbe a U.S. district judge for the Western District of Arkansas. A \ngraduate of Westminster College and the University of Arkansas School \nof Law, Mr. Holmes has been rated unanimously well qualified by the \nAmerican Bar Association.\n  After graduating from law school, Mr. Holmes became an associate at \nthe law firm of Warner & Smith, a firm that focused on general civil \npractice. On August 6, 1993, President Clinton nominated him to be the \nU.S. attorney for the Western District of Arkansas. The Senate \nconfirmed his nomination shortly after, and he served his role with \ndistinction until 2001. Since then, Mr. Holmes has been in private \npractice handling both criminal and civil litigation.\n  Again, I am pleased to support the nomination of Mr. Holmes to this \nseat that has been deemed a judicial emergency.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise to also support the nomination of \nJudge Marco Hernandez of Oregon to the U.S. district court. Judge \nHernandez is unquestionably qualified to serve on this court. He has \nbuilt his career through hard work and determination.\n  As a young man, he attended night classes at a local community \ncollege before enrolling at Western Oregon State College. He then \nproceeded to get a law degree at the University of Washington School of \nLaw.\n  As a young man, he picked crops. After he graduated from law school \nat the University of Washington, he returned to Oregon to join Legal \nAid Services and represent farm workers. He went on to serve as deputy \ndistrict attorney in Washington County and was later appointed to be a \nState court judge, a position he has held since 1995.\n  As a State court judge, he established an innovative domestic \nviolence program designed to aggressively pursue offenders. He also \nestablished a new program to assist mentally ill defendants, a program \nhe continues to oversee.\n  Judge Hernandez was first nominated to the district court by \nPresident Bush in 2008. Although Congress did not act on his \nnomination, he has again been nominated by President Obama and has the \nsupport of Republicans, Democrats, and organizations representing the \nspectrum of the legal community.\n  He also has strong support from the Hispanic National Bar Association \nand, if confirmed, will be the first Hispanic article III judge in the \nState of Oregon.\n  I urge my colleagues to support Judge Hernandez's confirmation. I \nlook forward to his contributions, based on the depth and breadth of \nhis life experience, to the U.S. district court.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all time \nbe yielded back so we can proceed to our votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, all time having been yielded back, the \nnomination of Marco A. Hernandez is confirmed.\n  The Senate will proceed to vote on the nomination of Diana Saldana to \nbe U.S. district judge for the Southern District of Texas.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Diana Saldana, of Texas, to be United States District Judge for the \nSouthern District of Texas?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKerry), the Senator from Wisconsin (Mr. Kohl), the Senator from New \nJersey (Mr. Lautenberg), the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Lieberman), \nand the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Menendez) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from New \nJersey (Mr. Lautenberg) would vote ``yea.''\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Tennessee (Mr. Alexander).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Tennessee (Mr. \nAlexander) would have voted ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We will terminate before 11 o'clock, so we \nwill have a vote around 10 o'clock, 10:15 in the morning--maybe two--on \nthe FAA bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, is there time for the Senator form Arkansas \nif he wants it? I request 2 minutes equally divided on the Arkansas \nnomination, and I yield my time to the senior Senator from Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise today to support the nomination of \nPaul K. Holmes--in Arkansas we call him P.K. Holmes--for the district \ncourt judgeship in western Arkansas. A lot of times when you stand here \nat this moment in a nomination, it is like making a closing argument. \nBut in this particular case there is no argument; everybody is for him. \nThe American Bar Association, Democrats, Republicans, plaintiffs, \ndefendants, everybody in Arkansas is for him.\n  He has been an Arkansas Lawyer of the Year. He has been the Western \nDistrict U.S. Attorney. He is a partner in Warner, Smith and Harris. P. \nK. Holmes has an outstanding record and outstanding reputation. He \nlikes to talk about the fact that he has a small town general practice, \nand that is true. He has handled a little bit of everything, but he has \nalways done it with integrity. He has an outstanding reputation in \nArkansas as a lawyer and a great member of the community.\n  I would hope all of my colleagues support this nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). All time is yielded back.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Paul Kinloch Holmes III, of Arkansas, to be U.S. district judge for \nthe Western District of Arkansas?\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, last December I came to the floor to \ndiscuss the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee \ninvestigation into for-profit online colleges and universities. It is \nan investigation that has now been going on for almost a year, and it \nis an investigation with profound consequences for taxpayers.\n  For-profit colleges, mostly online, receive more than $26 billion in \nFederal student aid each year. While some of these schools may be doing \na good job, taxpayers deserve to know that their education dollars are \nbeing well spent. It is also an investigation with profound \nconsequences for students.\n  According to data released last week by the Department of Education, \n25 percent of for-profit college student loan borrowers default within \n3 years of leaving school. One out of every four student loan borrowers \nwho go to these for-profit schools defaults within 3 years of leaving \nschool.\n  For-profit colleges have correctly pointed out that they educate a \ndisproportionate number of low-income and minority students. They argue \nthat if they were not doing a good job, students would not continue to \nenroll. How, then, is it possible that schools with very high rates of \nwithdrawal, high rates of loan debt, and high rates of default continue \nto enroll more and more students each year? The answer, according to my \ncommittee's investigation, lies in the enormous expenditure of money \nand effort that the for-profit colleges put into their recruitment \nprocess.\n  There have been many stories about abusive recruitment practices in \nnewspapers and television programs across the country. Last August, the \nGovernment Accountability Office documented many of those abuses in \nundercover videos presented at a HELP Committee hearing. The industry \nargued that these misleading and deceptive practices were the work of a \nfew rogue actors, but the overwhelming evidence of misleading, \ndeceptive, and even fraudulent conduct documented by GAO cannot be \nattributed to anything but a systemic effort to enroll students at any \ncost.\n  For anyone who questions that this is a systemic effort to pressure, \ndeceive, and mislead, I wish to take a few minutes to explore the \ndetails of the training practices that led directly to the GAO \nfindings. I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and on both \nsides of the Capitol find this a useful window into the training \ntactics used by these companies.\n\n[[Page S601]]\n\n  One of the most common words in the proprietary school industry's \nrecruiting documents is the word ``pain.'' It is not the first word \nthat might come to one's mind if they think about enrolling in college. \nYou might think of your son or daughter enrolling in college. You \nwouldn't think of ``pain'' as the first word. However, perhaps nothing \nworthwhile was ever accomplished without effort, so you might be \nthinking that schools are talking about preparing students for the hard \nwork and the pain of excelling in college. The reality is quite the \nopposite. Proprietary higher education companies want to make college \nseem easy. The reason they are focusing on pain is to try to get \nstudents to enroll.\n  Consider this quote from a memo written by the director of \nrecruitment at a campus of ITT, one of the largest of the for-profit \nschools. After falling short of the required quota of ``starts''--that \nis the industry term for new students--the recruiter writes:\n\n       The department needs to focus on the selling of the \n     appointment by digging in and getting to the pain of each and \n     every prospective student. By getting to the pain, the \n     representatives will be able to solidify the appointments and \n     have a better show rate for the actual conducts.\n       Another example from an ITT document about what recruiters \n     should do to keep students in class, reading now from one \n     which I will include for the record, says:\n       Remind them of what things will be like if they don't \n     continue forward and earn their degrees. Poke the pain a bit \n     and remind them who else is depending on them and their \n     commitment to a better future.\n\n  In their training, ITT went beyond rhetoric and created what they \ncalled a ``pain fund.'' It is probably hard to see this piece of paper. \nI will try to get this included in the Record. It is a picture of a \nfunnel, and it is called the ``pain funnel and pain puzzle.'' It \nillustrates four levels of pain, with questions that are supposed to \nget progressively more hurtful to the prospective student.\n  Level one starts off with questions such as, tell me more about that; \ncan you be more specific; how long has it been a problem? Level two: \nWhat have you tried to do about that? What have you done to fix it? \nLevel three pain: How do you feel about that? Then it gets down to \nlevel four. The recruiter is asking questions such as, have you given \nup trying to deal with the problem?\n  A different document from ITT goes to the same levels of pain. The \nlevel four question is, once again, what are you willing to change now \nor have you given up trying to deal with the problem?\n  What is the problem? The problem is, this young person is out of \nwork. They have no future. They probably have a high school degree, \nmaybe a D average in high school, C average at the most. They have \nanswered an ad. The recruiter is talking to them, and they are stoking \nthe pain.\n  The last thing they say is, OK, what are you willing to do to change \nit or are you just going to give up on it? That is a question I would \nlike to ask the executives who believe that preying on past failures is \na sound method for enrolling students or a reasonable way to run a \ncollege.\n  According to the Department of Education, 30 percent of student loan \nborrowers at ITT, the one I just quoted, default within 3 years of \nleaving school, and most of them leave before they ever get any kind of \ndegree. They are there for a few weeks, maybe a few months, but when \nthey drop out and when they default, ITT keeps the money.\n  Kaplan University also encourages its recruiters to focus on pain and \nfear. In a page from a manual dated July 8, 2009, with side notes about \n``advisor call control'' and maintaining ``rapport with PROSPECT,'' the \ndocument is similar to ITT's, with questions to ``uncover the pain and \nfear''--``uncover the pain and fear.'' At the bottom: ``It is all about \nuncovering their pain and fears,'' underlined. ``Once they are reminded \nof how bad things are, this will create a sense of urgency to make this \nchange.'' Sixteen pages of sales tactics later the recruiter is taught \nto ``restate back word for word, the better you restate the brighter \nthe dream.''\n  Another Kaplan document says, ``Keep digging until you uncover their \npain, fears and dreams. . . . '' If you get the prospect to think about \nhow tough their situation is right now and if they discuss the life \nthey can't give their family because they don't have a degree, you will \ndramatically increase your chances of gaining a commitment from the \nstudent. ``Get to their emotions and you will create the urgency!'' \n``Get to their emotions and you will create the urgency!'' Is that the \nway we ought to be enticing young people to go to school? Stoke the \npain, stoke the fear?\n  Again, according to the Department of Education, 30 percent of \nstudent loan borrowers at Kaplan default within 3 years of leaving \nschool. And, guess what, Kaplan keeps the money.\n  Let me cite just one more example--Corinthian Colleges. At \nCorinthian, recruiters are taught to convince students that their lives \nare bad and can be improved only by enrolling in the school. As a \nformer recruiter, Mr. Shayler White testified in a lawsuit filed \nagainst Corinthian by ex-students: ``The ultimate goal was to \nessentially make [prospective students] wallow in their grief, feel \nthat pain of having accomplished nothing in life, and then use that \npain'' to pressure them to enroll.\n  I have focused on the blatant exploitation of pain to demonstrate the \nterrible cynicism that pervades these companies, but the schools' \nrecruiting documents also are ripe with misrepresentations.\n  From a brochure for Ashford University, owned by Bridgepoint, it says \nit was ``established in 1918,'' a ``traditional 4-year campus with \nsports teams, dormitories, regionally accredited since 1950--what this \nmeans to you is that your degree will be recognized both professionally \nand academically.'' That is from Bridgepoint, Ashford University. Well, \nwhat it does not tell you is that up until 2005, Ashford was a small \nreligious school with 350 students. They were purchased by Bridgepoint \nand renamed ``Ashford.'' So 350 students at the end of 2005, and today \nthey have 70,000 online students, with astronomical dropout rates. And \n67 percent of Bridgepoint is owned by investment bank and private \nequity fund Warburg Pincus. Think about that--a private equity firm \nowns Bridgepoint. They buy a small religious school, with 350 students. \nThey put out these things: You can go to this school, with a great \ncampus and all that, but you are going to school online. Now they have \n70,000 students.\n  According to the Department of Education, 21 percent of student loan \nborrowers at Ashford's parent company Bridgepoint default within 3 \nyears of leaving school. That is a 17-percent increase in just 1 year.\n  The HELP Committee has heard testimony from experts in college \ncounseling. This testimony details the detrimental effects such overly \naggressive and misleading recruitment can have on the lives of \nstudents. When students are enrolled through deception or fear, they \nare less prepared to meet the challenges of college. Rather than \noffering students a better life, these types of strong-arm, emotionally \nabusive tactics are all too typical of schools that have little or no \ninterest in providing students the academic help and support they need \nfor the students to succeed.\n  Perhaps the attitude of these schools toward students is best exposed \nin a document provided by Vatterott, a privately held for-profit \nschool. Under the heading of ``Emotion,'' it notes that:\n\n       We deal with people that live in the moment and for the \n     moment.\n\n  That is whom they are going after.\n\n       Their decision to start, stay in school or quit school is \n     based more on emotion than logic.\n       Pain is the greater motivator in the short term.\n\n  Think about the schools you are familiar with in your own States, \nyour private, nonprofit schools, some religious based, then your public \nschools and your universities. Are they recruiting students like this? \nYou will not find this in any of them. They are not going after pain \nand fear; they are going after students to help and support them when \nthey go through school so they can have a better life.\n  Well, if this is the attitude--to stoke the fear and to stoke the \npain--if that is the attitude of these for-profit colleges, what does \nit say about its students' chances for success? Is it any wonder that \noutcomes are appalling and defaults are skyrocketing, accounting for \nnearly 47 percent of all student defaults?\n\n[[Page S602]]\n\n  Once again, I have to point out that the for-profit schools enroll \nabout 10 percent of higher education students in America, but they \naccount for 47 percent of the defaults--10 percent of the students, 47 \npercent of the defaults.\n  The bottom-line finding of my committee's investigation is that, No. \n1, these schools are very expensive; No. 2, they are exploitative; and \nNo. 3, these documents show they are focused on their own success--\npaying their shareholders if they are publicly held or paying back \ntheir equity investors if they are equity owned. They are not focused \non the success of their students.\n  The bottom line is that what we are confronting today with this \ntremendous explosion in for-profit schools, this tremendous explosion \nin their enrollment of students--as I said, Ashford in 2005, 350 \nstudents; today, 70,000 students--their tremendous churning of students \nthat is going on every year--this has a striking resemblance to the \nsubprime crisis that confronted America, a striking resemblance to the \nsubprime crisis.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the documents I referred \nto be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S603]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS07FE11.001\n\n\n\n[[Page S604]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS07FE11.002\n\n\n\n[[Page S605]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS07FE11.003\n\n\n\n[[Page S606]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS07FE11.004\n\n\n\n[[Page S607]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS07FE11.005\n\n\n\n[[Page S608]]\n\n  Mr. HARKIN.

Mr. President, I come today to the Senate floor as a \nphysician who has practiced medicine in Wyoming for a quarter of a \ncentury, taking care of the families of Wyoming, and to do what I have \ndone throughout the past year--provide a doctor's second opinion on \nthis health care law people across the country are now coming to grips \nwith as they finally are realizing what is in the bill or, as the \nformer Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, once said: First you have to \npass it before you get to find out what is in it.\n  People are finding out what is in it, and people all across the \ncountry are not happy. We know what the American people want. I know \nwhat the people of Wyoming want in terms of health care. They want the \ncare they need from the doctor they want at a cost they can afford. \nThat was the goal many of us had over a year ago when we started this \ndiscussion and debate on the Senate floor. What ultimately got passed--\nand many people believe crammed down the throats of the American \npeople--is now a health care law where people are at risk of losing \nwhat they want and what they have.\n  The promises made by the President are such that they have turned to \nbe, in many ways, unfulfilled. The President said this would actually \ndrive down the cost of care--the health care law--that insurance rates \nwould go down $2,500 per family. What people have seen all across the \ncountry is the cost of their health care insurance rates going up \ninstead of down. The President said: If you like the care you have, you \ncan keep it. Now we know that a majority of people who get their health \ninsurance through their work are not going to be able to keep the \ncoverage they have liked.\n  So I come to the floor with my colleague, Senator Graham, because we \nhave introduced a bill, S. 244, the State Health Care Choice Act, which \nallows States to make a decision to say: Is this something we want in \nour State?\n  I will turn to my colleague from South Carolina before getting into \nthe specifics. I know the Senator has visited with his Governor about \nthe concerns his Governor has, a newly elected Governor who has \nconcerns and actually addressed those concerns with the President about \nthe health care law and the mandates on the people of South Carolina.\n  So I would ask my friend and colleague, are there things we as a body \nought to be considering to make life easier for the people of his home \nState of South Carolina? And I can talk about things for Wyoming as \nwell.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes. If I may, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. No. 1, Senator Barrasso, who is an orthopedic surgeon, \nhas been a great addition to the Republican conference and to the \nSenate as a whole. He is a doctor and has practiced medicine longer \nthan he has been in politics, I am sure, and he sees this problem from \nthe physician's point of view, from the patient's point of view. And \nour Presiding Officer was recently a Governor.\n  Here is what my Governor is telling me: that Medicaid is a program \nthat needs to be reformed, not expanded the way we are doing it. The \nsecond largest expense to the State budget in South Carolina is \nMedicaid matching money.\n  For those who are home who may be watching, Medicaid is a program for \nlow-income Americans. It is a Federal program and a State program, but \nit is a Federal Government mandate that if you reach a certain income \nlevel, you are eligible for Medicaid services to be administered by the \nStates. But, quite frankly, the flexibility the States have is very \nlimited, and this bill, the Obama health care bill, expands Medicaid \neligibility to the point that 29 percent of the people in South \nCarolina would be Medicaid eligible.\n  Our State has an $850 million shortfall in our budget. I think \nWyoming is in pretty good shape, but I think we are probably closer to \nthe average State. We have had a dramatic decrease in revenues, and the \ncost of complying with the Medicaid expansion in this bill would be $1 \nbillion to a State that cannot afford it. I am sure West Virginia is \nvery similar.\n  So here is my commitment to the body. I would like to give the States \nan opportunity to speak as to whether they want the individual mandate, \nthe Medicaid expansion, and employer mandate that I think adds a lot of \ncost to businesses that will decrease job opportunities at a time when \nSouth Carolina needs every job it can get.\n  But one thing we could do by passing this legislation is get this \ndebate out of Washington, where everybody has kind of dug in their \nheels, and listen to the people. That is the one thing we have not been \nable to do.\n  This bill passed under the cover of darkness on Christmas Eve in a \nprocess that is not reflective of the hope and change we all would like \nto have. It was the worst of Washington. It is not as if the Republican \nParty has never, behind closed doors, passed bills on a party line. But \nwe are all trying to break that formula. And this bill passed on a \nparty-line vote on Christmas Eve. To get the 60th vote, quite frankly, \nwas unseemly.\n  So what I am hearing from my Governor is, please give me some relief \nfrom a Medicaid Program that is drowning my State.\n  So after this opportunity comes to take the debate to the State \nlevel, I would like to join with Senator Barrasso and the Presiding \nOfficer and anyone else in this body who wants to come up with a way to \nfix Medicaid before it bankrupts all the States.\n  So this opt-out approach I think would make the debate more \nmeaningful. It is not just about what people in Washington think; it is \nabout what America wants and what Americans think. The best way to get \ntheir opinion is to allow them to speak at the State level.\n  So if my colleagues on the other side believe this is a great bill, \nthen give other people a chance to validate what you think. We may be \nwrong. Senator Barrasso and I may be wrong. We may be hearing criticism \nfrom this bill that is very limited and unique to Wyoming and South \nCarolina. I don't think so, but we will never know if we don't give \npeople the chance to speak.\n  That is what this bill does. It allows States, if they choose, to opt \nout of the individual mandate and the employer mandate of Medicaid \nexpansion.\n\n[[Page S609]]\n\n  What is my colleague from Wyoming hearing about the effect of this \nbill on the State of Wyoming, and where do you think we should go as a \nnation?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. The people of Wyoming overwhelmingly want the \nopportunity to remove themselves from the heavy burden of the Obama-\npassed and supported health care law. There are huge expenses. The \nMedicaid mandate is huge.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, if I could interrupt and ask the Senator \nfrom Wyoming about waivers that have been given. Can the Senator tell \nus a little bit about the waivers that have been granted? Aren't we \nbasically allowing a State to request a waiver by our bill?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. We are doing exactly that. As of last week, the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services has given--just last week--500 \nnew waivers to allow individuals who get their insurance through work, \nand now a total of 729 waivers affecting 2.2 million people to opt \nout--individuals to opt out--of the specific requirement.\n  I think States ought to have the right to make decisions about the \nMedicaid mandate, about the individual mandate that requires everyone \nto buy government-approved health insurance. It is a mandate. Congress \nis telling people they have to buy government-approved health \ninsurance. I think it is unconstitutional. The Supreme Court will \nultimately decide. People will get penalized. There are going to be IRS \nagents checking to make sure people have this government-mandated and \ngovernment-approved health insurance. I think people ought to be able \nto--the State ought to decide if they are going to make every employer \nin the State--the business creators, the entities that hire people, the \nsmall businesses, the job creators--I think the State ought to have the \nright to make the decision to say, Are we going to make those \nemployers--force them--to provide government-approved health insurance.\n  It is a big cost for businesses that are trying to hire people. I \nthink States ought to be able to opt out of the benefit mandate which \ndefines how much insurance somebody has to have. Also, in many cases it \nis overinsurance--more than they need, more than they want, and more \nthan they can afford.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask the Senator, what percentage of the \nwaivers involve union plans?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Well, of the 2.2 million people who have gotten waivers \nby the Secretary of Health and Human Services--and, as I say, you need \nto have friends in high places if you want a waiver, because I know the \nsmall business owners in my State, and probably in the State of the \nSenator from South Carolina as well, couldn't get to the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services to get these waivers. But 860,000 waivers \nhave gone to members of 166 different unions' benefit programs. It is \ninteresting, because across the country unions have received 40 percent \nof the waivers, yet union members are only 7 percent of the workforce. \nSo it seems a disproportionate number of these waivers have been given \nto members of the unions.\n  What I find so intriguing is that these are the same people from the \nsame unions that lobbied so hard to get this health care law passed. \nNow that they know what is in it, they don't want it to apply to them. \nThat is a concern about which I think the American people will say, \nWell, if all of these different union members can get a waiver, why \ncan't I? Why can't States be able to opt out as well?\n  In a national poll last Friday, February 4, the majority of Americans \nsaid States ought to have the right to opt out of the health care law. \nA majority of Americans believe their State ought to have a right to \nopt out. We now know that seven states--Arizona, Georgia, Idaho, \nLouisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Virginia--have already passed laws \nor constitutional amendments making it illegal to force anyone to buy \nhealth insurance. Their State legislatures--to me, that is how I am \nreading it--say, we are going to opt out whether this law passes or \nnot.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, along that line, if I could pose a \nquestion to my colleague: How many States have joined the lawsuit \nsaying the individual mandate is unconstitutional, if the Senator knows \nthat number? The Senator just indicated how many States have passed \nState laws saying we shouldn't be required to comply with individual \nmandates.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Seven States have already passed laws or constitutional \namendments making it illegal to force someone to buy health insurance.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. How many States have joined the lawsuit?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Twenty-six States have joined the lawsuit, including my \nhome State of Wyoming which recently joined. New Governors have been \nelected and sworn into office in January, so five new States have \njoined the lawsuit, saying, This law isn't constitutional. People from \nCongress shouldn't be able to go into your home and make you buy a \ngovernment-approved product if you don't want to buy it. The background \nof the Senator from South Carolina is superior to mine in the legal \nfield or the courts, but it sure sounds to me as if rulings from \nVirginia and Florida uphold my firm belief that Congress can't make \npeople buy products.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. If I may, I think the Senator is going to find this case \ngoing to the Supreme Court in a year or two--the sooner the better, as \nfar as I am concerned. I don't know how the Court will rule, but I can \nunderstand why attorneys general would be arguing that requiring \nsomeone to do something to create activity is probably a real stretch \nof the commerce clause. Where does it end? There are two sides to that \nlegal coin.\n  My point is, I doubt if the attorneys general of these States, who \nare mostly elected--or I am sure all of them are elected--would be \nbringing a lawsuit to challenge the constitutionality if they believed \ntheir constituents were really for the bill. Does that make sense to my \ncolleague, that 26 attorneys general would be suing the Federal \nGovernment in court if they believed their own citizens felt as though \nthis were the right way to go?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I think the attorneys general are making decisions \nbased on what they believe is in the best interests of the citizens of \ntheir State, and they are saying, People of our State have rights, and \nwe have a Constitution, and that Constitution should trump the 2,700-\npage health care law.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, if I could make this point to my \ncolleague: No judge is going to ask the average person what they think, \nnor should they. This is a legal question. I don't know how it is going \nto come out. I think it is probably 50-50.\n  What we are doing differently, I say to my friend from Wyoming, is we \nare not saying we need to pass it all from Washington or repeal it all \nfrom Washington. We are saying: Allow people to comment on the product \nthat was created on a party-line vote on Christmas Eve, in an unseemly \nfashion, by allowing people at the State level, through their elected \nrepresentative, to have a say. That is different than a court \nchallenge. That is different than a Washington debate. Quite frankly, \nif we are going to turn one-fifth of the economy upside down, I think \nit would be very helpful to this country to involve our fellow \ncitizens.\n  This will be a constitutional academic decision made on the law. What \nwe are trying to do, I say to my good friend from Wyoming, is to take \nthe debate on health care to the State level so people can speak up \nbefore we lock the country into a plan that I think is going to ruin \nthe viability of the States' budgets by expanding Medicaid to 150 \npercent above poverty. Is that not the purpose, to give people the \nchance to speak as they have never had to this point?\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. What do people want? What do the States want? \nFlexibility, freedom, and choice. I know that is what people in Wyoming \nwant. We are rugged individuals who want flexibility, freedom, and \nchoice. I think every State ought to have the opportunity to make that \ndecision, and that is why this bill is on the floor of the Senate.\n  Last week I did vote to repeal the entire Obama health care law \nbecause I think it is bad for patients and providers--the nurses and \nthe doctors who take care of those patients--and I think it is bad for \nthe taxpayers. I think it will bankrupt the Nation. I think what is now \nhappening is it is also bankrupting the States. Governors, having to \ndeal with this Medicaid mandate, are realizing that to listen to \nWashington, they are going to\n\n[[Page S610]]\n\nhave to take money away from education. They are going to have to take \nmoney away from public services. They ought to have a right to make a \ndecision at the State level as to what they want to do, what laws ought \nto apply.\n  One size doesn't fit all. I know what works in Wyoming is not \nnecessarily what works in South Carolina or West Virginia and certainly \nmay not work in California or New York. That is why States ought to \nmake a decision about ways to help people in their own State get the \ncare they need from the doctors they want at prices they can afford. \nThis massive health care law does not accomplish that.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. One final question, and I do appreciate the Chair's \nindulgence. The whole idea of the status quo being acceptable is not \nwhat we are talking about. None of us believes the current health care \nsituation is sustainable. Medicare and Medicaid need to be reformed, \nbut so do private health care cost increases. There are monopolies out \nthere by insurance companies. To be able to buy across State lines \nmakes a lot of sense to me.\n  Briefly, if my colleague could, what does he see--I want to repeal \nthe bill, not just to maintain the status quo, but to replace it with a \nbipartisan product that does improve quality and lowers costs. Is that \nthe Senator's position, and how can we do that?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. There are things we mutually must do to make it easier \nand cheaper for people to get the health care they need, the doctors \nthey want, at the price they can afford. Number 1, as my colleague \nmentioned, make it legal for people to shop around and buy across State \nlines. We can't do that right now in this country. That in itself, as \nstudies show, would result in over 10 million Americans who don't have \ninsurance today getting insurance.\n  Most people get their insurance through work for the simple reason \nthat it is a tax deduction to the company they get their insurance \nthrough, but if they buy insurance personally, individually, they have \nto pay taxes on that money before they pay for the insurance. So I \nthink people who end up buying their health insurance individually \nought to get the same tax benefits as those who get it through work do. \nThat would make a big difference in bringing down the specific costs to \nthose folks.\n  I think we need to have incentives that help people actually stay \nhealthy. I ran a program in Wyoming. I was a volunteer at a program \ncalled the Wyoming Health Fairs, bringing low-cost health screenings to \npeople. I did health reports on television called ``Helping You Care \nFor Yourself,'' giving people information they could use to stay \nhealthy.\n  This health care law has money in it aimed at prevention, but it \nbasically has money for jungle gyms and street lamps and pathways, but \nactually no incentive to get somebody to get up and exercise and get \ntheir weight down and their cholesterol under control, their blood \npressure under control.\n  Then I think we have to do something about the lawsuit abuse out \nthere, which drives up the cost of care as doctors order tests not \nnecessarily to help the patient but to make sure they are not missing \nsome very rare condition, and that significantly adds to the cost of \ncare, in the billions and billions of dollars every year.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. On that note, I would say to the Presiding Officer and to \nmy friend from Wyoming, there seems to be a lot of ways to lower costs. \nThe status quo is not acceptable. The solution we have chosen in a very \npartisan way I think is going to drive up the budget deficit and \neventually lead to more people being in government-run health care at a \ntime when the government is broke and is, quite frankly, going to take \nthe State budget problems and make them unsustainable just by expanding \nMedicaid.\n  Our bill is pretty simple. If you think this is a very good idea, let \nit be tested by your Federal citizens through an opt-out provision. If \nyou think this is a bill that most people would opt out of if they \ncould on our side, give them a chance. The lawsuit is important, but \nthis is a decision the Nation needs to make, and the lawsuit is one way \nto approach this. But the best way to come up with health care \nsolutions is not going to court but having the Congress and the States \nand the people of America work together in a partnership. That is what \nwe have not been able to achieve--a partnership where we listen to the \nStates and the people, and from their input we pass laws in a \nbipartisan fashion.\n  That is what I hope will happen.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. That is why we come to the floor to discuss S. 244. The \ntitle is State Health Care Choice Act. That is what it truly is--State \nhealth care, and choice. It is a choice to be made by the States about \nhealth care because if the American people want anything, it is \nflexibility, freedom, and choice.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank my colleague. I have enjoyed the discussion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/07/senate-section/article/S610-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO MAJOR GENERAL THOMAS CUTLER\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, for the past 8 years, MG Thomas Cutler has \nbeen the leader of the Michigan National Guard. It has been my \nprivilege to work closely with him in his efforts to keep the Guard \nprepared for its missions at home and abroad. The people of Michigan \nhave benefitted greatly from his tireless efforts, and Americans and \npeople around the world have enjoyed the benefits of his leadership of \nthe men and women of the Michigan Guard who have served far from home.\n  General Cutler came to his position with extensive knowledge of the \nfull spectrum of the National Guard's operations, having served in \ncommand positions in Battle Creek, Alpena and at Selfridge Air National \nGuard Base, working not only with Air National Guard personnel but in \njoint operations as well.\n  Over his 8 years, he was an extraordinary advocate for improvements \nto the State's military infrastructure, improvements that made \nMichigan's people safer, served units from other States that use \nMichigan facilities for training, and contributed greatly to the \nwelfare of Guard members and their families. The list of ribbons we \nhave cut and of ground we have broken to modernize Michigan Guard \nfacilities is extensive, and the result is some of the most modern \nfacilities in the nation.\n  He also skillfully led Michigan through the implementation of the \n2005 round of base realignments and closures, helping to ensure that \nMichigan would maintain flying missions at two Air Guard bases and that \nthe Michigan Guard could continue to effectively fulfill its missions.\n  General Cutler has continually sought new opportunities for the men \nand women under his command. Most notably among these is the Michigan \nNational Guard's engagement with the armed forces of Latvia and now \nLiberia through the State Partnership Program. This program uses the \ncivil and military skills of the National Guard to aid the development \nof partner nation militaries while providing Guard personnel with \nunique opportunities to interact and build relationships with other \nmilitaries. Most important, General Cutler has focused on the people of \nthe Michigan National Guard--on its servicemembers and their families. \nHe has brought to his job a keen understanding of the challenges our \ncitizen-soldiers and airmen face, and the sacrifices of their families \nand communities.\n  On January 8, General Cutler left his position as adjutant general of \nthe Michigan National Guard. I salute General Cutler for his service to \nMichigan and the Nation. The men and women of the Michigan National \nGuard, who have so benefitted from his passion for the Guard, will long \nremember his service, and I shall look back on the many times we have \nbeen together as some of my best memories.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/07/senate-section/article/S610-2", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S610-S611]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                        specialist shawn a. muhr\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have the sad task today of paying \ntribute to Specialist Shawn A. Muhr of Coon Rapids, IA, who has fallen \nin the line of duty in Afghanistan. Specialist Muhr was serving with \nthe 546th Transportation Company, 264th Combat Sustainment Support \nBattalion, 82nd Sustainment Brigade out of Fort Bragg, NC. He was 26 \nyears old.\n  Shawn's family described him as ``a gentle person with an adventurous\n\n[[Page S611]]\n\nspirit.'' He is remembered fondly as a happy and generous individual, \nand I know his loss will be felt very keenly by all who knew him. My \nthoughts and prayers will be with his family at this time, including \nhis wife Winifred, his father David, and his mother Shirley as well as \nhis brother and sisters.\n  By all accounts, Specialist Muhr liked being in the Army and loved \nserving his country. He had previously served in Operation Iraqi \nFreedom as well as in South Korea and was serving his first tour in \nAfghanistan. What would we do without individuals like Shawn Muhr? \nThose young people who gladly serve their country, knowing the \nsacrifices they will be asked to make and the tremendous risk they \ntake, are the ultimate bulwark in defense of our freedom. Shawn Muhr \ntruly lived and died by the motto of the great State of Iowa, ``Our \nLiberties We Prize, Our Rights We Will Maintain.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/07/senate-section/article/S611-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S611]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   SUSQUEHANNA RIVER BASIN COMMISSION\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to commend and congratulate \nthe Susquehanna River Basin Commission, SRBC, in honor of their 40th \nanniversary. The Susquehanna River Basin Compact, which went into \neffect on January 23, 1971, brought together the Federal Government and \nthe States of New York, Pennsylvania, and Maryland to form the SRBC, \none of only two such Federal-interstate compact agencies in the Nation. \nThe mission of SRBC is to manage the water resources of the Susquehanna \nbasin under comprehensive planning principles, and to protect the \nChesapeake Bay, one of the world's most productive ecosystems. The \nSusquehanna is America's largest eastern river and supplies over half \nthe fresh water entering the Chesapeake Bay.\n  This unique partnership has resulted in numerous benefits for the \npeople of the basin, including the establishment of a basin-wide flood \nforecasting and warning system in one of America's most flood prone \nriver systems; the storage and release of water during low flow periods \nfrom federally operated reservoirs; the management of large scale \nwithdrawals and consumptive uses of water; and the monitoring of basin \nwater quality. Furthermore, SRBC's involvement in hydroelectric \nrelicensing has restored migratory fish runs, minimum flows, and \nimproved recreational facilities.\n  The Susquehanna Flood Forecast and Warning System, administered by \nthe National Weather Service, in cooperation with the U.S. Geological \nSurvey and the SRBC, provides timely warnings to residents of the \nSusquehanna River basin to reduce loss of life and property damage \nduring flood events. The funding I've helped to secure over the years \nsupports the flood warning infrastructure--a network of gauges, radar \nand computer technology--to provide advanced flood warning information \nto communities along the river.\n  The Susquehanna System is about saving lives and saving communities. \nI have seen firsthand not only what the warning system accomplishes, \nbut also its ongoing and compelling needs. This system has been \ncritical in protecting families and businesses during flooding that has \ndevastated communities along the east coast.\n  I extend my congratulations to the Susquehanna River Basin Commission \nfor its 40 years of water resources management excellence, and I will \ncontinue to work closely with the Commission on important water \nresource issues in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/07/senate-section/article/S611-2", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S611]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  REMEMBERING PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues from both \nsides of the aisle today to mark the 100th birthday of former President \nRonald Reagan.\n  It is fitting that this is a bipartisan tribute. After all, Reagan \nhad been a Democrat, then a Republican, in his political career, and he \ntransformed the political landscape for both parties by appealing to a \nbroad cross-section of Americans.\n  Much has been written about President Reagan's life. His story is \nwell-known, and is a classic tale of the American dream--a boy from the \nNation's heartland makes good.\n  And Ronald Reagan was a surprising man, a man of paradoxes: An actor \naffectionately remembered by a generation of Americans for his \nauthenticity, a former union leader who fired striking union members, \nand the oldest president who was most popular among young Americans, \nmany of whom are in leadership positions today, and some of whom are in \nthis very Chamber.\n  But what I would like to focus on in my time here today is the part \nof Reagan that is still with us today: his legacy.\n  One of the most frequently cited achievements of Ronald Reagan is \nending the Cold War.\n  Behind his eloquence and warmth was a steeliness that sent a clear \nmessage to Moscow: You cannot hope to compete with us. We will beat \nyou.\n  And so we did. Thanks to Reagan's steadfastness and the rise of a \nSoviet leader who recognized America's toughness under Reagan's \nleadership, the Iron Curtain ultimately clanged into a pile of rubble.\n  Reagan also gave birth to the Republican Party that those of us on \nthis side of the aisle belong to today.\n  Thanks to Reagan's efforts to broaden the tent of the Republican \nParty, for the first time in many years, scores of religious, socially \nconservative Americans finally found a political home.\n  His became a party of pro-military, pro-business, pro-small-\ngovernment, anti-tax, anti-Communist Americans. And while communism \nworldwide has been largely designated to oblivion, Reagan's legacy of \ntax-cutting, smaller government, personal responsibility and fewer \nonerous regulations from Washington have stood the test of time and \napproval from the American people.\n  Reagan's most lasting legacy, however, may be his innate optimism.\n  When he took office, America had suffered the indignity of Watergate, \nhigh gas prices and long lines at the pumps, a 21-percent inflation \nrate and the taking of 52 of our citizens from America's own embassy in \nTehran, Iran. We were a deflated Nation.\n  But Reagan, in many ways through the sheer force of his personality, \ngave Americans hope, gave us the urge to dare to dream, and the \nconfidence to be great again. When he told us it was morning again in \nAmerica, we believed him. And it was.\n  When Reagan was born on February 6, 1911, the airplane had only been \ninvented 8 years earlier. The horrors of World War I, the Great War \nthat helped spawn the modern Soviet Union, were still several years \naway and Teddy Roosevelt had been out of the White House for just 2 \nyears.\n  How fitting that Reagan's lifetime and legacy would book-end such \nadvances in technology, foreign policy and even his own Republican \nParty.\n  That includes the space flight that helped America surpass its Soviet \nrivals and his words of consolation to a grieving Nation when the Space \nShuttle Challenger disintegrated. And outlasting the Soviet Union after \na lifetime of opposition. And becoming a worthy successor to Roosevelt \nas an optimistic Republican leader who left a lasting imprint on a \nchanging Nation.\n  As usual, Reagan put it best when he told us, ``America's best days \nlie ahead. You ain't seen nothing yet.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/07/senate-section/article/S611-3", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S611-S612]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BLACK HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, to commemorate February 2011 as Black \nHistory Month, I would like to acknowledge the contributions of African \nAmericans to the cultural, technological, and social evolution of our \nNation and American democracy.\n  Each year, the Association for the Study of African American Life and \nHistory sponsors Black History Month in February because two great men \nof historical significance were born in this month: Abraham Lincoln, \nthe 16th President of the United States, and Frederick Douglass, a \nnoted Black social reformer and abolitionist. Their actions greatly \nforwarded the cause of equality for all African Americans.\n  Given the association has chosen ``African Americans and the Civil \nWar'' as their 2011 theme, it seems fitting to briefly contemplate \ninitiatives of these two reformers who are from that era.\n  President Lincoln is forever linked to the momentous Emancipation \nProclamation in 1863 which 3.1 million slaves\n\n[[Page S612]]\n\nliving in States that were in rebellion against the Union were declared \n``forever free'' and also allowed to join the military. The year \nbefore, Mr. Lincoln abetted the cause of freedom by forbidding Army \nofficers from returning fugitive slaves and signed a law declaring the \nFederal Government would compensate slave owners who freed their \nslaves.\n  Frederick Douglass escaped slavery and became a leader of the \nabolitionist movement. He was a great orator and writer and after the \nwar he was involved in Reconstruction efforts. His energies were \ndevoted to helping America truly become a place where all citizens \nenjoyed liberty. Mr. Douglass once said, ``I would unite with anybody \nto do right and with nobody to do wrong.''\n  In observing Black History month, it would be impossible to author an \nexhaustive list of all influential African Americans. Yet one such \nindividual in recent history stands out: Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. In \nJanuary, we celebrated his achievement of peaceful protest in \nfurthering civil rights for minorities. Dr. King's accomplishments \nrepresent but a fraction of the positive impact African Americans have \nhad on our society.\n  I also note the United Nations has proclaimed 2011 the International \nYear for People of African Descent. Their resolution calls for \nworldwide cooperation to further their full enjoyment of economic, \ncultural, social, civil and political rights, participation in \npolitical, economic, social and cultural aspects of society and \npromotion of a greater knowledge of and respect for their diverse \nheritage and culture.\n  I agree with these sentiments and urge Americans to continue to \nfulfill the potential of promise that our Nation offers everyone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/07/senate-section/article/S612-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S612]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      CLACKAMAS COMMUNITY COLLEGE\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am proud that my home State of \nOregon has so many citizen soldiers and even prouder of the way we take \ncare of them. In the world of veterans' services, one real shining \nlight is Clackamas Community College. I am delighted today to take this \nopportunity to recognize Clackamas Community College for being selected \nto receive the Patriotic Employer Award from the National Committee for \nEmployer Support of the Guard and Reserve, ESGR. Clackamas Community \nCollege sets an extraordinary example in its care of our nation's \nveterans that I would hope every institution of higher learning could \nfollow. Clackamas Community College doesn't just stop at educating its \nstudents. It serves every member of its community, especially its \nveterans.\n  When servicemembers come back from the war zone, it takes some \nadjusting to get back to the routine of life they left behind when they \nwent to serve. As anyone who has gone to college knows, just signing up \nfor classes or applying for student aid can be a confusing experience \nlet alone when you have been out of the university atmosphere for a \nwhile, fighting in battle. Clackamas Community College knows that. That \nis why it created a Veterans Education and Training--VET--Center to \nserve as a one-stop shop for students who are veterans. The VET \nCenter's staff knows the ins and outs of veterans' education benefits, \nfinancial aid and every other veterans' resource and program.\n  The VET Center is also there for student veterans who have a hard \ntime adjusting to being back in school after they have been deployed. \nThe center serves as a safe haven for the veterans to talk things out \nand get help with problems only another veteran can understand. A \nveterans' club regularly meets at the VET Center to provide support and \ncamaraderie for the folks they see as family--other vets.\n  Clackamas Community College also pays the VET Center staff to train \ncollege staff and faculty about issues that confront student veterans \nso they are ready when called upon to help. This helps create a \ntremendously supportive environment campuswide.\n  Through the VET Center, Clackamas Community College works to \neliminate obstacles in the admissions process while making every effort \nto help veterans earn education credit for their military service and \nexperience.\n  Clackamas Community College also recently joined with the Army \nReserves to open an Army Strong Community Center--ASCC--on campus. This \ncenter, which connects military members and their families with support \nresources in the community, is the first ASCC west of the Mississippi \nRiver.\n  But Clackamas Community College does even more. As a leader in its \ncommunity, it continues its veterans' outreach outside the campus \nboundaries. When nearly 1,500 Oregon National Guard soldiers were \ndeployed to Iraq, the college sponsored two Oregon National Guard \nfamily reunions to support the families of deployed 41st Brigade \nsoldiers. The college also hosted two yellow-ribbon reintegration \nevents that touched the lives of more than 3,800 soldiers and their \nfamilies.\n  When the college hosted a veterans job fair last year, they went \nabove and beyond the call of duty to host the largest single veterans' \njob fair in the State. The college found room for 104 employers that \nwere eager to hire veterans, 106 veterans' services providers and more \nthan 3,100 veterans. The logistics were incredible, and they handled \nthem with ease, even providing lunch and entertainment for the \nveterans' families while the veterans job-hunted.\n  In recognition of their ongoing efforts, Clackamas Community College \nwas one of 20 colleges and universities to receive a $100,000 grant to \nserve military veterans from the Wal-Mart Foundation and the American \nCouncil on Education. Clackamas Community College used the funds to \nfurther their efforts to help veterans transition from military service \nto college.\n  As an Oregonian and as their Senator, I could not be more proud of \nClackamas Community College, its president, Joanne Truesdell, and the \nheroes they serve. Our citizen soldiers answer the call of our country \nevery day, and Clackamas Community College returns the favor when they \ncome home. It is my honor to thank them for their support of Oregon's \nveterans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/07/senate-section/article/S612-2", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S612]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/07/senate-section/article/S612-3", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S612]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/07/senate-section/article/S612-4", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S612]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MEASURES DISCHARGED\n\n  The following bill was discharged from the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions, and referred as indicated:\n\n       S. 248.

A bill to modify the authority to use Cooperative Threat \nReduction funds for proliferation threat reduction projects and \nactivities outside the states of the former Soviet Union; to the \nCommittee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today I introduce the Nunn-Lugar Global \nCooperative Threat Reduction Improvement Act of 2011.\n  For many years, I have labored to ensure that the global Nunn-Lugar \nprogram has the flexibility it needs. Now that the global Nunn-Lugar \nprogram has begun to undertake important biological threat reduction \ncampaigns in Africa and other regions, I believe the need has arisen to \nreexamine the authorities we have provided to the program to ensure \nthat it can effectively implement projects around the globe. These \nprojects protect the American people from nuclear, chemical and \nbiological proliferation.\n  The record of the global Nunn-Lugar program has been impressive. The \nresults now total: 7,599 strategic nuclear warheads deactivated; 791 \nintercontinental ballistic missiles, ICBMs, destroyed; 498 ICBM silos \neliminated; 180\n\n[[Page S616]]\n\nICBM mobile launchers destroyed; 669 submarine launched ballistic \nmissiles, SLBMs, eliminated; 492 SLBM launchers eliminated; 32 nuclear \nsubmarines capable of launching ballistic missiles destroyed; 155 \nbombers eliminated; 906 nuclear air-to-surface missiles, ASMs, \ndestroyed; 194 nuclear test tunnels eliminated; and 507 nuclear weapons \ntransport train shipments secured. We have also upgraded security at 24 \nnuclear weapons storage sites; built and equipped 20 biological \nmonitoring stations; and neutralized 1,742 metric tons of Russian and \nAlbanian chemical weapons agent.\n  In addition to authorities to operate worldwide, the global Nunn-\nLugar program has been granted much needed flexibility in carrying out \nits mission. The global Nunn-Lugar program has been granted \nnotwithstanding authority to spend up to 10 percent of annual program \nfunds notwithstanding any other provision of law. The Secretary of \nDefense has the authority to accept funds from foreign governments and \nother entities to contribute to activities carried out under the global \nNunn-Lugar program.\n  This flexibility came after more than a decade of work to eliminate \nannual certifications on global Nunn-Lugar assistance that hampered the \nability of the United States to use the global Nunn-Lugar program \nquickly and effectively. The certification and waiver processes \nconsumed hundreds of man-hours of work by the State Department, the \nIntelligence Community, the Pentagon, as well as other departments and \nagencies. I argued that this time could be better spent tackling the \nproliferation threats facing our country. Former Under Secretary of \nState Bob Joseph noted during his confirmation process that, at the \ntime, more than a dozen individual steps were required in the State \nDepartment alone to complete these annual certifications and waivers. \nAfter a strong vote in the Senate, Congress eliminated these annual \ncertifications.\n\n  In 2003, I sought authority to use Nunn-Lugar funds outside states of \nthe former Soviet Union. This was favored by the Bush administration. \nThe National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2004, as amended \nby the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2008, \nprovides that the Secretary of Defense may spend Nunn-Lugar/Cooperative \nThreat Reduction funds for a proliferation threat reduction project or \nactivity outside the states of the former Soviet Union if the Secretary \nof Defense, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State, determines \nthat such projects or activities will assist the United States in the \nresolution of a critical emerging proliferation threat or permit the \nUnited States to take advantage of opportunities to achieve long-\nstanding nonproliferation goals. The law specifies that the Secretary \nof Defense may not obligate funds for projects or activities until the \nSecretary of State concurs in a determination regarding these projects \nand activities and in notifying Congress. The Secretary of State is \nalso involved in subsequent steps before the global Nunn-Lugar program \ncan put boots on the ground.\n  Unfortunately, the State Department has not been efficient in \ncarrying out concurrences required by existing law. It is troubling \nthat, after eliminating the lengthy certification processes of the \n1990s, equally burdensome and ultimately un-executable interagency \nconcurrence, determination and notification processes for the global \nNunn-Lugar program are limiting accomplishments.\n  The bill I introduce today remedies this situation by providing that \nthe Secretary of Defense be given sole authority regarding global Nunn-\nLugar funds--to include making all relevant determinations and \nnotifications to Congress. Originally, this authority had been given to \nthe President. I worked to delegate it to the Secretary of Defense. \nWhen it was given by Congress to the Secretary of Defense, State \nDepartment officials insisted they had a role in the process. We have \nnow had time to observe how this works in practice, and the result is \nclear: it does not function in a manner consistent with the intent of \nlaw. Congress clearly intended that efficiency and immediacy accompany \nthis authority.\n  I do not believe that reserving this authority to the Secretary of \nDefense means that the State Department does not play a role in other \nefforts; however, in the reorganized non-proliferation and arms control \nbureaus who oversee these matters within the State Department, as well \nas in its regional bureaus, it is the case that simply adding \nbureaucratic boxes to check has had little positive result. Too often, \nbureaucratic politics and inertia have intervened to prevent timely \nsuccess.\n  We must work to ensure that our implementers have the tools and \nauthorities they need to perform their missions in the Defense \nDepartment. It is to this end that I offer this simple bill. I look \nforward to working with Chairman Levin and Ranking Member McCain on the \nArmed Services Committee on this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 297. A bill to amend section 254 of the Communications Act of 1934 \nto provide that funds received as universal service contributions and \nthe universal service support programs established pursuant to that \nsection are not subject to certain provisions of title 31, United \nStates Code, commonly known as the Antideficiency Act; to the Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today, along with my colleague \nSenator Snowe of Maine, I am introducing legislation to exempt \nuniversal service contributions and the universal service support \nprograms from what is commonly referred to as the Antideficiency Act.\n  The Telecommunications Act of 1996 demonstrated our long-standing \ncommitment to ensuring the availability of telecommunications to all \nAmericans at reasonable prices. This concept known as universal service \nhas been the responsibility of the Federal Communications Commission, \nFCC, since its beginnings in 1934. As a result of the 1996 Act, the \nUniversal Service Fund, USF, was established in 1997. This fund is \nadministered by the Universal Service Administrative Company, USAC, \nwhose Board of Directors is appointed by the Chairman of the FCC.\n  USAC administers the High Cost, Low Income, Rural Health Care, and \nSchools and Libraries, E-rate, universal service programs. USAC makes \ncommitments, through letters, to schools for each school year under FCC \nrules, and it is obviously important these commitments be made before \nthe beginning of the school year to assist schools in their planning \nprocesses and achievement of educational goals. The letters of \ncommitment are based upon funds the USF is authorized to collect, and \nthe USF can adjust the contribution factor quarterly to ensure its \nreceipts.\n  While the USF receives no Federal monies, FCC staff directed USAC in \nlate September 2004 to treat E-rate and Rural Health Care commitment \nletters as government obligations subject to ADA requirements. Among \nthe ADA requirements is the demand for cash on hand to cover all \nobligations. This requirement disrupted the distribution of funds for \nfour months. Congress realized how ill-advised it is to subject these \nfunds to the ADA and enacted legislation to provide for a one-year \nexemption of the USF from the ADA, through December 31, 2005, and this \nexemption has been extended for one-year increments in each subsequent \nyear. The current extension expires December 31, 2011. Congress has \nmade permanent similar exemptions for at least fourteen different \nprograms, and we believe the time has come to end these annual one-year \nextensions and simply make the exemption permanent. This will allow \nUSAC to continue administering these important programs in the most \nsensible and effective way.\n  It is important to understand that there is precedence to provide a \npermanent exemption. There are 14 agencies that currently have a \npermanent exemption for the ADA, including the Federal Aviation \nAdministration, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the National Oceanic \nand Atmospheric Administration.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. STABENOW:\n  S. 298. A bill to drive American innovation and advanced vehicle \nmanufacturing, to reduce costs for consumers, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Charging\n\n[[Page S617]]\n\nAmerica Forward Act, based on similar legislation I offered last year, \nto drive innovation and advance vehicle manufacturing and to lower \ncosts for consumers when they buy these great new cars and trucks of \nthe future which, by the way, I would remind folks are being made in \nMichigan. So we want people to be buying those automobiles.\n  In his State of the Union Address, President Obama called on us to \nrise to the challenge of the 21st-century economy to outinnovative, \nouteducate, and outbuild the rest of the world. We can do that.\n  He also challenged us to put 1 million electric vehicles on the road \nby 2015. The bill I have introduced today will help us achieve that \ngoal. By investing in electric vehicle innovation, we can create the \njobs of the future in America. We are already creating those jobs in \nMichigan with these investments.\n  We all know new technologies are always the most expensive, which is \nwhy we passed a tax credit of up to $7,500 on the purchase of a new \nelectric vehicle. My bill makes that work even better for consumers. It \nturns that credit into a rebate that can be used at the time of \npurchase so that when you by a car, you would get up to the $7,500 off \nat the beginning, at the dealership, rather than waiting until you fill \nout your tax forms the next year.\n  Right now there is a cap on how many people can take advantage of \nthese credits. My bill would double that so more people can get the \nsavings from these particular credits and buy these new, great \nvehicles. Right now, when we see gas prices anticipated to rise like \ncrazy into the summer, wouldn't it be great if you had an automobile \nthat went 200 or 300 miles on a gallon of gas, or maybe didn't need any \ngas at all? That is what this is about.\n  The bill also increases investments in battery technology and \ninnovation. We know that by supporting American innovation and \nmanufacturing, we can bring jobs back. In fact, we are bringing jobs \nback from other countries because of what we have been doing through \nour investment efforts in the Recovery Act, and we can continue to \ncreate jobs in manufacturing in America.\n  We have invested $2 billion in the Recovery Act toward advanced \nbatteries--the kind of batteries that power these electric vehicles. \nBefore we made that investment, the United States made 2 percent of the \nworld's advanced batteries. In just 4 years, because of that \ninvestment, we will be making 40 percent of the world's advanced \nbatteries. That is a big deal, an effective investment.\n  My bill calls for doubling this smart investment and building on \nthese partnerships to create even more jobs. We want to make our \ncountry the undisputed leader in advanced battery technology, \nmanufacturing, and development, and we are on the way to doing that. We \nneed to keep focused and we will get there.\n  The Charging America Forward Act also extends a tax credit for \nbusinesses that purchase hybrid medium and heavy-duty trucks. This will \nhelp keep those technologies more affordable for our companies and job \ncreators, in addition to the savings they will get from better fuel \nefficiency.\n  The bill extends an important tax credit to support charging \nstations, so we have the infrastructure needed in our homes or in our \ngarages to be able to power the electric vehicles.\n  Innovation is the reason America has the strongest economy in the \nworld, even with our challenges. We have always been the leader. To \ncompete in the 21st century economy, we need a strong, vibrant \ninvestment strategy, an economy that looks to the future, not the past. \nThat is what Charging America Forward is all about. With the right \ninvestments, we can create jobs today that will last for years and \nyears to come.\n  We are in a race for the future.
