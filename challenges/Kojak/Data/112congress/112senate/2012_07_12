Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 446, S. \n3369, the DISCLOSE Act.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will state the bill by \ntitle.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to S. 3369, a bill to amend the Federal \n     Election Campaign Act of 1971 to provide for additional \n     disclosure requirements of corporations, labor organizations, \n     Super PACs, and other entities, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the next hour will be equally divided \nbetween the two leaders or their designees, with the majority \ncontrolling the first half and the Republicans controlling the final \nhalf.\n  Last evening I filed cloture on the Landrieu substitute amendment to \nS. 2237, the Small Business Jobs and Tax Relief Act. Under the rule the \ncloture votes would be on Friday. I will work on that with the \nRepublican leader--we already have a general agreement--and we will try \nto schedule the vote sometime today.\n\n\n                               Tax Rates\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this week Republicans continued to make the \ncase that millionaires and billionaires cannot afford to pay even a \npenny more in taxes. Meanwhile, a new report shows average tax rates \nare at the lowest level in decades.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reported this week that \nin 2009 rates fell to their lowest level in more than three decades, 30 \nyears. Much of that decline is thanks to President Obama, who has \nconsistently fought to lower taxes for middle-class families over the \nlast 2\\1/2\\ years.\n  The average tax rate in this country fell to the lowest rate since \n1979--17.4 percent. Of course, that is still higher than what Mitt \nRomney paid in the only year for which he has been willing to disclose \nhis tax return. I am confident the reason he hasn't disclosed his tax \nreturns in the years people want to know--remember, he disclosed 1 \nyear. His father George Romney set the precedent that people running \nfor President would file their tax returns and let everybody look at \nthem. But Mitt Romney cannot do that because he has basically paid no \ntaxes in the prior 12 years.\n  Again, the average tax rate in this country is the lowest it has been \nsince 1979--17.4 percent. But I repeat, that is still much higher than \nwhat Mitt Romney pays.\n  Most Americans don't have the benefit of Swiss bank accounts or tax \nshelters in the Cayman Islands or Bermuda and who knows what else. We \ncannot see those tax returns.\n  As our economy continues to recover, it is critical we keep tax rates \nlow for the middle class people who are struggling to pay their \nmortgage, send their kids to college, and save for retirement.\n  That is why President Obama and Democrats in Congress want to extend \ntax cuts for 98 percent of American families.\n  But there is one group that is not struggling: Mitt Romney and the \nrest of the top 2 percent of Americans.\n  My Republican friends can come out and talk and say it is terrible \nand all we are trying to do is raise taxes on small businesses. The \nPresident's legislation raises taxes on 2 percent of wealthy people and \nabout 2.5 percent of businesses. This is no crush for small\n\n[[Page S4920]]\n\nbusinesses. It seems to me the 2 percent at the top can contribute a \nlittle bit more to deficit control.\n  Yet Republicans are prepared to block tax cuts for 98 percent of \nfamilies, unless Democrats agree to even more giveaways for the richest \nof the rich.\n  As Republicans continue to argue that the wealthiest 2 percent cannot \ncontribute even a little more, I urge them to talk to the three-\nquarters of Americans who disagree. I urge them to talk to the almost \n60 percent of Republicans who believe the wealthiest Americans should \nshoulder their fair share of the responsibility for getting the deficit \nunder control. Almost 60 percent of the Republicans agree with what the \nPresident is doing; that the top 2 percent should pay a little more.\n  I urge my Republican friends to talk to a few of the more than 135 \nmillion taxpayers who are waiting to see whether Republicans will \ncontinue holding hostage their tax cuts.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nleadership time is reserved.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                               Hard Votes\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, yesterday, something truly remarkable \nhappened right here in the Senate. First, Democrats blocked a vote that \nthe President of their own party called for just 2 days earlier.\n  Last night, the majority leader moved to shut down a debate on taxes \nthat hadn't even begun.\n  Earlier this week, President Obama issued an outrageous ultimatum to \nCongress: Raise taxes on about 1 million business owners and I promise \nnot to raise taxes on anybody else.\n  At a moment when the American people are reeling from the slowest \nrecovery in modern times, when the percentage of those who could work \nare working is at a three-decade low, and just 5 months away from the \neconomic body blow that will result if tax rates spike, as scheduled on \nJanuary 1, the President's solution is to take away more money from the \nvery business folks we are counting on to create jobs we need, \npresumably so he can spend it on solar companies and stimulus bills.\n  This was the President's brilliant economic solution to the mess we \nare in.\n  Naturally, Republicans oppose this. The way we see it, nobody should \nsee an income tax hike right now, not small businesses, not \nindividuals, nobody. Nobody should get a tax hike right now. The \nproblem isn't that Washington taxes too little but that it spends too \nmuch. Rather than just talk about it, we thought we should actually \ntake a vote on it.\n  After all, the President himself boasted Monday that he would sign a \nbill to raise taxes on small businesses right away if we pass it. So we \nsuggested two votes, one on the President's plan--once it is actually \nwritten--and one on ours. But the majority leader in the Senate blocked \nit from happening. Why? Because, as usual, Democrats want to have it \nboth ways.\n  Two years ago, when the economy was growing faster than it is now, 40 \nDemocrats in the Senate voted to do precisely what Republicans are \nproposing right now: keep everybody's taxes right where they are and do \nno harm. The President apparently doesn't want any of them to vote that \nway now.\n  In other words, he doesn't want to do what is right for the economy \nand jobs. He wants to do what he thinks is good for his reelection \ncampaign. For some reason, his advisers think it helps him to take more \nmoney away from small, already-struggling businesses and spend it on \nmore government. That is the plan anyway, and he wants to stick with \nit.\n  Yesterday, the Democratic majority leader did what the President told \nhim to. He made sure there wasn't a vote on a proposal the President of \nhis own party demanded 2 days earlier. My friend, the majority leader, \nmade sure there wasn't a vote on the plan the President asked for just \n2 days ago. Then he offered a vote on a bill today that isn't even \nwritten and only if Democrats and Republicans give up their ability to \noffer amendments to the bill we haven't seen yet.\n  This is the kind of absurdity we get when we have a governing party \nthat is more concerned with winning an election than facing the \nconsequences of the President's failed economic policies. But it \nactually gets even more absurd because the majority leader didn't just \nblock us yesterday from having votes on whether to raise taxes, he \nwouldn't even let us have a debate about it--don't have the vote and \ndon't have the debate.\n\n  Senators on both sides of the aisle have proposals that would help \nthe American people weather the economic crisis we are in. Senator \nHutchison has an amendment that would extend the relief from the blow \nof the marriage penalty. Senator Heller has a plan to extend the \ndeduction of sales tax in Nevada. Senator Scott Brown and a whole host \nof other Republicans have a proposal to repeal the potentially \ndevastating tax on medical devices that is being used to help fund \nObamaCare. Senators Cornyn and Crapo have amendments that would lessen \nthe blow of the tax hikes on investments--tax hikes that will directly \naffect job creation and harm those, such as our seniors, who are living \non fixed incomes.\n  As for the Democrats, well, even they have some ideas that might do \nsome good for the country. Senator Brown of Ohio has an amendment to \nextend the research and development credit, which I know has bipartisan \nsupport even if Republicans might differ in his approach. Senator \nBegich has an amendment that would extend the popular tax breaks for \ninvestments by small businesses. I don't fully endorse the specific \napproach taken by these two, but if they had a chance to offer and \ndebate them, I think we might be able to work out an agreement and \nactually get a result. But we can't even have a debate or get a vote on \nthese Democratic amendments because of the politics.\n  Personally, I can't imagine why Democratic Senators would tolerate \nthis kind of authoritarian approach. It seems to me that if Senator \nBrown of Ohio and Senator Begich really believe in their amendments, \nthey would fight for a vote on them. It is hard to believe their \nconstituents sent them here to rubberstamp everything the party leader \nputs out there regardless of the impact on their States. We would \nprobably have these votes later today if these Democratic Senators vote \nto cut off debate. I will leave it up to them to explain to their \nconstituents why they didn't think these amendments deserved votes.\n  But the larger issue is this: All of these petty political maneuvers \nbetray an astounding lack of concern about not only the economic crisis \nwe are in but the threat that is posed by the fiscal cliff we all know \nis looming in January. A New York Times article from just this morning \nsuggests that one reason the economy has slowed down so much is that \nbusinesses are reacting to the uncertainty about what will happen at \nthe end of the year. Well, of course that is the case. We hear it from \neveryone. Yet here is a Democratic-controlled Senate blocking votes, \nblocking debate, and hosting private meetings with the President's \npolitical advisers on strategy instead of working on serious bipartisan \nsolutions.\n  Last night Democratic leaders admitted that the bill they wanted \nRepublicans to turn to hasn't even been written yet. Think about that. \nThe proposal the President announced Monday with so much fanfare hasn't \neven been put on paper. Yet Democrats wanted us to move to it. Move to \nwhat? What is it? We haven't seen it. I think it hasn't been written. \nYou can't move to a speech. This is the level of seriousness we are \nseeing from the Democratic-controlled Senate right now. This is how \nseriously they take this economic crisis. It is nothing but one \npolitical game after another. If the President has a proposal, we will \nbe happy to send an intern down to the White House to pick it up, but \nwe can't vote on a speech. Frankly, we can't continue like this.\n  It is long past time Democrats in the White House and in the Senate \ntook the lives and challenges of working Americans as seriously as they \ntake their politics. It is time to put childish things aside and get \ndown to serious business for the American people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S4921]]\n\n                           Order of Business\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nfollowing hour will be equally divided and controlled between the two \nleaders or their designees, with the majority controlling the first \nhalf and the Republicans controlling the final half.\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                       Wind Production Tax Credit\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise today, as I have been \nevery day, to urge my colleagues to work with me and to work with the \nPresiding Officer to extend the production tax credit for wind. The \nPTC, as it is known, has broad economic effects, positive effects all \nacross our great country.\n  I am going to talk today, as I have each day, about an individual \nState that is known for its wind resources, and today that is the great \nState of Kansas. Kansas is already known as a national leader in both \nwind manufacturing and production. In fact, Kansas has the most wind \nprojects under construction, as we sit here today, and is on track to \nalmost double their installed wind energy capacity.\n  We can see from this map of Kansas that there is a lot of activity. \nFor example, there is construction currently underway in what will be \nthe largest wind farm in Kansas, which is located just southwest of \nWichita, in south central Kansas. The Flat Ridge 2 Wind Farm will cover \nabout 66,000 acres, and it should be up and running by the end of the \nyear.\n  The two companies running the project--BP Wind Energy and Sempra U.S. \nGas & Power--have invested over $800 million and have employed 500 \nconstruction workers. Those are impressive numbers wherever you might \nfind them. But that is not all. Once this project is done and \noperating, the local community should receive over $1 million annually \nin tax payments from the project. There are some 200 property owners \nwho own the land under the turbines, and they will receive a similar \namount in royalty payments. That is real money for real Americans, all \nthanks to wind energy and the production tax credit.\n  These are jobs and investments that are created here at home, and \nthey create good-paying jobs in Kansas, helping the local economy and \nproviding critical income for rural communities. I have to say this is \nespecially important as the drought takes a steep toll on farmers \nacross the Midwest this year. Wind power, if you think about it, is a \ncash crop that always ripens and always returns the investment in the \nmarketplace.\n  This is just one project in Kansas that isn't even completed yet, so \nlet me talk about the overall effect of wind energy in Kansas.\n  The wind energy industry in Kansas supports 3,000 jobs, it results in \n$3.7 million in property taxes from wind projects that go to local \ncommunities, and 8 percent of Kansas's power comes from wind. Those are \nimpressive numbers, and they would only grow as Kansas invests.\n  There are thousands of Kansas wind energy jobs supporting millions of \ndollars of local tax revenue and, as I pointed out here, almost one-\ntenth of Kansas's total power needs. This harnessing of the wind has \ntruly become an economic driver, and it presents enormous opportunity \nfor this important Midwestern State.\n\n  I would like to focus on one county. Lane County's economic \ndevelopment operation is headed up by Dan Hartman. Dan moved to western \nKansas 5 years ago, in large part because he wanted to live in the \nheart of rural America, but he also wanted to help create a better, \nmore secure energy future for America, with Kansas playing a central \nrole. Since then, Dan has been working with counties, farmers, and \nlandowners to bring as much wind energy as possible to western Kansas, \nand I think those possibilities are almost unlimited because there is \nenough potential wind power in Kansas to meet the needs of Kansas some \n90 times over.\n  That brings me to the point I wish to make today, and it is why I \nkeep coming to the floor. The uncertainty we have created by failing to \nextend the wind production tax credit, unfortunately, has sidelined \nroughly $3.5 billion in wind energy investments. That just defies \ncommon sense. Back home in my State of Colorado, I keep hearing from my \nfellow Coloradans: Why the heck aren't you in Congress working to save \nwind energy jobs right now? To Dan Hartman, the solution seems simple, \nand I want to quote him. He said:\n\n       I look at the wind energy industry as a matter of survival \n     and our future in Kansas. If we don't extend the PTC, we're \n     throwing away our future. We need it badly. If you really \n     look at the money, the PTC cost is dwarfed by the capital \n     investment it encourages.\n\n  Dan has it right, and we should listen here in the Congress. If we \nrefuse to develop our wind energy resources, there are a lot of \ncountries that are willing to outcompete us--take China, for example. \nWe have to work to keep these jobs and that investment here in the \nUnited States, and that is why the Congress must extend the production \ntax credit as soon as possible.\n  Mr. President, you also know we have bipartisan support. This isn't \nsolely a Republican or a Democratic issue. Senator Moran from Kansas, \nmy good friend, has joined me and others to make this happen. We have \noffered an amendment to the bipartisan small business lending bill that \nwould extend the PTC by 2 years, until the end of 2014.\n  We need the PTC. It equals jobs. We need to pass it as soon as \npossible. I want to ask my colleagues again, as I have every day, to \njoin Senator Moran, Senator Udall of New Mexico, Senator Thune, and \nothers to help pass this much needed, commonsense, bipartisan amendment \nor find another way to extend the PTC to ensure that more investment \nand more jobs in States such as Kansas, Colorado, and others all across \nour country will be the result.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair, I yield the floor, and I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                 Small Business Jobs and Tax Relief Act\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Small \nBusiness Jobs and Tax Relief Act. This is a tough economy for a lot of \npeople across the United States. It is especially difficult in my home \nState of Rhode Island, and that is why I support the legislation before \nus today. It will help small businesses to hire new workers and to \nexpand their payroll or invest in new capital equipment. This is a \ncommonsense step to encourage growth and create jobs.\n  These tax cuts are cost-effective and have been estimated by the CBO \nas having some of the biggest bang for the buck compared to other \nfiscal policies that directly benefit businesses. It is especially \nimportant to pass cost-effective policies because we are in the midst \nof a global slowdown that is hurting job creation and lowering \ngovernment revenue.\n  In contrast, the other body--the House--has been intent upon \nrepealing the Affordable Care Act, rolling back regulations on firms \nthat pollute, or providing tax windfalls to special interests. That \napproach will not provide the real economic growth we need today to put \npeople to work. In fact, it will exacerbate our deficit, and it will \nhurt the middle class of the United States.\n  The targeted tax cuts in the legislation we propose, the Small \nBusiness Jobs and Tax Relief Act, stand in stark contrast to the \napproach taken by the House Republicans in their Small Business Tax Cut \nAct, which is in many respects just another way to provide huge tax \nbenefits to the wealthiest Americans instead of doing what we should be \ndoing--providing jobs for all Americans. Proposals such as the House \nRepublican bill will only generate 30 cents for every Federal dollar \nspent as compared to the $1.30 and $1.10 multiplier for tax cuts for \njob creation and investments in new equipment, respectively, that are \nincluded in our bill.\n  Even more disturbing with the House proposal is that nearly half of \nthe $46 billion in tax cuts would go to the wealthiest Americans--\nmillionaires and billionaires--without having to create one single job.\n  In contrast, our bill provides a targeted 10-percent income tax \ncredit for\n\n[[Page S4922]]\n\nbusinesses that increase their payroll by hiring new workers or raising \nwages this year. So there is a direct link between the tax credit and \ncreating new jobs or raising wages for working men and women. This is a \ntax credit that is directly linked to this job creation effort, and the \ncredit is targeted to increasing middle-class job wages because the \ncredit only applies to the first $110,000 in wages for any individual \nemployee. So we are looking to target this as closely and precisely as \nwe can to be both effective and prudent with our resources.\n  The tax credit is further targeted to small businesses because it \nonly applies to the first $5 million in new payroll, effectively \ncapping the maximum tax credit to any business to $500,000.\n  The bill also extends bonus depreciation through 2012 for businesses \nthat invest in new capital. Bonus depreciation has proved to be an \neffective incentive for businesses to pull forward capital purchases \nand invest in the near term, offsetting some of the weak aggregate \ndemand that has held back our economic recovery.\n  In 2011, bonus depreciation accelerated $150 billion in tax cuts to 2 \nmillion businesses and generated an estimated $50 billion in added \ninvestment.\n  In total, the Small Business Jobs and Tax Relief Act is estimated to \ncreate about 1 million jobs nationally and over 3,500 jobs in my State \nof Rhode Island. We desperately need these jobs, and we need them as \nquickly as possible. This bill is a responsible, cost-effective, and \nfair way to generate growth.\n  Before us today is yet another example of my colleagues in the \nDemocratic caucus putting forth reasonable solutions that have been \nanalyzed by economists and determined to provide immediate help to \nmillions of out-of-work Americans. But my fear is that my colleagues on \nthe other side will again filibuster and oppose this effort, like \nothers we have made, while only offering proposals that promise great \nthings but in reality contribute very little to putting people to work \nquickly. And that is our challenge.\n  The damage caused by the refusal of many of my colleagues to support \nthese legitimate job proposals and their efforts to actively unwind \nFederal support for our recovery is hard to overstate. Their narrowly \nfocused economic proposals, in which a vast portion of their tax cuts \nflow to millionaires and billionaires or corporations that send jobs \noverseas, doesn't help our middle class, doesn't help our economy, \ndoesn't help our Nation's fiscal health. Republican proposals do not \nrespond to our immediate crisis.\n  The legislation before us does respond to that crisis by creating \njobs for middle-class working Americans right now. And it does not give \nlarge additional tax cuts for the wealthiest of Americans.\n  So I hope we can move forward. I hope we can bridge the differences \nand pass this legislation. It is legislation that has been looked at by \neconomists and has been determined to provide real benefits. For every \ndollar we invest, we will get more than that in terms of economic \nproductivity in the economy. Again, this is in stark contrast to simply \nproposing to cut taxes for the wealthiest Americans and assume that \nwould put people to work. That was the essence of the Bush economic \npolicies, and at the end of 8 years we were in one of the deepest \neconomic crises, losing hundreds of thousands of jobs per month.\n  We pulled back from that brink, but in order to go forward, and go \nforward with momentum and confidence, we have to pass legislation such \nas the legislation we have proposed today: targeted efforts to put \npeople to work, to move our economy forward, to move the Nation \nforward. This will help millions of Americans who are impacted by this \ntough economy in the most meaningful way--and that is simply by getting \nthem back to work. When we do, this country will do great things, as it \nalways has done. I urge my colleagues to support this measure.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                              the economy\n\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, last week's jobs report reinforces what \nmany of us have known for some time. Unlike what the President would \nlike you to believe, the private sector is not doing fine and this \nadministration's policies are not providing effective solutions to our \nNation's problems. The health of our economy hinges upon job growth, \nand it clearly has not received the attention it deserves. Our Nation \nhas no roadmap, and it is past time for a genuine effort to work in a \nbipartisan manner to create the certainty and stability that will allow \nAmerican businesses and families to thrive.\n  Every morning Nevadans wake up and grab their hometown newspaper or \nturn on their local news. Some are getting ready to go to work, while \nothers start another day trying to find a job. These Nevadans have \nbecome all too familiar with headlines of Nevada leading the country in \nunemployment and foreclosures.\n  For the Nevadans who are going to their job, these headlines create \nfear and uncertainty about their future. For the Nevadan who is \nunemployed, these headlines are another blow to their hopes of finding \nwork. That is what many Nevadans have had to live with for far too \nlong.\n  I read and see the latest unemployment statistics just like everyone \nelse, but I know that behind these numbers are real people struggling \nto make ends meet. Being home in Nevada I have met the unemployed \nmechanic, the unemployed computer engineer, and the unemployed \nwaitress. Blue collar and white collar workers alike continue to pay \nthe price because of the poor decisions by Wall Street and Washington.\n  Nevadans did not want the Wall Street bailout--but Washington did it \nanyway. Nevadans did not want the trillion dollar stimulus bill--but \nWashington did it anyway. Nevadans did not want the President's health \ncare bill--but Washington did it anyway.\n  When I am in places such as Reno, Las Vegas, Henderson, or Elko I \noften ask people to raise their hand if the bailout has helped them \nfind a job. No one raises their hand. I ask did the stimulus bill help \nthem find a job. No one raises their hand. Finally, I ask them if the \nhealth care bill has helped them find a job and still no one raises \ntheir hand.\n  In January 2009, President Obama was inaugurated and Democrats \ncontrolled both the House and the Senate. Nevada's unemployment rate \nwas at 9.4 percent.\n  Nearly 4 years later Nevada's unemployment rate is 11.6 percent. Too \nmany people in Nevada are unemployed, have stopped looking for jobs or \nworse, left the State for employment elsewhere.\n  With over 23 million Americans out of work or underemployed I think \nit is past time to ask the President and this Congress is this working?\n  Nevadans have seen the effects of higher Washington spending, higher \nregulations, and higher debt and they know these policies have failed. \nThey deserve solutions. Instead of having more show votes, Congress \nneeds to focus on pro-growth policies that eliminate burdensome \nregulations, reform the tax code and help struggling homeowners. It is \nmy hope that our economy will improve as the year goes on, but \nWashington must take action.\n  There are small commonsense measures that we can pass right now if \ngiven the opportunity. I continually come here to the Senate floor to \noffer solutions that will provide our Nation's job creators with the \ntools to provide for long-term economic growth. I have crafted three \nhousing bills to help those foreclosed upon to stay in their home, \nshorten the short-sale process, and ensure homeowners who get mortgage \nrelief are not hit with additional taxes. I have offered legislation \nthat would require Washington bureaucrats at agencies to take into \naccount jobs when issuing regulations or to streamline permitting for \nenergy-related projects on public lands or even something as simple as \ncombining annual reports submitted to Congress. These are small \nmeasures that if passed would make a big difference to our Nation's job \ncreators. Unfortunately, all too often we find ourselves taking \npolitical show votes instead of debating\n\n[[Page S4923]]\n\ncommonsense solutions. The bill we have before us on the floor is a \nperfect example. I filed two amendments to this bill that would help \nease the stress of taxes on middle-class Nevadans and one to help \nunderwater homeowners. Both are bipartisan proposals. Yet once again we \nfind ourselves in a position where we cannot have an open debate on \namendments.\n  These are not partisan issues, these are American issues. If any \nMember of Congress commits themselves to spending reform, tax reform, \nregulation reform, and finding solutions to fix the housing crisis, \nthen they will have me as an ally.\n  Nevadans deserve better than what they have gotten from this Congress \nand White House, which is why I will continue to keep coming to this \nfloor to raise my voice for the citizens of Nevada and I will fight \nevery day to create jobs and get Nevadans back to work.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I ask to be recognized for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    KU Cancer Center Congratulations\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to congratulate \nthe University of Kansas on its prestigious designation as a National \nCancer Institute Cancer Center.\n  I do regret I can't be at the KU ceremony today to mark this \ndesignation by the NCI because of anticipated votes in the Senate, but \nI am certainly there in spirit.\n  This designation of `` cancer center'' is such an important \ndevelopment for my state and others in our region because it means that \nmany Kansans and their families who have faced frightening diagnoses--\nand trying treatments--will no longer have to seek cures all the way \ndown to Texas or up to Minnesota.\n  They can, and will be able to, stay closer to home and their support \nsystems. Simply put, it's great news for Kansas cancer patients in the \nregion.\n  I am personally gratified by this designation because it represents \nmore than a decade of work with so many outstanding partners. It has \ntruly been a team effort to achieve this important Federal designation.\n  When I was first elected to this body in 1996, I created a blue \nribbon committee of Kansas leaders in government, academia and the \nprivate sector to advise me on the State's science and technology \nneeds. The goal was to make us more competitive in a global marketplace \nincreasingly reliant on research and technology and to provide economic \nopportunity to stop out-migration of our best and brightest young \npeople.\n  The Roberts advisory committee set out to implement policies and \nsecure Federal investments to further the research goals of Kansas \nState University in plant and animal science, Wichita State University \nin composite and aviation research and the University of Kansas in life \nscience research.\n  I personally took this goal to the Kansas legislature in 2001 and \nagain in 2002 encouraging my colleagues in the Kansas State legislature \nto help promote State investment in research infrastructure--to be part \nof it.\n  At the time, I spoke about how the statistics showed that Kansas was \nlagging behind other States in the race for Federal and private \nresearch dollars.\n  In response, the Kansas legislature more than stepped up to the plate \nwith special thanks to leaders like Representative Kenny Wilk, Senator \nKent Glasscock, Representative Nick Jordan and Senator Dave Kerr.\n  The legislature voted in favor of bonding authority--and we \nconstructed and invested in buildings at the KU Cancer Center and the \nBiosecurity Research Institute at K-State. Likewise, Wichita State's \nwork in composite research is now revolutionizing industries from \naircraft to health care. And about this same time, Stowers Biomedical \nResearch Institute came into existence, which provided a key private \nsource of research excellence.\n  Our Kansas motto is ``To the stars through difficulty.'' Well, in \nshort, the stars aligned.\n  KU's then-Chancellor Bob Hemenway and I sought out other \nopportunities to help raise KU's research profile.\n  In 2004, we invited then-NIH Director Elias Zerhouni to KU for a tour \nand discussion about KU Medical Center's research facilities.\n  Dr. Zerhouni recognized--as many Federal research directors do--that \nthere is great promise in research conducted at Kansas universities.\n  Chancellor Hemenway and I worked in concert to design congressionally \ndirected programs to supplement KU's internal NIH cancer research \nsuccesses. This included those won by Dr. Jeff Aube, who leads one of \nfour NIH drug discovery centers.\n  Furthermore, this coordinated effort with Chancellor Hemenway and his \nleadership team also provided KU with the flexibility to recruit new \ncancer research faculty who brought considerable expertise and NCI \ncancer research programs to KU.\n  In 2006, with the critical mission of the National Cancer Institute \nin mind, from my post on the Senate Health Committee, we fought to \nreauthorize funding for National Institutes of Health which oversee the \nNational Cancer Institute.\n  This reform bill reaffirmed the various centers of NIH including the \nCancer Institutes and reauthorized their funding.\n  In fact, this was a continuation of Congressional efforts from 1999, \nwhen we were successful at doubling NIH funding over 5 years, at a time \nwhen many wanted to divert Federal funds to other research.\n  My then-partner in the Senate, Sam Brownback, now our State's \nGovernor, and I worked together to advance this push.\n  In 2009, Senator Brownback and I secured $5.5 billion in Federal \ninvestments for the University of Kansas to purchase equipment needed \nto further its cancer research. Sam's leadership, both then and now, is \nimmeasurable.\n  Over those 10 years, there were many other excellent team members \nsupporting this effort who should be recognized. I apologize I will not \nbe able to name everyone who played such a big and important role.\n  First, Dr. Howard Mossberg, dean emeritus of the KU School of \nPharmacy. He was the force behind the regular meetings of our Science \nand Technology Advisory Committee. Howard, who lives in Lawrence, home \nof KU, did this work for free because he recognized the opportunity to \nuse the advisory committee to provide us with key facts to support our \nresearch and technology initiatives. KU, in fact, hosted many of our \nadvisory committee meetings down through the years. I truly appreciate \nthat.\n  Riding shotgun back in Kansas on this effort has been my tireless \nstaff member Harold Stones. Harold provided the hard work of collecting \nand then distilling and providing to everyone concerned the valuable \ncontributions among our technology leaders for more than a decade, \nhelping me turn them into policy and progress.\n  Credit must also go to former KU research directors Dr. Bob Barnhill \nand Dr. Michael Welch. They were instrumental in my research about the \nKU Cancer Center. Jim Roberts, who sadly passed away from cancer \nhimself, was a valuable KU adviser to me, as is Steve Warren today.\n  I have appreciated getting to know Dr. Roy Jensen, who leads the KU \nCancer Center. I know Roy will continue to stay in close touch with me \nand the entire Kansas delegation about the KU Cancer Center as it \ncontinues to progress. Our work is ongoing. It is not done.\n  I would also be remiss not to mention the contributions of my former \nlegislative director, Mr. Keith Yehle. Keith was the point person for \nKU to contact, whether it was about the KU Cancer Center, the \nadvancements in special education or the Hoglund Brain Imaging Center, \nwhere we also secured $1.8 million in Federal investment for renovation \nand equipment. Keith went on to work at KU for Chancellor Hemenway to \nhelp him and our current Chancellor Gray-Little navigate the corridors \nof Capitol Hill.\n  My former chief of staff Leroy Towns, former deputy legislative \ndirector Jennifer Swenson, and my current\n\n[[Page S4924]]\n\nsenior health care policy adviser Jennifer Boyer round out the list of \nthe Roberts team who spent countless hours working on behalf of the \nUniversity of Kansas--whether it is the cancer center designation or \nany other of KU's initiatives.\n  Let me stress that my current colleagues in Congress, Senator Jerry \nMoran, Congresswoman Lynn Jenkins, and Congressman Kevin Yoder, have \neach carved out important initiatives to promote this designation and \nhave helped make this day possible. This partnership will continue for \nKU.\n  We could not have accomplished something this encompassing without \nstrong public support. In this regard, I also wish to thank the \npublisher and the editor of the Lawrence Journal-World, Mr. Dolph \nSimons, Jr., for his comprehensive coverage with regard to all these \ninitiatives over the years.\n  What we have with the NCI designation is proof of what I said to the \nKansas State legislature back in 2001; that public and private and \nacademic partnerships are critical to developing our State's economy \nover the long term. I applaud the generosity of the Kansas Masonic \nFoundation, Annette Gloch, the Hall Family Foundation, and others for \ntheir key contributions to this effort.\n  In the Senate this week, we have talked a lot about the need for job \ngrowth--jobs, jobs, jobs. According to the University of Kansas, since \n2006, the National Cancer Institute's designation pursuit alone has \ncreated 1,123 jobs and had a regional economic impact of $453 million. \nWe can only expect, with the announcement of the cancer center \ndesignation today, that these numbers will grow jobs, jobs, jobs.\n  Our work does not end today. We will always be focused on ensuring a \nbetter treatment of cancer victims. A great thanks go to so many--past \nand present. I am honored to have been there at the beginning, but in \nsome ways I believe you ain't seen nothing yet. Congratulations to the \nUniversity of Kansas and to the entire State of Kansas.\n  ``Rock Chalk Jayhawk.'' Well done, KU.\n\n\n                           Medical Device Tax\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the \nsmall business tax bill currently before the Senate, one of which I \nhope we have an opportunity to debate openly and fairly and allow \namendments. I am not quite sure if that is going to happen, which is \nfrustrating because the American people deserve better. When we allow \nthe process to work and we allow everybody to have their say in the \nprocess, we ultimately get a good bill. I am hopeful we can do the same \non this one.\n  It is good we are finally working on jobs, but I believe we should be \nworking in a more bipartisan way, as we did with the insider trading \nbill, crowdfunding, the Arlington Cemetery bill, the 3-percent \nwithholding, and many other bills. We need to work on a bill where all \nMembers are offered an opportunity to have their votes on job-creating \nideas.\n  I don't think one party has the monopoly on how to create jobs in \nthis country. I think we can actually get together in a room and hammer \nit out and try to work to help protect the middle-class and everybody \nin America who wants to get out and work.\n  We have worked together, as I have said, on a whole host of bills. I \nforgot the hire a hero tax credit, which is clearly a jobs bill. I \nworked with Senator Bennet and Senator Merkley on that. It is a very \nimportant piece of legislation. With that type of success, I don't \nunderstand why we don't try that more often.\n  The new medical device tax is one more example of a policy we all \nknow is bad for jobs and, in fact, bad for our economy. The House has \nalready voted to repeal this job-killing tax. I am disappointed to say \nthe Senate has not taken the time to work to repeal it in a truly \nbipartisan manner.\n\n  For those who don't know what the medical device tax is or why we \nshould even care, let me explain. In Massachusetts, we have over 400 \nmedical device companies employing tens of thousands of people. This \n2.3 percent tax on medical device sales will cost our economy thousands \nof jobs and limit Americans access to the most groundbreaking, state-\nof-the-art medical devices.\n  For example, Covidien, a medical device company with 2,000 employees \nin my home State, has estimated that taxable medical devices represent \napproximately 30 to 40 percent of the total net sales in 2011. What \nthat means in plain language is that will cost Covidien between $80 \nmillion and $107 million annually. From where is that money going to \ncome? Will it come from R, expansion, hiring or expanding their \nworkforce?\n  Over the last 5 years, Covidien has more than doubled its R \ninvestment and launched more than 100 new products. One of those \nproducts is a device that restores blood flow in patients who have \nsuffered from a stroke by mechanically removing blood clots from \nblocked vessels. Obviously, that is a very important device that would \nactually help save people's lives and save costs. Another product \nprovides the first safe and effective treatment for large or giant \nwide-neck brain aneurysms available on the market, but losing $80 \nmillion to $107 million in revenue each year will put Covidien's \ncontinuing growth in very real jeopardy.\n  Another medical device company, Stryker Corporation, said late last \nyear they would begin cutting 5 percent of their workforce in response \nto the tax. That is 1,000 jobs that will be gone as a result of this \ntax. Stryker expects the device tax to cost them $130 million to $150 \nmillion in the first year alone. These are just two examples. As I \nsaid, in Massachusetts we have over 400 medical device companies.\n  The Massachusetts medical device industry employs nearly 25,000 \nworkers in Massachusetts and contributes over $4 billion to our \neconomy. Massachusetts alone is expected to lose over 2,600 jobs. As a \ndirect result of this tax, around 10 percent of our device \nmanufacturing workforce will be affected. The bottom line is we can't \nhave that kind of job loss in a sector of our economy that is still \nstruggling.\n  Yesterday, I, along with others, introduced an amendment to repeal \nthis job-killing medical device tax. It is a tax which will drive up \nthe cost of care for patients and make our workers and our companies \nless competitive.\n  Some say it is time to move on from the health care bill to work on \nthe jobs legislation. With all due respect, working on job growth means \nrepealing the health care bill and its 18 new job-destroying taxes \nalong with one-half trillion in Medicare cuts.\n  A lot of these things haven't clicked in and the American public \nisn't quite aware they are soon going to be affected by 18 new taxes \nassociated with the Federal health care bill and a one-half trillion in \nMedicare cuts. It is time to get rid of the medical device tax before \nit does even more damage, not only to Massachusetts but other States \nthat have a large medical device industry.\n  I urge my colleagues to get behind this effort in a truly bipartisan, \nbicameral manner.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Should we go to the bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is considering the motion to \nproceed on S. 3369.\n\n\n                               Estate Tax\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I find it ironic that we are debating a \nbill called the Small Business Jobs and Tax Relief Act when that bill \ndoes absolutely nothing to address the death tax, one of the biggest \nthreats to our small businesses in our country.\n  Again, while Republicans are being accused of not wanting to move \nlegislation to help grow the economy and develop jobs, it was \ninteresting to read this morning that my Democratic friends still do \nnot have any agreement among themselves on how to proceed on a number \nof tax issues--including the death tax. They need to get moving over \nthere.\n  Next year, unless Congress does something, the death tax will come \nroaring back at a much higher rate of 55 percent and a much lower \nexemption amount of $1 million next year, though those who promote the \ndeath tax characterize it as impacting only Daddy Warbucks, the \nMonopoly Man, and Montgomery Burns. The data does not bear out this \ncartoonish characterization.\n  The death tax does not just hit those at higher income tax brackets; \nit has an effect well beyond small business owners and adversely \nimpacts middle-\n\n[[Page S4925]]\n\nclass jobs and wages. Call it what you will, the estate tax or the \ndeath tax, but in the end it is a tax that is antismall business and \nantijob creation and antiwage increase.\n  We are in the midst of another Senate floor show of pursuing \nlegislation that will give the President and his allies campaign \ntalking points but will do absolutely nothing to spur economic growth \nand job creation. Meanwhile, the Senate has failed to take action on \nestate tax reform. This is beyond irresponsible.\n  I have been a long-time proponent of repealing the death tax. Not \nonly is it double taxation and a deterrent to savings, but it also \nsucks up capital in the marketplace. To be clear, this is capital that \ncould be used to hire more workers or expand small businesses or any \nbusiness for that matter. This is a basic economic concept that seems \nlost on our current President, President Obama.\n  During last year's deficit reduction talks, President Obama argued on \nbehalf of tax increases saying:\n\n       I do not want, and I will not accept a deal in which I am \n     asked to do nothing, in fact, I'm able to keep hundreds of \n     thousands of dollars in additional income that I don't need.\n\n  Income that I don't need? This is a point that could only be made by \na person with a very loose understanding of how business and \nentrepreneurs operate. The President seems to think this so-called \nexcess income does no good. In fact, however, it will be invested or it \nwould be invested in new business ventures, new hires, and better \nwages.\n  If these entrepreneurs with all this excess income did nothing but \nput that money into a savings account, it would benefit individuals \nlooking to buy a house, buy a car or start their own business, but the \nPresident does not seem to grasp this. So it is no surprise that he and \nhis Democratic allies have done nothing to address this job-killing \ndeath tax increase looming on the horizon.\n  The President claims he is interested in job creation. He certainly \nshould be after last month's anemic jobs report. Well, he need look no \nfurther than death tax repeal. I know his liberal base might not \nappreciate it, but the rest of the country, which is less interested in \nclass warfare talking points and more interested in getting the economy \nmoving again, would embrace it.\n  The death tax adds inefficiency to our economy. It is what economists \nrefer to as deadweight loss. In other words, it creates another burden \non our free market system and prevents the full potential of economic \ngrowth.\n  For instance, many small businesses have to purchase insurance in \norder to prepare for paying the death tax so they do not end up having \nto sell the business just to pay the death tax. This added cost is \nembedded into the cost of goods when sold. In other words, American \nconsumers, American workers, or Americans looking for work are those \nwho will ultimately have to pay the death tax.\n  Consider also that heirs are often forced to sell an asset of the \nbusiness or the business itself in order to meet this arbitrary tax due \ndate. These assets are likely generating revenue and could be a vital \npart of the business. But because the tax man cometh, small businesses \nare forced to sell these assets to pay the death tax.\n  We ought to repeal the death tax, plain and simple. We actually don't \nget that much revenue from the death tax to justify its existence. It \nhas been a pain in the neck from the beginning.\n  In 2010 the death tax was temporarily repealed, but in a few months \nthe law will take a sharp turn for the worse. Back in 2010 Senators Kyl \nand Lincoln offered a compromise that gained bipartisan support which \neventually became law. Under title III of the Tax Relief Act--a law \nsigned by President Obama--the death tax and the gift tax are unified \nwith a $5 million exemption amount and a tax rate of 35 percent. Under \ncurrent law, however, in 2013 we will once again have a 55-percent \nestate tax due within 9 months of death, and in some cases the tax will \nreach 60 percent. The exemption amount could be as low as $1 million.\n  That is not right. How does it benefit our economy to have small \nbusinesses and farmers wondering whether they have to sell their \nbusiness or literally sell the farm to pay for an uncertain amount of \ntaxes? It creates an accounting and financial nightmare.\n  The estate tax is not about making the Tax Code more progressive. The \nestate tax is not about more redistribution. It is not about deficit \nreduction. It is class warfare, and while it might stir up some votes, \nit has an outsized and detrimental impact on our economy.\n  Many do not realize the enormous impact the death tax has on rural \nAmerica. I am not only talking about farmers and ranchers; I am also \ntalking about small family-owned businesses that generate economic \ngrowth in smaller towns--and even larger towns. If we do not address \nthe death tax, some businesses with assets over $1 million could be \nsusceptible to the death tax.\n  I know for a small business $1 million in assets is a pretty low \nthreshold. That is why I care about this death tax debate: because of \nreal people, real Utahans, in real communities, who will be upended if \nthis tax increase is allowed to go into effect.\n  When we hear about the number of individuals impacted by the death \ntax, that statistic actually understates the sweep of this intrusion by \nthe Federal Government. The estate tax return is filed by the \nrepresentative of the deceased. That return does not take into account \nthe dead person's family, employees, or neighbors. All of those folks \nare affected if the death tax burdens that particular family business \nor farm.\n  There seems to be a strategy by the Democratic leadership to drag its \nfeet in coming up with a resolution to this impending problem. What \nthey fail to realize is this strategy is only adding to the cloud of \nuncertainty--economic uncertainty--over our country and over our \neconomy. Will Congress keep the rates and exemption amounts the same? \nWill Congress increase them? What do I need to do as a small business \nowner to better prepare my business from withstanding a tax increase?\n  These are the types of questions more and more small business owners \nand farmers are continuing to ask. The uncertainty these questions \ngenerate is holding back investment, job creation, and wage growth. Yet \npolicies to promote economic growth have, unfortunately, taken a back \nseat to Presidential talking points that campaign advisers think will \ngenerate votes. Attack the rich. Promise more spending.\n  As a candidate, President Obama promised in 2008 that Washington \nneeded to spread the wealth around. That is one promise the President \nhas kept. In spite of an economy that demands a focus on job creation, \nthe President and his liberal allies have spent the last year coming up \nwith even more intensive redistributionist schemes.\n  Recently, the Joint Committee on Taxation released an estimate on how \nmany more taxable estates, farming taxable estates, and small business \ntaxable estates would be affected by the increase in the death tax over \nthe next 10 years. The numbers are truly astonishing. If Congress does \nnot act, we will see more than a 1,000-percent increase in the number \nof taxable estates, a 2,300-percent increase in the number of farming \ntaxable estates, and a 1,000-percent increase in the number of small \nbusiness taxable estates. The reach of the death tax is growing, and it \nis going to hit not just the so-called rich but current employees and, \nfor that matter, entire communities.\n  Let's take a look at the tax year of 2013. It arrives in a little \nover 7 months, by the way. Under current law, 46,700 estates will be \ntaxable. If we extend the Lincoln-Kyl compromise, 3,600 estates would \nbe taxable. Now, let me refer to the Joint Committee on Taxation estate \ntax data chart. It is the second column on the chart. When we think \nabout it, under current law the path on which we seem to be slow-\nwalking means more than 10 times the number of estates will be hit by \nthe tax. The Lincoln-Kyl compromise means only the top 10 percent--the \nwealthiest estates--would be hit by the death tax.\n  If we project out the 8 years of current law over 10 years, we will \nfind that roughly 570,000 estates will be taxable over that period. \nUnder the Lincoln-Kyl compromise, which is the current estate tax \nregime, roughly 41,000 estates would be taxable over that period. So \n570,000 estates under the law that many Democrats would want or only \n41,000 estates would be taxed under the Lincoln-Kyl compromise.\n\n[[Page S4926]]\n\n  In a recent interview with the Associated Press, Secretary of \nAgriculture Kathleen Merrigan described an epidemic of sorts that is \nhitting our farmlands across the United States. She did not talk about \nrising fuel prices or droughts. Instead, Secretary Merrigan discussed \nhow our country's farmers and ranchers are getting older, and fewer \nyoung people are taking their places. I have heard time and time again \nthat the death tax is the No. 1 reason family farms and businesses fail \nto pass down to the next generation.\n  If Congress does not act soon, the Joint Committee on Taxation \nestimates that another 2,000 farming estates will be hit by the death \ntax next year. Keep in mind farmers sometimes carry debt. That would \nreduce the value of the farm, but on the other hand farmers have other \nfarm-related assets such as combines and other equipment that are not \nincluded in the figures I cited.\n  This data shows the failure to address the estate tax cliff will \nundermine many family farms. For those folks who are working this land, \nthis is an unwelcome uncertainty. As I indicated earlier, the tax is an \nimpediment to passing on the family business, in this case the family \nfarm. A much higher death tax, apparently supported by many Members on \nthe other side, will undermine many family farms and small businesses. \nYet these family farms and small businesses form the economic backbone \nof their communities.\n  Do we really want to send the signal that those who work hard, save, \nand want to pass something on to their families exist solely to fund \nbloated Federal programs? Why work hard? Why save? Why not work less? \nInstead, if the President is just going to spread the wealth around, it \nmight just be easier to go into debt and live beyond one's means.\n  There is something fundamentally unjust about the estate tax. \nContrary to the claims of the President and his most liberal \nsupporters, a person's wealth is the result of his or her labor. When \none builds a business, one puts their sweat and ingenuity into it. To \nthen be punished for this--to have it taken away at the moment of death \nby the Federal Government--is an assault on personal liberty and \nfreedom.\n  John Locke, the great philosopher, understood this. America's \nFounding Fathers understood this, and they would no doubt be appalled \nto know that behind the Grim Reaper now stands an IRS agent waiting to \ncollect and deliver the government's share. But today's so-called \nliberals have abandoned this classical liberal philosophy--the \nphilosophy of natural rights and liberties upon which our Nation was \nfounded--in favor of a redistributionist philosophy that undermines \nrights and undermines our economy.\n  Time is running out. We cannot continue this cycle of passing \ntemporary tax relief and then waiting until the very last minute to \ndecide what to do next. We owe it to family farms and small businesses \nto figure out a way to pass a permanent solution so each year \nbusinesses are not left wondering whether they will have to shut their \ndoors in order to pay the death tax.\n  Also, for those who love to raise taxes on small businesses, keep in \nmind these small businesses pay a lot of income tax each year into the \nTreasury's coffers. Do we want to kill the goose that is laying the \ngolden eggs? If we are serious about providing true tax relief that \nwill help small businesses grow, we can sit here and debate whether a \nbandaid will be the cure to our ailing economy, or we can begin the \ndebate over how to prevent historic tax increases from hammering our \nsmall businesses and farms.\n  I urge my friends in the Democratic leadership to put the death tax \non the Senate's radar screen.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown of Ohio). Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                 Small Business Jobs and Tax Relief Act\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I am reminded today of the old saying \nthat we campaign in poetry but we govern in prose. We are in the midst \nof a campaign season when we hear a lot of rhetoric perhaps posing as \npoetry, but we have an obligation to govern. I rise today in support of \nS. 2337, which is most certainly simple, straightforward prose in \ndedication to the art of government. It is the Small Business Jobs and \nTax Relief Act. It is about as simple and straightforward as it \npossibly could be.\n  It has two compelling, concise concepts. The first is a tax credit of \n10 percent on new payroll. It can be either new hiring or increased \nwages in 2012 as compared to 2011, and it is capped at $500,000--pretty \nsimple, straightforward prose in aid of jobs, in aid of employment.\n  It also extends for 1 year the 100-percent bonus depreciation \nallowance to stimulate economic investment--again, to create jobs. It \nis a very simple and straightforward extension of the accelerated \ndepreciation that boosts gross domestic product and will benefit 2 \nmillion businesses--it is estimated 2 million businesses--most of them \nsmall businesses across the United States. In fact, this measure is \nvery specifically targeted and aimed at small businesses creating jobs. \nThey are the backbone of our economy. They are the source of the \nmajority of new jobs.\n  It economizes, very prudently and practically, the aid that is \ndesigned to boost new jobs, as well as overall output in our economy.\n  It is supported by a broad consensus of economists, including Alan \nBlinder, who has endorsed this idea as a job creator, saying:\n\n       The basic idea is to offer firms that boost their payrolls \n     a tax break. As one concrete example, companies might be \n     offered a tax credit equal to 10% of the increase in their \n     wage bills. . . . No increase, no reward.\n\n  That is the concept: ``No increase, no reward.'' But the reward and \nthe incentive are a powerful potential driving force to aid small \nbusinesses in increasing the numbers of jobs they provide.\n  I thank Leader Harry Reid for this very targeted and profoundly \nmeaningful proposal. But when I think about the impact of this \nlegislation, I do not think of the folks who are gathered in this \nChamber. I think of people in Connecticut--13,000 people in \nConnecticut--who will have jobs if we move forward on this bill.\n  I think of a man named Hector Hernandez. I met Hector at a jobs fair \nI hosted in East Hartford this past September. After 25 years of \nworking for the same company--as they say, working hard and playing by \nthe rules--Hector lost his job. He is willing to do most anything to \nfind a new job, but he cannot find one. There are simply no jobs for \nHector. This measure will help to provide him one.\n  At that same jobs fair I met Ty Wagner. Ty took a very smart path. He \ndecided he was going to get all the education that could possibly be \naccessible to him. He got a technical degree from a top university. He \nwanted to work in the State when he graduated. His dream job was to \ngive back, to provide public service. He has not been able to find any \njob, let alone his dream job, and he is every bit as lost as Hector \nHernandez.\n  That situation faced by Hector and Ty is only one aspect of the \ncrisis in America's job market. I think of Jodey Lazarus who moved to \nStamford 5 years ago in search of economic opportunity. She put her two \nkids in local schools, signed up for college classes, started to get \nher finances in order, and today she makes barely enough to feed her \nfamily. She receives no benefits. She has been looking for a job that \nwill pay her more and give her more security, but in this economy her \nefforts have come to nothing. Every week she hopes and prays her income \nwill be enough to provide food for her family. People like Jodey and \nHector and Ty deserve better.\n  As I travel across Connecticut, I hear often that there are jobs and \nemployers cannot find people with the skills to fill them. We need to \nprovide those skills to develop our workforce, to make sure education \nand training are available so people have skills to fill the jobs that \nexist.\n  Washington can do more for them. This kind of targeted, practical \napproach--not Republican or Democrat, not conservative or progressive--\nsimply provides the tools small businesses need: a 10-percent payroll \ntax cut, accelerated depreciation--simple,\n\n[[Page S4927]]\n\nstraightforward prose, not poetry, prose--that will put people back to \nwork in Connecticut and around the country.\n  I urge that my colleagues come together--as the American people want \nus to do desperately, are seeking for us to do--and to govern in prose \nthat makes a practical difference in their lives, a tool for small \nbusiness--not as a panacea but as a practical aid so small businesses \ncan put people back to work across the State of Connecticut and the \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, first, let me thank my colleague from \nConnecticut, Senator Blumenthal, for his comments. I must tell the \nSenator, listening to him account to the people in Connecticut, to the \nindividuals who are struggling in this economy, I can tell the Senator \nwe have the same exact circumstances happening in Maryland.\n  This past weekend I was with some small business owners who were \ntelling me their plans for opening a new restaurant and opening a new \ngasoline station, telling me of the struggles they are having in \ngetting financing. There are community banks that have money, but they \ncannot make the loans because of the new rating system, and it is very \ndifficult to get the capital to get the type of expansions they need \ntoday to start a new business.\n  In my State of Maryland, the high-tech and cybersecurity areas where \nwe have small companies that are starting up to help our country, to \nhelp our country answer the problems of cybersecurity, help our country \ndevelop the type of biotech discoveries that will make our health care \nsystem more cost effective, are having a very difficult time putting \ntogether the capital in order to be able to move forward with job \ncreation.\n  The Senator and I know 60 percent of our job creation will come from \nsmall businesses. We also know innovation is more likely to come from \nsmall companies that find ways to work more cost effectively. Today in \nthis economy it is a challenge for small business owners to be able to \nput together the business financing to create the jobs we need for our \neconomy.\n\n  The Senator also understands if we are going to balance our budget, \nif we are going to be able to move forward, we have to have more people \nworking. A lot of people are looking for work and cannot find a job. We \nwant more people working to fuel our economy. Also, by the way, they \nalso pay taxes and help us bring our budget into balance.\n  So I could not agree with the Senator more that we need to get \nDemocrats and Republicans working together. Here we have a bill on the \nSenate floor that helps small businesses. Let's not filibuster this \nbill. Let's at least bring it up for an up-or-down vote. I thought in a \ndemocracy majority rules. Let's bring it up. Let's have a vote. Let's \nkeep it to the small business issues.\n  We all talk about our support for small businesses. Let's keep it to \nthe issue before us: to create jobs, to help small businesses do that.\n  The underlying bill--and I thank Senator Reid for the underlying \nbill--says to small businesses: If you add to our economy, if you \ncreate more jobs, if you increase your payroll, then we have tax help \nfor you to do that.\n  I must tell you, I think this is exactly what we need. We know \nbusinesses cannot get all the financing they need. They need some help \nin order to be able to put together new job opportunities. This bill \nprovides that with a 10-percent credit on the cost of a new hire. That \ngives an incentive for the small business owner. It may be the \ndifference between setting up that new restaurant or moving forward to \nadd that employee that will not only help our economy but will help \nthat company discover the way in which we can deal with the cyber \nthreats to this country. So it helps our country, it creates the jobs, \nand this underlying bill should be discussed on the floor of the Senate \nwithout filibusters that deny us that chance.\n  I also thank Senator Landrieu. Senator Landrieu, the chair of the \nSmall Business Committee, has put forward a series of amendments. I am \nproud to have worked with her on the amendment she has brought forward \nthat adds some provisions that are extremely important.\n  I know in the underlying bill, working with Senator Landrieu, we have \nalso the expensing provision. That is an important provision. As I am \nsure the Senator from Connecticut understands, that provision allows a \nbusiness owner to go out and make a capital investment, to buy a piece \nof equipment. Rather than having to write it off over 3 years or 5 \nyears or 10 years, they can write it off immediately, having the \nability to buy that piece of equipment, to grow their business, and to \nbe able to then write off the cost. It is just a timing issue for the \nbusinessperson, but it is the difference between making the investment \nor not making the investment, creating a job or not creating a job.\n  By the way, by buying that piece of equipment, that business owner is \nalso helping another business owner who is selling that piece of \nequipment, to get our economy back moving again. It is those types of \ncommonsense provisions that have always enjoyed broad bipartisan \nsupport in the Senate--always. These are provisions we have had \nDemocrats and Republicans working on together. We need to do that \ntoday.\n  Let's move on with the bill. We have had it on the floor of the \nSenate now a couple days. Let's move on and start voting, but do not \nfilibuster. Let's vote on relevant amendments. Can't we just stick with \nthe small business issues and vote on that in order to help our economy \ngrow?\n  I am also pleased about another provision that is in the Landrieu \namendment and the underlying bill now that we could have a chance to \nvote on that increases the surety bond limits for small businesses. \nThis was passed by the Senate and incorporated into law in February \n2009. I was proud to be the sponsor of this amendment that increased \nthe surety bond limit from $2 million to $5 million.\n  The reason this becomes important is, for a small business owner to \nbe able to get a government contract of over $100,000, they need to \nhave a surety bond. In order to get that surety bond, the small \nbusiness owner has to take, usually, for security, some of their assets \nand pledge them for the surety bond rather than using them for the \ncredit of the company, which is really a catch-22 situation.\n  Increasing the limit from $2 million to $5 million frees up some of \nthat ability because the government comes in, the Small Business \nAdministration comes in and helps them with that surety bond. So if you \nare a construction contractor trying to get a Federal contract, the \ndifference between $2 million and $5 million is a huge difference in \nthe type of contracts that you can compete for.\n  It is interesting that when we looked at it, we had projected it \nwould generate about $147 million in additional bonding activity for \nprojects of over $2 million, and we found that, in fact, it increased \nactivity by $360 million.\n  So the need was there. It generated strong activity. Democrats and \nRepublicans supported it. I was proud of the support of Senator \nLandrieu and Senator Snowe.\n  This is not a controversial issue. The only way we are going to get \nthat increase--that expired in 2010. It is no longer part of the law. \nWe are back to $2 million. So small business owners are at a \ndisadvantage. We just have not had a chance to extend that. It is not \ncontroversial. It brings money into the economy. It is not scored.\n  So we need to be able to get that done. If we cannot get to this \nbill, I do not know when we will get that increase in the surety bond \nlimit. So that is another reason I urge my colleagues to let us vote on \nthis bill to help small businesses in our community. It has always \nenjoyed bipartisan support.\n  Here is what we are asking. My colleagues, we all talk about we want \nto create more jobs. We all talk about supporting small businesses \nbecause we know small businesses are the growth engine of America. We \nall know small businesses create more of the new patents, more of the \nnew innovations per employee than the larger companies do. Let's put \nour action where our words are. We can do that today by allowing the \nSenate to move forward to consider amendments on the Reid bill that is \nbefore us--the Landrieu amendments. Let's move forward with that bill. \nLet's take up relevant amendments that deal with small business\n\n[[Page S4928]]\n\nissues. Let's vote them up or down by a majority vote of the Senate. \nAnd then I am sure, at the end of the day when we put that bill up for \nfinal passage, it will enjoy broad support by the Members of this body. \nAnd it gives the American people confidence that we indeed are focused \non job creation for America.\n  I urge my colleagues to let us move forward on this bill. Let's take \nup the Landrieu amendments, take up the underlying bill. Let's do \nsomething that can help small businesses, help job growth, help our \neconomy, and restore confidence to the American people that we are \nindeed dealing with the agenda they want us to do--moving our country \nforward, moving our economy forward by creating more jobs in our \neconomy.\n  I thank my friend from Connecticut.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Progrowth Tax Reform\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the need for \nprogrowth tax reform.\n  Recently, President Obama--in fact, on Monday--in a speech proposed a \nplan to raise tax rates rather than continuing the current tax rates. \nThat means raising taxes on individuals and small businesses and \nraising the capital gains tax on investment--not only the income tax, \nbut also the capital gains tax on small businesses, individuals, \ncapital gains tax on investments. It also means raising the death tax \non American families--the estate tax.\n  He made that proposal even though he has repeatedly said we cannot \nraise taxes in a recession. He has made that statement repeatedly in \nrecent years, that we cannot raise taxes in a recession because it \nwould hurt the economy, and raising taxes would hurt job creation.\n  But here we were on Monday, and he proposed we raise the tax rates. \nThis is at a time when we have 8.2 percent unemployment; in fact, we \nhave been over 8 percent unemployment for 41 straight months. We have \n13 million people who are unemployed whom we want to get back to work, \nand we have another 10 million who are underemployed. On the order of \n23 million people are either unemployed or underemployed.\n  Since this administration has taken office, middle-class income has \ndeclined from approximately $55,000 to about $50,000. The number of \npeople on food stamps has grown from 32 million recipients to 46 \nmillion recipients. Home values have dropped from an average of about \n$169,000 to an average of about $148,000. In the area of economic \ngrowth, GDP growth is the weakest of any recovery post-World War II. \nThe last quarter, it was reported that it was about a 1.9-percent \nincrease over the prior quarter.\n  In the area of job creation, the report for June, as far as the \nnumber of jobs gained in the month, came out last week. In June, we \ngained about 80,000 jobs. That is far short of the 150,000 jobs we need \nto grow each month just to keep up with population growth.\n  So now the President says the solution is to raise taxes on our job \ncreators. This week, after the President's speech--as I said, he spoke \non Monday--I received a letter from a small business owner in my State \nof North Dakota. I know this individual. In fact, he has a hardware \nstore in Bismarck. I have often gone there for items I need when I am \nworking on my home. In fact, last year, when we had terrible flooding \nthroughout North Dakota, in Minot and other communities--we had \nflooding in Bismarck, and my home is along the Missouri River and was \nin the way of the flood--I often went there to get needed items. He \nruns a good business, a good small business, and it is very helpful. He \nsent me this letter after the President's speech on Monday. I will read \nit. It is short:\n\n       Senator Hoeven:\n       The president's recent comments on raising taxes on high \n     income earners concern me greatly. Perhaps he just doesn't \n     understand that for people like me, who own a business, the \n     bulk of those earnings actually go to the bank payments for \n     what I borrowed to be here. I am actually in danger of being \n     taxed to a point of no living wage for myself. The taxes and \n     bank payments come first. Out of an income that classifies me \n     as rich, I actually take $40,000 home to my family. How much \n     more do they want?\n       John, you've shopped in my store, you've seen all how we \n     have grown, and you know people like me would use every \n     available dime to grow more. This president's programs not \n     only limit my company's potential to grow, but they destroy \n     any incentive to work and hire more people. I just don't know \n     if he doesn't understand what he's doing, or just doesn't \n     care.\n       Please, Senator Hoeven, share with your partners in the \n     Senate how critical an issue this is for small business \n     owners like me. Oh, and Thanks for Shopping at Ace when \n     you're home in Bismarck.\n       Jeffrey Hinz, Kirkwood Ace Hardware.\n\n  I think Jeff sums it up well--better than I could. Jeff represents \nmillions of small businesses across this country that are the very \nbackbone of our economy. They hire the people, they pay the wages, they \npay the taxes. They fuel the growth and the dynamism of our economy. In \nshort, they make our economy go. Small business in this country makes \nour economy go.\n  Yet the President's proposal would raise taxes on about 1 million \nbusiness owners, hurting their ability to grow our economy, hurting our \nability to get those 13 million unemployed people back to work.\n  That is not the way to go. Very clearly, that is not the way to go. \nThis administration's policies are making it worse. But the President \nsays everyone needs to pay their fair share. How many times have you \nheard him say that? Well, of course, everyone needs to pay their fair \nshare. But the way to do it is with progrowth tax reform and closing \nloopholes, not by raising taxes on some people, some businesses, and \nnot others.\n  That is what we have proposed. We have proposed progrowth tax reform \nand closing loopholes. Let's extend the current tax rates for 1 year \nand set up a process to pass progrowth tax reforms that lower rates, \nclose loopholes, are fair, simpler, and will generate the revenue to \nreduce our debt and deficit, along with savings and spending less--\ncontrolling government spending, but that will generate the economic \ngrowth to drive revenue, not higher taxes.\n  The reality is that is the only way to get on top of our debt and \ndeficit and to get people back to work. We need economic growth to \nreduce the debt and deficit, along with more savings at the Federal \nlevel, controlling spending, and we need economic growth to get people \nworking again.\n  That is why we have put forward our approach--a simple approach--to \nextend the current tax rates for another year and set up a process for \ncomprehensive progrowth tax reform. That is the right approach. From \n2000 to 2010, I served as the Governor of my State. That is the \napproach we took. Look at the results in our State of North Dakota. \nLook at the results in States such as Indiana, where that approach has \nbeen taken. It works at the State level. It will work at the Federal \nlevel. We need to do it.\n  I call on President Obama, as well as my colleagues, to engage in \nthis vital effort now for the good of the American people.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Ohio, Mr. Brown, be recognized following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   National Defense Authorization Act\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this body for 50 years has passed the \nNational Defense Authorization Act, and for 50 years, after conference, \nit has reached the President's desk and been signed by the President of \nthe United States.\n  There are many pressing issues that confront the Senate, the \nCongress, and the Nation. But I don't think we should forget that our \nfirst obligation is to secure the safety of our citizens, and that can \nonly be done by training, arming, and equipping the men and women who \nare serving in the military.\n  Mr. President, a couple of months ago, through the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, we passed the National Defense Authorization Act, \nand it has some very important components in it to continue to support \nthe men and women who are serving, and their families, and to provide \nthem with the equipment and training they need to defend this Nation.\n\n[[Page S4929]]\n\n  We are still in conflict in Afghanistan. We are on the brink of a \ncrisis with Iran over nuclear weapons. We have adjusted our presence in \nAsia in response to the rising influence of China. The uprising in \nSyria threatens to spill over into neighboring countries. And, of \ncourse, the situation in Egypt is clearly one of significant question \nas to how the Egyptian Government and people will progress. Some would \nargue that in many respects the State of Israel is under more threat \nthan at any time since perhaps the 1973 war. So we live in a dangerous \nworld. We live in a very uncertain time. And it seems to me our \npriorities should be to bring the national defense authorization bill \nto the floor.\n  The bill received a unanimous vote in committee by both Republicans \nand Democrats. I am proud of the relationship the chairman and I have \ndeveloped over many years of working together. I am confident that \ndespite the fact there will be hundreds of amendments filed, we can \nwork through those and work through the process, as we have in the \npast, and bring the Defense authorization bill to a conclusion and to \nconference with the House and then signed by the President of the \nUnited States. We owe this to the men and women who are serving in the \nmilitary. It is not our right, it is our obligation to get the \nauthorization bill to the President's desk.\n  We may have significant disagreements, but for 50 years this body has \npassed the Defense authorization bill and it has been signed by the \nPresident of the United States. We are in some danger of not getting \nthis done this year when we look at the remaining weeks we have in \nsession and the number of challenges that are before us. So I think it \nis time we step back and look at the requirement to pass this \nlegislation.\n  I have some sympathy for the majority leader in that there is great \ndifficulty in the way we are doing business nowadays. But I hope my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle will all recognize the importance \nof this legislation. We must urge Members on both sides to set aside \ntheir own personal agendas and do what is necessary for the defense of \nthis Nation.\n  The bill provides $525 billion for the base budget of the Defense \nDepartment, $88 billion for operations in Afghanistan and around the \nworld, and $17.8 billion to maintain our nuclear deterrent. The bill \nauthorizes $135 billion for military personnel, including the cost of \npay, allowances, bonuses, and a 1.7-percent across-the-board pay \nincrease for all members of the uniformed services--something I think \nall of us would agree is well-earned. That is, by the way, also the \nPresident's request. It improves the quality of life for the men and \nwomen in the Active and Reserve components of the All-Volunteer Force \nand helps to address the needs of the wounded servicemembers and their \nfamilies.\n  As we and our NATO partners reduce operations in Afghanistan, the \nimportance of transitioning responsibility to Afghan forces increases, \nas does the need to provide for the protection of our deployed troops. \nThis legislation provides our service men and women with the resources, \ntraining, equipment, and authorities they need to succeed in combat and \nstability operations. It enhances the capability of U.S. forces to \nsupport the Afghan National Security Forces and Afghan local police as \nthey assume responsibility for security throughout Afghanistan by the \nyear 2014.\n  Weapons systems modernization is essential to the future viability of \nour national security strategy, and this legislation provides for \nsubstantial improvement of legacy ships, aircraft, and vehicles, while \nauthorizing research and development investments to ensure our troops \nremain the best equipped in the world. The bill authorizes the \nPresident's request for missile defense and accelerates support for our \nallies, including the joint U.S.-Israeli cooperative missile defense \nprograms, such as the Arrow weapon system and the David's Sling short-\nrange missile defense system. It also provides multiyear procurement \nauthority for the Chinook helicopters, V-22 aircraft, Virginia-class \nsubmarines, and Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, reflecting estimated \nsavings of more than $7 billion over 5 years. And none of this can take \nplace unless we pass the authorization bill.\n  The committee also sought to improve the ability of the armed \nservices to counter nontraditional threats, including terrorism, cyber \nwarfare, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. I \nbelieve the key battlefield of the 21st century will be cyber warfare, \nand I am concerned about our ability to fight and win in this new \ndomain. To improve the Defense Department's cyber capabilities, this \nlegislation consolidates defense networks to improve security and \nmanagement, which will permit personnel to be reassigned to support \noffensive cyber missions, which are understaffed.\n  The issue of nuclear proliferation is addressed, and other programs \nto counter the flow of improvised explosive devices and curtail the \ntrade of worldwide narcotics are authorized in this bill.\n  Especially important are provisions to enhance the capability of the \nsecurity forces of allied and friendly nations to defeat al-Qaida, its \naffiliates, and other violent extremist organizations. The Armed \nServices Committee extended the Defense Department's authority to train \nand equip forces in Yemen to counter al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula \nand forces in east Africa to counter al-Qaida affiliates and elements \nof al-Shabaab.\n  To ensure proper stewardship of taxpayer dollars and compliance with \nlaw and regulation, the bill promotes aggressive and thorough oversight \nof the Department's programs and activities. This includes adding \nfunding for the Department of Defense inspector general. The Department \nof Defense inspector general reviews resulted in an estimated $2.6 \nbillion in savings in 2011--a return on investment of more than $8 for \nevery $1 spent. The committee mark also codifies the 2014 goal for the \nDepartment of Defense to achieve an auditable statement of budgetary \nresources.\n  Further, it improves the cost-effectiveness of DOD contracting by \nlimiting the use of cost-type contracts for the production of major \nweapons systems. In addition, the bill includes a series of wartime \ncontracting provisions drawn from the McCaskill-Webb bill implementing \nthe recommendations of the Commission on Wartime Contracting. In that \nvein, the bill enhances protections for contractors that blow the \nwhistle on waste, fraud, and abuse in defense contracts.\n\n  Finally, this legislation requires the Secretary of Defense to submit \na detailed report to Congress on the impact budget sequestration will \nhave on military readiness and national security. Similar legislative \nlanguage has been passed twice by this body and by the House of \nRepresentatives. The Congress does not yet have an accurate \nunderstanding of the implications of sequester beyond an assertion that \nthe cuts would be ``devastating,'' which is the word used by Secretary \nof Defense Leon Panetta and nearly every other defense official we have \nqueried. We must have this information as we begin the work of \ndeveloping a balanced approach to deficit reduction that replaces \nsequestration with a responsible plan for getting our Nation's finances \nin order.\n  I want to repeat, Mr. President, that for 50 years, I am proud to \nsay--and in the years I have been in this, obviously--we have \nsuccessfully authorized the programs and policies of the Department of \nDefense. I am proud of what this committee has done. I am proud of what \nthe Senate has done. I am proud of what the Congress has done and the \nPresidents these pieces of legislation have come before for their \nsignature. Let's not allow the anticipation of an election to hinder \nour ability to act in the interests of the men and women who are so \nbravely serving our Nation.\n  I hope the majority leader, in consultation with the Republican \nleader, will come to an agreement so that we can have a date certain. \nAnd I can assure the leadership on both sides that Senator Levin and I \nwill again be able to expedite this process, allowing amendments and \ndebate as they are called for and at the same time come to a successful \nconclusion and make this the 51st year we have succeeded in doing what \nis necessary to fulfill our most solemn and important obligation, which \nis to do everything within our power to ensure the security of this \nNation.\n\n[[Page S4930]]\n\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio.

Madam President, I rise to address a problem \nfacing too many communities across the country, including small towns \nand big cities, suburbs and remote rural areas.\n  Servicemembers who have risked their lives protecting our Nation \nshouldn't have to wonder whether they will be able to find a job when \nthey leave the service. Unfortunately, far too many do.\n  On Monday, I was in Youngstown in northeast Ohio speaking to Army \nveteran Pedro Colon. He is one of the first Mahoning County area \nveterans to be approved for VRAP.\n  VRAP is a particularly important program for veterans in this \ncountry. It stands for Veterans Retraining Assistance Program. We just \nauthorized it under the VOW to Hire Heroes Act. I am the first Ohio \nSenator ever to sit on the Veterans' Committee for a full term, and I \ntake that responsibility seriously. One of the outreach training \nefforts put together by Senator Murray in the Veterans' Committee is \nVRAP.\n  Mr. Pedro Colon, Jr., is a high school graduate in his early fifties. \nEven though he served in an Army medical laboratory as a specialist, \ncivilian employers wouldn't accept his military training experience. As \nthe Presiding Officer knows, having such a huge military presence in \nher State, in many cases employers are reluctant to hire veterans. \nPerhaps they are afraid they haven't been tested for PTSD or, for \nwhatever reason, employers far too often seem reluctant to hire \nveterans. We know the unemployment levels are higher among veterans \nthan they are the rest of the population. We know there is a particular \nproblem for veterans who are a little bit older, who, as in the case of \nMr. Colon, are middle-aged. We also know sometimes veterans, \nparticularly if they came out of high school and went directly into \nservice, might not know when leaving the service how to apply for a \njob, how to do a resume, all the things people learn to do when they \nare stateside in the civilian workforce.\n  Because of VRAP, Mr. Colon will study at the Mahoning County Career \nand Technical Center, beginning in September, to train to become a \nmedical assistant--something he knows something about from his military \nservice but was not certified and, unfortunately, unemployable in that \nfield.\n  We have a responsibility to the Pedro Colons of the world to do \nsomething about these thousands of older veterans who are jobless or \nunemployed. VRAP is for veterans 35 to 60. The GI bill--which most of \nus in this Chamber supported earlier--helped those returning \nservicemembers a little bit younger than 35, not as much as it should \nhave but in a significant way. But for many who, similar to Mr. Colon, \nare older than that, the opportunity to benefit from much of the GI \nbill has expired.\n  As we invest in our servicemembers in times of war, we should do so \nwhen they return to their communities, when they hang up their \nuniforms, and when they embark in the next phase of their lives.\n  We have a role to play, and this is a case where government can step \nin and help the private sector do what is right to serve those veterans \nwho served us. That is why the Veterans Retraining Assistance Program--\nwhich is a joint Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Labor \ntraining initiative--is so important.\n  Last year Congress passed and President Obama signed into law the VOW \nto Hire Heroes Act, which honors our government's obligation to our \nveterans. VRAP, a component of that law, provides unemployed veterans \nbetween the ages of 35 and 60 the opportunity to pursue training for \nnew careers in high-demand occupations.\n  As of July 12, some 33,000 applications have been received nationally \nfor the VRAP. The program was limited to 99,000 participants through \nMarch 31, 2014. All of us must do everything we can to spread the word \nto eligible veterans. The number was restricted to 99,000 and the \nexpiration date was set at March 31, in large part, so we could see how \nthis program worked, we could measure it and we could reintroduce it \nand continue it, if it is as effective as I and as most of us on the \nVeterans' Committee think it will be.\n  Tony Blankenship, another Ohioan from Martins Ferry in Belmont County \non the Ohio River in eastern Ohio, across from Wheeling, WV, was an \nunemployed iron worker and plans to study at Belmont College for a \ncareer as a medical assistant.\n  There are hundreds of different kinds of jobs and tens of thousands \nof slots for people to sign up. In my State, they can go to the \nVeterans Service Commission. Ohio is one of those lucky States--not \nevery State does this--that has a Veterans Service Commission funded by \ntaxpayers in local communities. Every county seat, I believe, has a \nveterans service officer and a Veterans Service Commission, the chief \nfunction of which is to serve returning veterans with health care, \neducation, and a whole host of issues, such as job training, for \ninstance, that a veteran might deal with.\n  So programs such as VOW to Hire a Heroes Act and VRAP are not only \nabout opportunities for veterans; they are about helping businesses \nstrengthen our economy by meeting the demand for high-skilled workers. \nWe are seeing businesses leverage public and private resources to hire \nveterans and expand operations. I met with veterans and veterans \nadvocates from Dayton and Dublin to Mansfield, Chillicothe, Cleveland \nand Columbus and lots of places around my State to talk to them about \nhow we can partner to help businesses hire unemployed veterans.\n  In North Canton I worked with the Chesapeake Energy Corporation to \nconvene a job fair for Ohio veterans seeking employment as equipment \noperators, truckdrivers, electronic technicians, and other high-demand \ncareers, perhaps in the shale development industry.\n  In Cleveland State University's SERV Program, staff discussed their \nnational model of helping servicemembers and veterans transition to \ncivilian life through education and workforce training.\n  At a roundtable I did on Veterans Day at Cleveland State 4 or 5 years \nago, I talked to veterans and to school administrators about the \nimportance of integrating service men and women who have recently left \nthe military back into the classroom, thinking about the 25-year-old \nyoung man or woman who had been in combat in Iraq sitting in class next \nto an 18-year-old suburban young man or young woman who had no idea of \nthe kind of life experiences the veteran, only 6 or 7 years older \nchronologically but much older in what he or she had seen in combat. \nCleveland State has figured this out, as has Youngstown State, and they \nhave been national models for ways of integrating these service men and \nwomen back into the classroom to be able to go out into the workforce.\n  In Columbus, where I held a field hearing on veterans unemployment in \nDecember, the Solar by Soldiers Program is hiring veterans to install \nenergy technology.\n  We need to spread the word about training programs, such as VRAP, \nthat will help provide our veterans with the necessary skills to find \ngood-paying jobs. It is part of our job to serve those who have served \nus so faithfully and so well.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, it is always good to see the gallery \nfull, people in town visiting this process, this week in the Senate. We \nhave actually had a pretty interesting week. We have had a chance to \ntalk about the economy and taxes, something I wish we had spent more \ntime talking about in the months since I got elected last year to the \nSenate. In a few moments, later this afternoon we will have a vote on a\n\n[[Page S4931]]\n\nbill that has been called a tax cut bill. The problem with it--and I \nwant people watching here who are maybe not fully familiar with the \nprocess, a process I am still learning, to understand--what is going to \nhappen is Republicans had a bunch of ideas we wanted included. We \nprobably were not going to win those votes. We are not the majority. \nBut we wanted those ideas to be discussed, and instead we have been \ntold that cannot happen, that the majority is going to pick which of \nour ideas they want to listen to and the others will be put aside.\n  The problem with that is the people of Florida sent me here and, just \nlike there are 99 other people who serve here, they have a right to \nhave their voice heard. Unfortunately some of the ideas we have offered \nwill not get a vote, and therefore we will not be able to move forward \non that bill as a result. One of the only things the minority party can \ndo in this process here in the Senate to ensure our voices are heard is \nensure we are not going to allow legislation to move forward unless the \nrights of the minority are respected because, after all, we represent \nAmericans as well who have different ideas than the majority and have a \nright to have their voices heard. I hope we get back to a point where \nthe Senate works the way it was designed to work--the Senate I ran to \nbe a part of, not the Senate we are part of here today.\n  I do think what has been good about this week is we have had a chance \nto talk about the economy. I know people at home are hearing a lot \nabout the economy, about jobs and about the debt, so I am trying to \nmake some sense of it for folks calling our office. One of the best \nways to do that is come here on the floor of the Senate and be able to \nspeak about these issues, not just to the people sitting here today but \nto the folks who are going to watch back at home or later on on YouTube \nor wherever this video might be available to them.\n  What I want to talk a little bit about today is the debt and what \nthat means. What it basically means is the Government of the United \nStates borrows money to pay for our costs because we spend more money \nthan we take in. The Federal Government, your government, spends more \nmoney every year than it takes in in taxes and other fees. The only way \nit can get the money to pay for these things is they have to borrow it \nby selling something called bonds. They sell this debt that we have to \npay back over the years. That is how we fund our Government. \nUnfortunately, almost a third is funded in that way. What has happened \nover the years is because we have spent consistently more than we have \ntaken in--that is called the deficit. Every year when you spend more \nthan what you take in, the annual amount you owe is called the deficit, \nbut it starts building up something called the national debt. Today we \nowe about just over $15 trillion of money that we are going to have to \npay back. Let me correct that--that you are going to have to pay back \nthrough your taxes now and in the future. In fact, your great-\ngrandchildren are going to have to pay it back. That is the national \ndebt. The problem with the national debt is it has become an enormous \npart of our national economy. It has grown to a very dangerous level as \na percentage of our overall economy.\n  What is the way to solve it? The only way to solve it is growth. The \nonly way to solve this problem is to grow our economy. If our economy \ngrows, then the debt becomes smaller as a percentage of our overall \neconomy. Think of it almost as a pie. If the pie gets bigger, the slice \ngets smaller if you keep it constant. It is the same thing with the \ndebt. If we can keep the debt constant and we can grow the economy, \nthen our debt becomes less problematic. That is the solution to this \nproblem.\n  As a point of emphasis, let me tell you, let's suppose we wanted to \nget back to what our debt was in 2007. We want our debt to be what it \nwas in 2007. In order to do that, we would have to come up with over $1 \ntrillion this year to get us back to what our debt was as a percentage \nback in 2007. It basically means we would have to come up with that \npermanently. The functional reality is that to do that we would either \nhave to double everybody's taxes or we would have to cut close to a \nthird of our budget right now.\n  The point is, we cannot tax our way out, cut our way out of this \nissue. Definitely there have to be cuts. But we cannot cut our way out \nof this and we certainly cannot tax our way out of it. If you double \nthe tax rates in this country, which is what you would have to do to \nget us back to 2007, No. 1, you would trigger a massive recession. I \nmean the economy would stop. But, No. 2, it would be impossible to \ncollect it. It is unrealistic.\n  I am citing those numbers to give an example of why we cannot raise \ntaxes. We cannot tax our way out of this problem and we cannot simply \ncut our way out of it either. The only solution is growth, dynamic \ngrowth--not slow growth, big growth. That is the only solution because \nif the economy grows, more jobs are created. If more jobs are created, \nyou have more taxpayers. If someone is unemployed right now, they are \nnot paying income tax. Now they get a job or get a raise at their job. \nEven if the rates stay the same, they are paying more taxes. Now the \ngovernment has more money to pay down the debt--if it doesn't grow the \ngovernment. And that has been the problem over the last few years. Our \nrevenue has grown. The amount of money coming into the government has \nactually gone up. But the spending has gone up even more and that is \nwhy the deficit grows and why the debt grows. That is how growth would \nsolve this problem. If the economy grows, more people have jobs and \nthey get raises at their jobs. That means people get more money which \nleads to more growth because they spend that money and invest that \nmoney, but it also means they are generating more, but for government, \nand now the government has more to pay down the debt and they have to \nborrow less. So that is the solution. Growth is the solution, growing \nthe economy.\n  How do we grow the economy faster? The economy grows because of the \nprivate sector, that is how. Real growth comes from businesses, it \ncomes from private sector growth, from small businesses and from big \nbusinesses, from dry cleaners, from gas stations, from convenience \nstores, from the guy who cuts your yard and your lawn--that is growth, \nprivate sector growth.\n\n  Here is the truth. If you look at the statistics, it is undeniable. \nThe bigger the government the smaller the private sector--because there \nis only so much money in the world. And the only place government gets \nits money is either it has to tax or borrow it from the private sector. \nThat is--unless it is going to print more money which has a whole other \nset of problems we will talk about 1 day--the only way your government \ncan get more money to grow, if it takes it from you, from the private \nsector. It either has to tax you or it has to borrow the money from \nyou. Either way, it is money that the government has to take out of the \nprivate world to grow the government.\n  Here is what happens when you take money out of the private world. \nThat money is no longer available to save, because if you save it you \nare putting it in a bank and the bank can now use that money to give \nyou a mortgage. Or that is money you no longer have to spend, which \nmeans businesses have fewer customers and the customers they do have \nare spending less money.\n  Let me tell you the functional application of that. If you are a \nwaiter or waitress at a restaurant and people are not spending as much \nbecause they do not have the money, they are spending it in taxes, this \nmeans they are going to restaurants less, which means you are going to \nmake less money in both tips and wages. It may even mean your hours get \ncut. Millions of Americans know this reality. This is not a theory, \nthis is a reality. If people have less money to spend, they cannot \nspend it at the place where you work, and if they do not have the money \nto spend at the place where you work, you will make less money, you \nwill work less hours, and you may even lose your job.\n  The other thing the private sector can do with this money is invest \nit, and that is when you get growth in the economy. When a business or \nbusiness man or woman makes some money and they take the money and \ndecide, you know what I am going to do this with money? I am going to \nuse it to grow my business or I am going to use it to start a new \nbusiness. The problem is, if government takes some of this money from \nthem, they can't do that. That is\n\n[[Page S4932]]\n\nwhy the bigger the government, the smaller the private sector, and the \nsmaller the private sector, the smaller the growth, which is our only \nsolution. That is not a theory, that is a reality. Statistics prove \nthat the bigger the government, the higher the unemployment rate. I \nshould have brought the chart I have that shows that every time \ngovernment size and spending go up, the unemployment rate goes up. Why? \nFor the reasons I just explained. That money the government used to \ngrow came out of the private sector. That is money businesses now don't \nhave to invest or spend.\n\n  Let me talk about another place where it hurts. The higher the \ngovernment, the worse the stock market does. Why is that? I will \nexplain why. People buy stock on the hope that they can make a profit \non that stock in the future. The problem is that the more the \ngovernment spends, the higher the taxes will have to be in the future \nto pay for that. So if people think taxes in the future are going to be \nhigher and therefore their chances for making money on stock are going \nto be less, they are not going to buy stock.\n  Here is the problem. When people buy shares of stock, what they are \nbasically doing is investing money in companies. They are investing \nmoney in companies so that the company can grow and make more money, \nand then the company pays back a profit. But if people are no longer \nwilling to invest money in companies, those companies cannot grow. If \nthose companies cannot grow, that is where people become unemployed, \nthat is where people's hours get cut, and that is where new jobs are \nnot created. It is also why kids who are graduating from college can't \nfind a job. The money has to come from somewhere, and the bigger the \ngovernment, the less that is available in the private sector to grow. \nThese are facts.\n  Now, what are the arguments around here? Well, the Bush tax cuts are \nthe existing Tax Code. The Bush tax cuts led to this debt. Well, George \nBush cut taxes, and as result the government didn't generate enough \nmoney, and that is why we have this debt.\n  That is false. Our government has grown impressively over the last \ndecade. The problem is that the amount of money we spent has grown even \nfaster.\n  Listen, it doesn't matter if you get a raise. If you get a raise but \nyour spending grows by even more, you are not going to notice the \ndifference. If you get a $10,000 raise but you buy something that costs \n$20,000 more than what you are spending now, you are going to owe more \nmoney. That is what we have done here in Washington--certainly before I \ngot here.\n  By the way, both parties are to blame. Unfortunately, this is a \nbipartisan debt, and what has happened is that even though the \ngovernment has generated more money, it has spent even more. So it is \nnot the Bush tax cuts. That is just not true.\n  The fact is we have a spending problem. Let me explain what is so \ndangerous about this spending problem. The Federal Government has grown \nfast in the past. We have had periods like this before. Let me tell you \nwhen they were: the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, World War I, and \nWorld War II. During those four periods, government spending grew \nreally fast. But here is the difference: When the war was over, the war \nwas over. The war happened, we won World War II, and things went back \nto normal. The difference now is that this is not because of a war, \nthis is because we have grown the government. This is permanent. That \nis the difference between the spike in spending and the other spending \nin the past. This spike in spending is permanent. That means it is here \nto stay unless we change. There is no going back to normal.\n  We have a serious problem, and I have explained why the debt hurts \neveryone at home. If you are unemployed, if you are underemployed, if \nyou are working twice as hard and making half as much, the debt is part \nof the problem because the government has taken money out of the \nprivate sector. It is money that used to go to you and is now going to \nthe government now and in the future. So the debt is part of the reason \nwhy the economy is not growing and why jobs are not being created.\n  At the end of the day, we cannot tax and simply cut our way out of \nthis. Let me be clear. There are places to save money. I promise, the \nFederal Government wastes money. We should find that, and we should \neliminate it. It is never a good idea to waste money. But we can't just \ncut our way out, and we certainly can't tax our way out of this debt \nproblem. We have to grow our way out of this debt problem. We have to \ngrow our economy out of it, not our government out of it. The only way \nto grow our economy is for the private sector to grow, but the evidence \nis clear that the bigger the government, the smaller the private \nsector. So therein lies the answer.\n  When we talk about holding constant and lowering the size of \ngovernment, it is not some ideological talking point. This is not some \nconservative-versus-liberal talking point. This is evidence-based. This \na fact, and the statistics are clear that the bigger the government, \nthe higher the unemployment rate. The bigger the government, the worse \nthe stock market performs. The bigger the government, the less money \nthere is available to create jobs in the private sector, start new \nbusinesses, or grow existing businesses. That is why we have to shrink \nthe size of our government. The sooner we do it, the better we are \ngoing to be, and that is what I hope we will work on here in a \nbipartisan fashion. Both parties helped to create this situation, and \nnow I hope both parties will help to work to solve it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Transparency in Government\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, President Obama and his administration \nclaim to be open and above board in their actions. As recently as July \n1, the White House Chief of Staff, Jack Lew, told a television \naudience:\n\n       This administration has been the most transparent \n     administration ever.\n\n  So I come to the floor now to say that is simply not the case, and I \nam going to highlight an outstanding example of how it is not the case.\n  Last month, an attorney with the Department of Justice from the Civil \nRights Division attended a public meeting in Louisiana--a public \nmeeting in her official capacity. Before the meeting began, this \nattorney, Rachel Hranitzky, reportedly asked whether any \nrepresentatives of the media were present at this meeting. A reporter \nfrom the Daily Iberian identified himself. This Justice Department \nattorney then announced: ``You can quote those who speak, but you can't \nquote me.''\n  On what basis does the Justice Department presume to tell a reporter \nwho can be quoted at a public meeting? The reporter had the same \nquestion. It has been reported that he asked her to cite legal \nauthority which would support her claim that he could not quote a \nJustice Department attorney at a public meeting. Ms. Hranitzky provided \nno such law. She did say the Justice Department has special rules on \nhow its attorneys can be quoted. She did not back up that statement, \nhowever. So here is a public meeting anyone could attend and hear a \nlawyer from their government speak on civil rights enforcement. Yet a \nrepresentative of that government claimed that it was the policy of the \nJustice Department that the press would have fewer rights than the \ngeneral public to quote what that government representative said at \nthat public meeting. This undercuts the claim that ``[t]his \nAdministration has been the most transparent administration ever,'' \ngoing back to the quote of the Chief of Staff.\n  This refusal to allow the public to know how government officials are \nperforming their job is totally unacceptable--and I hope to everybody \nit would be unacceptable.\n  As appalling as this reported action was, what followed was even \nworse. Ms. Hranitzky tried to kick the reporter out of an open meeting \nbecause he questioned her. She relented after he said--regrettably but \nunderstandably, in my view--that he would not quote her.\n  Then the Justice Department attorney totally abused her power, \naccording to press reports. She told the reporter she could have the \nJustice Department call the newspaper's publishers or editors and say \nsomething such as this: You don't want to get on the Department of \nJustice's bad side.\n  That statement represents a raw abuse of power.\n  We expect the Justice Department to investigate law-breaking and \npursue appropriate cases without regard to politics. Threatening to use \nthe power to bring a criminal case or civil action against any entity \nbecause it had the temerity to insist that the Department of Justice \nobey the first amendment is outrageous.\n  The newspaper has protested to the Justice Department and has not, to \nmy knowledge, received any response. The Department's public comment on \nthe incident does not deny that any of the reported statements were \nmade.\n  That the Civil Rights Division and the Department of Justice have not \ncommitted to allowing the press to quote its attorneys at public \nmeetings a month after one of its attorneys has claimed that it is the \nDepartment's policy not to permit such reporting is completely \nunacceptable. It leads one to ask: What does the Civil Rights Division \nwish to hide?\n  I have received many complaints concerning the enforcement actions of \nthe Civil Rights Division. When the division's attorneys will not allow \nthemselves to be quoted, we can only conclude that they are saying \nthings about enforcing the law that the American people would never \naccept.\n  There are no statutes that deny the media the right to quote \nstatements of Justice Department officials that are made at public \nmeetings. If there were, they would violate the first amendment's \nprotection of freedom of speech as well as protection of freedom of the \npress. There should be no Justice Department policies to that effect \neither, and for the very same reason.\n  This administration says it is transparent. It wants people to \nbelieve that, but then it wants to prevent the press from reporting \nwhat it says in public. To carry out that plan, it threatens those \nreporters with a politically motivated legal action. That is thuggish, \nnot transparent.\n  To the extent the Department has a policy of preventing the press \nfrom quoting the statements of its attorneys at public meetings, that \npolicy should be reversed immediately to comply with the first \namendment. Whether it has a policy or not, the attorney who claimed \nthat such a policy existed and tried to expel the reporter from a \npublic meeting because he might quote her, and threatened the reporter \nfor getting on the Department of Justice's bad side, should be \nappropriately disciplined.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I have said repeatedly that the people of our State cannot \nwait until after the election for Congress to work on solutions to \nspeed up our economic recovery. That is why I am pleased the Senate has \nagreed to consider this small business legislation.\n  This is a bill that will help North Carolinians get back to work this \nyear in industries such as health care, finance, construction, \nmanufacturing, and retail.\n  This legislation supports businesses that expand payroll or invest in \nnew equipment, and there are estimates that it will put 27,000 \nunemployed people in my State back to work. It does this by creating an \nincentive for North Carolina small businesses to add new jobs in 2012 \nby giving businesses a 10-percent income tax credit on new payroll.\n  And it encourages businesses to make new investment by extending the \n100-percent business deduction on qualified property. Providing real \ntax relief that lowers the cost of doing business should be a \nbipartisan idea and it is one I will support.\n  I also want to express my deep appreciation to the Small Business \nCommittee chair, Senator Landrieu, for including a proposal of mine in \nher SUCCESS Act amendment. This amendment would put us on the path to \nestablishing a common application for small businesses to apply for \nFederal assistance across agencies, across departments, and programs \nwith a single application.\n  Frequently I hear from small business owners who tell me that \ngovernment redtape is preventing them from growing their businesses and \ncreating jobs. We need to slim down this bureaucratic redtape. I \nbelieve our small business should not have to be responsive to the \nwhims of the Federal bureaucracy. The Federal Government needs to be \nresponsive to the needs of our small businesses.\n  In February, I introduced the Small Business Common Application Act, \nwhich would establish a common application that allows small business \nowners to apply for grants, seek technical assistance, and bid on \ncontracts from the Federal Government with a single form. It would \nfunction much like the common application students use today to apply \nto multiple colleges and universities.\n\n[[Page S4934]]\n\n  Senator Landrieu's amendment would put us on the path toward creating \na common application by establishing an interagency executive committee \nwith representatives from 12 different agencies and departments that \nwill report back to Congress and the SBA within 270 days on whether a \ncommon application is feasible.\n  This is a commonsense bill that I believe both sides of the aisle can \nagree to to cut the paperwork burden on our small business owners.\n  I ask unanimous consent that all time spent in quorum calls be \nequally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, before too long here we are going to be \nvoting. We are going to have three votes, I think, on whether we are \ngoing to move forward on a tax bill. I frankly think there are things \nin the underlying bill that is before us today that would do some good. \nThe bonus depreciation provision is something many of us have supported \nin the past. We think that is good tax policy with regard to \nencouraging small businesses to invest, by giving them a quicker way to \nwrite off those capital investments. So there are some things in the \nunderlying bill that make some sense.\n  But the whole exercise we are going through here is a charade for a \ncouple of reasons. One, you cannot originate revenue measures in the \nSenate. That is something that has to happen in the House of \nRepresentatives. So anything that comes out of here, if it were to \npass, would be blue-slipped by the House of Representatives. You have a \nconstitutional issue to deal with here in the first place.\n  Secondly, you have a procedure, a process set up whereby there is not \nan opportunity for us to offer amendments. We put a tax bill on the \nfloor, a piece of legislation, a vehicle that ought to be open to \namendment. There are many of us with ideas about things that we think \nwould promote economic growth and create jobs in our economy, but we \nare not going to have the opportunity to offer those amendments.\n  Frankly, a tax debate is something that many of us welcome. We think \nthat talking about taxes is certainly something that, if you are \nsomeone who is concerned about the economy, if you are someone who is \nconcerned about getting Americans back to work, certainly talking about \nthe Tax Code and its impact on our economy is a very relevant debate. \nFrankly, we ought to be headed toward a reform of our Tax Code which \ntoday is way too complicated and, frankly, it needs to be overhauled.\n  But in the interim, we have coming up now on January 1 of next year a \nbunch of tax provisions, current tax policy, that expires. In \nanticipation of that, we have a lot of businesses that are very \nconcerned. There is uncertainty out there among job creators in our \neconomy about what is going to happen on January 1, and is Congress \ngoing to act to put off these tax increases that will occur on January \n1 or are they going to allow them go into effect, in which case many \nbusinesses would be dramatically impacted by having higher tax burdens, \nmaking it more difficult for them to create jobs.\n  I do not think there is anybody out there, those who study economics, \neven those of us who do not, just as a matter of common sense, on a \nvery practical level, who would think that raising taxes on people who \ncreate jobs, on small businesses, would be something that would be good \nin an economy that you are trying to get back on its feet, trying to \nget to recover.\n  In fact, the President of the United States in 2010 said it would be \na blow to our economy if tax rates went up on small businesses. Well, \nthat was back at a time when economic growth was a little over 3 \npercent. Here we are 2 years later. Economic growth is much slower. We \nare growing at a more sluggish rate, about 2 percent. There is a \nconcern that even that is going to slow down as we approach the end of \nthe year.\n  And yet we have this threat hanging out there on the horizon, \nlooming, of higher taxes on small businesses, the very people we rely \nupon to get Americans back to work, to create jobs, and to get this \neconomy growing again.\n  What we ought to be thinking about is what can we do to promote \neconomic growth. We ought to be thinking about what are those tax \npolicies we can put in place. I hope that will be the purpose of tax \nreform when we get there. I hope that is soon as well. As I said \nbefore, I think tax reform is critical if we are going to see economic \ngrowth and if we are going to do away with the complex Tax Code we have \ntoday and replace it with something that makes much more sense, it is \nmore clear, more simple, more fair for American businesses and people \nacross this country who are filing their tax returns every year.\n  But we ought to be looking at what can we do to promote economic \ngrowth. All of our tax policy ought to be oriented around getting this \neconomy growing and expanding again, because in so many ways that helps \naddress many of the other problems we are confronting. We have this \nhuge out-of-control debt problem. Obviously it needs to be addressed \nthrough spending reductions, trying to make government more efficient, \nsmaller, more limited, rather than the government we have seen here the \nlast few years that continues to grow as a percentage of our economy. \nThe government as a percentage of our economy today is at the highest \nlevel we have seen literally since the end of World War II. We are at \nabout--24 or 25 percent of our entire GDP now is represented by Federal \nspending. So we have got to get government under control, which means \nwe have got to address some of the drivers of Federal spending, \nincluding Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security. That means these \nentitlement programs so many people rely upon, in order to save them, \nhave to be reformed. If we are going to get them on a sustainable \nfiscal path, if we are going to make sure they are there for future \ngenerations, we have got to reform our entitlement programs and get the \ngovernment spending back at a more reasonable level, more consistent \nwith what we have seen historically, which is about 20 to 21 percent of \nour entire economy.\n\n  So it starts there. But then you have to couple the reductions in \ngovernment spending with economic growth. The way ultimately that we \nget to where we need to be as a Nation is we have to get the economy \ngrowing and expanding again. It is counterintuitive to me and to most \nAmericans, I think, to suggest that the way to do that would be to \nraise taxes on the very people you are looking to to create jobs and to \ngrow this economy. Those are our small businesses. So when the \nPresident came out earlier this week and suggested we ought to allow \nthe tax rates to expire for people who make more than $250,000, what he \nwas talking about, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, was \nalmost 1 million small businesses, almost 1 million small businesses, \nif we do not take steps to avert it on January 1. They are going to see \ntheir taxes go up. Those small businesses I am referring to employ 25 \npercent of the American workforce. Most of them are small businesses \norganized as subchapter S corporations, LLCs, which means their income \nflows through to their individual tax returns and they pay at the \nindividual rate level.\n  So as a consequence, when you start raising taxes for people above \n$250,000, you are hitting 1 million--almost 1 million, I should say--of \nthose small businesses that are going to be faced with higher tax \nburdens and higher tax liabilities. That to me is completely \ncounterintuitive to what we ought to be thinking if we are interested \nin getting the economy growing again. We should not be making it more \ndifficult, more expensive for small businesses to create jobs, we ought \nto be looking at what we can do to lessen the burden on our small \nbusinesses and to keep that tax burden, that regulatory burden, at a \nlevel that does not create impediments and barriers to them going out \nand investing and creating jobs.\n  The President's proposal is exactly the opposite of what we should be \ndoing. And 53 percent of the income I mentioned--these companies that \nare organized, small businesses as S corporations, LLCs--53 percent of \nthat income would be faced with a higher tax\n\n[[Page S4935]]\n\nburden come January 1 unless we take steps to avert it. What the \nPresident proposed essentially was allowing taxes to go up on those \nvery small businesses.\n  So I hope not only will we turn down the President's proposal, but \nthat we will be thinking about what we can be doing to simplify the Tax \nCode, that would lower rates businesses in this country pay, and \nprovide incentives for them to get people back to work. Again, by that \nI mean policies that promote economic growth.\n  There are so many things we ought to be doing that we are not doing \nnow that I think would provide the necessary policies to encourage and \nenable small businesses to grow their business, make those investments, \nand put people back to work. There are a number of things that our \nsmall businesses face that are not directly related to the Tax Code but \nindirectly related: regulatory burdens and more agencies spending time \non more regulations making it difficult and more expensive to create \njobs.\n  Regulatory reform ought to be part of an agenda here. If we are \nserious about policies that will grow the economy, we ought to deal \nwith the overreaching regulations that create excessive burdens for the \nsmall businesses and couple that with tax reform.\n  One of the burdens we have placed on small businesses of late is the \nObamaCare legislation we passed a few years ago. There has been some \ndebate about the question of whether the individual mandate is a \npenalty or a tax. We know one thing: It is a cost that will be borne by \na lot of people across this country. We also have the mandate or \nrequirements imposed upon small business--employer mandates that will \nincrease the cost of our small businesses--the cost of doing business \nfor them out there.\n  All of these things that have been put in place drive up the cost of \ndoing business, make it more difficult and expensive to create jobs in \nthis country--rather than looking at what we can do to make it less \nexpensive and less difficult to create jobs.\n  Regarding the health care bill, we talked about the individual \nmandate and who is impacted. By the way, according to the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation, 77 percent of the people who would be impacted \nby the individual mandate tax are people who make less than $120,000 a \nyear. The President promised, when he was running for office, he would \nnot raise taxes on anybody who makes less than $250,000 a year. \nClearly, one of the many broken promises in the health care bill was \nthe individual mandate and its impact on the very people on whom he \nsaid he would not raise taxes--middle-income Americans who make less \nthan $120,000 a year. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, 77 \npercent of those people would see higher taxes.\n  It is a significant amount of tax, $54 billion over the next 10 \nyears. If you think about the amount of revenue raised by the \nindividual mandate tax, it is actually more in revenue than would have \nbeen raised by the so-called Buffet tax designed to get millionaires in \nthis country to pay more in taxes. So we are levying a tax on middle-\nincome Americans that actually is going to exceed in revenue the amount \nraised by the so-called tax on millionaires. It is ironic, but that is \nexactly what the ObamaCare bill will do.\n  In addition to that there are a series of other taxes that are \nimposed on people across this country. Many of them strike at middle-\nincome Americans. There are about $250 billion in taxes that are \nimposed on our economy that will be passed on, in many cases, to \nconsumers, and the impact is to raise the cost of health care. Taxes on \nhealth insurance plans, taxes on pharmaceuticals, taxes on medical \ndevices, self-insured health plans--a whole range of taxes that are \nincluded in the ObamaCare legislation, are going to hit middle-income \nAmericans squarely in the face. Not only do we have the individual \nmandate tax but all these others that are included in the ObamaCare \nlegislation that will hit working people across this country.\n  Look at all the burdens associated with those taxes and the \nregulations that are coming out of many of the agencies in our \ngovernment now, and all you see, if you are a small business, is a \nhigher cost of doing business, more uncertainty about what is going to \nhappen in the future, and it is just that much more difficult when it \ncomes to making determinations about growing your business or starting \na new business and creating the jobs that are so important to our \neconomy.\n  When we talk about the economic circumstances that we are in today, \neverybody focuses on the unemployment rate, of course. We have now had \nmore than 8 percent unemployment for 41 straight months. We have 23 \nmillion Americans who are either jobless or underemployed in our \neconomy. And 5.4 million Americans have been unemployed for a long \nperiod of time. We have the weakest recovery, literally, since the end \nof World War II.\n  Yet what is the prescription that the President and many of his \nallies in Congress have for that? Higher taxes. It is higher taxes on \nthe people who create jobs. Can you think of anything that makes less \nsense if you are really interested in economic growth and creating \njobs? That is absolutely the opposite of what we ought to be doing. We \nshould not be raising taxes on those 1 million small businesses--\nsubjecting them and the 25 percent of the workforce who work for them \nto the possibility that there will be higher taxes. Their jobs can be \nin jeopardy.\n  We ought to look for ways to provide certainty, and we should extend \nthe existing rates so small businesses out there trying to make \ndecisions about what they are going to do in the future can know for \nsure what the rules are, but, more importantly, also know that their \ntaxes will not go up on January 1.\n  There is a Congressional Budget Office analysis out there which \nsuggests that come January 1, when we hit the so-called fiscal cliff, \nwhich includes the increase in the tax rates as well as the sequester \non spending that was put into place as part of the Budget Control Act, \nthat if nothing is done to avert that fiscal cliff, in the first 6 \nmonths of next year we will see up to 1.3 percent less economic growth. \nBut just as important, not only is that a factor we deal with next \nyear, it is also something that impacts us right now, today, because \nthe CBO also found it could cost a half point of economic growth this \nyear, right now. It is because of this uncertainty, because of the \nspecter of tax rates going up on small businesses come January 1 of \nnext year.\n  What we ought to be doing instead of talking about what we are going \nto do or raising taxes on small businesses in this economy is looking \nto extend the rates that exist today so those rates don't go up, giving \nbusinesses certainty, and then following up on that next year with \ntax reform which broadens the tax base, lowers rates, gets us more \ncompetitive in the global marketplace, and is more clear, more simple \nand fair for American businesses.\n\n  Until that happens, the very worst we could be doing now, in my \nopinion, is raising taxes, for all of the reasons I just mentioned. It \ncreates uncertainty, obviously, and raises the cost of doing business \nin this country. It hits the very people we are hoping are going to \nlead us out of this economic malaise we are in today.\n  Again, I also say with regard to this issue, the issue of taxes is so \nimportant to businesses. The issue of regulations is so important to \nbusinesses. Those are things, if we are serious about an agenda to get \nAmericans back to work, we ought to be focused on.\n  That is why we ought to be repealing ObamaCare. That $248 billion in \ntaxes--that is not the total amount of taxes; it is over $500 billion \nin taxes that will be imposed as a result of ObamaCare. These are the \ntaxes that hit middle-income Americans, according to the Joint Economic \nCommittee. Not only do we have the $248 billion or $250 billion that \nhits middle-income Americans, we have an additional 3.8 percent tax on \nunearned income that would hit high-end earners, as well as a new \nMedicare tax on high-end earners. We have so many taxes coming at this \neconomy now it is hard to fathom.\n  That should not be complicated by doubling down with our small \nbusinesses and essentially telling them that come January they are \ngoing to see their rates go up. For the people paying the 35-percent \nrate today, it would go up to 39.6 percent. Capital gains will go up \nfrom 15 to 20 percent. Dividend rates are going up from 15 to 39.6 \npercent. This is a very real issue, a real-time issue. It is having an \nimpact\n\n[[Page S4936]]\n\non the economy today. We should do everything we can to avoid that.\n  I hope when we are through with what is a charade, and we have the \nvotes on this bill--which, as I said, because the revenue measures \ndon't originate in the Senate; they originate in the House, they would \nbe blue-slipped if it passed here because this is a process where \nRepublicans are not allowed to offer amendments. This is a tax vehicle \non the Senate floor. But in the terms we use in the Senate, the \nmajority leader has ``filled the amendment tree,'' making it virtually \nimpossible for Republicans to offer amendments that we would like to \nsee debated and voted on.\n  When this charade is completed, I hope the majority leader will \ndecide we need to have a debate about taxes and what we can do to \npromote economic growth, a debate on whether we are going to extend the \nrates that will expire January 1, meaning higher taxes for nearly 1 \nmillion small businesses to whom we are looking to get us out of this \nrecession and get Americans back to work. I hope that will be the \ndebate and vote we will ultimately have when this particular political \nexercise is completed today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2524\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I would like to say a few words about \nthe next vote, which is the Cantor amendment.\n  The Cantor amendment, just to review, would give a 20-percent \ndeduction to all businesses that employ fewer than 500 people. The 20-\npercent deduction is calculated on U.S. source business income and is \nlimited to 50 percent of the W-2 wages paid. In other words, the \nbusiness must be paying at least twice the amount of the deduction in \nwages. In addition, taxpayers cannot get both this deduction and the \n90-percent manufacturing deduction; the main point being this Cantor \nbill is a gross giveaway. It gives businesses a 20-percent deduction \nfor simply earning income. They do not have to do anything, just earn \nincome and get a 20-percent deduction.\n  The amendment allows businesses to avoid paying taxes on about one-\nfifth of their profits as long as they employ fewer than 500 people. \nThat is virtually 99 percent of all American companies. Worse still, it \nprovides a temporary reduced tax rate. This would incentivize \nbusinesses to defer making investments, hiring new employees or \nincreasing wages in order to increase profits. That is because the \nlarger the profits, the larger the tax deduction under this bill.\n  Rather than creating jobs or investing in business, the Cantor bill \nincentivizes the opposite. It incentivizes businesses to sit and wait \nrather than to invest in people or equipment. It does not make any \nsense to spend $46 billion for only 1 year of the provision, as \nproposed in this bill.\n  This is a giveaway, frankly, to almost all companies--99.6 percent of \nthe companies in the United States--to hedge funds, to partnerships, \nand private equity firms. Almost all employ fewer than 500 employees. \nIt is absolutely the wrong policy for this Nation to adopt.\n  I move to table the amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). Under the previous order, the \nquestion is on agreeing to amendment No. 2524.\n  A motion to table has been made.

The Republican leader.\n\n\n           SENATOR COLLINS' 5,000TH CONSECUTIVE ROLLCALL VOTE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins, \nhas just passed an important milestone, her 5,000th consecutive \nrollcall vote, a tenacious accomplishment indeed that represents the \nwork ethic and dedication Senator Collins has for the people of Maine \nand for the Senate. We all know she is one of the hardest working \nMembers of the Senate.\n  Listen to this. Since she was sworn in, in January, January 3 of \n1997, she has been present for every single rollcall vote. That is over \n15 consecutive years, never missing a vote.\n  Senator Collins is actually in quite an elite company. Recently, she \npassed Senator Byrd and is now third all time behind Senator Chuck \nGrassley and the late Bill Proxmire from Wisconsin. I know she took \ngreat pride also in being in the company of her role model, a woman who \nplayed a major role in her decision to run for public office in the \nfirst place, fellow Maine Senator Margaret Chase Smith, who is \ncurrently No. 5 on the list.\n  On behalf of the entire Senate, I congratulate Senator Collins for \nthis milestone.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this is a remarkable accomplishment. I hope \nI do not get her into trouble with her colleagues, but I truly like \nher. I appreciate her capability to work with us, work with everybody. \nShe is somebody whom we never have to guess where she stands on an \nissue and I admire and appreciate her so much for that. I have worked \nwith her on issues going back for many years and I again say I \nappreciate what she has done.\n  She has great genes. Her mother and father each served as mayor of a \nsmall town in Maine, a place called Caribou. I don't have fond memories \nof Caribou because in my, I think, 1998 race, there was a great mailing \nwe did. One of my consultants from--not from Nevada, that is for sure--\ninstead of having deer, they had caribou on my campaign literature. It \ntook me a while to figure that one out. I am sure the town of Caribou \nwas bigger than my campaign spot.\n  Her family ran a lumber business. Her father was also a State \nsenator.\n  I am confident Susan has learned to be the Senator she is because of \nBill Cohen. I had the pleasure of serving with him. He is a good man--\nfrom Maine. I served as a junior Member when he was chairman of the \nAging Committee and he was such a wonderful man. I still talk to Bill \nCohen. She has many of his traits. As we know, she worked for him. He \nhas been a great Secretary of Defense. He has just been a good person, \nand I am confident her ability to be the legislator she is, a lot of it \nis attributed to him.\n  She has always been known for her ability to compromise. Legislation \nis\n\n[[Page S4937]]\n\nthe art of compromise, and she works with all Members.\n  I think the tone she has set working with Joe Lieberman is \nmagnificent. They have run that committee with dignity and on a totally \nbipartisan basis.\n  Five thousand votes--frankly, a number of us have cast 5,000 votes, \nbut it is ridiculous, the example she has set, never missing a vote. I \nwish her the very best and many years to serve in the future of the \nSenate.\n  (Applause.)\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to honor \nSenator Collins, a colleague and dear friend, on her landmark 5,000th \nconsecutive vote.\n  Since becoming a Senator in 1997, Senator Collins has never missed a \nsingle vote. This is a sign of her commitment to the people of Maine \nand the entire country. The commitment began in her home. Her parents \ntaught her what it meant to work hard and serve the people, both in the \nfamily-owned lumber business and both as mayors of her hometown of \nCaribou, ME. She has carried on their legacy and deep commitment to \npublic service.\n  I stand here in recognition of Senator Collins because her 5,000 \nvotes have stood not only for the people of Maine, but for our great \nNation. She has stood for science, innovation and research, women's \nequality and veterans. Her voice and her votes have shaped and will \ncontinue to shape our Nation.\n  Let me tell you a little bit about what her votes have accomplished. \nSenator Collins is a fighter for funding for science, innovation and \nresearch. Together we cosponsored the Spending Reductions through \nInnovations in Therapies (SPRINT) Act which would spur improvement in \nresearch and drug development for chronic health conditions such as \nAlzheimer's.\n  When I reach across the aisle, I know Senator Collins is there to \nfind a sensible center that will be good for America.\n  Her leadership has extended beyond her bipartisan efforts. She \ncontinues to serve as a role model for young women nationwide. As a \nfellow Girl Scout, we both learned that determination, principles and \nrespect for others are the foundation for a productive future. We \ndesignated 2012 the ``Year of the Girl,'' in support of Girl Scouts and \nthe organization's lasting lessons.\n  Today we celebrate Senator Collins' record of integrity, unsurpassed \nwork ethic, and a steadfast commitment to the people of Maine. Her \nvoting record is exemplary of the fact that we are continuing to crack \nthe marble ceiling. Not only are women getting elected to the Senate, \nwe are raising hell, holding powerful leadership positions and taking \non America's biggest issues.\n  She is a valued Member, colleague and dear friend. Congratulations \nSenator Collins on your 5,000th vote and your extraordinary commitment \nto the people of Maine and our great Nation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am delighted to add my voice to this \nchorus of congratulations for our colleague on her singular and \nremarkable achievement.\n  It seems fitting that Senator Collins would reach this historic \nmilestone just after the All Star Game because this really is a Hall of \nFame sort of accomplishment.\n  With that 5,000th consecutive vote she cast moments ago, Senator \nCollins now holds the third-longest voting streak in Senate history. In \nthe entire history of the United States Senate, the only Members with \nlonger unbroken voting streaks are William Proxmire, who is way out \nfront with 10,252 consecutive votes, and Senator Grassley, with 6,393 \nconsecutive votes.\n  But here is the thing about Senator Collins: She is the only Senator \nwho has ever hit that mark without missing a single vote--the only \nperfect voting record among the 5,000-consecutive votes Hall of Famers.\n  Senator Collins' historic voting record is a reflection of her \ndedication to the hardworking people of Maine and a testament to her \nrespect for this Senate.\n  We have heard about some of the lengths Senator Collins has gone to \nto preserve her unbroken voting streak, including how she once twisted \nher ankle running in high heels to cast a vote.\n  That vote was to protect the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram, and working parents and their children in my State of Illinois \nand throughout America are grateful to her for her pains.\n  That is the other remarkable thing about Senator Collins' voting \nrecord. It is laudatory not only for the number of consecutive votes \nSenator Collins has cast but also for the courage behind many of those \nvotes.\n  Senator Collins and I were elected to the Senate in the same year, \n1996. As freshman Senators, we cosponsored a successful bill to repeal \na $50 billion tax break for the tobacco industry.\n  We have worked together to combat Medicaid fraud and improve food \nsafety.\n  Along with Senator Snowe, Senator Collins voted for Wall Street \nreform and for the economic recovery plan that may well have kept \nAmerica from tipping into a depression.\n  She voted for the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, and she voted to \nconfirm both Sonya Sotomayor and Elena Kagan to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  I hope I don't get her into trouble with this list.\n  Her voting record is in keeping with Maine's tradition for \nindependent thinking.\n  When Susan Collins was a senior in high school, she came to \nWashington and had an amazing experience. She was able to talk to her \nhero and home State Senator, Margaret Chase Smith, for nearly 2 hours \nin her office.\n  Senator Collins later told a reporter: ``I remember leaving her \noffice thinking that women can do anything and that women can get to \nthe highest levels of government and make a difference.''\n  Years earlier, Margaret Chase Smith had made history of her own when \nshe delivered her famous ``Declaration of Conscience'' speech. In that \nspeech, she urged Senators to reject the destructive anti-communist \nhysteria being whipped up by Joe McCarthy.\n  Senator Smith said then: ``As an American, I want to see our nation \nrecapture the strength and unity it once had when we fought the enemy \ninstead of ourselves.''\n  We can hear echoes of that famous plea in an op-ed Senator Collins \nwrote for The Washington Post a few months ago.\n  As Senator Collins wrote: ``[N]either party has a monopoly on good \nideas. The challenges we face will not be met by those who believe \ncompromise is a dirty word. . . . The center will hold only if we put \nthe same effort into unity that partisans put into division.''\n  She is right.\n  On a more personal note I want to say that not only does Senator \nCollins have one of the best voting records in this Senate, she also \nhas the best taste in books of just about anyone I know. She reads \nconstantly, and I am grateful to her for the many good books and \ntalented authors she has introduced me to.\n  A year ago, some gay veterans and other Mainers hosted a reception to \nthank Senator Collins for her courageous cosponsorship, with Senator \nLieberman, of the bill to allow gay men and lesbians to serve openly in \nAmerica's Armed Forces.\n  At that reception, a Navy veteran who spent her time in the service \nhiding her sexual orientation presented Senator Collins with one of her \nship's coins, which are awarded to Navy personnel for going beyond \ntheir duty.\n  And an 80-year-old man and lifelong independent voter praised her by \nsaying, ``Senator Collins is . . . filling the high heels of Margaret \nChase Smith wonderfully.''\n  We know that even when those high heels cause her to twist her ankle, \nthey cannot keep her from casting her vote and making history.\n  Once again, I congratulate Senator Collins on this singular \nachievement.\n  And looking forward to the happy milestone she will celebrate next \nmonth, Loretta and I give Senator Collins and her husband-to-be our \nbest wishes for many years of happiness together.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2521\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I discussed this amendment in great \ndetail yesterday, so there is no reason to review it. I thank many \nMembers of the Small Business Committee on both sides of the aisle for \nputting forth some terrific, very popular, and effective ideas for \nsmall business: 100 percent exclusion of capital gains, decreased \ndeductions for startup expenditures, S corporation holding period \nreductions, carryback on business credits, and expensing of 179--all \nvery familiar to this body and absolutely critical for investing in our \nsmall business. The bill only costs $4 billion compared to some of the \nother numbers that are being thrown around here. We think it is very \ncost effective, and I ask for the support of the body.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. HATCH.

Madam President, today I voted in support of invoking \ncloture on Senate Amendment 2521 to S. 2237, offered by Senator \nLandrieu. I supported cloture on this substitute amendment because, \noverall, Senator Landrieu's legislation would help our Nation's small \nbusinesses grow and find new markets. However, I had some concerns with \naspects of the legislation that would increase sole-source contracting. \nIn general, we need to ensure that where noncompetitive contracting \nprograms are authorized, they are narrow and fair. In light of the fact \nthat cloture was not invoked on the amendment, I look forward to \nworking with Senator Landrieu on her legislation in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/12/senate-section/article/S4938-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4938-S4943]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           DISCLOSE ACT OF 2012--MOTION TO PROCEED--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, before we end the debate on the small \nbusiness tax relief bills, I want to thank the 57 Members of this \nSenate who voted for the SUCCESS Act. The SUCCESS Act has been building \nsupport, strong support across the aisle\n\n[[Page S4939]]\n\nnow for about 3 to 4 weeks. It is an outgrowth of not one, not two, but \nthree very successful, high-profile roundtables the Small Business \nCommittee in the Senate has conducted over the course of the spring, \ncoming into the summer, in hopes that we could present a bill that \ncould give a boost in the middle of this summer period to the small \nbusinesses that are really struggling to hire and to get stronger as \nthis economy gains strength. Unfortunately, we fell only three votes \nshort just a few minutes ago.\n  This bill is primarily a tax cut--very targeted, very specific, and \nvery effective--to the small businesses we are counting on to grow and \nto accelerate the potential high-growth businesses, not just any \nstartups but those that really have the capacity to grow.\n  We were hoping that despite the partisan posturing, we could have \nreceived the 60 votes to give this effort some more life. But we are \nnot going to be discouraged.\n  I want to particularly thank Senator Shaheen, the Presiding Officer, \nfor her help. I want to specifically thank Senator Cardin and Senator \nHagan for spending time on the floor for the provision of streamlining \napplications for small businesses. That is in this bill.\n  I want to thank Senator Vitter, Senator Heller, and Senator Collins \nparticularly for their support today. I want to briefly, for another \nminute, mention a few of the organizations that are supporting this \neffort, which is only a $4 billion cost. It has a $12 billion immediate \nimpact but only a $4 billion score. It was very effectively written to \ncreate a score like that. I am proud of the staff work that went into \nthis effort.\n  The American Farm Bureau Federation, the American Lighting \nAssociation, the Rental Association, Association of Builders and \nContractors, Association of Equipment Manufacturers, Automotive \nAftermarket Industry Association, Financial Executives, Metal Services \nInstitute, Independent Community Bankers--and just to name a few more--\nthe National Beer Wholesalers, National Association of Home Builders, \nPrinting Industry of America, Small Business & Entrepreneurship \nCouncil, the U.S. Black Chamber of Commerce, many women's \norganizations, Women Construction Owners, Women's Business Enterprise, \net cetera, et cetera.\n  We are very proud to be building in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce a \nvery broad coalition that can see the value. Perhaps we cannot find \ncommon ground on a $40 billion tax cut bill or a $50 billion tax cut \nbill or even $20 billion. But I think we could find common ground on a \nbill that only scores and costs the Federal Government $4 billion has a \n$12 billion impact.\n  It is $4 billion over 10 years, but the benefit is right now, the way \nthat we have structured it, to extend these tax credits and tax \nextenders for about a year and 3 months which would give us time as we \nmove forward to revise the Tax Code and to see how we can reduce and \neliminate our deficit and make our Tax Code more fair. At least it \nwould give a strong signal to many of these small businesses they can \ncount on the tax cuts that are in this bill.\n  So I am going to, on behalf of the 57 Members who voted for this bill \ntoday, file a stand-alone bill. It is going to be called the SUCCESS \nAct of 2012. I am going to ask all of those who voted today to join me \nas a cosponsor of the legislation. And let's see, we still have some \ntime left in the summer before we leave. Perhaps, with the \nadministration's support--and they do support the provisions of this--\nand with the leadership shown by some of the Republican Senators today, \nwho knows, we might be able to get something done.\n  Finally, we are working closely with the House leadership on the \nSmall Business Committee. I am working very closely with Chairman \nGraves. They have passed some of this already through the House. So \nperhaps if we stay focused and work a little bit harder, we might be \nable to squeeze out another piece of legislation that will help the \nsmall businesses of America.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               Tax Rates\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I come to the floor at this point to \ncounteract and add substance to something the majority leader said \ntoday in regard to taxes.\n  Recently, the Congressional Budget Office released an update to its \nreport on average effective tax rates. Several of my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle have pounced on this report claiming that tax \nrates are at historic lows.\n  In a floor speech just this morning the majority leader said the \nlowest tax rates in 30 years was ``thanks to President Obama, who has \nconsistently fought to lower taxes for the middle-class families over \nthe last 3\\1/2\\ years.'' However, the majority leader and others of his \npolitical party are only telling half the story. The report also shows \nthat incomes of households in all income groups have declined by an \naverage of 12 percent since 2007. This means, then, that Americans are \n12 percent poorer than they were in 2007.\n  Now, should we also thank President Obama for this reduction in \nincome? Essentially, this is what the majority leader is doing when he \nthanks President Obama for lower tax rates because when individuals \nhave less income, they pay less in taxes. Now, isn't that common sense?\n  Millions of Americans are out of work and have very little or no \nincome. You would have better luck getting blood out of a turnip than \ncollecting income taxes from someone who has no income.\n  Over the past weeks and months we have heard a lot about income \ninequality. Occupy Wall Street has been very vocal on this issue. Many \nMembers of Congress have also expressed concern that income inequality \nis ever increasing. The Finance Committee, of which I am a member, just \nrecently had a hearing on this very topic. This most recent CBO data \nshows that income inequality is at the lowest point in more than a \ndecade. The share of income held by the top 1 percent has shrunk by 28 \npercent. At the same time, the bottom 60 percent of households saw \ntheir share of income increase by an average 11 percent.\n  So perhaps my friends on the other side of the aisle do have reason \nto cheer: The rich are much less rich but, of course, the poor are \npoorer as well. It is just that those in the lower incomes did not see \ntheir income shrink by as much as higher income people.\n  Of course, those in the bottom 60 percent of households are not \nbetter off today than they were when income inequality was greater. In \nfact, they are poorer and struggling more than ever. So I just hope my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle keep that in mind as we try \nto create a better future, and do it for everyone.\n  Reduction in income inequality should not be a goal in and of itself. \nWhat really matters is individual well-being and opportunity for \neverybody to succeed. This is best achieved, then, through progrowth \npolicies aimed at growing the economic pie, not by targeting certain \nunpopular groups for tax hikes.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the \nDISCLOSE Act of 2012. This is legislation that will shine a bit of \nneeded light into the flood of secret money in our elections. I would \nlike to start with particular thanks to Senators Chuck Schumer, Michael \nBennet, Al Franken, Jeff Merkley, Jeanne Shaheen, and Tom Udall for \ntheir hard work on developing the legislation. I look forward to \njoining them as this debate goes forward.\n  This morning the majority leader moved to proceed to this vital piece \nof legislation. I thank him. I and many of my colleagues are looking \nforward to the opportunity to make the case in\n\n[[Page S4940]]\n\nthis Chamber for this important piece of legislation. In a sense, that \ncase has already been made. As anyone who watches television knows, our \nairwaves are filled with negative political attack ads. The \norganizations that pay for these negative political attack ads all have \npatriotic-sounding names dotted with words like ``prosperity,'' \n``freedom,'' and ``future.'' The names sound harmless, but they are \nphony. All too often the ads are paid for by secret special interests, \nbillionaires, and wealthy corporations seeking special secret influence \nin our democracy and drowning out the voices of middle-class American \nfamilies.\n  As USA Today put it just last week in an editorial supporting this \nDISCLOSE Act, ``Everybody's watching what's expected to be by far the \nmost expensive presidential campaign in history, and not without a dose \nof horror. Freed by the Supreme Court from spending limits, all manner \nof special interests are opening the spigots to buy influence.'' That \nis exactly right, ``All manner of special interests are opening the \nspigots to buy influence,'' and because their money is secret, the \nAmerican public doesn't even know who is behind the negative political \nattack ads other than the phony name.\n  Here is how my home State paper, the Providence Journal, reacted to \nthe original Citizens United decision that has unleashed this torrent \nof secret special interest money:\n\n       The [Citizens United] ruling will mean that, more than \n     ever, big-spending economic interests will determine who gets \n     elected. More money will especially pour into relentless \n     attack campaigns. Free speech for most individuals will \n     suffer because their voices will count for even less than \n     they do now. They will simply be drowned out by the big \n     money.\n\n  The Providence Journal could not have been proven out more correctly \nby the events that have taken place since.\n  Senator John McCain said earlier this year:\n\n       I predicted when the United States Supreme Court, with \n     their absolute ignorance of what happens in politics, struck \n     down [the McCain-Feingold campaign finance law], that there \n     would be a flood of money into campaigns, not transparent, \n     unaccounted for, and this is exactly what is happening.\n\n  Senator McCain was right. Campaigns are no longer waged by candidates \nand parties fighting over ideas; they are now waged by shadowy \npolitical attack groups posing as social welfare organizations, run by \npolitical operatives, linked to specific candidates, and fueled by \nmillions of undisclosed dollars from secret special interests. When \nthese secretive special interests take over our elections, it puts in \njeopardy the key supports of a strong middle class, supports such as \nSocial Security, Medicare, Pell grants, a progressive tax system, and \nthings that have paved the way for generations to achieve the American \ndream.\n  Why do I say that? I say that because these special interests have \nmotives to spend this kind of money. If those motives were good for \nAmerica, would they be so desperate to keep what they are doing secret? \nI don't think so.\n  Americans who worry now that Washington listens too much to the \nspecial interests, strap in, look out, and hang on to your wallet \nbecause a secret special interest avalanche is underway. According to a \nstudy in April, 90 percent of the money being spent by super PACs, \nnonprofits, and other outside groups to elect the President of the \nUnited States is coming from secret sources, secretive corporations, \nand billionaires whose names and motives the voters may never know and \nwho will have no accountability for how that money is spent.\n  When there is no accountability for how money is spent because the \nphony front organization that purports to be spending it isn't real and \nthe real party and interest has hidden behind a veil of secrecy, then \nthere is no limit on what people will say. It is accountability that \nkeeps public dialog in reasonable check. That is why you and I, Mr. \nPresident, are obliged at the end of our campaign advertisements to \nsay: I am Senator Whitehouse, and I approve this message. I am Senator \nCoons, and I approve this message.\n  Well, relieved from that accountability, about 70 percent of the ads \nin this election cycle have been negative. That is up from 9 percent in \n2008. I will say it again: 70 percent, up from 9 percent, as this flood \nof secret special interest money has hit.\n  Even worse, if we look at the four top-spending political \n501(c)(4)s--the secret organizations, the ones that hide their donors--\nand what they have done in the last 6 months, an estimated 85 percent \nof their election spending was spent on ads that contained deceptions, \naccording to a recent analysis by the Annenberg Public Policy Center. \nSo we unhinge any real person from accountability for this spending. \nThe special interests behind it remain secret, and the ads become \nvirtually exclusively negative attack ads and they are riddled with \ndeception.\n  This is what the Supreme Court thought free speech looked like. This \nis all the result of that disastrous decision by the Supreme Court in \nCitizens United v. Federal Election Commission which opened the \nfloodgates of secret, anonymous special interest money. I think it was \na deliberate decision, but that is a discussion for another day. For \ntoday, our purpose is to point out that the campaign finance system, as \na result, is broken and it lends itself to corruption in new and \nunprecedented ways.\n  The Supreme Court, in the Citizens United decision, in its blissful \nignorance, never even considered what happens behind the scenes. They \ntalked only about the public debate and the public expenditure of this \nmoney. They assumed it would be independent of the candidates, and they \nwere wrong. They assumed it would be transparent as to who was \nbehind it, and they were wrong. They also assumed that what was put on \nthe air was the end of the issue. They took no consideration of the \nbehind-the-scenes meeting where the special interest comes in to meet \nthe Congressman and doesn't spend $5 million in secretly funded \nnegative attack ads but threatens to. And if the threat works, they buy \nthe vote, nobody ever sees an ad, and the institution of government is \ncorrupted.\n\n  It is one thing if it is a company and they say: Well, I am going to \nbe against you, and my CEO is going to have a party and raise money in \n$5,000 increments against you, and our PAC is going to give a $10,000 \ncheck to your opponent. We are going to tell our workers that you are \nnot a good person for our industry.\n  OK, that is not great, but it is nowhere near as dangerous as being \nable to say: We are going to put $5 million into a secret campaign of \nnegative attack ads against you, and nobody is going to know it is us. \nIf you play right and do what you are told, we will lay off, but \notherwise, look out, we are coming after you. It will be hidden, it \nwill be negative, and it will be nasty.\n  That is no way to run a democracy. So today the majority leader has \nmoved to a bill that will bring at least transparency and \naccountability to our elections. At least these big special interests \nwill have to say who they are. Then we as Americans can evaluate what \ntheir motives are, what the deal might be, whether we are actually \naligned with their interests, and we can evaluate what they are saying \nabout candidates. We will have more information. We will have a better \nquality of free speech. This is not a Democratic or Republican issue. \nIn fact, disclosure has never before been a Republican or Democratic \nissue. This is about protecting our democratic process as Americans.\n  I really look forward to debating this important measure with my \ncolleagues in the upcoming days. I am joined by Americans of all \npolitical stripes who are disgusted by the influence of this unlimited \nsecret money pouring into our elections. We are disgusted by campaigns \nthat succeed or fail, that last or don't last, depending on how many \nbillionaires the candidate has funding their campaign through these \nspecial organizations. More and more around this country, particularly \nin Rhode Island--the people I hear from at home--people feel this \ngovernment responds only to wealthy and corporate interests. They feel \nthe middle class can't catch a break, that nobody is listening, that \neverything is done for the big guys. They see their jobs disappear. \nThey see their wages stagnate. They see bailouts and special deals for \nthe big guys, and they lose faith that their elected officials are \nactually listening to them. If we thought that was a problem before, \nwhen at least it was public and at least we knew who the registered \nlobbyists were and who had\n\n[[Page S4941]]\n\nmade the campaign contributions and at least we knew there were some \nreasonable limits on all that--all those gates have been knocked down. \nIt is the Wild West now, and it is secret.\n\n  Six in ten Americans say the middle class will not catch a break in \nthis economy until we reduce the influence of lobbyists, big banks, and \nbig donors. Guess what. With these fountains of secret money behind \nthem, their influence isn't being reduced; it is going to be \ndramatically increased--and increased in ways that lend themselves to \ncorruption.\n  One out of every four Americans actually says they are less likely to \neven vote because they believe big donors and super PACs have so much \nmore influence over elected officials than they do that they feel \npushed out of the process, so why bother. That is a terrible blow to \nAmerican democracy.\n  Nearly 7 in 10 Americans, including a majority of Democrats and \nRepublicans, agree with this proposition: New rules that let \ncorporations, unions, and people give unlimited money to super PACs \nwill lead to corruption. One would think that is a blindingly obvious \nproposition. It escaped the five conservative members of the Supreme \nCourt who decreed that was not going to be the case. Seven out of ten \nAmericans disagree with them. I disagree with them. The closer we get \nto elections, the more we see that proposition is foolhardy.\n  So we have the DISCLOSE Act, a bill that Republican and former \nFederal Election Commission Chairman Trevor Potter said is \nappropriately targeted, narrowly tailored, clearly constitutional, and \ndesperately needed. I very much hope we can join in this debate; that \nwe can get this bill passed in the Senate; that we can clean up our \nelections and begin to do something about this foul avalanche of \nnegative attack ads--again, 85 percent of them containing deception--\nthat are now polluting our public discourse.\n  Prior to the Citizens United decision and prior to the floodgates \nactually opening, there was a long and rich bipartisan tradition in \nthis Senate of demanding disclosure of spending in elections. Many of \nour Republican colleagues in the Senate have loudly and clearly \nsupported disclosure in the past, and I hope they will join us in \npassing this important piece of legislation. The fundamental principle \nof a government of the people, by the people, and for the people is a \ngovernment that will listen to the people, not just to the big special \ninterests that can afford massive secret money.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the DISCLOSE Act of 2012.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n            Tribute to Lieutenant General Ronald L. Burgess\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to LTG \nRonald L. Burgess, Jr., the current Director of the Defense \nIntelligence Agency, and one of the Nation's premier leaders in the \nintelligence community and in the United States military.\n  Lieutenant General Burgess retires this summer after a distinguished \n38-year career. During his career, Lieutenant General Burgess has been \nrecognized with numerous awards and decorations, which include the \nDefense Distinguished Service Medal, Defense Superior Service Medal \nwith two oak leaf clusters, the Legion of Merit, Meritorious Service \nMedal with four oak leaf clusters, Joint Service Commendation Medal, \nUnited States Special Operations Command Medal, Army Commendation \nMedal, Army Achievement Medal, NATO Medal--Former Republic of \nYugoslavia, Parachutist Badge, Joint Chiefs of Staff Identification \nBadge, and the Army Staff Identification Badge.\n  As a driving force in the intelligence community, General Burgess \nwill soon conclude a career marked by exceptional leadership and \nstrategic vision, both of which have significantly advanced U.S. \nnational security interests while also strengthening our national \nintelligence and military intelligence capabilities during a very \nchallenging period in our Nation's history.\n  Throughout his time in uniform, Lieutenant General Burgess has \ndemonstrated an unyielding dedication to duty and an innate ability to \ninspire enthusiasm and commitment to serve those he leads. Lieutenant \nGeneral Burgess's selfless service to country and his unparalleled \npersonal drive have been instrumental in transforming defense \nintelligence into a more capable and cooperative enterprise, providing \nthe critical intelligence required by military commanders and \npolicymakers both at the defense and national levels.\n  Commissioned as a second lieutenant through the Auburn University \nROTC Program in 1974, Lieutenant General Burgess began his career with \na series of assignments in armor and military intelligence units in \nGermany and Ft. Stewart, GA, where he was directly responsible for \nplanning multiple highly successful National Training Center rotations, \nnumerous command post exercises, and an Army training and evaluation \nprogram.\n  Lieutenant General Burgess was recognized for his meticulous planning \nand forceful execution of operational procedures which contributed \nsignificantly to combat readiness. Later Lieutenant General Burgess \nheld a variety of key staff and command positions, including Assistant \nExecutive Officer to the Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence, \nWashington, DC in 1990, and as the battalion commander, 25th Infantry \nDivision, from May 1993 to May 1994, at Schofield Barracks, HI.\n  From July 1995 to May 1997, Lieutenant General Burgess commanded the \n470th Military Intelligence Brigade where he served with great \ndistinction. As commander, he provided outstanding leadership which led \nto the unit's operational success in support of the Commanding General \nof the United State's Army South and the Commander U.S. Southern \nCommand.\n  During this period, LTG Burgess skillfully integrated a multi-\ndisciplined intelligence force into an extremely innovative war-\nfighting asset while also expanding the brigade's regional focus \nthrough more than 150 operational deployments across Latin America, the \nCaribbean, Europe, and Korea. While commanding the 470th, LTG Burgess \nalso served as acting vice director of intelligence, and subsequently \nthe acting director of intelligence for U.S. Southern Command. During \nthis period LTG Burgess guided a continuous flow of intelligence \nanalysis in support of the year-long Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement \nhostage crisis at the Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima. LTG \nBurgess's support was key to developing the detailed analysis required \nby U.S. military commanders, our ambassador to Peru and the President \nto make timely and informed decisions leading to the safe withdrawal of \nAmerican hostages.\n  Following his assignment at U.S. Southern Command, LTG Burgess served \nas the Director of Intelligence (J-2) for the Joint Special Operations \nCommand, JSOC, Fort Bragg, North Carolina, from May 1997 to May 1999. \nDuring this assignment, Ron's leadership was instrumental in supporting \ncontinuous global deployments as well as major exercises and highly \ncomplex joint-service training events.\n  Mr. President, in June 1999, Ron returned to the Southern Command as \nthe Director of Intelligence, J-2. Among his achievements while serving \nin that position, LTG Burgess led an interagency intelligence effort to \ncreate a fused Colombian intelligence capability that enhanced military \nand police cooperation against illegal global drug networks. LTG \nBurgess led Southern Command's intelligence response to many challenges \nincluding potential migrant operations, tracking of Cuban exiles, \nhurricane and earthquake disaster relief, and sustained counterdrug \noperations in both the area of responsibility and throughout transit \nzones.\n  From June 2003 to July 2005, LTG Burgess served as the Director for \nIntelligence (J-2) for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, JCS. As the J-2, Ron \ndirected\n\n[[Page S4942]]\n\nall-source intelligence analysis and reporting for the Chairman JCS, \nthe Secretary of Defense, the Joint Staff, and Unified Commands. LTG \nBurgess served as the focal point for crisis intelligence support to \nmilitary operations, indications and warning intelligence in the \nDepartment of Defense, and Unified Command intelligence requirements. \nAssuming control of intelligence operations only months after the \nUnited States and coalition forces invaded Iraq, LTG Burgess was at the \nforefront of providing timely and insightful intelligence for \noperational requirements in Iraq, Afghanistan, transnational terrorism, \nand all developing global issues affecting U.S. interests abroad.\n  In August 2005, LTG Burgess reported to the Office of the Director \nfor National Intelligence, ODNI, where he served as the Deputy Director \nof National Intelligence for Customer Outcomes, Director of the \nIntelligence Staff, Acting Principal Deputy Director of National \nIntelligence, and acting Director of National Intelligence. During this \nperiod, LTG Burgess played a key role in developing and reforming the \nIntelligence Community during an unprecedented period of global change. \nDuring Ron's tenure at ODNI, his leadership was key during the revision \nof Executive Order 12333, which governs all intelligence activities, \nthe development of the first-ever joint manning document for military \npersonnel assigned to organizations outside of the Department of \nDefense, critical Intelligence Community managerial operations were \noverhauled, and innovative human capital practices were implemented \nunder his watch.\n  After completing his ODNI assignment, LTG Burgess was appointed the \n17th director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, DIA, in March 2009. \nAs the Vice Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence I \nhave personally witnessed Ron's thoughtful and ambitious program to \nstrengthen DIA's ability to address the ever-changing requirements of \nmilitary commanders and policymakers at the defense and national \nlevels. LTG Burgess has focused DIA on our nation's greatest challenges \nincluding Afghanistan-Pakistan, Iraq, Iran, transnational terrorism, \nand preventing strategic surprise elsewhere around the globe. In doing \nso, Ron has reinforced DIA's ability to surge in support of contingency \noperations and crises, successfully launching a 24/7 crisis analysis \ncell at the start of the Libyan crisis and establishing an Afghanistan-\nPakistan Task Force that refined the agency's ability to support \nongoing combat operations\n  As DIA was celebrating its 50th anniversary, LTG Burgess charted an \ninnovative, five-year strategy to strengthen and unite the agency's \ncore defense capabilities while also focusing the agency on warning, \ncore mission areas, partnership, and performance. DIA's new strategy \nemphasizes best practices to support our warfighters and policy makers \nin an era of persistent conflict and enduring U.S. fiscal challenges \nand sets the path toward achieving the strategy's major theme of ``One \nMission--One Team--One Agency.''\n  As Director of DIA, LTG Burgess has worked to strengthen and improve \nthe Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System, JWICS, the \nsecure backbone for much of the U.S. Intelligence Community, the White \nHouse, U.S. combatant commanders, and allies. Additionally, he has led \nthe effort to establish the Defense Clandestine Service, DCS, which \nprovides enhanced collection capabilities in support of the highest \npriority intelligence requirements of the Director of National \nIntelligence, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretaries of the Military \nDepartments, and the Combatant Commanders.\n  No matter the range or complexity of the issues, Ron always kept \nhimself, his colleagues and subordinates focused on the fundamental \nobligations and responsibilities borne by those entrusted with some of \nthe Nation's most important and sensitive missions.\n  He frequently reminded DIA employees, ``While much of what we do is \nsecret, our work is a public trust.''\n  And consistent with that view, Ron emphasized at every opportunity \nthe non-negotiable need for intelligence professionals to always \ndemonstrate the highest degree of integrity, both personal and \nprofessional. He often counseled new employees, senior managers and \nmilitary attaches headed to new postings that ``integrity is needed \nmost when it is hardest to maintain.''\n  Mr. President, while much of what is said behind closed doors at the \nSenate Intelligence Committee is classified, I can tell you, my \ncolleagues and the American people, that DIA is held in high esteem by \nthe Senate Intelligence Committee, due in no small part to Ron's \nleadership. DIA is an indispensable, principal member of the U.S. \nIntelligence Community and has strengthened its performance as the \nfunctional intersection between defense and national intelligence. LTG \nBurgess leaves behind a more flexible and adaptive agency, one that is \nmuch more capable of meeting our national security challenges. Under \nhis leadership, DIA has earned even greater respect within the \nIntelligence Community and continues to warrant Congress' strong \nsupport and trust.\n  Mr. President, while the Army and Intelligence Community will be \nlosing a leader who has answered the call time and again at such \ncritical points in our Nation's history, I know that Ron will be happy \nto reclaim his Saturday afternoons in the fall to root for his Auburn \nTigers, and that the Burgess family will cherish more time with a \nhusband and father. Mr. President, I wish Ron and his wife Marta the \nvery best as he enters retirement. On behalf of a grateful Nation and \nmy colleagues in the U.S. Senate, I thank Ron and his family for his \nmany years of faithful service and a job well done.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n            Unanimous Consent Agreement--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on Monday, July \n16, at 5 p.m., the Senate proceed to executive session to consider the \nfollowing nomination: Calendar No. 662; that there be 30 minutes for \ndebate equally divided in the usual form; that upon the use or yielding \nback of that time, the Senate proceed to a vote with no intervening \naction or debate on the nomination; that the motion to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate; that no further motions be in order; that any related \nstatements be printed in the Record; that the President be immediately \nnotified of the Senate's action and the Senate then resume legislative \nsession.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senate is currently on the motion to \nproceed to S. 3369; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The leader is correct.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. REID. That being the case, I have a cloture motion at the desk on \nthe motion to proceed to that matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of \nrule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, hereby move to bring to \na close debate on the motion to proceed to calendar No. 446, S. 3369, a \nbill to amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to provide for \nadditional disclosure requirements for corporations, labor \norganizations, Super PACs and other entities, and for other purposes.\n\n         Harry Reid, Sheldon Whitehouse, Jack Reed, Joseph I. \n           Lieberman, Jon Tester, Mark L.

MEADOWS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I recognize and honor William H. Meadows for \nhis long and successful service from 1996 to 2012 as president of The \nWilderness Society. Bill came to Washington, D.C. with his wife Sally \nto lead The Wilderness Society after years of working as a volunteer \nand then as a professional staff person for the Sierra Club. Since \nthen, he has neither lost the passion that first made him a \nconservation activist nor the gracious Southern charm that came from \nhis Tennessee upbringing.\n  Under his leadership, The Wilderness Society has maintained its focus \non their core mission of protecting wilderness and inspiring Americans \nto care for our wild places. During his tenure, The Wilderness Society \nhas had substantial success, helping Congress expand the National \nWilderness Preservation System by nearly 6.5 million acres and \nestablish the National Landscape Conservation System to increase \nprotection for Bureau of Land Management lands. In that time, the \norganization has nearly doubled in size and they provide sound \nscientific, legal, and policy expertise on major issues relating to our \nFederal public lands better than ever.\n  I have had the good fortune of working with Bill and The Wilderness \nSociety on legislation that impacts our Federal wild lands heritage. He \nand The Wilderness Society have been important partners in successful \nefforts to protect millions of acres of Nevada's finest wilderness in \nClark, Lincoln, and White Pine counties, as well as establish the Black \nRock Desert-High Rock Canyon Emigrant Trails National Conservation Area \nand Sloan Canyon National Conservation Area. I am tremendously proud of \nthat legacy and Bill played a critical role in that effort. He never \nfailed to understand the need to work closely with local communities \nand key stakeholders to find areas of common ground and to reach shared \nsolutions. He brought to these conservation efforts a level headed, \nreasonable, thoughtful approach that helped move all the parties beyond \nthe type of knee-jerk ideology that too often results in gridlock.\n  Bill has also been an important ally in many national debates about \nFederal public lands ranging from our energy policy to management of \nhealthy forests to the protection of iconic wild lands like the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge. He and his organization were influential in \nthe Clinton Administration's establishment of the Roadless Rule, which \nhelps protect nearly 60 million acres of our most pristine national \nforests.\n  He has always been willing to meet with his opponents. At a time when \nmany conservationists were at odds with the George W. Bush \nadministration, Bill was able to establish and maintain a working \nrelationship with the Undersecretary for Natural Resources in the \nDepartment of Agriculture. This big tent approach to conservation is \none of the things that make Bill exceptional. He is further \ndistinguished by his ability to clearly understand the dynamics of \nnational and local politics without becoming cynical or losing his \nintegrity. Thank you, Bill, for your tremendous service as an \nextraordinary conservation leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/12/senate-section/article/S4943-3", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4943]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DENNIS T. DORTON\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a good \nfriend of mine and a good friend to the Commonwealth of Kentucky, Mr. \nDennis T. Dorton. After a successful, lifelong career in banking \nculminating in his service as president and chief executive officer at \nCitizens National Bank, Mr. Dorton will retire this month.\n  A native of Paintsville, KY, Dennis Dorton has worked at Citizens \nNational Bank for 42 years. He joined the bank in 1970 following his \ngraduation from Morehead State University, where he earned a bachelor's \ndegree in business administration. Dennis also attended Paintsville \nHigh School and is a graduate of National Investment School University \nof Oklahoma, National Trust School Northwestern University, and \nattended Stonier Graduate School of Banking at Rutgers University.\n  Dennis is well known and well regarded throughout the State's banking \ncommunity for his career of accomplishment. He served as treasurer for \nthe Kentucky Bankers Association and was that organization's chairman \nin 2007-08. He is also on the Board of Trustees for the Kentucky \nHospital Association and the Highlands Regional Medical Center. His \nmany other civic and community service efforts include his work as \ntreasurer and board member of the Paintsville-Johnson County Chamber of \nCommerce, chairman of the Appalachian Artisan Center, treasurer of the \nKentucky Historical Society Foundation, and vice chairman and board \nmember of the Christian Appalachian Project Board. He also served for \n15 years on the Paintsville City Council, 6 years on the Paintsville \nIndependent School Board, and on a number of committees for Big Sandy \nCommunity & Technical College.\n  Mr. Dorton is also an active member of the First United Methodist \nChurch in Paintsville, and has volunteered on missions to Belize and \nCosta Rica to help build church and school buildings. He has taught \npersonal financial management courses at his church, and even taught at \nlocal elementary schools on subjects as varied as woodworking, banjos, \nand folk art.\n  Dennis and his wife, Jean, have a son, Andrew Trigg Dorton, who is \nmarried to Stephanie Stumbo. Dennis and Jean are the grandparents of \nTristan Andrew and Ashton Warren.

The Cook County Criminal Courts Building in Chicago is an \nimposing building at the intersection of 26th Street and California \nAvenue that has long been known by its address: 26th and Cal. Last \nmonth, the Criminal Courts Building was renamed the Honorable George N. \nLeighton Criminal Court Building in tribute to a remarkable man.\n  Judge George Leighton, who turns 100 years old this October, has \nexcelled as a lawyer and judge and has embodied the ideals of the \nAmerican dream.\n  George Leighton was born in 1912 in New Bedford, MA, to African \nimmigrants. As a young boy, Judge Leighton picked fruit for several \nmonths each year to help support his family. Then just before he should \nhave started seventh grade, he left school to take a job on an oil \ntanker in the Dutch West Indies.\n  George Leighton never finished grade school or high school, but he \nheard that a scholarship fund was offering a $200 scholarship for the \nwinner of an essay contest, and he submitted the winning essay. In \n1936, with his $200 scholarship, he hitchhiked to Washington, D.C., to \nattend college. He was granted conditional admittance to Howard \nUniversity, where he graduated magna cum laude 4 years later.\n  In 1940, George Leighton joined the United States Army's 93rd \nInfantry Division. When he returned to the United States after the war, \nhe was accepted at Harvard Law School. He graduated from Harvard and \npassed the Illinois State Bar Examination.\n  He then moved to Chicago because he was impressed that Chicago had \nelected an African American congressman, William Dawson. He set up a \nlaw practice next to the old Comiskey Park on\n\n[[Page S4944]]\n\nChicago's South Side. And he began fighting courageously to break down \nbarriers of racial discrimination in voting, housing and education.\n  In 1949, George Leighton became an Assistant Illinois Attorney \nGeneral. When he advised one group of African-Americans that the law \ndid not prohibit them from moving to the Cicero neighborhood, an all-\nwhite neighborhood at the time, race riots erupted. Judge Leighton was \nindicted for inciting the riot. An up-and-coming lawyer named Thurgood \nMarshall came to the defense of Judge Leighton, argued the case, and \nthe indictment was dismissed.\n  In 1964, Mayor Daley asked Leighton to run for circuit court judge, \nand he won the election in a landslide. He then moved into his office \nat 26th and Cal, the Cook County Criminal Courts Building.\n  In 1969, Judge Leighton was appointed to the First District Appellate \nCourt of Illinois, where he served as the first African-American judge \non the Illinois Court of Appeals. Six years later, he was nominated by \nPresident Gerald Ford to serve as U.S. District court judge for the \nNorthern District of Illinois.\n  George Leighton has been a life-long champion of civil rights and \nequality. There is no more fitting a tribute than to name the building \nin which Judge Leighton first began practicing law some 66 years ago in \nhis honor.\n  Judge Leighton contributed to our understanding of justice. He stood \nup to powerful interests in defense of the truth and did not bend to \npressure or prejudice in his pursuit of justice. He served the people \nof Illinois and the citizens of the United States proudly throughout \nhis tenure on the bench.\n  I thank Judge George Leighton for his service and join the Chicago \ncommunity in congratulating him on this new honor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/12/senate-section/article/S4944-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4944-S4945]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                HUNGARY\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, a year ago, I shared with my colleagues \nconcerns I had about the trajectory of democracy in Hungary. \nUnfortunately, since then Hungary has moved ever farther away from a \nbroad range of norms relating to democracy and the rule of law.\n  On June 6, David Kramer, the President of Freedom House who served as \nAssistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor for \nPresident George W. Bush, summed up the situation. Releasing Freedom \nHouse's latest edition of Nations in Transit Kramer said: ``Hungarian \nPrime Minister Viktor Orban and Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych, \nunder the pretext of so-called reforms, have been systematically \nbreaking down critical checks and balances. They appear to be pursuing \nthe `Putinization' of their countries.''\n  The report further elaborates, ``Hungary's precipitous descent is the \nmost glaring example among the newer European Union (EU) members. Its \ndeterioration over the past five years has affected institutions that \nform the bedrock of democratically accountable systems, including \nindependent courts and media. Hungary's negative trajectory predated \nthe current government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban, but his drive to \nconcentrate power over the past two years has forcefully propelled the \ntrend.''\n  Perhaps the most authoritative voice regarding this phenomenon is the \nPrime Minister himself. In a February 2010 speech, Viktor Orban \ncriticized a system of governance based on pluralism and called instead \nfor: ``a large centralized political field of power . . . designed for \npermanently governing.'' In June of last year, he defended his plan to \ncement economic policy in so-called cardinal laws, which require a two-\nthirds vote in parliament to change, by saying, ``It is no secret that \nin this respect I am tying the hands of the next government, and not \nonly the next one but the following ten.''\n  Checks and balances have been eroded and power has been concentrated \nin the hands of officials whose extended terms of office will allow \nthem to long outlive this government and the next. These include the \npublic prosecutor, head of the state audit office, head of the national \njudicial office, and head of the media board. Those who have expressed \nconcerns about these developments have good reason to be alarmed.\n  I am particularly concerned about the independence of the judiciary \nwhich, it was reported this week, will be the subject of infringement \nproceedings launched by the European Commission, and Hungary's new \nmedia law. Although there have been some cosmetic tweaks to the media \nlaw, the OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media has argued that it \nremains highly problematic. Indeed, one expert has predicted that the \nmost likely outcome of the new law will be to squeeze out reporting on \ncorruption.\n  Hungary also adopted a new law on religion last year that had the \nstunning effect of stripping hundreds of religions of their legal \nrecognition en masse. Of the 366 faiths which previously had legal \nstatus in Hungary, only 14 were initially granted recognition under the \nnew law. Remarkably, the power to decide what is or is not a religion \nis vested entirely and exclusively in the hands of the legislature, \nmaking it a singularly politicized and arbitrary process. Of 84 \nchurches that subsequently attempted to regain legal recognition, 66 \nwere rejected without any explanation or legal rationale at all. The \nnotion that the new framework should be acceptable because the faiths \nof most Hungarian citizens are recognized is poor comfort for the \nminority who find themselves the victims of this discriminatory \nprocess. This law also stands as a negative example for many countries \naround the world just now beginning tenuous movement towards democracy \nand human rights.\n  Finally, a year ago, I warned that ``[i]f one side of the nationalism \ncoin is an excessive fixation on Hungarian ethnic identity beyond the \nborders, the other side is intolerance toward minorities at home.'' I \nam especially concerned by an escalation of anti-Semitic acts which I \nbelieve have grown directly from the government's own role in seeking \nto revise Hungary's past.\n  Propaganda against the 1920 Treaty of Trianon, which defines the \ncurrent borders of Hungary, has manifested itself in several ways. Most \nconcretely, the Hungarian government extended citizenship on the basis \nof ethnic or blood identity--something the government of Viktor Orban \npromised the Council of Europe in 2001 that it would not do and which \nfailed to win popular support in a 2004 referendum. Second, the \ngovernment extended voting rights to these new ethnic citizens in \ncountries including Romania, Serbia, Slovakia and Ukraine. This has \ncombined with a rhetorical and symbolic fixation on ``lost'' Hungarian \nterritories--apparently the rationale for displaying an 1848 map of \nGreater Hungary during Hungary's EU presidency last year. In this way, \nthe government is effectively advancing central elements of the agenda \nof the extremist, anti-Semitic, anti-Roma Jobbik party. Moreover, \nimplicitly--but unmistakably--it is sending the message that Hungary is \nno longer a civic state where political rights such as voting derive \nfrom citizenship, but where citizenship derives from one's ethnic \nstatus or blood identity.\n  The most recent manifestation of this revisionism includes efforts to \nrehabilitate convicted war criminal Albert Wass and the bizarre \nspectacle of the Hungarian government's role in a ceremony in \nneighboring Romania--over the objections of that country--honoring \nfascist writer and ideologue Joszef Nyiro. That event effectively saw \nthe Speaker of the Hungarian Parliament, Laszlo Kover; the Hungarian \nState Secretary for Culture, Geza Szocs; and Gabor Vona, the leader of \nHungary's most notoriously extremist party, Jobbik, united in honoring \nNyrio. Several municipalities have now seen fit to erect statues \nhonoring Miklos Horthy, Hungary's wartime leader, and the writings of \nWass and Nyiro have been elevated onto the national curriculum.\n  It is not surprising that this climate of intolerance and revisionism \nhas gone hand-in-hand with an outbreak of intolerance, such as the \nantiSemitic verbal assaults on a 90-year old Rabbi and on a journalist, \nan attack on a synagogue menorah in Nagykanizsa, the vandalism of a \nJewish memorial in Budapest and monuments honoring Raoul Wallenberg, \nthe Blood Libel screed by a Jobbik MP just before Passover, and the \nrecent revelation that a Jobbik MP requested--and received--a \ncertificate from a genetic diagnostic company attesting that the MP did \nnot have Jewish or Romani ancestry.\n\n[[Page S4945]]\n\n  We are frequently told that Fidesz is the party best positioned in \nHungary to guard against the extremism of Jobbik. At the moment, there \nseems to be little evidence to support that claim. The campaign to \nrehabilitate fascist ideologues and leaders from World War II is \ndangerous and must stop. Ultimately, democracy and the rights of \nminorities will stand or fall together.\n  Hungary is not just on the wrong track, it is heading down a \ndangerous road. The rehabilitation of disgraced World War II figures \nand the exaltation of blood and nation reek of a different era, which \nthe community of democracies--especially Europe--had hoped was gone for \ngood. Today's Hungary demonstrates that the battle against the worst \nhuman instincts is never fully won but must be fought in every \ngeneration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/12/senate-section/article/S4945-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4945]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         YUKOS OIL COMPENSATION\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, Russia's weak rule of law is bad for the \npeople of Russia, of course, but it also harms American citizens. As \nCongress considers legislation directed at strengthening human rights \nand the rule of law in Russia, we also should address the economic \nimpact on Americans, including those Americans who are owed $12 billion \nwhen Yukos Oil, in which they held 15 percent of its stock, was \nexpropriated by the Russia Government. To date, none of the American \nowners of Yukos caught up in Russia's renationalization of this company \nhas received any compensation for this unlawful taking. And without a \nbilateral investment treaty, BIT, with Russia, the only recourse \navailable to U.S. investors is for our State Department to espouse the \ncase of its wronged citizens. I support this course of action, and I \nask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter I wrote \nwith Senator Scott Brown to Secretary Clinton last October 27, 2011, \nthat addresses this issue.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 27, 2011.\n     Hon. Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     Secretary of State, Department of State, C Street, NW., \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Secretary: We are writing to ask that you seek \n     compensation from Russia on behalf of hundreds of thousands \n     of U.S. investors who have lost approximately $12 billion as \n     a result of Russia's expropriation of Yukos Oil Company. With \n     all other avenues exhausted for American investors, only \n     espousal by the United States can help to bring this matter \n     to an appropriate resolution.\n       American investors collectively owned approximately 15 \n     percent of Yukos at the time the Russian authorities began \n     dismantling the company. The American investors in Yukos \n     included several public pension funds and more than 70 \n     institutional investors in at least 17 States. There also \n     were over 20,000 individual American investors who owned \n     Yukos shares directly, in addition to the hundreds of \n     thousands who owned shares indirectly through mutual funds.\n       These investors have valid claims against Russia under \n     international law, but they have no mechanism to assert these \n     claims because there is no bilateral investment treaty (BIT) \n     in force between the United States and Russia. Other foreign \n     owners of Yukos have been able to initiate BIT claims, and a \n     UK investor recently won such a case. In a unanimous \n     decision, the arbitrators in the UK case concluded that \n     Russia had expropriated Yukos and that compensation was due.\n       In June 2008, American investors formally petitioned the \n     State Department to undertake government-to-government \n     negotiations with Russia. We respectfully ask that you \n     espouse the claims of these Americans and seek payment from \n     the Government of Russia as soon as possible.\n       Thank you for your consideration of our concerns. We look \n     forward to hearing from you.\n           Sincerely,\n     James M. Inhofe,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Scott Brown,\n       U.S. Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/12/senate-section/article/S4945-2", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4945]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JACK BOOKTER\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

Colonel Anderson will officially retire \nfrom the United States Army Corps of Engineers at the end of the year. \nColonel Anderson's career has spanned 26 years of service where he has \nled both mechanized and airborne combat engineer units as well as \ncommanding two USACE districts.\n  Colonel Anderson excelled as the commander of the Baltimore District \nin the North Atlantic Division. He directed the successful operation of \nflood risk mitigation, hurricane protection, environmental restoration, \nFederal navigation and other water resource work within a 49,000 square \nmile area and along 7,000 miles of the Chesapeake Bay's environmentally \nsensitive shoreline. Colonel Anderson led the district as it responded \nto the Nation's Base Realignment and Closure 2005 mission, which \nbrought a $7.2 billion construction and engineering effort to the \nNational Capital Region.\n  During his career he has served as the commander of the Honolulu \nDistrict and two tours as a legislative assistant, including one tour \nas the legislative assistant to the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army, \nand one tour as the legislative assistant to the Secretary of the Army.\n  Colonel Anderson's dedication to duty, loyalty to the Nation, and \npersonal engagement with soldiers, civilian personnel, and the public \nwill be positively felt for years to come. His selfless service is in \nkeeping with the highest traditions of the Corps of Engineers.\n  Kara Anderson, Colonel Anderson's wife of 24 years, and his three \nchildren, also warrant our thanks.

An ambitious athlete, she is a three-time Mountain West \nhammer-throw champion, two-time national All-American honoree, and \nrecently set a new UNLV hammer throw record.\n  Jake Dalton, a 2009 graduate of Spanish Spring High School, took \nvictories in the floor exercise and vault in a combined points total \nfrom the VISA Championships and the Olympic Trials. He joins the rest \nof Team USA in the hopes of winning gold, a feat that has not been \nsecured by men's gymnastics since 1984. Jake has won 4 individual NCAA \ntitles, 13 All-American honors, and is believed to be Nevada's first \nmale gymnast to make the Olympic team.\n  Green Valley High School alumni, Connor Fields, won the U.S. Men's \nBMX Time Trials in Chula Vista, California, earning a place on the \nthree-man team for the 2012 London Games. This 19-year-old southern \nNevada native is the first rider in BMX supercross history to win three \nstraight World Cup final races.\n  Michael Hunter, Las Vegas heavyweight boxer, qualified for this \nsummer's London Games with a semifinal victory in the AIBA Americas \nOlympic Qualifying Tournament in Rio de Janeiro.

Mr. President, on June 30, Trooper Aaron Beesley \nresponded to a call to rescue two teenagers stranded on Mount Olympus \nin the Wasatch Mountains near Salt Lake City. As a part of the search \nand rescue helicopter unit, he helped load the two teenagers into the \nhelicopter, ensuring their own safety before his own. When the \nhelicopter pilot had secured the hikers, he went back for Trooper \nBeesley, only to find that he had fallen down the 60-foot cliff face. A \nhero fell from Mount Olympus. Someone once said, ``A hero is always \nremembered, but legends never die.'' Aaron Beesley woke up that morning \nalready a hero in every sense of the word, and he fell that night into \nlegend, a legend of service and sacrifice that will live far beyond his \nmortality.\n  His mother recalled that from the age of 5 Aaron had aspired to be a \nfirefighter. His greatest ambition was to protect others from harm and \ndanger. He attended the police academy after serving a LDS mission in \nOakland, CA, and was then hired by the Utah Highway Patrol. There he \ncommitted to ``face danger with confidence, resolution and bravery'' \nand to ``meet the service needs of everyone encountered.'' These \nprinciples were a part of Aaron's nature long before he became a \ntrooper. He may have fallen in the line of duty, but for him, this duty \nwas his life. He saw the world through the lens of a hero, constantly \nseeking opportunities to help and serve others long after the workday \nended. At his funeral service, Aaron's mother Laretta Beesley said, \n``Aaron was a hero every day of his life.'' Based on his rescue record, \nlifesaving awards, medal of excellence, and the tremendous words of \npraise from his family and coworkers, I believe his mother's \ndescription is perfect.\n  Aaron will be remembered as a man of many hats. He is survived by his \nwife Christine and sons Austin, 7, and twins Derek and Preston, 4. They \nwill remember him as a loving husband and father. His brother Arik \nremembers him as a hero, recalling the countless phone calls they \nshared in which Aaron provided a play-by-play account of his latest \nrescue. His parents remember him as a clever practical joker. As a \nchild he once tricked a group of neighborhood boys into performing his \nloathed chore of stacking wood by telling them how much fun it would \nbe. His mother lovingly remembers how he watched them do it for him \nwith a sly smile, periodically expressing how much he would love to be \nstacking wood too. His coworkers and friends remember him as a genius \nwho could fix anything, from neighbors' broken electronics to highway \npatrol communications equipment. Aaron was even able to perform the \nnecessary maintenance on the patrol's air fleet, saving the department \nthousands of dollars. His colleague Steve Winward remembers him as an \ninventor, designing cell phone applications for helicopter flight \nnavigation and field sobriety tests.\n  Mr. President I pay tribute today to Aaron Beesley not simply to \nmourn his loss but to celebrate his life, his willingness to perform \nhis duty and serve others. Sharon and I extend our condolences to \nChristine, Austin, Derek and Preston and praise them for their courage \nat this difficult time. Aaron truly remembered service before self, as \ndo all who wake up every morning prepared to give their lives for those \nthey serve. I pray that his family, friends, and loved ones may feel an \noutpouring of love and support from grateful citizens around the \ncountry and that they may forever remember Aaron with the tremendous \npride his legacy deserves.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/12/senate-section/article/S4946-2", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4946]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNIZING BRYAN ALMEIDA\n\n Mr. RUBIO.

A bill to establish scientific standards and protocols \nacross forensic disciplines, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, the criminal justice system relies on \nforensic science to identify and prosecute criminals and exonerate the \nfalsely accused. But in a pathbreaking 2009 report to Congress, the \nNational Academy of Sciences found that the interpretation of forensic \nevidence is severely compromised by the lack of supporting science and \nstandards. They concluded, ``The bottom line is simple: In a number of \nforensic science disciplines, forensic science professionals have yet \nto establish either the validity of their approach or the accuracy of \ntheir conclusions, and the courts have been utterly ineffective in \naddressing this problem.''\n  In a series of recent articles, the Washington Post reported on \nflawed forensic work that may be responsible for the wrongful \nconvictions in thousands of criminal cases. An April Post editorial \nurged the Justice Department to conduct a full review of all cases that \nended in conviction, and a July 11 story reports that the Justice \nDepartment and the FBI have now launched such a review. The National \nAcademy of Sciences, the Washington Post, the Innocence Project, and \nthe National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, among others, \nhave all called for strengthened forensic science and standards.\n  The Forensic Science and Standards Act of 2012 responds to this call \nby promoting research. The bill would establish a National Forensic \nScience Coordinating Office, housed at the National Science Foundation, \nNSF, to develop a research strategy and roadmap and to support the \nimplementation of that roadmap across relevant Federal agencies.\n  NSF would establish a forensic science grant program to award funding \nin areas specifically identified by the research strategy. NSF would be \ndirected to award two grants to create forensic science research \ncenters to conduct research, build relationships with forensic \npractitioners, and educate students. All agencies with equities in \nforensic science would be encouraged to use prizes and challenges to \nstimulate innovative and creative solutions to satisfy the research \nneeds and priorities identified in the research strategy.\n  The bill requires standard development. The National Institute of \nStandards and Technology, NIST, would be directed to develop forensic \nscience standards, in consultation with standards development \norganizations and other stakeholders. NIST could establish and solicit \nadvice from discipline-specific expert working groups to identify \nstandards development priorities and opportunities.\n  The bill requires implementing uniform standards. To advise on the \napplication of the new standards, a Forensic Science Advisory Committee \nchaired by the Director of NIST and the Attorney General would be \nestablished. The Advisory Committee, composed of research scientists, \nforensic science practitioners, and users from the legal and law \nenforcement communities, would make recommendations to the Attorney \nGeneral on adoption of standards. The Attorney General would direct the \nstandards' implementation in Federal forensic science laboratories and \nwould encourage adoption in non-Federal laboratories as a condition of \nFederal funding or for inclusion in national databases.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3378\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Business bankruptcies have increased sharply in recent \n     years and remain at high levels. These bankruptcies include \n     several of the largest business bankruptcy filings in \n     history. As the use of bankruptcy has expanded, job \n     preservation and retirement security are placed at greater \n     risk.\n       (2) Laws enacted to improve recoveries for employees and \n     retirees and limit their losses in bankruptcy cases have not \n     kept pace with the increasing and broader use of bankruptcy \n     by businesses in all sectors of the economy. However, while \n     protections for employees and retirees in bankruptcy cases \n     have eroded, management compensation plans devised for those \n     in charge of troubled businesses have become more prevalent \n     and are escaping adequate scrutiny.\n       (3) Changes in the law regarding these matters are urgently \n     needed as bankruptcy is used to address increasingly more \n     complex and diverse conditions affecting troubled businesses \n     and industries.\n\n        TITLE I--IMPROVING RECOVERIES FOR EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES\n\n     SEC. 101.

A bill to impose certain limitations on consent decrees and \nsettlement agreements by agencies that require the agencies to take \nregulatory action in accordance with the terms thereof, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce important \nregulatory reform legislation.\n  Recently, when describing the state of our economy, President Obama \nsaid that the private sector was ``doing fine.''\n  I disagree. I think that the American people disagree with the \nPresident's statement.\n  There are 12.7 million Americans unemployed and another 8.2 million \nunderemployed. 5.4 million Americans have been unemployed for 27 weeks \nor more.\n  That's not ``doing fine.''\n  The Federal Government needs to do everything possible to create an \nenvironment that will allow private sector employers to create jobs. To \naccomplish that, common sense would tell us that the government needs \nto remove barriers to job creation rather than erect new ones. The \nFederal Government needs to listen to employers so it can learn from \nthem exactly what it can do to help.\n  Unfortunately, the Obama administration hasn't listened. In fact, \nunbelievably it is actually doing the opposite of what employers are \nsaying they need.\n  Employers are saying that they need relief from job killing \nregulations.\n  For example, according to a Gallup survey, small-business owners in \nthe United States are most likely to say that complying with government \nregulations is the biggest problem facing them today.\n  Indeed, the burden of regulations is overwhelming. Recently, the \nSmall Business Administration estimated that the Federal regulatory \nburden has reached $1.75 trillion per year.\n  So what has the Obama administration's response been?\n  It is planning to increase the number of regulations.\n  The Obama administration's regulatory agenda has thousands of \nregulations in its production line, more than a hundred of which will \nhave a major impact on the economy. Those are on top of more than one \nthousand regulations already completed.\n  I am sorry to say that the news gets even worse. On top of the \nthousands of new regulations it to impose, it appears that the \nadministration is trying to get around the procedures governing how \nregulations are enacted.\n  In recent years, consent decrees and settlement agreements have been \nused to circumvent the laws and procedures that govern how regulations \nare enacted and to speed up the process in ways that limit the public's \nability to fully participate and to exercise the rights guaranteed by \nour laws.\n  These consent decrees or settlement agreements may come as a surprise \nto the regulated industry and the public. They usually establish \ntruncated deadlines for the agency to promulgate a regulation.\n  The lack of advance notice and the expedited schedule for the \nproposal and promulgation of regulations allows an agency to avoid the \ninput that comes with meaningful public participation. It may also \nallow agencies to short-circuit the analytical requirements of \nregulatory process statutes, such as the Administrative Procedure Act. \nExpedited deadlines further allow agencies to undercut the review of \nproposed regulations by the Office of Management and Budget's Office of \nInformation and Regulatory Affairs OIRA.\n  The practice of using consent decrees and settlement agreements to \nenact regulations has become known as ``sue-and-settle'' litigation.\n  The dangers of sue-and-settle litigation and of government by consent \ndecree are not a new problem.\n  Nearly 30 years ago, Judge Malcom Wilkey of the D.C. Circuit warned \nabout the dangers of collusive consent decrees. In his dissenting \nopinion in Citizens for a Better Environment v. Gorsuch, Judge Wilkey \nexplained:\n\n       Government by consent decree enshrines at its very center \n     those special interest groups who are party to the decree. \n     They stand in a strong tactical position to oppose changing \n     the decree, and so likely will enjoy material influence on \n     proposed changes in agency policy.\n       As a policy device, then, government by consent decree \n     serves no necessary end. It opens the door to unforeseeable \n     mischief; it degrades the institutions of representative \n     democracy and augments the power of special interest groups. \n     It does all of this in a society that hardly needs new \n     devices that emasculate representative democracy and \n     strengthen the power of special interests.\n\n  Because the Obama administration is trying to dramatically increase \nthe number of regulations, we must make sure that the laws and \nprocedures governing rulemaking are followed and followed in a \nmeaningful way.\n  The debate about sue-and-settle litigation is important because it \nraises questions about fairness, transparency and public participation \nin administrative rulemaking. It also raises the issue of whether \nmeaningful judicial review is taking place.\n  Under the Administrative Procedure Act and other laws, the public and \naffected persons, in particular, have a right to adequate notice and an \nopportunity to comment on a proposed regulation. They also have a right \nto have their comments fully considered.\n  However, when sue-and-settle litigation is used real, public \nparticipation is effectively eliminated.\n  Generally speaking, the agreement on how to regulate is reached \nwithout the full input of the people and businesses that are affected. \nDiscussions are held and agreements may be reached between government \nofficials and special interest groups outside the public process. This \nis particularly true where career employees and political appointees at \nagencies share the agenda of the special interest group suing the \nagency and use the lawsuit as an opportunity to implement their common \ngoals.\n  Also, the negotiated deadlines for creating the new regulation can be \nso accelerated that the public's comments might receive little or no \ntrue consideration.\n  Keep in mind that these regulations often involve complex scientific \nand\n\n[[Page S4959]]\n\neconomic issues. Those issues cannot generally be fully and properly \nconsidered under a truncated time frame.\n  Another fundamental aspect of rulemaking is the opportunity to \nchallenge a decision by participating as an intervenor. However, with \nsue-and-settle litigation, special interest groups and the government \nmay reach an agreement before a lawsuit is even filed. This eliminates \nthe opportunity for members of the public to intervene in the case to \nprotect their interests.\n  Even where a settlement occurs after affected parties may have been \ngranted intervention, these parties have little or no chance to \nparticipate in settlement discussions because they are not invited by \nthe government and the special interest groups.\n  Moreover, when an agency creates a regulation through sue-and-settle \nlitigation, it reorganizes its work by promising to take specific \nactions at specific times, before or instead of other projects that may \nbe of greater benefit to the public.\n  Also, sue-and-settle litigation helps officials and administrations \nto avoid accountability. Instead of having to answer to the public for \ncontroversial regulations and policy decisions, officials are able to \npoint to a court order and maintain that they were required or forced \nto promulgate a controversial regulation.\n  The case of American Nurses Association v. Jackson is an example of \nthe sue-and-settle phenomenon.\n  In that case, a group of environmental organizations sued the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, EPA, in December 2008, challenging the \nagency's failure to create emissions standards for pollutants from \npower plants under the Clean Air Act. Subsequently, the Utility Air \nRegulatory Group, UARG, representing the utility industry, intervened \nas a defendant in the case.\n  On October 22, 2009, the plaintiffs and the EPA filed a proposed \nconsent decree. It was the result of a deal struck exclusively between \nthem. They did not include the UARG in their discussions. Although the \njudge expressed concerns about the exclusion of the UARG from the \nsettlement discussions, she was satisfied when the plaintiffs and the \nEPA informed her that this practice was the ``norm.''\n  Under the consent decree, the EPA conceded that it had failed to \nperform a mandatory duty under the Clean Air Act by failing to issue a \n``maximum achievable control technology'', MACT, regulation for power \nplants. The EPA pledged that it would issue a proposed regulation by \nMarch 16, 2011 and a final regulation by November 16, 2011.\n  The UARG objected to the consent decree. It argued that the proposed \ndecree improperly limited the government's discretion because it \nrequired the EPA to find that standards under 112(d) of the Clean Air \nAct were required. Consequently, the decree prevented the agency from \neither declining to issue standards or adopting other standards instead \nof the more burdensome MACT standard.\n  Although acknowledging the significance of the UARG's arguments, the \njudge nevertheless rejected them in its short opinion approving the \nconsent decree.\n  As to the language limiting the EPA's discretion in the rulemaking, \nthe judge stated that the EPA believed itself to be obligated to \npromulgate 112(d) standards and, ``and by entering this consent decree \nthe Court [wa]s only accepting the parties' agreement to settle, not \nadjudicating whether EPA's legal position [wa]s correct.'' The judge \nsimply believed that ``[i]f necessary, [the] UARG c[ould] challenge \n[the] EPA's final rule and its legal position.''\n  With regard to the UARG's argument that the time frame within which \nthe EPA proposed to carry out the rulemaking was insufficient, the \njudge noted that she ``appreciate[d]'' the concern that the schedule \nwas too short for the critical and expensive regulatory decisions that \nwould be made. Nevertheless, she held that it was enough that the \nproposed consent decree allowed for a change of the schedule if needed.\n  The judge's reasoning on this point was interesting given that she \nacknowledged in a footnote that under the consent decree, the UARG \ncould not petition for an extension of the deadlines.\n  In the end, the judge acknowledged that the concerns raised by the \nUARG were not insubstantial. However, she did not believe that she \ncould gauge the adequacy, or lack thereof, of the schedule. \nConsequently, in a somewhat cavalier manner the judge concluded that: \n``[s]hould haste make waste, the resulting regulations will be subject \nto successful challenge''. . . . If EPA needs more time to get it \nright, it can seek more time.''\n  Unfortunately, it appears that the EPA's proposed regulation \ncontained significant errors. Indeed, the EPA did not analyze the \nimpact of its regulation on electric reliability or provide sufficient \ntime for industry to do so.\n  In November of 2011, the UARG brought its concerns to the judge, \nasking for relief from the consent decree.\n  In particular, it argued that more time was needed to respond to the \nvoluminous comments submitted during the rulemaking process, to fix the \nserious flaws, and to then more carefully consider the promulgation of \na rule with such serious and far-reaching consequences. For example, \nthe schedule under the consent decree only allowed 104 days for the EPA \nto consider and respond to 20,000 unique, public comments received \nbefore it published the final rule. In total, there were 960,000 \ncomments submitted.\n  The UARG's motion was supported by twenty-four states and Governor \nTerry Branstad on behalf of the people of Iowa. As part of their amicus \nbrief, they pointed out that the American Coalition for Clean Coal \nElectricity, ACCCE, had estimated that the rule promulgated under the \nconsent decree would result in the loss of 1.44 million jobs in the \nUnited States between 2013 and 2020. Because of the rule, the ACCCE \nalso predicts national electricity price increases in 2016 to average \n11.5 percent, with an increase of 23.5 percent in some regions.\n  The EPA issued a final rule on December 21, 2011, and has argued that \nthe UARG's motion is moot.\n  As it stands, the rule is among the most costly of rules ever \npromulgated by the EPA with the agency estimating that the annualized \ncost at $9.6 billion in 2015. Industry estimates are even higher. \nPetitions for reconsideration of the rule are pending and more lawsuits \nare likely.\n  The EPA could have done it right the first time by crafting a \nsensible, workable rule that both protects the environment and can be \nimplemented without causing unnecessary job losses or higher \nelectricity prices for hard-working families. Instead, we have flawed, \ncontroversial regulation that may have to be rewritten.\n  Although we don't know how this will all turn out, we have to \nremember that the process by which this rule was created was the \nproduct of a consent decree.\n  In sum, when special interest groups and agencies engage in sue-and-\nsettle litigation, the end product is a regulation that implements the \npriorities of the special interest groups. Moreover, these regulations \nare created under schedules that render notice-and-comment rights a \nmere formality, eliminating the opportunities for regulated entities, \nthe public and the OIRA to have any input on the content of final \nregulations.\n  That is why I'm introducing the Sunshine for Regulatory Decrees and \nSettlements Act of 2012. Senators Kyl, Cornyn, Coburn, Lee and Paul are \ncosponsors of the bill.\n  Representative Benjamin Quayle of Arizona has introduced a companion \nbill in the House.\n  The Sunshine bill endeavors to solve the problems I have outlined. It \ndoes this by enacting reasonable pro-transparency measures. I'll just \noutline a few of those measures.\n  First, the Sunshine bill provides for greater transparency, requiring \nagencies publicly to post and report to Congress information on sue-\nand-settle complaints, decrees and settlements.\n  Second, the bill prohibits same-day filing of complaints and pre-\nnegotiated consent decrees and settlement agreements in cases seeking \nto compel agency action. Instead, it requires that consent decrees and \nsettlement agreements be filed only after interested parties have been \nable to intervene in the litigation and join settlement negotiations \nand only after any proposed decree or settlement has been published for \nnotice and comment.\n\n[[Page S4960]]\n\n  Third, the Sunshine bill requires courts considering whether to \napprove proposed consent decrees and settlement agreements to account \nfor public comments and compliance with regulatory process statutes and \nexecutive orders. This bill would facilitate public participation by \nallowing comment on any issue related to the matters alleged in the \ncomplaint or addressed in the proposed agreement. Government agencies \nwould be required to respond to comments, and the court would assess \nwhether the proposed schedule allows sufficient time for real and \nmeaningful, public comment on the regulation.\n  Fourth, the bill requires the Attorney General or, where appropriate, \nthe defendant agency's head, to certify to the court that he or she has \napproved any proposed consent decree or settlement agreement that \nincludes terms that: convert into a duty a discretionary authority of \nan agency to propose, promulgate, revise, or amend regulations, commit \nan agency to expend funds that have not been appropriated and budgeted, \ncommit an agency to seek a particular appropriation or budget \nauthorization, divest an agency of discretion committed to it by \nstatute or the Constitution, or otherwise afford any relief that the \ncourt could not enter under its own authority.\n  Finally, the Sunshine bill makes it easier for succeeding \nadministrations to successfully move the courts for modifications of a \nprior administration's consent decrees by providing for de novo review \nof motions to modify if the circumstances have changed.\n  Sue-and-settle litigation damages the transparency, public \nparticipation and judicial review protections Congress has guaranteed \nfor all of our citizens in the rulemaking process.\n  Regulations are laws. The procedure and process used to create them \nare important. They are part of our system. The American system of \nlawmaking and judicial review is a model for the world. Our system \nshould not be distorted or manipulated.\n  Regulations must be made in the open, through the procedures and \nprocesses established under our laws.\n  The Sunshine for Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act will help to \nensure that established and well-grounded protections remain in place, \nwhile maintaining the government's ability to enter into consent \ndecrees and settlement agreements, when appropriate.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to work with me and to support this \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/12/senate-section/article/S4960-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4960]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2532.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Freedom from Restrictive \n     Excessive Executive Demands and Onerous Mandates Act of \n     2012''.\n\n     SEC. _02. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) A vibrant and growing small business sector is critical \n     to the recovery of the economy of the United States.\n       (2) Regulations designed for application to large-scale \n     entities have been applied uniformly to small businesses and \n     other small entities, sometimes inhibiting the ability of \n     small entities to create new jobs.\n       (3) Uniform Federal regulatory and reporting requirements \n     in many instances have imposed on small businesses and other \n     small entities unnecessary and disproportionately burdensome \n     demands, including legal, accounting, and consulting costs, \n     thereby threatening the viability of small entities and the \n     ability of small entities to compete and create new jobs in a \n     global marketplace.\n       (4) Since 1980, Federal agencies have been required to \n     recognize and take account of the differences in the scale \n     and resources of regulated entities, but in many instances \n     have failed to do so.\n       (5) In 2009, there were nearly 70,000 pages in the Federal \n     Register, and, according to research by the Office of \n     Advocacy of the Small Business Administration, the annual \n     cost of Federal regulations totals $1,750,000,000,000. Small \n     firms bear a disproportionate burden, paying approximately 36 \n     percent more per employee than larger firms in annual \n     regulatory compliance costs.\n       (6) All agencies in the Federal Government should fully \n     consider the costs, including indirect economic impacts and \n     the potential for job loss, of proposed rules, periodically \n     review existing regulations to determine their impact on \n     small entities, and repeal regulations that are unnecessarily \n     duplicative or have outlived their stated purpose.\n       (7) It is the intention of Congress to amend chapter 6 of \n     title 5, United States Code, to ensure that all impacts, \n     including foreseeable indirect effects, of proposed and final \n     rules are considered by agencies during the rulemaking \n     process and that the agencies assess a full range of \n     alternatives that will limit adverse economic consequences, \n     enhance economic benefits, and fully address potential job \n     loss.\n\n     SEC. _03.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) A vibrant and growing small business sector is critical \n     to the recovery of the economy of the United States.\n       (2) Regulations designed for application to large-scale \n     entities have been applied uniformly to small businesses and \n     other small entities, sometimes inhibiting the ability of \n     small entities to create new jobs.\n       (3) Uniform Federal regulatory and reporting requirements \n     in many instances have imposed on small businesses and other \n     small entities unnecessary and disproportionately burdensome \n     demands, including legal, accounting, and consulting costs, \n     thereby threatening the viability of small entities and the \n     ability of small entities to compete and create new jobs in a \n     global marketplace.\n       (4) Since 1980, Federal agencies have been required to \n     recognize and take account of the differences in the scale \n     and resources of regulated entities, but in many instances \n     have failed to do so.\n       (5) In 2009, there were nearly 70,000 pages in the Federal \n     Register, and, according to research by the Office of \n     Advocacy of the Small Business Administration, the annual \n     cost of Federal regulations totals $1,750,000,000,000. Small \n     firms bear a disproportionate burden, paying approximately 36 \n     percent more per employee than larger firms in annual \n     regulatory compliance costs.\n       (6) All agencies in the Federal Government should fully \n     consider the costs, including indirect economic impacts and \n     the potential for job loss, of proposed rules, periodically \n     review existing regulations to determine their impact on \n     small entities, and repeal regulations that are unnecessarily \n     duplicative or have outlived their stated purpose.\n       (7) It is the intention of Congress to amend chapter 6 of \n     title 5, United States Code, to ensure that all impacts, \n     including foreseeable indirect effects, of proposed and final \n     rules are considered by agencies during the rulemaking \n     process and that the agencies assess a full range of \n     alternatives that will limit adverse economic consequences, \n     enhance economic benefits, and fully address potential job \n     loss.\n\n     SEC. _03. INCLUDING INDIRECT ECONOMIC IMPACT IN SMALL ENTITY \n                   ANALYSES.\n\n       Section 601 of title 5, United States Code, is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(9) the term `economic impact' means, with respect to a \n     proposed or final rule--\n       ``(A) the economic effects on small entities directly \n     regulated by the rule; and\n       ``(B) the reasonably foreseeable economic effects of the \n     rule on small entities that--\n       ``(i) purchase products or services from, sell products or \n     services to, or otherwise conduct business with entities \n     directly regulated by the rule;\n       ``(ii) are directly regulated by other governmental \n     entities as a result of the rule; or\n       ``(iii) are not directly regulated by the agency as a \n     result of the rule but are otherwise subject to other agency \n     regulations as a result of the rule.''.\n\n     SEC. _04.

Mr. REID (for Mrs. Gillibrand (for herself, Mr. Isakson, Mr. \nChambliss, and Mr. Durbin)) proposed an amendment to the bill H.R. \n2527, to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint coins in \nrecognition and celebration of the National Baseball Hall of Fame; as \nfollows:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Baseball Hall of \n     Fame Commemorative Coin Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) On June 12, 1939, the National Baseball Hall of Fame \n     and Museum opened in Cooperstown, New York. Ty Cobb, Walter \n     Johnson, Christy Mathewson, Babe Ruth, and Honus Wagner \n     comprised the inaugural class of inductees. This class set \n     the standard for all future inductees. Since 1939, just one \n     percent of all Major League Baseball players have earned \n     induction into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.\n       (2) The National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum is \n     dedicated to preserving history, honoring excellence, and \n     connecting generations through the rich history of our \n     national pastime. Baseball has mirrored our Nation's history \n     since the Civil War, and is now an integral part of our \n     Nation's heritage.\n       (3) The National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum \n     chronicles the history of our national pastime and houses the \n     world's largest collection of baseball artifacts, including \n     more than 38,000 three dimensional artifacts, 3,000,000 \n     documents, 500,000 photographs, and 12,000 hours of recorded \n     media. This collection ensures that baseball history and its \n     unique connection to American history will be preserved and \n     recounted for future generations.\n       (4) Since its opening in 1939, more than 14,000,000 \n     baseball fans have visited the National Baseball Hall of Fame \n     and Museum to learn about the history of our national pastime \n     and the game's connection to the American experience.\n       (5) The National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum is an \n     educational institution, reaching 10,000,000 Americans \n     annually. Utilizing video conference technology, students and \n     teachers participate in interactive lessons led by educators \n     from the National Baseball Hall of Fame Museum. These award-\n     winning educational programs draw upon the wonders of \n     baseball to reach students in classrooms nationwide. Each \n     educational program uses baseball as a lens for teaching \n     young Americans important lessons on an array of topics, \n     including mathematics, geography, civil rights, women's \n     history, economics, industrial technology, arts, and \n     communication.\n\n     SEC. 3. COIN SPECIFICATIONS.\n\n       (a) Denominations.--In recognition and celebration of the \n     National Baseball Hall of Fame, the Secretary of the Treasury \n     (hereafter in this Act referred to as the ``Secretary'') \n     shall mint and issue the following coins:\n       (1) $5 gold coins.--Not more than 50,000 $5 coins, which \n     shall--\n       (A) weigh 8.359 grams;\n       (B) have diameter of 0.850 inches; and\n       (C) contain 90 percent gold and 10 percent alloy.\n       (2) $1 silver coins.--Not more than 400,000 $1 coins, which \n     shall--\n       (A) weigh 26.73 grams;\n       (B) have a diameter of 1.500 inches; and\n       (C) contain 90 percent silver and 10 percent copper.\n       (3) Half-dollar clad coins.--Not more than 750,000 half-\n     dollar coins which shall--\n       (A) weigh 11.34 grams;\n       (B) have a diameter of 1.205 inches; and\n       (C) be minted to the specifications for half-dollar coins \n     contained in section 5112(b) of title 31, United States Code.\n       (b) Legal Tender.--The coins minted under this Act shall be \n     legal tender, as provided in section 5103 of title 31, United \n     States Code.\n       (c) Numismatic Items.--For purposes of sections 5134 and \n     5136 of title 31, United States Code, all coins minted under \n     this Act shall be considered to be numismatic items.\n       (d) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that, \n     to the extent possible without significantly adding to the \n     purchase price of the coins, the $1 coins and $5 coins minted \n     under this Act should be produced in a fashion similar to the \n     2009 International Year of Astronomy coins issued by Monnaie \n     de Paris, the French Mint, so that the reverse of the coin is \n     convex to more closely resemble a baseball and the obverse \n     concave, providing a more dramatic display of the obverse \n     design chosen pursuant to section 4(c).\n\n     SEC. 4.

The Secretary shall take \n     into account this compensation amount when determining the \n     sale price described in section 6(a).\n       (d) Reverse Design.--The design on the common reverse of \n     the coins minted under this Act shall depict a baseball \n     similar to those used by Major League Baseball.\n\n     SEC. 5.

SALE OF COINS.\n\n       (a) Sale Price.--The coins issued under this Act shall be \n     sold by the Secretary at a price equal to the sum of--\n       (1) the face value of the coins;\n       (2) the surcharge provided in section 7(a) with respect to \n     such coins; and\n       (3) the cost of designing and issuing the coins (including \n     labor, materials, dies, use of machinery, winning design \n     compensation, overhead expenses, marketing, and shipping).\n       (b) Bulk Sales.--The Secretary shall make bulk sales of the \n     coins issued under this Act at a reasonable discount.\n       (c) Prepaid Orders.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary shall accept prepaid orders \n     for the coins minted under this Act before the issuance of \n     such coins.\n       (2) Discount.--Sale prices with respect to prepaid orders \n     under paragraph (1) shall be at a reasonable discount.\n\n     SEC. 7.

The Secretary of the Treasury may issue \n     guidance to carry out this subsection.\n\n     SEC. 8. FINANCIAL ASSURANCES.\n\n       The Secretary shall take such actions as may be necessary \n     to ensure that--\n       (1) minting and issuing coins under this Act will not \n     result in any net cost to the United States Government; and\n       (2) no funds, including applicable surcharges, are \n     disbursed to any recipient designated in section 7 until the \n     total cost of designing and issuing all of the coins \n     authorized by this Act (including labor, materials, dies, use \n     of machinery, winning design compensation, overhead expenses, \n     marketing, and shipping) is recovered by the United States \n     Treasury, consistent with sections 5112(m) and 5134(f) of \n     title 31, United States Code.\n\n     SEC. 9.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the `National Baseball Hall of \n     Fame Commemorative Coin Act'.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) On June 12, 1939, the National Baseball Hall of Fame \n     and Museum opened in Cooperstown, New York. Ty Cobb, Walter \n     Johnson, Christy Mathewson, Babe Ruth, and Honus Wagner \n     comprised the inaugural class of inductees. This class set \n     the standard for all future inductees. Since 1939, just one \n     percent of all Major League Baseball players have earned \n     induction into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.\n       (2) The National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum is \n     dedicated to preserving history, honoring excellence, and \n     connecting generations through the rich history of our \n     national pastime. Baseball has mirrored our Nation's history \n     since the Civil War, and is now an integral part of our \n     Nation's heritage.\n\n[[Page S4981]]\n\n       (3) The National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum \n     chronicles the history of our national pastime and houses the \n     world's largest collection of baseball artifacts, including \n     more than 38,000 three dimensional artifacts, 3,000,000 \n     documents, 500,000 photographs, and 12,000 hours of recorded \n     media. This collection ensures that baseball history and its \n     unique connection to American history will be preserved and \n     recounted for future generations.\n       (4) Since its opening in 1939, more than 14,000,000 \n     baseball fans have visited the National Baseball Hall of Fame \n     and Museum to learn about the history of our national pastime \n     and the game's connection to the American experience.\n       (5) The National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum is an \n     educational institution, reaching 10,000,000 Americans \n     annually. Utilizing video conference technology, students and \n     teachers participate in interactive lessons led by educators \n     from the National Baseball Hall of Fame Museum. These award-\n     winning educational programs draw upon the wonders of \n     baseball to reach students in classrooms nationwide. Each \n     educational program uses baseball as a lens for teaching \n     young Americans important lessons on an array of topics, \n     including mathematics, geography, civil rights, women's \n     history, economics, industrial technology, arts, and \n     communication.\n\n     SEC. 3. COIN SPECIFICATIONS.\n\n       (a) Denominations.--In recognition and celebration of the \n     National Baseball Hall of Fame, the Secretary of the Treasury \n     (hereafter in this Act referred to as the ``Secretary'') \n     shall mint and issue the following coins:\n       (1) $5 gold coins.--Not more than 50,000 $5 coins, which \n     shall--\n       (A) weigh 8.359 grams;\n       (B) have diameter of 0.850 inches; and\n       (C) contain 90 percent gold and 10 percent alloy.\n       (2) $1 silver coins.--Not more than 400,000 $1 coins, which \n     shall--\n       (A) weigh 26.73 grams;\n       (B) have a diameter of 1.500 inches; and\n       (C) contain 90 percent silver and 10 percent copper.\n       (3) Half-dollar clad coins.--Not more than 750,000 half-\n     dollar coins which shall--\n       (A) weigh 11.34 grams;\n       (B) have a diameter of 1.205 inches; and\n       (C) be minted to the specifications for half-dollar coins \n     contained in section 5112(b) of title 31, United States Code.\n       (b) Legal Tender.--The coins minted under this Act shall be \n     legal tender, as provided in section 5103 of title 31, United \n     States Code.\n       (c) Numismatic Items.--For purposes of sections 5134 and \n     5136 of title 31, United States Code, all coins minted under \n     this Act shall be considered to be numismatic items.\n       (d) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that, \n     to the extent possible without significantly adding to the \n     purchase price of the coins, the $1 coins and $5 coins minted \n     under this Act should be produced in a fashion similar to the \n     2009 International Year of Astronomy coins issued by Monnaie \n     de Paris, the French Mint, so that the reverse of the coin is \n     convex to more closely resemble a baseball and the obverse \n     concave, providing a more dramatic display of the obverse \n     design chosen pursuant to section 4(c).\n\n     SEC. 4. DESIGN OF COINS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The design for the coins minted under this \n     Act shall be--\n       (1) selected by the Secretary after consultation with--\n       (A) the National Baseball Hall of Fame;\n       (B) the Commission of Fine Arts; and\n       (2) reviewed by the Citizens Commemorative Coin Advisory \n     Committee.\n       (b) Designations and Inscriptions.--On each coin minted \n     under this Act there shall be--\n       (1) a designation of the value of the coin;\n       (2) an inscription of the year ``2014''; and\n       (3) inscriptions of the words ``Liberty'', ``In God We \n     Trust'', ``United States of America'', and ``E Pluribus \n     Unum''.\n       (c) Selection and Approval Process for Obverse Design.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary shall hold a competition to \n     determine the design of the common obverse of the coins \n     minted under this Act, with such design being emblematic of \n     the game of baseball.\n       (2) Selection and approval.--Proposals for the design of \n     coins minted under this Act may be submitted in accordance \n     with the design selection and approval process developed by \n     the Secretary in the sole discretion of the Secretary. The \n     Secretary shall encourage 3-dimensional models to be \n     submitted as part of the design proposals.\n       (3) Proposals.--As part of the competition described in \n     this subsection, the Secretary may accept proposals from \n     artists, engravers of the United States Mint, and members of \n     the general public.\n       (4) Compensation.--The Secretary shall determine \n     compensation for the winning design under this subsection, \n     which shall be not less than $5,000. The Secretary shall take \n     into account this compensation amount when determining the \n     sale price described in section 6(a).\n       (d) Reverse Design.--The design on the common reverse of \n     the coins minted under this Act shall depict a baseball \n     similar to those used by Major League Baseball.\n\n     SEC. 5. ISSUANCE OF COINS.\n\n       (a) Quality of Coins.--Coins minted under this Act shall be \n     issued in uncirculated and proof qualities.\n       (b) Period for Issuance.--The Secretary may issue coins \n     minted under this Act only during the 1-year period beginning \n     on January 1, 2014.\n\n     SEC. 6. SALE OF COINS.\n\n       (a) Sale Price.--The coins issued under this Act shall be \n     sold by the Secretary at a price equal to the sum of--\n       (1) the face value of the coins;\n       (2) the surcharge provided in section 7(a) with respect to \n     such coins; and\n       (3) the cost of designing and issuing the coins (including \n     labor, materials, dies, use of machinery, winning design \n     compensation, overhead expenses, marketing, and shipping).\n       (b) Bulk Sales.--The Secretary shall make bulk sales of the \n     coins issued under this Act at a reasonable discount.\n       (c) Prepaid Orders.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary shall accept prepaid orders \n     for the coins minted under this Act before the issuance of \n     such coins.\n       (2) Discount.--Sale prices with respect to prepaid orders \n     under paragraph (1) shall be at a reasonable discount.\n\n     SEC. 7.

The Secretary of the Treasury may issue \n     guidance to carry out this subsection.\n\n     SEC. 8. FINANCIAL ASSURANCES.\n\n       The Secretary shall take such actions as may be necessary \n     to ensure that--\n       (1) minting and issuing coins under this Act will not \n     result in any net cost to the United States Government; and\n       (2) no funds, including applicable surcharges, are \n     disbursed to any recipient designated in section 7 until the \n     total cost of designing and issuing all of the coins \n     authorized by this Act (including labor, materials, dies, use \n     of machinery, winning design compensation, overhead expenses, \n     marketing, and shipping) is recovered by the United States \n     Treasury, consistent with sections 5112(m) and 5134(f) of \n     title 31, United States Code.\n\n     SEC. 9.
