Mr. President, the Congressional Budget Act requires \nthat Congress pass a budget by April 15. The Republican House has \npassed its budget. They stated their financial vision for the future in \nAmerica. The Democratic Senate, however, has not passed a budget in 750 \ndays. It has been 750 days since we have had a budget that passed the \nSenate. This year they haven't even brought a budget forward to \ncommittee to begin to mark up a budget as specifically required by the \nsame statute. They have not even put forward a plan.\n  The Democrats control the Senate. They campaigned for the majority \nand, as my wife says to me when I complain: You asked for the job. So \nwe have the largest economy on Earth, and we are in the middle of a \nfiscal crisis. For the majority party to skip work on the Nation's \nbudget is not something to be taken lightly.\n  I ask my good friend, the Senator from Utah, the ranking Republican \non the Finance Committee, my former chairman in the Judiciary \nCommittee, if the American people were polled, how many does the \nSenator think would say the Senate should not pass a budget?\n  Mr. HATCH. That is a good question. The distinguished ranking member \nof the Budget Committee has asked a fundamental question. The answer, \nto me, and I think everybody else, is as clear as a bell: The American \npeople overwhelmingly expect the Senate to do the people's business. \nFirst, we have to get our fiscal house in order. The House has taken \nthe first step. The folks in Utah have dealt with their family budgets, \nbusiness budgets, and government budgets, and they rightly ask that the \nSenate do exactly the same.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. One reason it is so important to have an honest, open \nbudget process is that budgets are so easy to manipulate and spend. The \nPresident, in proposing a budget sometime ago, said his budget called \non America to live within its means and ``not add more to the debt.'' \nThat was the President's own statement. In fact, his budget doubles the \ndebt in 10 years, producing annual deficits each year, the lowest of \nwhich never once fell below $748 billion. In fact, that would average \nalmost $1 trillion a year and nowhere close to balancing.\n  The CBO found numerous gimmicks when they analyzed the President's \nplan. They found that it contained another $2.3 trillion in deficits. \nIt increased the deficit. The President delivered a speech promising $4 \ntrillion in savings over 12 years. After his budget was ill-received by \nobjective commentators all over the country, editorial boards, and in \nCongress, he made a speech and he promised $4 trillion in savings over \n12 years. But the committee analysts on our staff revealed that this \nso-called framework actually worsens the budget in relation to the CBO \nbaseline.\n  Does the Senator from Utah believe the White House and the Democratic \nleaders in the Senate should produce an honest, concrete, fact-based \nbudget on which we can rely?\n  Mr. HATCH. I sure do. They actually worsen the deficit by $2.2 \ntrillion in relation to the CBO baseline.\n  Until one sees the numbers in black and white, the budget is just \ntalk. Democrats and Republicans have an obligation to produce fiscal \nblueprints in an intellectually honest, complete, and transparent \nfashion. The majority, the Democrats, have the responsibility to take \nthe first step, and the Republicans have a responsibility to convey our \nfiscal blueprint through debate and amendments. That is the way this \ntraditionally has always been done. As the distinguished ranking member \nindicated, our side is ready to engage in this important debate and \nprocess, but it is hard to do it when they would not even put up a \nbudget. They have not done that in the last couple of years. Without a \nbudget, we don't have anything to debate and analyze.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask Senator Hatch, for the people who may not \nunderstand, it is the chairman's responsibility to call a hearing and \nto begin a markup, and the minority is not able to call the committee \ninto effect. So we do have to look to the chairman, and probably the \nchairman would operate in relation to the majority leader to call the \ncommittee into session; is that right?\n  Mr. HATCH. There is no question about it. The chairman has the \nresponsibility for holding hearings that lead up to a budget \nresolution, the structure of the budget resolution, in accordance with \nhis party's belief, it seems to me, and then bringing it up in \ncommittee where both sides can argue about it and both sides have the \nright to amend and improve it. Then they can bring it to the Senate \nfloor. But they don't do that. Then they wonder why we are in such \nfiscal difficulties.\n  I know the distinguished Senator from Alabama understands this fully \nas the ranking member on the Budget Committee. Having also been \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, frankly, I am concerned about it--\nand I think everybody is concerned--because they don't want to come up \nwith a budget, and there may be invalid reasons for that.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The budget is fundamentally a plan, a vision for the \nfinancial future of America. It is astounding that the party in the \nmajority is not even prepared to say to the American people----\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes.\n  Mr. HATCH. There is nothing more important in our lives now than \ncoming up with a budget that would put us on a downward trend for \nspending. We are spending around 69 percent of the GDP. Our national \ndebt of $14.3 trillion is 90 percent of the GDP. We are headed toward \n90 percent of GDP of spending. If we get there, this country will have \ndifficulties that will be difficult to overcome. That is where we are \nheaded, especially if we don't have a budget to debate on the floor of \nthe Senate.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I couldn't agree more. When the President submitted his \nbudget, Mr. Erskine Bowles, whom the President asked to chair the \nfiscal commission that was supposed to come up with a plan to help us \nget out of this fix, said the President's budget is nowhere close to \nwhat is necessary to avoid our fiscal nightmare. That is what the co-\nchair of the President's commission said.\n  So now we are looking to Congress. That is the President's proposal, \nbut the Senate has to move forward a proposal. We cannot even go to \nconference and begin to work out a budget that both Houses can agree on \nuntil the Senate moves a budget forward.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is right. I think the distinguished chairman of the\n\n[[Page S3121]]\n\nBudget Committee, Senator Conrad, wants to do it. But in their caucus \nthey cannot get together because they all want to spend and tax more. \nThey want to keep spending and taxing the way they have in the past. It \nis clear we cannot keep doing that.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I agree. As a matter of fact, we have heard reports \nthat the Democratic caucus is debating a budget in closed door caucus \nmeetings, and they have done that at least twice. This is now 6 weeks \nafter the committee deadline to bring forward a budget has passed.\n  These reports indicate that in order to oblige the Senate's leading \nprogressive, the Senator from Vermont, Senator Conrad has moved his \nbudget further to the left, I think, than he probably desires. So we \nare told this budget now has more taxes than savings--raising taxes $2 \ntrillion and possibly even $2.7 trillion, while cutting just $1.5 \ntrillion in spending over 10 years. We will have to see it to know for \nsure. All we are hearing is news reports at this point.\n  Even the President, in his speech, called for $3 in spending cuts for \nevery $1 in tax increases. Our analysis of his speech shows he did not \ndo that. But that is what he said is the right approach.\n  As a ranking Republican on the Finance Committee, what are the \nSenator's thoughts about how steep tax hikes would affect the economy? \nWould it be better to cut wasteful Washington spending or to raise \ntaxes and continue the spending spree we have been on?\n  Mr. HATCH. That is a good question. I tell my friend from Alabama \nthat it amazes me how much our friends on the other side are hard wired \nto increase taxes.\n  As the ranking member knows, if current tax policy is left in place, \nincluding today's low rates, family tax relief and the alternative \nminimum tax patch, the Congressional Budget Office tells us revenues \nwill trend to the historic average of 18 percent of GDP. The President \nmoves revenues up to record highs as a percentage of GDP. Last year it \nwas about 25.3 percent. The last time we had that was in 1945, at the \nend of the Second World War, at the height of it.\n  Now, the tax increases contemplated by the President's budget will \nmean half of the small business flow-through income will be hit with a \nmarginal tax rate of 17 to 24 percent on top of the regular tax rate. \nDemocrats and Republicans agree the small business sector is the key to \njob creation. Seventy percent of the jobs are created by small \nbusinesses. The top marginal rate on capital gains income will rise to \n59 percent in a little over 18 months under the President's budget. \nThat will drive down aftertax rates of return on investments.\n  Is that policy a path to recovery? I don't think so. I don't think \nanybody else who looks at it with any degree of intelligence thinks so. \nThat is another reason we need to engage in the budget process in the \ncommittee, and I have to say that I am appreciative of my friend's \nleadership on that committee. He will have to lead our side, but it is \nhard to lead when you don't have anything to lead on.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, we cannot even have a discussion if a budget \nisn't brought up.\n  I just had occasion to meet with the Finance Minister from Canada, \nand he told me they are bringing their corporate tax rate down to 15 \npercent or below. We are at 35 percent. We have the second highest \ncorporate tax rate in the world. Wouldn't it be nice if we can tax more \nand get some more money? But as the Senator knows from his experience, \nif we have too high of tax rates, it drives investment out of America, \ndrives jobs out of America, and companies are liable to want to move to \nCanada where they pay less taxes, creating jobs for them and not us.\n  So there is a danger, is there not, economically?\n  Mr. HATCH. Of course.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. There is a danger economically, is there not, and a \ndanger to growth, which we need desperately, if we keep raising taxes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Our corporate rate is 35 percent. That is the highest in \nthe world, other than Japan's. It is causing a lot of corporations to \nleave our country. In the 1970s, 39 of the top 50 multinational \ncorporations in the world were based in the United States. Today there \nare only 16--that was the last figure I heard--which is low. The reason \nis we are taxing them to death, and we have a lot of other screwy tax \naspects that don't work. We can solve all these problems if we just get \na decent budget and work to bring spending under control and get on a \ndownward trend with regard to spending.\n  I have to say, we cannot do it without budget debates and balance. \nOur friends on the other side don't seem to be able to get their caucus \ntogether and allow the chairman to come up with a budget on time, in a \nway that will help us debate this matter and, hopefully, resolve it on \nthe Senate floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I think the Senator is right. This Senate is filled \nwith remarkable people, but I think our colleagues on the other side \nare paralyzed, frankly, by the challenge of putting a plan on paper \nthat can actually be examined, the numbers calculated, and ideas \nconfronted. I think their problem is they are not able to produce a \nbudget their caucus will support, that the American people will \nsupport, and that would actually get the job done. That is a difficult \nchallenge. But if you want to be a leader, you have to meet that \nchallenge.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. My friend from Alabama, as he always does, has arrived \nprecisely at the critical point. We need a fiscal policy that is \nbalanced. Its remedies must respond to the causes of our current fiscal \ncalamity. In the most recent fiscal year, spending hit, as I said, over \n25 percent of GDP. That figure is easily more than 20 percent above the \nhistorical average.\n  It is unbelievable we are spending that much. Spending is fueling the \ndeficits we are facing. The President's budget reaches into the \nAmerican people's pocketbooks with taxes trending at or near historic \nhighs in an anemic effort to close the gap. The other side of the \nledger, spending, is not dented. It remains far above any reasonable \nhistoric average. Nobody can refute that fact. These are facts. I am \nconcerned about it. I will tell my colleague that.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Democratic leaders and the President talk a lot about a \nbalanced approach to reducing our deficit. We believe in that approach. \nThe Senator from Utah has indicated that. But I ask the Senator, what \nis the more balanced approach? Is the plan that hikes taxes and grows \nthe government or a plan that controls Washington spending and shifts \nthe balance back to everyday Americans?\n  Mr. HATCH. The ranking member, my friend from Alabama, summed up the \nfiscal predicament perfectly. It comes down to a lack of balance. Our \nfriends on the other side simply cannot agree among themselves at this \ntime, and the reason they cannot agree is, most of them are looking to \nthe revenue side of the ledger to resolve what is a spending problem.\n  The Finance Committee has jurisdiction over 50 percent of Federal \nspending, and that will trend to 60 percent shortly. It has \njurisdiction over nearly all revenues. As a member of the Finance \nCommittee and ranking member, I fail to see how a tax-increase-driven \nbudget can be advanced in the Finance Committee on a bipartisan basis. \nI am keenly interested in how the Budget Committee will come down on \nthe biggest policy question of our time.\n  I am pleased to have the advice and counsel of my friend from Alabama \nas that process moves forward. I would like to have the advice and \ncounsel of the distinguished Budget Committee chairman, but he cannot \nget his side to do what is reasonable; that is, bring down spending. \nThat is what we have to do. We are taxing enough. We are spending us \ninto oblivion, and that is the problem.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. This is true. It is dangerous to our country. We have \ngone 750 days without passing a budget in the Senate. I do believe if \nwe took a poll of the American people, what percentage would one get if \nthey were asked: Should the Congress of the United States, particularly \nat a time of great financial danger, have a budget? We will not have a \nbudget unless the Senate acts.\n  It is a question both of philosophy and economics. Philosophically, \nthe American people do not want Washington to hike taxes on millions of \nAmericans in order to fund its wasteful\n\n[[Page S3122]]\n\nspending spree. Economically, the evidence shows cutting spending--not \nraising taxes--and we have done a number of studies on this--is the \napproach that consistently produces the best results time and time \nagain.\n  We need a budget based on facts. We need a budget to grow the \neconomy, not the government. We need a budget that imposes real \nspending discipline on Washington. We need a budget without gimmicks or \nempty promises. We need a budget that is produced publicly and openly, \nallowing the American people full opportunity to see what is in it and \nto consider it. We need a budget that the American people deserve, an \nhonest budget that spares our children from both the growing burden of \ndebt and the growing burden of big government. We need a budget that \nensures America will compete, creating jobs, lead, and thrive in the \n21st century.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague. He sums it up pretty well, is all I \ncan say. For our children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren, we \nneed to get this done. Frankly, it ought to be done in the Budget \nCommittee and not by rule XIV on the floor. The reason it should be \ndone in the Budget Committee is because I know the minority will weigh \nin and at least have their viewpoints expressed. There will be \namendments, and people can vote up or down on whatever it is. Then they \ncan bring it to the floor, and we should have a complete consideration \nof it here as well. That is the way it ought to be done.\n  As a former member of the Budget Committee, I have to admit it is a \ndifficult process, but it is not difficult if we all work together to \nget spending under control and quit taxing the American people to \ndeath. We can do this if we work together.\n  I hate to say it, but I think our friends on the other side are not \nworking together in their own caucus. The distinguished Senator from \nAlabama has pointed that out--I think courteously--today. I hope they \nwill get together, even though I am pretty sure they are going to come \nup with a budget that continues to spend and tax such as we have had in \nthe past. I hope they do not. If they do not, I think the American \npeople will breathe a sigh of relief and say they did a good job. If \nthey do, I think it will be more of the same.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank Senator Hatch. I have enjoyed sharing these \nthoughts. I will note again that we are looking at a period in history \nin which our systemic debt problem is greater, I believe, than any time \nin our history. World War II was serious, but we could see our way out \nof it as soon as that war was over, and we bounced back rapidly.\n  Every expert tells us it is not going to be easy to bounce back out \nof the systemic problems we have. We need to have leadership. To have \ngone this long, 750 days without a budget in the Senate. Last year we \ndid not pass a budget, and there were 59 Democrats in the Senate.\n  One may say: Don't be so partisan, Senator Sessions. We are calling \ntheir names this morning. We like our colleagues, but the truth is, \nwhen you have the majority, you have a responsibility. The \nresponsibility at this point in history could not be greater than to \nproduce a blueprint, a plan for the future, such as the House has done, \nthat the American people can see: Does that solve our problems? Does it \nput us on the right path? I think the House bill does.\n  We have yet to see anything out of the Senate that does. It is our \nresponsibility in this body to pass legislation, because if we do not, \nwe cannot conference with the House, and we can never get a budget \npassed.\n  I thank Senator Hatch. I look forward to working with our colleagues. \nMaybe we can somehow break this logjam. The American people have a \nright to watch us and not be happy when we are not doing the kind of \nwork necessary to put this country on a sound financial path.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Is it time to move to the Liu nomination?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Not until 11 o'clock. There are a \nfew minutes remaining.\n  Mr. HATCH.

Under the previous order, the time until 2 \np.m. will be equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or \ntheir designees.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am very honored to speak in favor of the \nGoodwin Liu nomination and to urge my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to cast a proud vote for an extraordinary person, a remarkable \nyoung man who, for want of a better word, is just a star in everything \nhe has ever done.\n  This is a picture of Goodwin. To say Goodwin personifies the dream of \nAmerica is an understatement. To say this is a good nomination \nunderstates the way I feel about it. I thank the President for moving \nforward with Goodwin on two occasions, two nominations--or three times. \nI thank the Judiciary Committee for reporting him out on more than one \noccasion. Of course, I thank Senators Leahy and Reid and Feinstein for \ntheir hard work in getting us to this point.\n  It is rather stunning for me to hear conservative Republicans come to \nthe floor and blast this nominee because Goodwin Liu, Professor Liu has \nsupport from some of the most conservative legal minds in the country. \nKen Starr, who, as we all know, was the special counsel on the White \nWater matter and who was considered at that time quite partisan and was \none of the conservative, I think--I want to say stars of their thought, \nsaid:\n\n       In our view--\n\n  And he writes this with Professor Amar, and this was published.\n\n       In our view, the traits that should weigh most heavily in \n     the evaluation of an extraordinarily qualified nominee such \n     as Goodwin are professional integrity and the ability to \n     discharge faithfully an abiding duty to follow the law. \n     Because Goodwin possesses those qualities to the highest \n     degree, we are confident that he will serve on the Court of \n     Appeals not only fairly and competently, but with great \n     distinction. We support and urge his speedy confirmation.\n\n  This is Kenneth Starr.\n  So I say to my Republican conservative friends, before you come here \nand start attacking Goodwin Liu for things he has never done, read what \nsome of your conservative leaders in the legal profession are saying.\n  Just today in Politico there is yet another op-ed written by the \nchief\n\n[[Page S3123]]\n\nWhite House ethics lawyer under George W. Bush for 2\\1/2\\ years, \nRichard Painter, a Republican serving a Republican administration. This \nis what he said:\n\n       All that is required is for Senate Republicans to practice \n     what they preached for so long under Bush. Give Liu an up-or-\n     down vote rather than a filibuster.\n\n  Well, we are facing a filibuster. I want the American people to \nknow--and everyone who is supporting Goodwin Liu and everyone who \nsupports giving young, extremely talented people a chance to prove \ntheir mettle--that this is someone who has been a star his whole life, \nsomeone who caught the dream. Give this man a chance. Don't filibuster \nthis. Let's have an up-or-down vote.\n  I think the ramifications--and I feel very strongly about this. I \ndon't say this very often on the floor. I think the ramifications of \nthis filibuster are going to be long and difficult for those who caused \nthis good man to be filibustered, unless, of course, we get the 60 \nvotes we need. Why do I think that? I am going to tell my colleagues \nwhy I think that. I am going to spend the next few minutes talking \nabout Goodwin and telling my colleagues about his life and his \nachievements and his amazing recognition by so many in his short 40 \nyears. Goodwin Liu has been extremely successful at each stage of his \nacademic and professional career. He has reached for the stars, and he \nhas grabbed them.\n  He was the covaledictorian and captain of his tennis team in high \nschool. Let's start with Goodwin in high school. He was born to \nTaiwanese immigrants who are both physicians, they moved to Sacramento, \nand they were quite an influence on Goodwin. They used to leave out \nmath problems for him to solve even after he finished his homework. \nThey said to Goodwin: You work hard and you can get what you want. They \nforgot to mention there is a filibuster that could interfere, but let's \nnot go there because we certainly hope we get the 60 votes.\n  So it starts in high school where we have a covaledictorian, a \ncaptain of the tennis team at Rio Americano High School in Sacramento. \nThen he goes to Stanford, where he graduates Phi Beta Kappa--a very big \nhonor--from Stanford. While he is at Stanford, he is elected \ncopresident of the student body. He receives an award called the Lloyd \nDinkelspiel Award. It is the university's highest honor for outstanding \nservice to undergraduate education.\n  So in high school, he is a star. He is a star at Stanford. Then he \ngoes to Oxford University, where he was a Rhodes Scholar, which is \nconsidered one of the most prestigious academic accomplishments.\n  Following his time at Oxford, he decides to attend law school at Yale \nUniversity. Once again, Goodwin goes to Yale and he is a star. He was \nan editor of the Law Journal. Along with a classmate, he won the law \nschool's moot court competition. He wrote an article during his third \nyear of law school that won two awards, one for best paper by a third-\nyear law student and another for the best paper on taxation.\n  He had such a distinguished record in law school that it earned him a \nclerkship with Judge David Tatel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia, and then he does so well there that he serves in \none of the most prestigious clerkships in the country--a law clerk to \nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  I say to my Republican colleagues, what are you thinking? We should \nthank Goodwin for being willing to continue his life of public service. \nWe should be praising his decision to put up with all of this \nconfirmation process. Instead, they have given him a horrible time, an \nawful time, a miserable time. I said yesterday on the floor while \naddressing his wife and his kids: You be proud of your dad and you be \nproud of your husband, because I say this: If he doesn't get this, it \nis about politics. It says more about the people here in this place \nthan it does about Goodwin. Throughout this period they have made all \nthese attacks on him, all these ideological attacks, frankly, on \nsomeone they made him become.\n\n  This is a man with huge support from conservatives, moderates, and \nliberals. He brings people together because of his personality, his \nkindness, how intelligent he is, how he listens to people. That is what \npeople tell us about him. Yet, still he has been viciously attacked, \nand we see politics being played.\n  This will not be lost on the American people, I will tell my \ncolleagues that right now, because this isn't just some guy whom the \nPresident bumped into one day and said: I think you would be good on \nthe court. This is an extraordinary American who has fought so hard in \nevery job he ever had to be the best, to bring the best qualities to \nhis work. That is why he has won the support of former Bush officials \nand Kenneth Starr, the conservatives I know support Goodwin. But it is \nnot good enough for the politics that are being played around here, and \nthis is not going to go down easy if he doesn't get his up-or-down \nvote. This is not going to go down easy. I have had experience in this \npolitical world for a long time. I won 11 straight elections. They have \nall been really--not all but most of them--very hard. I know when there \nis an issue that touches the heart, and I know when there is a person \nwho comes along who deserves better than what Goodwin Liu is getting \nfrom the Republicans. I am speaking of the Republicans here in this \nChamber, not the Republicans outside.\n  Let me read what Kenneth Starr said about this man. Let me read it \nagain to my colleagues.\n\n       The traits that should weigh most heavily in the evaluation \n     of an extraordinarily qualified nominee such as Goodwin are \n     professional integrity and the ability to discharge \n     faithfully an abiding duty to follow the law. Because Goodwin \n     possesses those qualities to the highest degree, we are \n     confident that he will serve on the Court of Appeals not only \n     fairly and competently, but with great distinction. We \n     support and urge his speedy confirmation.\n\n  That was Kenneth Starr. Well, Kenneth Starr's Republican friends are \nnot listening. ``Speedy confirmation.'' This is an emergency vacancy. \nThis is an emergency because they need to fill this position. What they \nare doing by playing politics with this is making sure the people of \nthis country--because the Ninth Circuit is a very important circuit--\nwill not get justice, unless they change their minds and come to their \nsenses and do what they said they would do.\n  I won't quote who said these things, but I have heard many on the \nother side say: Oh, we don't want to filibuster judges. Let them get an \nup-or-down vote. Then we hear they are not going to vote to give \nGoodwin an up-or-down vote. What is the reason? There is no reason. \nNobody can find a more qualified person. What is the message to the \npeople in this country when we have someone who was a star in high \nschool, a star in college, a star in law school, a star in everything \nhe did, a law clerk?\n\n  Now, he gave a lot of his life to public service in the Corporation \nfor National Service, where he helped launch the AmeriCorps public \nservice program. As a senior adviser in the program, he led the \nagency's efforts to build the AmeriCorps program at colleges and \nuniversities across this country.\n  Between his clerkships, Goodwin returned to government service as a \nSpecial Assistant to the Deputy Secretary of Education.\n  He won praise from Republicans, from Democrats, from conservatives, \nfrom liberals, from moderates in every position he ever held until he \ngot to this Senate floor, where the conservative Republicans turned \ntheir backs on Kenneth Starr, turned their backs on Bush administration \nlawyers, turned their backs on the facts of Goodwin Liu's life for some \nagenda. I am telling you, this will not go down easy for them. This \nwill not go down easy.\n  Goodwin served in the private sector. He worked for a very well \nrespected law firm, O'Melveny & Myers. He worked on a wide ring of \nmatters from antitrust to white-collar crime. He also maintained an \nactive pro bono practice--pro bono. He did things for free to help \npeople who needed his help.\n  Walter Dellinger of O'Melveny said Goodwin was ``widely respected in \nlaw practice and for his superb legal ability, his sound judgment, and \nhis warm collegiality.''\n  Well, let me tell you, the kind of treatment he is getting here is \nfar from warm. It is cold. It is wrong. It is harsh.\n\n[[Page S3124]]\n\n  I want to read again what Kenneth Starr said. This is the third time. \nKenneth Starr--you cannot get more conservative.\n\n       The traits that should weigh most heavily in the evaluation \n     of an extraordinarily qualified nominee such as Goodwin are \n     professional integrity and the ability to discharge \n     faithfully an abiding duty to follow the law. Because Goodwin \n     possesses those qualities to the highest degree, we are \n     confident that he will serve on the court of appeals not only \n     fairly and competently, but with great distinction. We \n     support and urge his speedy confirmation.\n\n  Kenneth Starr.\n  Again, today, in an op-ed piece in Politico, George W. Bush's White \nHouse ethics lawyer said:\n\n       All that is required is for Senate Republicans to practice \n     what they preached . . . : Give Liu an up or down vote rather \n     than a filibuster.\n\n  But, no, we are facing a filibuster against someone who is a star. So \nas we follow Goodwin's career--star in high school, star in college, \nstar in law school--everywhere he goes he is recognized.\n  In 2003 he joined UC Berkeley's faculty as a law professor where he \nhas excelled as a scholar and a teacher. He is considered in this \nNation one of the leading constitutional law and education law \nexperts--but not in this Chamber. What do they want from a nominee--\nbacking from conservatives, backing from liberals, backing from the \nmainstream?\n  His article on education law issues won the Education Law \nAssociation's award for distinguished scholarship in 2006.\n  He received the Distinguished Teaching Award in 2009, the \nuniversity's most prestigious award.\n  I have never--let me say this: I have seen some wonderful people come \nto this floor for confirmation, Democrats and Republicans. I have seen \nqualifications. I have voted for Republican judges, for Democratic \njudges. Honest to God, it is hard for me to recall someone who, at \nevery stage of his life--and he is only 40 years old--has been able to \nachieve such excellence.\n  What is the message coming from this body if we do not give this man \nan up-or-down vote? I am telling you, it will go down hard.\n  The American Bar Association gave him the highest rating--the highest \nrating--and yet we are facing a filibuster.\n  The Goldwater Institute--everybody knows Barry Goldwater, idol of \nconservatives--the director of the conservative Goldwater Institute \nendorsed Goodwin Liu. But that is not good enough for my Republican \nfriends. They said they are endorsing him because of his ``fresh, \nindependent thinking and intellectual honesty.'' But that is not enough \nfor my friends on the other side. They said they were endorsing him \nalso because of his ``scholarly credentials and experience to serve \nwith distinction on this important court.''\n  So we have heard from Kenneth Starr, a conservative icon. We have \nheard from George Bush's White House ethics lawyer for 2\\1/2\\ years, \nRichard Painter. He wrote today. Let's see what else Richard Painter \nwrote about Goodwin. These supporters of Goodwin's are passionate. That \nis why I say this is going to go down hard if we do not get this \ncloture vote. This is interesting. He writes:\n\n       I've done my share of vetting judicial candidates and \n     fighting the confirmation wars. I didn't know much about Liu \n     before his nomination to the Ninth Circuit. But I became \n     intrigued by the attention the nomination generated, and I \n     wondered if his Republican critics were deploying the same \n     tactics the Democrats had used [against] Republican nominees. \n     They were. If anything, the attacks on Liu have been even \n     more unfair. . . .\n\n  More unfair.\n\n       Based on my own review of his record, I believe it's not a \n     close question that Liu is an outstanding nominee whose views \n     fall well within the legal mainstream. That conclusion is \n     shared by leading conservatives who are familiar with Liu's \n     record.\n\n  That is not good enough for my friends on the other side. Well, I \nwill give them another quote.\n  Former Republican Congressman Bob Barr has also offered praise of \nProfessor Liu's ``commitment to the Constitution and to a fair criminal \njustice system,'' as he puts it. He noted:\n\n       [Liu's] views are shared by many scholars, lawyers and \n     public officials from across the ideological spectrum.\n\n  But Bob Barr's opinion is not good enough for my friends on the other \nside.\n  I am even going to read a quote from a former Congressman who tried \nto get the Republican nomination twice to run against me, Tom Campbell. \nHe and I have had a couple of disagreements, but not on Goodwin. Tom \nCampbell, who served 9 years as a Republican Congressman from \nCalifornia, said:\n\n       Goodwin will bring scholarly distinction and a strong \n     reputation for integrity, fair-mindedness and collegiality to \n     the Ninth Circuit.\n\n  Reflecting on Liu's many years of work in serving the public \ninterest, Campbell also said:\n\n       I am not surprised that [Liu] has again been called to \n     public service.\n\n  So it goes on and on. I will give you another Republican. Brian \nJones, who served as the general counsel at the Department of Education \nfrom 2001 to 2005 under George W. Bush, after Liu's tenure there, this \nis what he said about Goodwin that speaks to the heart and soul of this \ngood human being:\n\n       During [2001 and 2002], and even after he became a law \n     professor in 2003, [Goodwin] volunteered his time and \n     expertise on several occasions to help me and my staff sort \n     through legal issues. . . . In those interactions, Goodwin's \n     efforts were models of bipartisan cooperation.\n\n  Listen:\n\n       In those interactions, Goodwin's efforts were models of \n     bipartisan cooperation.\n       He brought useful knowledge and careful lawyerly \n     perspectives that helped our administration to achieve its \n     goals.\n\n  And he says:\n\n       I am convinced, based on his record and my own experiences \n     with him, that he is thoughtful, fair-minded and well-\n     qualified to be an appellate judge.\n\n  Well, all those wonderful letters--and let me thank everyone who is \nengaged in this battle, from Kenneth Starr to the Goldwater Institute, \nand all the conservatives who have gotten involved in this campaign on \nGoodwin's side and all the liberals and all the moderates.\n  Here is a man whose family came from Taiwan. They taught him every \nvalue of family. Goodwin has a beautiful family. They taught him every \nvalue of hard work, every value of education, every value of fairness \nand justice. Why we would not give this man an up-or-down vote--that is \nall we are asking. No, they bring out the filibuster, and it is going \nto go down hard if this man does not get this opportunity.\n  So, Mr. President, this has been an honor for me to stand here for 2 \ndays to lay out the strong support that Goodwin Liu has, not just from \nthe two home State Senators--and let's keep that one in mind, Senators. \nWhen you and your colleague in your State are backing a nominee, just \nkeep in mind, do not ever tell us, well, that does not matter because \nit should matter. He has strong support from the two home State \nSenators, strong support across the political spectrum, strong support \nby community organizations.\n  In closing, let me say this: Diversity is important on the bench. Why \ndo I say that? I say that because America, we are a melting pot, and we \nare proud of this American dream. But if our court does not reflect \nthis diversity, it could still be fair, it could still be just, but not \nas good as if we have a diversity of thought and ethnic diversity.\n  The Ninth Circuit--this is interesting. The Ninth Circuit covers an \narea where 40 percent of Asian Americans live. Forty percent of Asian \nAmericans live within the Ninth Circuit boundaries, and we do not have \nan Asian American judge.\n  Is the Asian American community excited about this nomination? \nAbsolutely. Whether they are Republicans--and many of them are--whether \nthey are Democrats--and many of them are. I think it is almost like a \n50-50 split in the Asian American community.\n  Well, pay attention to this. This is a moment. It should be a moment \nof great celebration. I am fearful--I am fearful--it might not be, but \nI am forever hopeful that it will be. If people listen, and they see \nthe breadth of support for this man, and they take politics out of the \nequation and ideology out of the equation, they will vote for ending \nthis filibuster, and they will vote for Goodwin.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the \nnomination of Goodwin Liu to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth \nCircuit.\n\n[[Page S3125]]\n\n  As he said at the first hearing before the Judiciary Committee, his \nrecord is public, and he has written what he has written; he has said \nwhat he has said.\n  That record is what we have to go on, the basis on which we have to \nmake a decision about his nomination to the Federal bench or his \nconfirmation by the Senate.\n  Professor Liu's record endorses a powerful judiciary that can take \ncontrol of the law in general and of the Constitution in particular. \nHis activist judicial philosophy is fundamentally at odds with the \nprinciples on which our system of government is based.\n  I examine a judicial nominee's entire record to determine if he is \nqualified by legal experience and, even more important, by judicial \nphilosophy.\n  As to Professor Liu's legal experience, I know the ABA has rated him \nunanimously ``well qualified.'' That is more than a little baffling \nsince the ABA's own criteria state the nominee should have at least 12 \nyears of actual law and practice and substantial trial experience as a \nlawyer or trial judge. So it is a little bit more than baffling. \nProfessor Liu has none of that. None of the actual law practice and \nsubstantial trial experience as a lawyer--none. Suffice it to say that \nunderstanding the mysteries of the ABA's judicial nominee ratings has \neluded me for many years. Sometimes they do a great job. A lot of times \nthey do not and politics enter in.\n\n  The more important qualification for judicial service is the \nnominee's judicial philosophy and his understanding of the power and \nthe proper role of government in our system of government. Professor \nLiu has been unequivocal about his views on this issue, writing and \nspeaking directly about how judges should go about judging. He has \nwritten and spoken extensively about how judges should interpret and \napply the law, especially the Constitution, to decide cases.\n  The debate about judicial philosophy comes down to this. We can all \nread what the Constitution says. The real question is what the \nConstitution means, where the meaning of its words properly may be \nfound. The debate is about who gets the final say on what the \nConstitution means, the people or the judges.\n  America's founders clearly took the people's side in this debate. In \nhis farewell address in 1796, President George Washington said that the \nvery basis of our political system is that the people control the \nConstitution. He said until the people change the Constitution, it is \nsacredly obligatory upon all. That certainly includes, in fact that \nprimarily includes, government because that is what the Constitution \nexists to do, to both empower and to limit government.\n  The Constitution cannot limit government if it cannot limit judges \nand it cannot limit judges if they control what the Constitution means. \nThe Constitution belongs to the people, not to judges.\n  President Obama takes the opposite view. When he was a Senator and \nopposed the nomination of Chief Justice John Roberts, one of the \ngreatest appellate lawyers in the history of the country--he said that \njudges decide cases based on their deepest values and core concerns, \ntheir perspective on how the world works, their empathy, and what is in \ntheir heart. That is what then-Senator Obama said.\n  As a Presidential candidate he made the same case to the Planned \nParenthood Action Fund and said these were the criteria by which he \nwould pick judges.\n  President Obama certainly kept that campaign promise in the person of \nProfessor Goodwin Liu. Professor Liu has written that judges are \nliterally on a search for new constitutional meaning. In article after \narticle, in speech after speech, he argues that judges on this quest \nfor new constitutional meaning may find it in such things as the \nconcerns, conditions, and evolving norms of society; social movements \nand practices; and shifting cultural understandings. No matter how you \ncut it, these are simply alternative ways of saying the Constitution \nmeans whatever judges say it means. This is a blueprint for a judiciary \nthat controls the Constitution.\n  Professor Liu's approach treats the Constitution as if it were \nwritten in some kind of code or disappearing ink and treats judges as \nthe only ones who have the key to figuring it out.\n  Professor Liu, of course, is hardly the only one to make this \nargument. It is pretty standard fare for those who want our \nConstitution to say and mean something other than what it does. When \nthese folks want government to have power the real Constitution denies, \nthey urge judges to change the Constitution's meaning to be what they \nwant. When these folks do not want government to have power the real \nConstitution allows, they urge judges to make up so-called rights that \nare not there at all.\n  Whether seeking liberal or conservative political results, this is \nreal judicial activism: judges taking control of our law by taking \ncontrol of its meaning; judges remaking the Constitution in their own \nimage. In my 35 years of actively participating in the judicial \nconfirmation process, I don't recall someone who more forcefully and \ndirectly advocated such an activist judiciary.\n  In a 2008 article published in the Stanford Law Review, for example, \nProfessor Liu argued that the judiciary is ``a culturally situated \ninterpreter of social meaning.''\n  That would be a surprise to America's founders, who had a much more \npedestrian view of the judiciary, which Alexander Hamilton described as \nthe weakest and least dangerous branch.\n  Thomas Jefferson warned that if judges could control the \nConstitution's meaning it would be nothing but a lump of wax that \njudges could twist and shape into any form they please. There is no \nroom in this modest judicial role for something as grand as \ninterpreting social meaning.\n  I grant that there are individuals or institutions in our society \nthat should play this role. I think elected representative bodies, such \nas the one in which I am proud to serve, should play this role. But the \nlast body of people in our society who should play this role of \nculturally interpreting social meaning are judges in whose hands is \nplaced the interpretation and application of the supreme law of the \nland.\n  I, for one, did not take an oath to support and defend a judge's \nempathy or perspective on how the world works, whether that judge is \nliberal or conservative. I did not take an oath to support and defend a \njudge's view of evolving social norms or shifting cultural \nunderstandings. I took an oath to support and defend the Constitution \nof the United States, a document that belongs, in its words and its \nmeaning, to the people of the United States. The Constitution I have \nsworn to support and defend places limits on government, including \nlimits on the judiciary and the people alone have authority to change \nthose limits.\n  Professor Liu advocated an activist judiciary before he had been \nnominated to the judiciary, but when he came before the Judiciary \nCommittee in each of two hearings he painted a very different picture. \nBefore his nomination, for example, he wrote in the Stanford Law Review \nthat judges must determine ``whether our collective values on a given \nissue have converged to a degree that they can be persuasively \ncrystallized and credibly absorbed into legal doctrine.'' After his \nnomination he told the Judiciary Committee that there is no room for \njudges to invent or create new theories.\n  Now it is anybody's guess what all of that collective value \nconvergence and credible crystallization means. But if that is not a \nnew theory, I don't know what it is.\n  Before his nomination, Professor Liu wrote directly and forcefully \nabout where judges should look for the meaning of the Constitution. He \nmade a career of it, received awards for it, and became one of the \nstars of the leftwing legal universe. After his nomination when I \nraised some of his controversial writings at his first hearing, \nProfessor Liu told me ``whatever I may have written in the books and \narticles would have no bearing on my role as a judge.''\n  At the end of that same hearing last year, Professor Liu told one of \nmy committee colleagues that ``as you look across my entire record, \nthere are many things I think relevant to the kind of judge I would \nbe.''\n  Which is it? Before he wants to be a judge he argues that judges can \nfind new meaning for the Constitution in changing cultural \nunderstanding and evolving social norms. After he wants to become a \njudge he tells critics to ignore that record but tells supporters to\n\n[[Page S3126]]\n\nconsider that record. This has been about the most stunning \nconfirmation conversion I have seen in all my time in the Senate.\n  In closing, the fight over judicial nominees is a fight over judicial \npower. Judges must either take the law as they find it, as the people \nand their elected representatives make it, or judges may make the law \ninto whatever they want it to be. Those are the two choices. Our \nliberty requires that people to whom the Constitution belongs alone \nhave the authority to change it. Our liberty requires judges who will \nbe controlled by that Constitution.\n  President Obama and Professor Liu instead advocate a judiciary able \nto control the Constitution, to change the Constitution, to literally \ncreate from scratch a new Constitution. That will destroy our liberty.\n  When I look at Professor Liu's record I see he consistently and \nstrongly advocates an approach that allows judges to find the meaning \nof the Constitution virtually anywhere they want to. That is the \nopposite of the defined, limited role judges properly have in our \nsystem of government. I cannot support someone for appointment to the \nFederal bench, especially to what is already the most activist circuit \nin the country, who believes judges should have that much power.\n  The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals is indeed the most activist court \nin the country. It is a court that ignores the law consistently--or at \nleast some of the judges on that court. Judge Reinhardt, who is a \nbrilliant man by any measure, apparently doesn't even care what the \nwords of the Constitution say. He is going to interpret things the way \nhe wants. He is just one. There is a whole raft of them there. Judge \nReinhardt gets reversed almost every time he writes an opinion--by the \nSupreme Court of the United States. The problem is that people can say: \nIsn't that taken care of by the Supreme Court? Yes, it is in those \nindividual decisions. But in these circuit courts of appeals there are \nthousands of court cases and legal opinions written that will never be \nconsidered by the Supreme Court because the Supreme Court only \nconsiders between 80 and 100 cases a year. But thousands of cases are \ndecided by these circuit courts of appeal, so they are important. Who \nwe put on them is important, too. We don't need any more judicial \nactivists, either from the right or left, interpreting the Constitution \nin accordance with their own predilections rather than what the \nConstitution actually says.\n  Goodwin Liu has a long history of positions that are outrageous to \nthose of us who want the courts to be what they should be, interpreters \nof the laws, not makers of the law. They are not elected to anything \nand they are appointed for life on the basis that they will do what is \nright and that they will uphold the law regardless of whether they \nagree with it.\n  I have to say folks on our side who have listened to Goodwin Liu, we \nknow what he stands for and what he has taught in schools. What he has \nwritten in books and law review articles is contrary to what judges \nshould do. I don't care that the American Bar Association has given him \nsuch a sterling rating.\n  This is an important issue. I wish I didn't have to vote against \nGoodwin Liu because I like him personally. In fact, this is not about \nhim as a person but whether he will be the right kind of judge. I am \nconvinced that he will not and, therefore, I must strongly oppose his \nnomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to speak on the Liu \nnomination. I appreciate the good advocacy of Senator Boxer. But I \nwould remind her that she and her Democratic colleagues changed the \nground rules of the Senate and created filibusters that had heretofore \nnot been done in early 2001.\n  I opposed that, but after much debate, several years in which a half \ndozen fabulous nominees to the courts were being blocked by \nfilibusters, the Gang of 14 decided that matter and said: Well, we all \nagree now. We will not filibuster except in extraordinary \ncircumstances.\n  I think as a matter of law, not as a matter of character and \npersonality but as a matter of approach to law, extraordinary \ncircumstances exist in this case.\n  I have heard my colleague talk about Professor Liu's unusual \nintellectual abilities, his academic career, clerkship on the Supreme \nCourt, and his prolific writings--and certainly I do not dispute he is \na good man and involved in debate about law in America.\n  What they fail to mention, however, is his lack of any meaningful \nexperience as a practicing attorney. He has never tried a case before a \njury and has argued only once before a Federal court of appeals--only \nonce. This is a very serious shortcoming for a number of reasons, the \nmost important of which is the plain fact that significant legal \nexperience litigating in court provides insight to someone who would be \na judge and an understanding that words have meaning and consequences.\n  It is a real legal world testing ground in which persons can prove \ntheir judgment and their integrity and their skill. It also provides a \nmaturing experience, where one learns that words have reality and that \na single word in a deed, a contract, a letter or even an e-mail can \ndetermine which party receives millions of dollars in a lawsuit or even \nwhether they go to jail.\n  Seasoned lawyers bring much to the bench, as do judges who have had \nprevious experience when they go on to the courts of appeals. This lack \nof litigation experience leaves me with only two sources of how to \nevaluate how this nominee would behave on the bench: his writings, \nwhich are extensive, and his testimony before the committee, which \nfrankly, I thought did not have much value.\n  From his writings, one cannot help but see that Mr. Liu has \nextraordinary beliefs about our laws and Constitution, beliefs that \nfall far outside the mainstream. They just do. Professor Liu does not \nbelieve judges are bound to apply the Constitution according to what it \nactually meant at its drafting or what it plainly says. But he believes \njudges are free to adapt the Constitution according to how they \nperceive the needs of modern society.\n  In fact, he has written this:\n\n       Interpreting the Constitution requires adaptation of its \n     broad principles to the conditions and challenges faced by \n     successive generations. The question is not how the \n     Constitution would have been applied at its founding, but \n     rather how it should be applied today in light of changing \n     needs, conditions, understandings of our society.\n\n  This is an untethering of a judge from law, in my opinion. He has \nalso written that the Constitution has no fixed meaning. He has written \nthat ``our Constitution has shown a remarkable capacity to absorb new \nmeaning and new commitments forged from passionate dialogue and debate, \nvigorous dissent and sometimes disobedience.''\n  He goes on to say: ``Fidelity to the Constitution requires judges to \nask not how its general principles would have been applied in 1789 or \nin 1868, but rather how those principles should be applied today in \norder to preserve their power and meaning in light of concerns, \nconditions, and evolving norms of our society.''\n  To that, I would disagree and say: Words do have meaning. They mean \nsomething specific. When they are written down in a statute or a \nConstitution, that meaning does not change by the mere passage of time \nor the mere shifting of political winds or the judge's personal views \nabout what may be the concerns, conditions, and evolving norms of our \nsociety.\n  Judges are not empowered to do that. They are not empowered to impose \ntheir views about the concerns, conditions, and evolving norms of our \nsociety. Judges are given the power to decide cases and to say what the \nplain meaning of the law is. For a judge to believe otherwise is a \nserious threat to the rule of law and to the principles that make this \nNation great.\n  Professor Liu's writings express extreme views about more than \nConstitutional interpretation. His writings have often expressed an \nunorthodox view of the role of a judge. Alexander Hamilton famously \nwrote in the Federalist Paper 78 that:\n\n       The judiciary . . . has no influence over either the sword, \n     the purse; no direction either of the strength or of the \n     wealth of the society; and can take no active resolution \n     whatever. It may truly be said to have neither force nor \n     will, but merely judgment.\n\n  Frankly, having read his writings and listened to his testimony, for \nall his great capabilities and fine character, I have concluded that he \nindeed\n\n[[Page S3127]]\n\nlacks the most essential quality of a judge; that is, good judgment, \nproven in the practice of law or as a previously appointed judge.\n  I agree with the role of a judge as envisioned by Chief Justice \nMarshall when he wrote: ``It is emphatically the province and duty of \nthe Judicial Department to say what the law is.''\n  I think Chief Justice Roberts perfectly summed up the role of a judge \nas the Founders saw it, as we have been raised to understand it, when \nhe said that a judge should be a neutral umpire who calls the balls and \nstrikes without preference for either side.\n  But Professor Liu does not agree with that analogy. He attacked Chief \nJustice Roberts. He does not argue that the task of judges is to read \nthe words of the Constitution according to their original meaning. \nInstead he has written that:\n\n       The historical development and binding character of our \n     constitutional understanding demand more complex explanations \n     than a conventional account of the courts as independent, \n     socially detached decision makers that say what the law is. \n     The enduring task of the judiciary . . . is to find a way to \n     articulate constitutional law that the nation can accept as \n     its own.\n\n  This is utterly wrong. That view cannot be accepted because it calls \nfor a judge to ponder, to seek, to render a decision that is popular or \nfits the judge's own values. Most certainly such a decisionmaking \nmethod is not law. It is not objective. It is subjective. It allows a \njudge to base rulings on factors that are incapable of being a \nstandard. It introduces politics, ideology, religion, and whatever else \nmay be in a judge's mind in a decisionmaking process. That is contrary \nto the entire history of the American rule of law that served us so \nwell.\n  Mr. Liu has also written that ``the problem for courts is to \ndetermine, at the moment of decision, whether our collective values on \na given issue have converged to a degree that they can be persuasively \ncrystallized and credibly absorbed into legal doctrine.'' These words \ndescribe a policymaker not a judge.\n  Professor Liu's writings also show he does not share our Founding \nFathers' vision in many different areas. He does not see the \nConstitution as a charter of freedom from government interference. \nInstead, he argues that portions of the Constitution create positive \nrights to welfare benefits. He attempts to derive all these rights from \nthe citizenship clause of the fourteenth amendment.\n  That clause reads simply this: ``All persons born or naturalized in \nthe United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens \nof the United States and of the State wherein they reside.''\n  It may be difficult to determine exactly what some of the words mean \nin the Constitution. However, our language has not changed so much that \nthese words could possibly be read to mean that all Americans have a \nright to various benefits, such as--this is what Mr. Liu has written:\n\n       . . . expanded health insurance, child care, transportation \n     subsidies--\n\n  I kid you not--\n\n     job training and a robust earned income tax credit.\n\n  That is what he has written in several important law journals; not \nremarks in a casual conversation. He has written in law journals. He \nwrites that word ``citizenship'' does not mean citizenship in that \nclause but rather ``the ability to be a fully able participating member \nof society.''\n  The Constitution did not say that. The citizenship clause simply made \na person a citizen. His article asserts that education, health \ninsurance, childcare, transportation subsidies, job training, and \npresumably other welfare benefits we might need are constitutional \nrights because the citizenship clause ultimately requires equality of \nresults in those contexts.\n  He asserts that the judge's role is to ensure such a result is \nachieved, even if the legislature may not so find. That is like no \ndefinition of citizenship I have ever heard. Professor Liu's \ninterpretation of the citizenship clause is so far disconnected from \nthe actual text of the document and what the people meant when they \nratified it that it would be unrecognizable to those who drafted it.\n  Some of Professor Liu's supporters have said--as he did before the \ncommittee--that his argument about the citizenship clause was directed \nonly at Congress, the legislative branch, executive branch, and it was \nnever meant for judges. That simply does not square with what he wrote, \nand we have researched this and tried to be fair to him.\n  In 2008, Professor Liu published an article entitled ``Rethinking \nConstitutional Welfare Rights.'' Constitutional welfare rights. In that \narticle, he set out to make--as he said--``a small step toward \nreformation of thought on how welfare rights may be recognized through \nconstitutional adjudication.''\n  That means by judges. Judges do adjudication. In that same article, \nProfessor Liu argued that, once a legislative body creates a welfare \nprogram, it is the role of the courts--he said the courts--to determine \nthe community meaning and purpose of that welfare benefit, in light of \nthe needs of ``equality'' and ``national citizenship.''\n  Professor Liu explicitly stated that when necessary, courts should \nrecognize or expand these welfare rights by ``invalidating statutory \neligibility requirements''--this is his language he wrote--``by \ninvalidating statutory eligibility requirements''--that means welfare \neligibility requirements--``or strengthening procedural protections \nagainst the withdrawal of benefits.''\n  In other words, Professor Liu believes judges have the right and, \nindeed, the duty, to rewrite laws written by Congress when they think \nthose laws are inadequate or when the judge, without the traditional \nlimits of legal standards, decides the case on what the judge thinks is \nfair.\n  This truly is a dangerous, nonlegal philosophy. His writings also \nshow he holds a number of views on some of the most controversial \ntopics of our day that are extreme.\n  He believes the longstanding definition of marriage as between a man \nand a woman is unconstitutional. He filed a brief, with other law \nprofessors in the California case, on that subject. We asked him about \nthat at the hearing. Frankly, his answer was not satisfactory, in the \nsense that he said he was only referring to California law, when, in \nfact, his brief cited the U.S. Constitution, which has similar \nlanguage.\n  He also made statements that raise questions as to his temperament. \nHe was very nice at our hearing. We have heard nice things said about \nhim. I just ask if you consider these nice comments he made about Chief \nJustice Roberts, for example. He said that Chief Justice Roberts has \n``a vision for American law--a right-wing vision antagonistic to \nimportant rights and protections we currently enjoy.'' He criticized \nhim for being a member of the ``Republican National Lawyers Association \nand the National Legal Center for the Public Interest, whose mission is \nto promote (among other things) `free enterprise,' `private ownership \nof property,' and `limited government.' ''\n  These are all Mr. Liu's words. He considers those improper goals and \nsays, ``These are code words for an ideological agenda hostile to \nenvironmental, workplace, and consumer protections.''\n  Give me a break. With respect to Justice Alito--a fabulous member of \nthe Supreme Court, who is so experienced, so much more seasoned as a \nnominee than this nominee comes close to being--he went even further, \nappearing in person before the Judiciary Committee to testify that \nJustice Alito ``envisions an America where police may shoot and kill an \nunarmed boy to stop him from running away with a stolen purse; where \nFederal agents may point guns at ordinary citizens during a raid, even \nafter no sign of resistance; where a black man may be sentenced to \ndeath by an all-white jury for killing a white man; and where police \nmay search what a warrant permits, and then some.''\n  When asked about that in committee, he acknowledged that was \nunnecessarily colorful language. Nobody should say that kind of thing. \nIt was an intemperate remark and was unfair to Justice Alito.\n  Thus, I have concluded that the nomination presents an extraordinary \ncircumstance that requires me to oppose cloture on the nomination, \nwhich I am reluctant to do. I have voted against some nominees, but I \nhave voted for probably 90 percent of President Obama's and President \nClinton's nominees while I have been in the Senate. But this nominee, I \nbelieve, represents an extraordinary circumstance. His record reveals \nthat he believes the Constitution is a fluid, evolving document,\n\n[[Page S3128]]\n\nwith no fixed meaning; that he believes the role of a judge is to \nparticipate in a ``dialogue'' with the legislature about what welfare \nbenefits are required by the Constitution, and that the traditional \ndefinition of marriage is unconstitutional. His record also reveals he \nis willing to use the courts in order to achieve what he thinks is the \nproper level of social welfare benefits, and that he is willing to \nattack the integrity and distort the records of honorable judges in \norder to promote his views of what he thinks the Constitution should \nrequire.\n  I do believe our Senate would have done better not to have had \nfilibusters. That was my view. But we had a debate on that, and it \nchanged. If Senator Boxer and other Democrats now have rethought that \nmatter and wish to talk to me, I would certainly be willing to consider \nrestoring the traditional view of the Senate regarding filibusters of \njudges. I don't think that is likely to happen, because it was done \nsystematically and deliberately, with great deliberation and \ndetermination by the Democrats in 2001, I believe, and they imposed \nthat change on the Senate. That is what we are operating under today.\n  Based on that, I do believe Professor Liu should not be confirmed.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I join my colleague from Alabama, who \nhas served for a long time on the Senate Judiciary Committee, as have \nI, in voicing my strong opposition to this nominee.\n  It is odd, it seems to me, to have someone who has actually been \nnominated three separate times by this President, and I think it tells \nus something about the President's determination to nominate and see \nconfirmed someone who is unsuited for service as a Federal judge.\n  In saying that, it doesn't mean they don't have rights to speak \nfreely about their strongly held views. They do. That is what we do \nhere in the legislative branch. That is not what we expect out of a \nlife-tenured judge. We expect judges to be impartial, to render \njustice, and to decide cases, not to be roving policymakers making the \ncountry into their image of what it should be. We cannot vote for these \njudges. Judges are appointed and they serve for a lifetime. In return \nfor that lifetime appointment and that protection from the sort of \naccountability that other elected officials are required to have, we \nunderstand and our Constitution provides, that they have a limited but \nimportant role, and that is to apply the law as written, apply the \nwords of the Constitution as written, and not to sort of make it up as \nyou go along or to dream up new rights along the way that are not \nsubject to a vote of the American people, or subject to an election.\n  Based upon nearly everything that Mr. Liu, Professor Liu, has written \nor said, I have some very serious concerns about his impartiality and \nsuitability to serve as a life-tenured judge. My concerns start with \nhis lack of judicial temperament.\n  During the confirmation hearings of Justice Sam Alito, who is now on \nthe U.S. Supreme Court, Mr. Liu went out of his way to testify under \noath before the Senate Judiciary Committee in a way I can only describe \nas vicious and disgraceful. This is what he said:\n\n       Judge Alito's record envisions an America where police may \n     shoot and kill an unarmed boy to stop him from running away \n     with a stolen purse; where Federal agents may point guns at \n     ordinary citizens during a raid, even after no sign of \n     resistance; where the FBI may install a camera where you \n     sleep on the promise that they won't turn it on unless an \n     informant is in the room; where a black man may be sentenced \n     to death by an all-white jury for killing a white man, absent \n     a multiple regression analysis showing discrimination; and \n     where police may search where a warrant permits, and then \n     some.\n\n  I humbly submit this is not the America we know, nor is it the \nAmerica we aspire to be. These were the words of a person who President \nObama has, three times, nominated to serve on the Ninth Circuit Court \nof Appeals, one of the highest courts in the land, which is expected to \ndispassionately decide cases without fear, favor, or any preconceived \nnotion about the outcome. I think these words, perhaps more than \nanything else, demonstrate Professor Liu's nonsuitability to serve as a \nFederal judge. These were not an off-the-cuff set of remarks or a \ntemporary lapse in judgment; they were a product of carefully scripted \nand prepared testimony provided to the Senate Judiciary Committee \nduring the Alito hearings.\n  Despite Professor Liu's comments, Justice Alito was confirmed with \nbipartisan support. During his failed confirmation process last year, I \nasked Professor Liu that, if given the opportunity, would he change \nanything about his remarks about Justice Alito. In response, Mr. Liu \nclaimed that he regrets having written that passage, calling it \n``unduly harsh and provocative.''\n  Well, Professor Liu waited 4 years to provide that semi-apology to \nJustice Alito for these shameful remarks. Like so many nominees who \ncome before the Senate Judiciary committee, they seem to undergo a \nnomination conversion that changes the tone and nature of their remarks \nand attitudes. Frankly, we cannot depend on this conversion sticking. \nWe need greater assurance that the nominees who come before the Senate \nare going to exercise a sort of dispassionate judgment that we expect \nof judges.\n  Frankly, Professor Liu has shown himself capable of incredibly poor \njudgment--and not just one time. After Chief Justice Roberts was \nnominated to the Supreme Court, Mr. Liu again went out of his way to \ncriticize then-Judge Roberts. He argued that Justice Roberts' record \n``suggests that he has a vision for American law--a right-wing vision--\nantagonistic to important rights and protections that we currently \nenjoy, and that he is not afraid to flex judicial muscle to achieve \nit.''\n  In that same article, he attacked Justice Roberts' membership in the \nNational Legal Center for Public Interest, calling its mission to \npromote free enterprise, private property, and limited government--he \ncalled those code words for an ideological agenda hostile to the \nenvironment, workplace, and consumer protections.\n  So Professor Liu considers free enterprise, private property, and \nlimited government code words for an ideological agenda hostile to the \nenvironment, workplace, and consumer protections. That is what he said. \nIs that the kind of person we want, the Senate should want, or that \nAmerica should want to sit in judgment, enforce our Constitution and \nlaws passed by the Congress? Well, I think not.\n  Yet, in another dramatic nomination conversion during his failed \nnomination process last year, Professor Liu responded to my written \nquestions by calling this statement a ``poor choice of words.''\n  There are several more examples of Professor Liu's lack of judicial \ntemperament. His record is already crystal clear. It is one thing for \nProfessor Liu to disagree with a person--we do that every day on the \nfloor of the Senate, in committee, and around the country, across \nkitchen tables in our homes--but it is quite another to repeatedly \nengage in these types of inaccurate and, frankly, disgusting attacks \nagainst a public official trying to do their job the way they think it \nshould be done. For Professor Liu to only reflect upon his statements \nonce he is offered a life-tenured judgeship on the court of appeals is \nunacceptable.\n\n  Given his lack of experience as a practicing lawyer, obviously his \nlack of experience as a judge, never having served as a judge, it is \nimpossible for me to trust his assurances that now all of a sudden he \nwill calmly and impartially apply the law as written by Congress or as \nwritten in the Constitution of the United States.\n  I would cite just one other example of my experience on the Judiciary \nCommittee, this one involving now Justice Sonia Sotomayor. Justice \nSotomayor is a charming woman. She came into the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee hearings and won over many people who were, frankly, a little \nskeptical of her nomination based on some of her previous writings and \nspeeches. But I remember one particular question, she was asked whether \nshe accepted as an individual right the guarantee in the second \namendment of the Constitution the right to keep and bear arms, and she \nsaid she did. She accepted a decision in a case called the Heller case \nthat said that was an individual right of a citizen.\n\n[[Page S3129]]\n\n  A few months later, in a case called McDonald v. Chicago, she wrote a \ndissenting opinion from a Supreme Court decision where she said the \nright to keep and bear arms is not a fundamental right.\n  You can parse the words, ``an individual right,'' ``a fundamental \nright,'' but to me it is clear that Justice Sotomayor, during her \nconfirmation hearings, tried to parse the words in a way so as not to \nraise alarms about her commitment to the Bill of Rights and the second \namendment to the Constitution. But then once she was confirmed as a \njudge on the Highest Court in the land--of course, she serves for life \nwith no accountability either to Congress or to the voters, and she, \nindeed, serves with impunity, even though her testimony before the \ncommittee and her decisions, once on the Court are inconsistent.\n  We just cannot take a chance that Professor Liu has somehow had a \ntrue conversion in his views and his attitudes during the nomination \nprocess.\n  Aside from his questionable temperament, Professor Liu's activist \nviews of the law are equally troubling. In his book called ``Keeping \nFaith with the Constitution,'' Professor Liu summarizes activist \nphilosophy in this way. He said:\n\n       Fidelity to the Constitution requires judges to ask not how \n     its general principles would have applied in 1789 or 1868, \n     but rather how those principles should be applied today in \n     order to preserve their power and meaning in light of the \n     concerns, conditions, and evolving norms of our society.\n\n  What does that mean? Does that mean the words on the page do not \nnecessarily mean what they say; that a judge is going to somehow \nsubjectively read into those words what the evolving norms of our \nsociety are and to change an outcome to decide a case, to decide what \nour Constitution means based on their subjective impression of those \nwords and what evolving norms in society means?\n  That is sometimes called a doctrine of believing in a living \nConstitution; that the words on the page are mutable or changeable and \ncan morph over time and mean different things based on a judge's \ninterpretation of what those evolving norms are. To me, that is a \nlicense to lawlessness. It is a license for a judge--an unelected, \nlifetime-tenured individual who takes an oath to uphold the \nConstitution and laws of the United States--that is untethered to any \nconcept of what the law means, something that can be applied with equal \napplication to every man, woman, and child in America and gives a judge \na chance to impose their political or ideological views on what the \nConstitution means. That is dangerous, it is lawless, and it is not \nupholding the Constitution that we, even as Members, swear to uphold in \nour different jobs as policymakers.\n  Particularly troubling for Professor Liu is his controversial and, I \nwould say, ridiculous view that our Constitution somehow guarantees a \nEuropean-style welfare state. We are engaged in a very important debate \non the floor of the Senate, and during the course of this vote on the \ndebt ceiling--which I suppose we will have sometime in July, or not--\nwith whether we are going to continue to be an opportunity society or \nwhether we have become an entitlement society, a welfare state.\n  Professor Liu, in his article, ``Rethinking Constitutional Welfare \nRights,'' has argued that the Constitution includes an ``affirmative \nright to health insurance, childcare, transportation subsidies, job \ntraining, and a robust earned-income tax credit.''\n  I must have missed that in my copy of the Constitution. I do not \nremember the Founding Fathers writing in the Constitution, nor the \nStates ratifying language in the Constitution, that guarantees a right \nto a robust earned-income tax credit. When Senator Sessions gave \nProfessor Liu the opportunity to clarify his views in April 2010, he \nreplied:\n\n       I do believe that, Senator. But those arguments are \n     addressed to policymakers, not the courts.\n\n  I think Professor Liu is being disingenuous, and I am trying to be \ncharitable. When he says the Constitution includes these rights but \nsays those arguments are addressed to policymakers, not the courts, he \nis denying that a court that might agree with him might enforce those \nrights as a matter of constitutional law. This is not just addressed to \npolicymakers. That is not being honest. I do not blame him if he has an \nhonestly held view about these matters. I would welcome candor in \nexpressing those strongly held views. But they are views more \nappropriately expressed in the court of public opinion where we debate \nthe values and meaning of our laws and what kind of country we want \nthis to be, not in people who want to be judges and impose those views \nas a matter of judgment in an individual case, transforming the written \nConstitution into something completely different than what each of us \ncan read on a printed page or what we learned in school our \nConstitution actually means.\n  In other words, Professor Liu believes the Constitution contains an \nunenumerated list of goods and services, such as free health insurance, \ndaycare, and bus passes that Federal legislators must provide to every \ncitizen.\n  It is not difficult to see how an activist judge might one day use \nProfessor Liu's theory to force Congress to provide for these lavish \nwelfare benefits, even though our country faces a historic debt crisis, \nas we do now. What is more, Professor Liu has suggested that under his \nview of the Constitution, it may be unconstitutional to repeal certain \nwelfare programs once they are enacted.\n  For example, in ``Rethinking Constitutional Welfare Rights,'' \nProfessor Liu wrote that legislation may give rise to a cognizable \nconstitutional welfare right if it has ``sufficient ambition and \ndurability, reflecting the outcome of vigorous public contestation and \nthe considered judgment of a highly engaged citizenry.''\n  That is a mouthful. What he is saying is, once the legislature passes \na law, the legislature has no power to repeal that law because it \nsomehow then is transformed into a constitutional right and beyond the \npower of Congress to change. That is radical.\n  Professor Liu's writings also have suggested his unconventional \nbelief that the death penalty is unconstitutional, that same-sex \nmarriage is a constitutional right, and that it is appropriate for \njudges to consider foreign law when reaching their legal conclusions \nabout what American law means.\n  Taken as a whole, Professor Liu's record demonstrates that he would \nuse his position as a Federal judge to advocate his ideological \ntheories and undermine the well-settled principles of the U.S. \nConstitution. That is simply unacceptable to me. I think it should be \nunacceptable to the Senate.\n  Given his lack of temperament, his poor judgment, and his activist \nview of the role of judges and the law, I am left with no choice but to \nfight Professor Liu's confirmation with every tool at my disposal.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, I rise today to continue to express my \nviews in support of the nomination of Professor Goodwin Liu, a nominee, \nas you know, to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Much has been said \non the Senate floor in recent hours, and I rise to offer my comments on \nsome of the concerns that are being debated.\n  For once, it is great to actually hear debate on the floor of this \nChamber. I have been here, as you know, Madam President, just 6 months. \nAs someone who is new to the Judiciary Committee, new to the debates \nand dialog of this Chamber, I am struck at the things I am hearing \nabout Professor Goodwin Liu and the significant divergence between what \nI have found in questioning him, looking at his record, and speaking \nwith my colleagues and what I have heard on the floor just today.\n  I will do my best to try and lay out what I see as the real record of \nthe real Professor Goodwin Liu, a nominee to the Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n  Some have come to the floor today and argued that Professor Liu lacks \nthe candor or the temperament to serve on a circuit court. As someone \nwho clerked for the Third Circuit Court of Appeals for a distinguished \njudge, I will suggest something that I think is commonplace, which is \nthat candor and an appropriate temperament are critical to service on a \ncircuit court of appeals.\n  A lot of these charges raised against Professor Liu seem to center on \na few\n\n[[Page S3130]]\n\ncomments that Professor Liu made during the nomination hearing for now-\nJustice Alito or some purported deficiencies in his disclosures to the \nJudiciary Committee. Let me speak briefly to both of those, if I may.\n  Professor Liu has apologized at length and in detail for the \nintemperate tone of one brief passage that he wrote as part of his \ntestimony before the Judiciary Committee during the Alito nomination \nhearings now some 6 years ago. I take this apology at face value. I \ntake his expression of regret at the tone at face value. But anyone who \nhas taken the time to meet him, to interview him, to question him, I \nthink has to conclude that despite this one brief episode of the use of \nintemperate language, he is not an intemperate person.\n  In fact, the American Bar Association, as my colleague, Senator \nBoxer, pointed out previously today, specifically considered Professor \nLiu's temperament when it gave him its highest rating of ``unanimously \nwell qualified'' in the recommendation for his consideration by this \nbody.\n  Let me next turn briefly to claims about candor before the committee \nwhich I believe are equally unfounded. He has, in fact, testified \nbefore the Judiciary Committee for a total of 5 hours and answered \nhundreds of questions and requests for additional information. He has \nbeen sharply criticized for missing some documents from his initial \nresponse to what is a searching committee questionnaire.\n  I will comment for those following this debate that Professor Liu has \nbeen a prolific scholar and speaker. He is someone who has published \nextensively. He is someone who has spoken extensively. He is the first \ncontroversial circuit court nominee to have his nomination take place \nnot just in the computer age but in the YouTube age when a combination \nof cell phones and video recorders have literally made a record of \nevery bag lunch, every 5-minute speech, every off-the-cuff remark made \nby this nominee before us.\n  The argument that his need to supplement the record with some \ndocuments not initially produced and that somehow that reflects some \nlack of candor, and somehow that suggests a lack of truthfulness that \nshould disqualify him not for a vote but not even for a consideration \nof a vote is wholly without merit.\n  As the White House Chief Ethics Counsel under President Bush, Richard \nPainter, has written: Professor Liu's ``original answers to the \nquestions''--asked by the Judiciary Committee--``was a careful and \ngood-faith effort to supply the Senate with the information it needed \nto assess his nomination.''\n  It means a great deal to me that someone such as Mr. Painter \nconcluded that Professor Liu provided a lot more information than most \nnominees do in similar circumstances. Frankly, it seems to me \noverreaching to try to suggest that simply because in the YouTube age \nthis professor, who provided us with hours of testimony, pages of \nresponses, failed to notice the committee about some brown bag lunches \nand off-the-cuff comments rises to the standard of justifying a \nfilibuster.\n\n  Let me next turn to the suggestion that he is insufficiently \nqualified to hold the position of circuit judge--an important concern, \nbecause we want judges of judicial temperament, of openness and candor \nand good character, and also those who are sufficiently experienced. As \nI said a moment ago, the American Bar Association, after conducting a \nconfidential and comprehensive review of his qualifications, concluded \nhe was ``unanimously well-qualified''--its highest possible rating.\n  In previous nomination debates, Senators of this body, Senators of \nthe other party, have touted the ABA rating as a comprehensive and \nexhaustive evaluation that provides valuable insight that ought to be \ntrusted. Several Members of this body--several Senators--including some \nwho spoke immediately before me have made those exact references to the \nvalue of the ABA rating process. Reasonable minds may be able to differ \non the margins, but it is not credible, in my view, to claim a \ncandidate with Professor Liu's remarkable legal education, long record \nof public service and experience, and the ABA's highest rating is not \nqualified to serve on a circuit court.\n  The charges or suggestions that Professor Liu is unqualified because \nhe is young or because he lacks significant courtroom experience are \nalso hollow and one-sided when we look at the real record. Since 1980, \n14 nominees younger than Professor Liu--advanced by Republican \nPresidents--have all been confirmed. For example, Judge Neil Gorsuch, \non the Tenth Circuit, was 38 when nominated; Judge Brett Kavanaugh, an \nacquaintance and, I would say, friend of mine from law school--now on \nthe DC Circuit--was 38 when nominated; and now-Justice Samuel Alito was \n39 when nominated to the Third Circuit.\n  Republican nominees with similar or lesser practical courtroom \nexperience than Professor Liu have also been nominated and confirmed. \nCircuit Court Judge Frank Easterbrook and J. Harvie Wilkinson were both \nunder 40 when nominated without any practicing legal experience at all. \nYet this lack of practical experience didn't prevent either of these \njudges from becoming the most well respected and widely regarded in \ntheir circuits.\n  I would ask my colleagues to seriously consider looking instead at \nthe standard that was applied when a similarly controversial professor \ncame before this body. I was not here at the time, but I understand \nfrom the record that Democratic Senators approached the nomination of \nMichael McConnell, President George W. Bush's nominee to the Tenth \nCircuit, in a way that was generous and that accepted at face value \nsome of his assertions.\n  Like Professor Liu, Professor McConnell was a widely regarded law \nprofessor who was nominated to a Federal appeals court without having \nfirst served as a judge. Many Democratic Senators at the time had \nconcerns about Professor McConnell's conservative writings, which \nincluded strong opposition to Roe v. Wade, congressional testimony that \nthe Violence Against Women Act was unconstitutional, and harsh \ncriticism of the Supreme Court's 8-to-1 decision in the Bob Jones case. \nDespite these positions--which one could argue are at the outer edge, \neven the extreme of the legal canon at the time--Professor McConnell \nwas confirmed, not after a filibuster, not after a long series of \ngrinding nomination hearings and public discourse, but Professor \nMcConnell was confirmed by voice vote of this Chamber 1 day after his \nnomination was confirmed by the Judiciary Committee.\n  In supporting Professor McConnell's nomination, Democratic Senators \nat the time credited his assurances that he understood the difference \nbetween the role of law professor and judge and that he respected and \nwould follow precedent. In my view, the Senators of this body should \ncredit similar assurances that Professor Liu has provided during his \nconfirmation hearings and that Professor Liu has provided to me in an \nindividual interview in answer to hundreds of written questions from \nmembers of the committee as well as in answer to challenges presented \nhere.\n  Let me next turn to some challenges or concerns that have been raised \nabout Professor Liu's view on education. A bipartisan group of 22 \nleaders in education law, policy, and research have written to support \nProfessor Liu's nomination and to highlight his scholarship and \nreputation in the field of education law and policy. They wrote:\n\n       Based on his record, we believe Professor Liu is a careful, \n     balanced, and intellectually honest scholar with outstanding \n     academic qualifications and the proper temperament to be a \n     fair and disciplined judge.\n\n  Later, they wrote in this letter:\n\n       His work is nuanced and balanced, not dogmatic or \n     ideological.\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord the letter to which I just referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   March 23, 2010.\n     Re Federal Judicial Nomination of Goodwin H. Liu, U.S. Court \n         of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jeff Sessions,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Sessions: We are a \n     bipartisan group of 22 leaders in education law, policy, and \n     research who support the nomination of Professor Goodwin Liu \n     to be a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth \n     Circuit. Your\n\n[[Page S3131]]\n\n     committee will undoubtedly receive much commentary about \n     Professor Liu's scholarly work in constitutional law. We \n     write to highlight his scholarship and reputation in the \n     field of education law and policy. Collectively, we have read \n     his work in this area; we have seen him speak at many panels \n     and conferences; and some of us have worked closely with him \n     on research projects or on policy issues when he served in \n     the U.S. Department of Education. Based on his record, we \n     believe Professor Liu is a careful, balanced, and \n     intellectually honest scholar with outstanding academic \n     qualifications and the proper temperament to be a fair and \n     disciplined judge.\n       Professor Liu is one of the nation's leading experts on \n     educational equity. His scholarly work on topics such as \n     school choice, school finance, desegregation, and affirmative \n     action is unified by a deep and abiding concern for the needs \n     of America's most disadvantaged students. In analyzing \n     problems and proposing solutions, Professor Liu's writings \n     are thorough, pragmatic, and scrupulously attentive to facts \n     and evidence. His work is nuanced and balanced, not dogmatic \n     or ideological. For example:\n       He has argued for more resources for low-performing schools \n     while also advocating greater opportunities, including school \n     vouchers, to enable disadvantaged students to choose better \n     schools.\n       He has argued for greater equity in school finance while \n     also urging reforms that would loosen regulations and \n     increase local control over spending decisions.\n       He has praised the No Child Left Behind Act for focusing \n     education policy on achievement outcomes and inequities while \n     also urging reforms to ameliorate the Act's unintended \n     negative consequences.\n       He has argued that the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee of \n     national citizenship encompasses a duty to provide adequate \n     education while emphasizing that the responsibility for \n     enforcement belongs to Congress, not the judiciary.\n       He has written in support of affirmative action while also \n     emphasizing that affirmative action primarily benefits \n     middle- and high-income minorities and does not do enough to \n     promote socioeconomic diversity.\n       We do not necessarily agree with all of Professor Liu's \n     views. But we do agree that his record demonstrates the \n     habits of rigorous inquiry, open-mindedness, independence, \n     and intellectual honesty that we want and expect our judges \n     to have. His writings are meticulously researched and \n     carefully argued, and they reflect a willingness to consider \n     ideas on their substantive merits no matter where they lie on \n     the political spectrum. Moreover, we are confident in \n     Professor Liu's ability to decide cases based on the facts \n     and the law, regardless of his policy views. His scholarship \n     amply demonstrates that kind of intellectual discipline, and \n     our high regard for his work is widely shared. Indeed, the \n     Education Law Association selected Professor Liu in 2007 to \n     be the first-ever recipient of the Steven S. Goldberg Award \n     for Distinguished Scholarship in Education Law.\n       In short, Professor Liu is exceptionally qualified to serve \n     on the federal bench. He would make an outstanding judge, and \n     we urge his speedy confirmation.\n           Sincerely,\n       Cynthia G.

Madam President, during his confirmation hearings, \nProfessor Liu said this, in testifying before the Judiciary Committee:\n\n       I absolutely do not support racial quotas, and my writings, \n     I think, have made very clear that I believe they are \n     unconstitutional.\n\n  Professor Liu also stated to the committee:\n\n       I think affirmative action, as it was originally conceived, \n     was a time-limited remedy for past wrongs, and I think that \n     is the appropriate way to understand what affirmative action \n     is.\n\n  These two statements, which reflect Professor Liu's testimony to the \ncommittee, are well within the mainstream.\n  Professor Liu has written and spoken about his support for diversity \nin public schools and, in my view, there is nothing extreme in this \nview. Ever since Brown v. Board of Education was decided by a unanimous \nSupreme Court in 1954, the Supreme Court of the United States has \nrecognized the legitimacy of State action to desegregate schools.\n  In fact, the Supreme Court upheld the use of race as one factor in \nadmissions decisions in the 2003 case of Grutter v. Bollinger. Although \nsome on the far right of the Supreme Court have argued that both Brown \nand Grutter should be disregarded to the extent they recognize the \npermissibility of efforts to achieve diversity in public institutions, \nit is, I would argue, those Justices who are out of step with the \nmainstream of Federal jurisprudence and of the constitutional tradition \nof this country.\n  Even in its most recent case on point, the 2007 decision in Parents \nInvolved v. Seattle School District, which struck down a specific \ndesegregation program, five of the nine Justices who made up the \nmajority agreed with Liu that achieving diversity remains a compelling \ngovernmental interest.\n  The notion that somehow Professor Liu is an idealog on these issues \nis belied by his actual record. As a scholar, Professor Liu has \nsupported market-based reforms to promote schoolhouse diversity--\nreforms that are often labeled conservative. Professor Liu believes, \nand has written in support of, school choice and school vouchers, \nstating they have a role to play in improving educational opportunities \nfor disadvantaged children. He has publicly advocated for these \nprograms on a nationwide scale, earning praise from conservatives in \nthe process.\n  Clint Bolick, director of the conservative Goldwater Institute--\nreferred to previously by my colleague, Senator Boxer--has written:\n\n       I have known Professor Liu . . . since reading an \n     influential law review article he coauthored . . . supporting \n     school choice as a solution to the crisis of inner-city \n     public education. It took a great deal of courage for [him] \n     to take such a strong public position . . . I find Professor \n     Liu to exhibit fresh, independent thinking and intellectual \n     honesty.\n\n  He closes his letter by saying:\n\n       He clearly possesses the scholarly credentials and \n     experience to serve with distinction on this important court.\n\n  Professor Liu has, in my view, made very clear that he understands \nthe difference between being a law professor, a scholar and advocate, \nand a judge. He has assured us during his nomination hearings before \nthe committee and again in personal conversations with me he would \nfollow the court's precedent if confirmed. During his confirmation \nhearings Professor Liu testified to our committee:\n\n\n[[Page S3132]]\n\n\n       [I]f I were fortunate enough to be confirmed in this \n     process, it would not be my role to bring any particular \n     theory of constitutional interpretation to the job of an \n     intermediate appellate judge. The duty of a circuit judge is \n     to faithfully follow the Supreme Court's instructions on \n     matters of constitutional interpretation, not any particular \n     theory. And so that is exactly what I would do, I would apply \n     the applicable precedents to the facts of each case.\n\n  As I said before, and I will say again, I believe this quote from \nProfessor Liu deserves exactly the same weight and deference and \nconfidence as similar assertions by then-Professor McConnell, now \nCircuit Court Judge McConnell, when he was confirmed by voice vote in \nthis Chamber. To speak otherwise is to do violence to the tradition of \ndeference to those who give sworn testimony, to hearings, and to the \ndeliberations of this body.\n  Last, let me turn to some points that were raised recently about \nwhether Professor Liu believes Americans have a constitutional right to \nwelfare benefits, such as education, shelter, or health care; and, if \nconfirmed, would somehow declare those constitutional rights from the \nbench.\n  Professor Liu has authored, as I have said, many different Law Review \narticles, and in one, the 2008 Stanford Review Article, entitled, \n``Rethinking Constitutional Welfare Rights,'' he, in fact, criticized \nanother scholar's assertion from a 1969 article that courts should \nrecognize constitutional welfare rights on the basis of a so-called \n``comprehensive moral theory.'' Professor Liu rejected that.\n  In 2006, he penned a Yale Law Review article that argued the 14th \namendment authorizes and obligates Congress to ensure a meaningful \nfloor of educational opportunity.\n  His record is replete with sources that make it clear Professor Liu \nrespects and recognizes the role of this body--of Congress--and the \nrole of the Supreme Court in establishing, interpreting, and applying \nboth precedent and constitutional theory, and that he accepts, \nacknowledges, and will respect the very real limits on a circuit court \njudge in innovating in any way.\n  Madam President, in closing, allow me to simply share with you and \nthe Members of this body that--new to this body, new to the fights that \nhave divided this Chamber and have deflected real deliberation on \nnominees to circuit courts and the Supreme Court--I have taken the time \nto review his writings, to interview him individually, to attend the \nnomination hearing, and have come to the conclusion that candidate, \nnominee Professor Goodwin Liu is a qualified, capable, competent, in \nfact, exceptional legal scholar, who understands and will respect the \ndifferences between advocacy and scholarship and serving as a member of \nthe circuit court in the Judiciary of the United States.\n  I urge the Members of this body, I urge my colleagues to take a fresh \nlook at the record and to allow this body to vote. Why on Earth this \nrecord of this exceptionally qualified man would justify a filibuster \nis utterly beyond me and suggests that, unfortunately, we have become \nmired in partisanship rather than allowing debate and votes on this \nfloor, which, in my view, if we followed the best traditions of this \nbody, would lead to the confirmation of Goodwin Liu to the Ninth \nCircuit.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I would tell my colleague from Delaware \nthat he makes some very excellent points and they were very well \nstated.\n  I have spent a number of years--now almost 7--on the Judiciary \nCommittee, and my observations make me painfully aware of our process. \nGoodwin Liu is a stellar individual. There is no question about it. He \nis a stellar scholar. There is no question about it. But my \nobservations have taught me, as we have voted and put judges on the \nappellate court and on the highest Court, that what is said in \ntestimony before the committee doesn't bear out or have any impact on \nwhat happens once somebody becomes a judge. My observation is that \npeople are who they are.\n  I actually spent a significant time with Goodwin Liu. I think he is a \ngenuine great American. The question, however, is not whether he is a \nstellar scholar, of stellar intellect, or whether he is a great \nAmerican. The question is: Do his beliefs match what the Constitution \nrequires of appellate judges and higher judges. And I have come to the \nconclusion that being stellar and being a great teacher and professor, \nbeing a wonderful judge, is not enough. I take the words to heart, that \nmy colleague said, because we all make mistakes. His comments on Judge \nAlito and Judge Roberts, he said, were poor judgment; he should not \nhave done it. There is not anybody in this body who has not done the \nsame thing, so we cannot hold that against him, and I do not.\n\n  But what I do think matters is whether the oath to the Constitution \nand our laws and our treaties and the foundational documents of our \nConstitution do matter. I believe that where we find ourselves today as \na country--not having the debates on the Senate floor as we should be \nhaving the debates on the Senate floor--is partially to blame because \nof where the judges have put us. They have not been loyal to the \ndocument. They expanded the commerce clause well beyond its ever-\nanywhere-close intent. The general welfare clause, that now finds us at \na time when we are nearing bankruptcy, and we cannot get out of our \nproblems without retracting tremendously the size and scope of the \nFederal Government. We cannot grow our economy with the tax revenue \nincreases that are going to be required to get out of this problem. It \ncomes back down to what do they believe about the Constitution.\n  The best way to find that out is, before they ever thought about \nbeing nominated and before they are trying to be controversial in a \nteaching environment, what are their great thoughts and what are their \nbeliefs. I do not believe professors write articles to be \ncontroversial. I believe they write articles based on what their \nlearned research tells them. I just have a frank disagreement with \nProfessor Liu on the role of a Federal judge.\n  I actually believe what the Constitution says. It says:\n\n       The judicial Power should extend to all Cases, in Law and \n     Equity, arising under this--\n\n  And the word is ``this''--\n\n       Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and the \n     Treaties made, or which shall be made. . . .\n\n  The problems I have with Professor Liu are that I believe he \nadvocates for an unconstitutional role for judges. He believes the \nConstitution is a living document, that it is indeterminate.\n  I recognize I am just a doctor from Oklahoma and I don't have a law \ndegree, but I can read these words as plain as anybody else. I don't \nthink they are indeterminate. I think some of the things our Founders \ndid were wrong, and we have corrected them through the years, through \nwise Supreme Court decisions, but also through amendments to the \nConstitution.\n  He also believes the Constitution should be subject to ``socially \nsituated modes of reasoning that appeal culturally and historically to \ncontingent meanings.'' What that says to me is what this says is wide \nopen.\n  I really like the guy. I got along fabulously with him. He is a \nwonderful individual. But I don't think he is who we want on the \nappellate court. I think what potential judges say and write, when we \ntake the totality of what they say and write--not what they say at a \nhearing because it all changes once they are nominated--what they say \nand write is very important about what kind of judge they are going to \nbecome.\n  You heard Senator Cornyn relate about Justice Sotomayor, based on \n``here is her testimony,'' and in the first case what she does is \nexactly opposite of what her testimony does but is totally consistent \nwith what her beliefs were and her writings in previous cases. It used \nto be the Judiciary Committee didn't bring the judges before them. We \nlooked at the history.\n  Let me address something else. What the ABA says doesn't matter to me \nanymore because there was a controversial nominee from Oklahoma the ABA \nrated ``qualified,'' when four distinct people interviewed by the ABA \nsaid the individual wasn't qualified, and that was totally discounted \nby the ABA. The people who were actually interviewed said the person \nwas not qualified. The ABA gave them a ``qualified'' rating anyway. \nThese are their peers. That basis for saying we have qualifications is \nno longer trustworthy\n\n[[Page S3133]]\n\nin my mind and hasn't been for some time. I think the due diligence is \nlacking in the ABA and their method for scoring who is qualified or who \nis not.\n  The final point I would make is, although he has written a lot, and a \nlot of it has been controversial, one of the things that really bothers \nme is his profound belief that he has the right to use foreign law to \ninterpret the U.S. Constitution. That is really code word for saying: \nIf I do not like what is written in this document, I will go find some \njurisprudence somewhere else and apply it to this document that gets me \nthe result I want, rather than being truthfully and honestly obedient \nto what this document says.\n  I know that sounds overly simple, but it is not. The fact that we are \nnot applying our Constitution and its meaning and what our Founders \nsaid about what it meant and we are ignoring it is one of the things \nthat has put us in the perilous state we are in today.\n  We are going to have a great test sometime in the next year on the \nmassive expansion of the commerce clause that was put in the law \nthrough the Affordable Care Act. I will predict in this body today, if \nthat is upheld, there will be no need for State and local governments \nanymore because there will be no limitation on what we as a Federal \nGovernment can do to limit the freedom and free exercise of the tenth \namendment to the States.\n  The idea that one can take what this Constitution very clearly says: \n``all cases in law or equity arising under this Constitution''--not \nforeign law, not foreign constitution, not foreign thought, but our \nlaw--it does not mean we cannot learn from other things, but we cannot \nuse foreign law to interpret our Constitution. It is a violation of a \njudicial oath every time one of our Supreme Court Justices references \ntheir opinion based on foreign law. It is a violation of their oath \nbecause their oath is to this Constitution, not some other \nconstitution. So we see that occasionally, especially in minority \nopinions, and oftentimes in previous majority opinions, that have \ngotten our country into the problem we are in.\n  I believe Goodwin Liu a generally wonderful man. He is a stellar \nintellectual thinker. By reports he is an outstanding professor and is \na great human being. That does not qualify him to be on the Ninth \nCircuit Court of Appeals. What will qualify him is absolute fidelity to \nour Constitution and our future and not the creative ways that we can \nchange that through our own wills or whims of judges to get a result \nthat is different than what our Constitution would say that we should \nhave.\n  So I, regretfully--and it is truly with regret--will be voting \nagainst cloture for his nomination because I do not like this process. \nI think it hurts us. I think it divides our body. My hope is we can \nhandle these in the future much better than we have handled them in the \npast.\n  I see the assistant majority leader on the Senate floor, and I will \nyield to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, at 2 o'clock we will have a vote on the \nSenate floor. A man is seeking a judgeship. There is no question in \nanybody's mind that this is a judgeship that should be filled. \nProfessor Goodwin Liu wants to serve in the U.S. Circuit Court of \nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit. He was nominated in February of 2010. \nHere we are in May of 2011. The significance of that delay is the fact \nthat this is a vacancy that causes a problem. The Administrative Office \nof the U.S. Courts--no political office but the court's office--\ndeclared a judicial emergency in this circuit and said they need this \nvacancy filled. So nobody questions that there is at least a sense of \nurgency in filling the seat.\n  So you ask yourself, if the President nominated someone back in \nFebruary of 2010, why in May of 2011 are we just getting around to it? \nI think that question needs to be directed to the other side of the \naisle. They have found reasons to delay this and to raise questions \nwhich have brought us to this moment.\n  So how about this professor? Is he qualified to serve at the second \nhighest level of courts in America on the Ninth Circuit? The American \nBar Association did not waste any time evaluating Professor Goodwin \nLiu. They awarded him their highest possible rating--``unanimously \nwell-qualified.'' If we look at his background, it is no surprise.\n  The son of immigrants, he attended Stanford University, where he \ngraduated Phi Beta Kappa. He won a Rhodes Scholarship, attended Yale \nLaw School, where he was editor of the Yale Law Review. He served as a \nlaw clerk to Judge Tatel of the DC Circuit and to Supreme Court Justice \nRuth Bader Ginsburg.\n  After finishing his second clerkship, the one at the Supreme Court, \nhe worked for years at the law firm of O'Melveny & Myers in Washington. \nThen he joined the faculty at the University of California-Berkeley Law \nSchool. He has won numerous awards for his teaching and academic \nscholarship, including the highest teaching award given at the Cal-\nBerkeley Law School.\n  What is the point of this debate? We know he is well qualified. We \nknow there is a judicial emergency that requires us to fill this seat--\nand we should have done it a long time ago. When we look at his resume, \nit would put every lawyer, including myself, to shame, when we consider \nall that he has done leading up to this moment in his career.\n  It turns out those who oppose him do not oppose his qualifications. \nThey think he has the wrong philosophy, the wrong values. They \ncriticize him for a handful of statements he made while he served as a \nprofessor. Isn't it interesting, the double standard that is being \napplied?\n  I was here in 2002 when a Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals nominee by \nthe name of Michael McConnell was up to be considered. He had been a \nlaw professor at the University of Utah and the University of Chicago. \nAt his nomination hearings, Senator Orrin Hatch, who strongly supported \nhis nomination, said:\n\n       I think we should praise and encourage the prolific \n     exchange of honest and principled scholarly writing, assuming \n     such scholars know the proper role of a judge to interpret \n     the law as written and to follow precedent.\n\n  What was Senator Hatch defending in Professor McConnell's background? \nIt was the fact that he had called Roe v. Wade, a landmark Supreme \nCourt decision, ``illegitimate.'' Professor McConnell had defended Bob \nJones University's racist policies on the grounds that they were \n``church teachings,'' even though the Supreme Court rejected his \nargument in an 8-to-1 decision, and he claimed the Violence Against \nWomen Act was unconstitutional.\n  That was fodder for a lot of questions that should have been asked \nand were asked. He had made some very extreme statements as a \nprofessor. But Professor McConnell assured the Senate that when he left \nthe classroom and entered the courtroom he would put his views aside \nand follow the law. The Senate did not stop him with a filibuster. The \nSenate took Professor McConnell at his word and gave him an up-or-down \nvote on the Senate floor, and he was confirmed. That is all we are \nasking for when it comes to Professor Liu. I point out that other well-\nrespected Federal judges have also served in academic roles before \ncoming to the bench.\n  Richard Posner of the Seventh Circuit in Chicago is a friend of mine. \nEvery once in a while we get together for an amazing lunch. He is such \na brilliant guy. We disagree on so many things, but I can't help but \nsit there in awe of this man's knowledge of the law and of the world \nand his prolific authorship of books on so many subjects.\n  I think most would agree he has taken some pretty controversial views \nhimself. In a 2005 debate on civil liberties with Geoffrey Stone, Judge \nPosner said:\n\n       Life without the self-incrimination clause, without the \n     Miranda warnings, without the Fourth Amendment's exclusionary \n     rule, with an unamended USA PATRIOT Act, with a depiction of \n     the Ten Commandments on the ceiling of the Supreme Court, \n     even life without Roe v. Wade would still, in my opinion \n     anyway, be eminently worth living.\n\n  Is there any fodder there for political commentators? He was a \nsitting judge when he said that. Some of my friends on the left would \nhave had a field day with that quote.\n  Some of my friends on the right might have disagreed strongly with \nJudge Posner when he wrote an article about the 2008 Supreme Court \ndecision in DC v. Heller, a case where the court\n\n[[Page S3134]]\n\nstated the Second Amendment right to bear arms confers an individual \nright. Judge Posner wrote that the Court's decision in Heller ``is \nquestionable in both method and result, and it is evidence that the \nSupreme Court, in deciding constitutional cases, exercises a \nfreewheeling discretion strongly flavored with ideology.''\n  I suspect there are a lot of Senators on the other side of the aisle \nwho disagree with that quote.\n  So let's get down to the bottom line. We recognize the value of \nacademic freedom and discourse. We understand a professor has a \ndifferent role in America than someone sitting on a bench judging a \ncase. We trust them. We give them basic credit for integrity when they \nsay they can separate the two lives. They understand the two \nresponsibilities.\n  Professor Liu is a man widely recognized for his integrity and \nindependence. That is why he has the support of prominent conservative \nlawyers. Kenneth Starr--no hero on the Democratic side of the aisle--\nhas said he would be a great judge. Bob Barr, former Republican \nCongressman, and Goldwater Institute Director Clint Bolick express \nsupport for Liu's nomination. In fact, Ken Starr and Yale law Professor \nAkhil Amar wrote:\n\n       [I]n our view, the traits that should weigh most heavily in \n     the evaluation of an extraordinarily qualified nominee such \n     as Goodwin are professional integrity and the ability to \n     discharge faithfully an abiding duty to follow the law. \n     Because Goodwin possesses these qualities to the highest \n     degree, we are confident he will serve on the Court of \n     Appeals not only fairly and competently, but with great \n     distinction. We support and urge his speedy confirmation.\n\n  Well, we are not going to grant their wishes with a speedy \nconfirmation; the question is whether 60 Senators will decide that \nProfessor Goodwin Liu is entitled to a vote--a vote--an up-or-down \nvote--in the Senate.\n  Professor Liu said at his confirmation hearing:\n\n       [T]he role of a judge is to be an impartial, objective, and \n     neutral arbiter of specific cases and controversies that come \n     before him or her, and the way that process works is through \n     absolute fidelity to the applicable precedents and the \n     language of the laws, statutes, or regulations that are at \n     issue in this case.\n\n  Professor Liu is committed to respect and follow the judicial role. I \nam confident he will fulfill that role with distinction.\n  This is a good man, a great lawyer, an extremely well-qualified \nnominee. His nomination has been languishing before this Senate since \nFebruary of last year. He has had to put his life on hold in many \nrespects waiting for the Senate to act.\n  We will have a cloture vote in about an hour. I think we know what is \ngoing on here. For many on the other side of the aisle, they are guided \nby advisers who tell them: Keep as many critical judicial posts open \nfor as long as possible. Help is on the way in the next election. We \ndon't want to allow this President to fill these vacancies, and \nparticularly when it comes to the circuit courts because of the \ntremendous responsibility and opportunity there is for important and \nhistoric decisions.\n  So Professor Liu has been caught in this maelstrom. He is now going \nto be subjected to this filibuster vote. I sincerely hope my colleagues \nwill be fair and honest in their vote. I hope they will look at the \nobvious record of this man to fill an important vacancy, a man found \nunanimously ``well qualified'' by the American Bar Association, a \nperson with a legal resume that is peerless, someone who has stated \npurely and unequivocally that he will follow the law. To dwell on \nstatements he has made as a professor is to do a great disservice to \nacademic freedom and to ignore the obvious. When Republican nominees \ncame before us, we have used our discretion to separate out their \nacademic lives with their promise that as judges they will look at the \nworld in a very sober, honest way.\n  I intend to vote in support of cloture and in support of this \nnomination. I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, several of my colleagues have expressed \nconcerns about the nomination of Goodwin Liu. I share many of those \nconcerns and do not wish to belabor points they have already made. I \nwill limit my comments today to two fundamental reasons why I find \nmyself unable to support the nomination of Professor Liu to serve as a \njudge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n  First, I am truly dismayed by the lack of judgment displayed in \nProfessor Liu's 2006 testimony regarding the confirmation of Samuel \nAlito as an Associate Justice for the U.S. Supreme Court. Throughout \nextensive written testimony and during an appearance before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, Professor Liu unfairly criticized then-Judge Alito \nand his long judicial record as, among other things, having ``shown a \nuniform pattern of excusing errors and eroding norms of basic \nfairness.'' In particular, the final paragraph of Professor Liu's \nwritten testimony which served as a summary of his entire analysis of \nJudge Alito was nothing short of an inflammatory attack. He wrote:\n\n       Judge Alito's record envisions an America where police may \n     shoot and kill an unarmed boy to stop him from running away \n     with a stolen purse; where federal agents may point guns at \n     ordinary citizens during a raid, even after no sign of \n     resistance; where the FBI may install a camera where you \n     sleep on the promise that they won't turn it on unless an \n     informant is in the room; where a black man may be sentenced \n     to death by an all-white jury for killing a white man. . . .\n\n  Professor Liu's unseemly attack on Justice Alito generated \nconsiderable attention at the time, as well as understandable concern \nabout Professor Liu's temperament, his judgment, and his basic ability \nto be fair.\n  So far as I know, it was only after he was nominated to be a judge on \nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit that Professor Liu \noffered any apology for his testimony about Justice Alito. A few weeks \nago, Professor Liu told members of the Judiciary Committee that he had \nlearned from the outrage his remarks caused ``that strong language like \nthat is really not helpful in the process.'' Professor Liu's \nobservation is certainly true, but it misses the central point. His \ncomments about Justice Alito were offensive not simply because they \nwere unhelpful in his confirmation process, but because they were \nmisleading and they were an unwarranted personal attack on a dedicated \njudge and public servant.\n  Professor Liu's treatment of Justice Alito and his last-minute and \nincomplete handling of the concerns raised by his remarks lead me to \nbelieve that he lacks the basic judgment and discretion necessary to be \nconfirmed to a life-tenured position in the judiciary.\n  The second reason I feel compelled to oppose this nomination has to \ndo with the integrity of our Nation's system of constitutional \ngovernment and the rule of law. In my careful and considered judgment, \nthe judicial philosophy espoused by Professor Liu is fundamentally \ninconsistent with the judicial mandate to be a neutral arbiter of the \nConstitution and to uphold the rule of law.\n  I do not base this conclusion on the fact that his approach to the \nlaw is in many respects different from my own. That is not a \nprerequisite and that is not the basis of my opposition to this \nnominee. Most of the judges nominated by President Obama do not share \nmy personal textualist and originalist commitments. Yet in my short \ntime as a Member of the Senate, I have voted to confirm many nominees \nwith whom I fundamentally disagree.\n  Professor Liu, by contrast, is not simply a progressive nominee with \na somewhat more expansive view of constitutional interpretation than is \ncommon among many sitting judges, nor is he a nominee whose \ncontroversial remarks are few and can be overlooked given a long \nhistory of mainstream legal practice and observations.\n  Throughout the course of his numerous speeches, articles, and books, \nProfessor Liu has championed a philosophy that in my judgment is \nincompatible with faithfully discharging the duties of a Federal \nappellate judge in our constitutional Republic. His approach advocates \nthat judges go far beyond the written Constitution, statutes, and \ndecisional law to ascertain and incorporate into constitutional law--in \nProfessor Liu's own words--``shared understandings,'' ``evolving \nunderstandings,'' ``social movements,'' and ``collective values.''\n  In a 2008 Stanford Law Review article describing the judicial role, \nProfessor Liu wrote:\n\n\n[[Page S3135]]\n\n\n       [T]he problem for courts is to determine, at the moment of \n     whether our collective values on a given issue have converged \n     to a degree that they can be persuasively crystallized and \n     credibly absorbed into legal doctrine.\n\n  In so framing the process of judicial decisionmaking, he advocated a \nconception of a judiciary as a ``culturally situated interpreter of \nsocial meaning.''\n  In a 2009 book entitled ``Keeping Faith with the Constitution,'' he \nwrote that constitutional interpretation rightly ``incorporates the \nevolving understandings of the Constitution forged through social \nmovements, legislation, and historical practice.''\n  In an interview later that year, Professor Liu suggested that the \njudicial role is an individual process that includes ``lessons learned \nfrom experience, and an awareness of the evolving norms and social \nunderstandings of our country.''\n  These are just a few examples of a clear, consistent, and extreme \napproach to judging that Professor Liu has championed in many settings \nover the course of many years. His approach necessarily requires a \njudge to violate separation of powers principles, making law based on \nthe judge's subjective understanding of public opinion, communal \nvalues, historical trends, or personal preferences, rather than \nfaithfully interpreting and applying the laws made by the legislative \nand executive branches.\n  A noted judge who has faithfully served in the role to which \nProfessor Liu has been nominated, and who as a result was intimately \nfamiliar with the very real dangers of legislating from the bench, \nshared this vital insight:\n\n       It is absolutely important to freedom to confine the \n     judiciary's power to its proper scope as it is to confine \n     that of the President, Congress, or state and local \n     governments. Indeed, it is probably more important, for only \n     courts may not be called to account by the public.\n\n  I rise today in defense of our Nation's constitutional separation of \npowers and, ultimately, in defense of the essential liberty that it \nprotects.\n  I also feel the need to respond to the point made by my distinguished \ncolleague, the Senator from Illinois, moments ago. This is not an \nopposition that is based on a disagreement with a particular set of \nlegal analyses. My colleague from Illinois noted there was some \nopposition to Judge McConnell who was confirmed by this body to serve \non the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, notwithstanding the \nfact that many in this body disagreed with particular legal conclusions \nthat had been reached by then-Professor McConnell. This is different \nthan that. This is not about a disagreement with a particular legal \nconclusion. It is instead about a concern arising out of a systemic, \nbroad-based interpretive approach, one I believe doesn't give due \nregard to the rule of law, to the notion that we are a nation that \nlives under the law, that our laws consist of words, that words have \ndefined, finite meaning, and that in order for our laws to work \nproperly, that meaning needs to be respected and it needs to be \ninterpreted in and of itself and held as an independent good by the \njudiciary on a consistent basis.\n  Professor Liu's appalling treatment of Justice Alito leaves grave \ndoubt in my mind as to whether he possesses the requisite judgment to \nserve as a life-tenured judge. I have come to the conclusion that \nProfessor Liu's extreme judicial philosophy is simply incompatible with \nthe proper role of a judge in our constitutional Republic.\n  For these reasons, as well as those articulated by many of my \ncolleagues, I am compelled to oppose this nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I thank the Chair.\n  I rise to support the nomination of Goodwin Liu to be a member of the \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. I believe Mr. Liu's \nacademic qualifications, strong intellect, his character, and his \ntemperament make him a person who would be a valuable addition to the \nFederal bench. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture and \nthen in favor of his confirmation.\n  Mr. Liu brings an outstanding academic and professional background to \nthis nomination and a personal life story that is quintessentially \nAmerican. It is not a reason in itself, certainly, to vote to confirm \nhim as a judge of this high court, but it speaks to the endless \nopportunities for upward mobility in this country for people who work \nhard. Where you end up is not determined by where you start out in this \ncountry.\n\n  Goodwin Liu is the second son of Taiwanese immigrants. As a young \nboy, his family settled in Sacramento. He began to work hard from the \nbeginning, ultimately graduating from Stanford University. He received \na Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford University and eventually graduated from \nYale Law School.\n  Should he be confirmed to the Ninth Circuit, Professor Liu would \nbecome the second Asian American currently serving on a Federal appeals \ncourt. He is now an associate dean and professor of law at the \nUniversity of California, Berkeley School of law. He is widely \nrecognized and respected broadly throughout academic and legal \ncommunities in the United States.\n  I note that prior to entering academia, he was an appellate litigator \nwith O'Melveny & Myers--a first-rate firm here in Washington--and \nclerked for both Circuit Court Judge David Tatel and Supreme Court \nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, representing different points on the \nideological legal spectrum, and served them both, I know, with great \ndistinction.\n  Although I do not agree with everything Goodwin Liu has ever written \nor said, his views, it seems to me, have been well expressed and well \nreasoned and quite intelligent. I think he has a thoughtful approach to \ncomplex legal questions, and I am impressed he has earned the respect \nand support of thinkers and lawyers from all sides of the legal \nideological spectrum, which I think speaks, ultimately, to his personal \nevenhandedness, to the power of his intellect, and what we can expect \nof him as a judge of the circuit court.\n  I was particularly impressed--and I know it has been quoted before, \nbut it speaks volumes--by the comments of former Judge Ken Starr, a \nformer dean also, who said Goodwin Liu is ``a person of great \nintellect, accomplishment, and integrity, and he is exceptionally well-\nqualified to serve on the court of appeals.''\n  I know many of my colleagues have concerns about this nomination, \nabout things Professor Liu has either written or said, and I understand \nthose. I have some of those concerns. I read the statement he made \nabout Judge Alito. It has the ring of a passionate litigator making an \nargument with probably more zeal than he himself appreciates as he \nlooked at it in the aftermath.\n  But for those who have concerns, I urge my colleagues to vote \naccordingly on an up-or-down vote, not to sustain this filibuster and, \ntherefore, prevent an up-or-down vote on this nomination.\n  I have always felt that in our advice and consent role--this is my \nown personal reading of it--the President, by his election, earns the \nright to make these nominations. We do not have to decide, in \nconfirming a nominee, that we would have made this nomination, only \nthat the nominee is acceptable, is within the range of those acceptable \nand capable of doing the job for which he is nominated.\n  Not so long ago, in 2005, there was a move to reduce the right to \nfilibuster and require 60 votes, particularly with regard to Supreme \nCourt nominees but others as well. That led to the formation of the so-\ncalled Gang of 14. I was proud to be a member of that group, and we \nreached an agreement, one of whose I wish to read now on ``Future \nNominations.'' This is one of them: Goodwin Liu.\n\n       Signatories will exercise their responsibilities under the \n     Advice and Consent Clause of the United States Constitution \n     in good faith. Nominees should only be filibustered under \n     extraordinary circumstances, and each signatory must use his \n     or her own discretion and judgment in determining whether \n     such circumstances exist.\n\n  End of quote from the agreement of the Gang of 14.\n  I do not think these are extraordinary circumstances, when you \nconsider Goodwin Liu's intellect, his varied background, the character \nhe has, and this broad range of endorsements from people. To me, a \ndisagreement about a statement made in the heat of an argument or even \nthe substance of an article published is not strong enough to prevent \nthis nominee from\n\n[[Page S3136]]\n\nhaving what I think is his right and the President's right to get a \nvote up or down--not to block him by requiring 60 votes.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture. I am going to do so with \na full measure of comfort and confidence about the kind of judge \nGoodwin Liu would be but with a full measure of comfort that I am \nexercising my responsibility under the advice and consent clause, as I \nhave always seen it, including as it has been informed by my proud \nparticipation in the memorandum of understanding of the Gang of 14 in \n2005.\n  I thank you very much and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I rise in regretful opposition, quite \nfrankly, to having to vote to deny cloture for a judicial nominee. I \nalso was in the Gang of 14, and the whole effort was to make sure the \nSenate follows constitutional and historical norms; that is, giving \ngreat deference to Presidential elections when it comes to the \njudiciary.\n  So to my conservative colleagues, the best way to make sure you have \nconservative judges is to win elections. Because if we start blocking \nall the judges whom we do not like, who have a different view of the \nlaw than we, our friends on the other side will return the favor and \nyou wind up having a chaotic situation.\n  There is a reason Justice Ginsburg got 90-something votes and Justice \nScalia got 90-something votes. It used to be the way you did business \naround here. When a President won an election, they were able to pick \nqualified nominees for the court. Unless you had a darn good reason, \nthey went forward. I think that should be the standard.\n  To me, I do give a lot of deference. It is not one speech. It is not \nan article. Justice Sotomayor, whom I voted for, had made a famous \nspeech that she thought the experiences of a Latino woman maybe were \nmore valuable to the court than that of a White male, and people got up \nin arms about that. It bothered me. She explained herself. I look at \nthe way she lived her life, and I understood, based on the way she \nlived her life, that she was a fair person who did not represent \nbigotry on her part toward White males.\n  We all make statements and write articles and get in debates and I am \nnot going to use that as a reason to disqualify somebody from sitting \non the judiciary. I would not want that done to our nominees, and I do \nnot intend to do it to the other side.\n  But here is what Mr. Liu did that, to me, is a bridge too far. When a \nconservative wins the White House, you expect people such as Chief \nJustice Roberts and Justices Alito and Scalia. When a liberal wins, you \nexpect people such as Justices Ginsburg and Elena Kagan and Sotomayor. \nThat is the way it works. All of them are well qualified; they just \nhave a different approach to the law. But there are a lot of 9-to-0 \ndecisions.\n  The one thing that drives my thinking is, Mr. Liu chose--not in an \narticle he wrote as a young man, not in some debate that got carried \naway but to appear before the Judiciary Committee and basically say \nJudge Alito's philosophy would create:\n\n     . . . an America where police may shoot and kill an unarmed \n     boy to stop him from running away with a stolen purse--\n\n  That line probably comes from some case Judge Alito was involved in--\n\n     where federal agents may point guns at ordinary citizens \n     during a raid, even after no sign of resistance; where the \n     FBI may install a camera where you sleep on the promise that \n     they won't turn it on unless an informant is in the room; \n     where a black man may be sentenced to death by an all-white \n     jury for killing a white man, absent a multiple regression \n     analysis showing discrimination. . . .\n\n  These statements about Judge Alito and the decisions he has rendered \nand his philosophy are designed to basically say that people who have \nthe philosophy of Judge Alito are uncaring, hateful, and should be \ndespised. That is a bridge too far. Because I share Judge Alito's \nphilosophy, we may come out at a different result on a particular case, \nbut I do not think I fall in the category of being hateful, uncaring, \nand someone you should despise.\n\n  These statements given to the Judiciary Committee were designed to \ninflame passion against Judge Alito based on his analysis of cases \nbefore him during his judicial tenure.\n  If that is not enough, Chief Justice Roberts' record, according to \nMr. Liu, suggests he has a vision for American law--a ``right-wing \nvision antagonistic to important rights and protections we currently \nenjoy.''\n  It is one thing to debate your opponent. It is another thing to have \nstrong opinions. But this is not an accidental statement. This was \ncalculated, delivered at a time where it would do maximum damage.\n  All I am saying to future nominees: I expect President Obama to \nnominate people of a liberal judicial philosophy. I do not deny you \naccess to the court because you may have said something in an article I \ndo not like, you may have represented a client with whom I disagree. \nBut the one thing I will not tolerate is for a conservative or a \nliberal person seeking a judgeship to basically impugn the character of \nthe other way of thinking.\n  These words are not that of a passionate advocate who may have went \ntoo far, according to Senator Lieberman, in my view. These words were \ndesigned to destroy, and they ring of an ideologue. He should be \nrunning for office, not sitting on the court. There is a place for \npeople who think this way about conservative judicial philosophy: Run \nfor President. Run for the Senate. Do not sit on the court. Because the \ncourt has to be a place where you accept differences, you hash it out, \nyou render verdicts. Based on the way he views Justice Alito and Chief \nJustice Roberts and his disdain for their philosophy, I do not believe \nhe could give someone such as me a fair shake.\n  So at the end of the day, I ask one thing of my Democratic \ncolleagues. I will try my best to make sure the Senate stays on track \nand that we do not get on the road of filibustering judges haphazardly \nbased on the fact they are somebody we do not agree with. I have tried \nmy best not to go down that road because I think it will destroy the \njudiciary and disrupt the Senate.\n  If you are a conservative in the future wanting to be a judge and you \ncome before our committee, when a liberal nominee is before the \ncommittee, and you question their patriotism and you suggest they are \nhateful people who should be despised for their philosophy, then I will \nrender the same verdict against you.\n  We want people on the court who are well rounded, who are qualified, \nwho understand America is a big place, not a small place. In Mr. Liu's \nworld I think he has a very small view of the law. Those on the other \nside who think differently should be engaged intellectually or \nchallenged through academic debate. He has tried to basically rip their \ncharacter apart, and he will not get my vote. A conservative who feels \nthe same way about liberal philosophy would not get my vote either.\n  I am looking for the model of Miguel Estrada, who was poorly treated, \nwho wrote a letter on behalf of Elena Kagan, saying: She was my law \nschool classmate. We don't agree on much when it comes to the law, but \nshe is a wonderful person, well qualified, and deserves to be on the \nbench.\n  That is the way conservatives and liberals should engage each other, \nin my view, when it comes to the judicial nomination process.\n  This was a bridge too far for Lindsey Graham.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, as a member of the Gang of 14 in 2005, I \nagreed that ``Nominees should be filibustered only under extraordinary \ncircumstances.'' The nomination of Mr. Liu rises to a level of \n``extraordinary circumstances'' due to his clear belief that judges \nhave vast powers to shape and even rewrite the law--a contention I \ndeeply oppose as an elected representative of the people who believes \nit is the duty of the Congress to shape and write the laws and not that \nof the judiciary.\n  With no litigation or judicial experience to examine, the Senate can \nonly consider Mr. Liu's academic writings and public comments. These \nwritings and his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee show \nMr. Liu believes that the Constitution is a living, breathing document \nthat must change to accommodate new progressive ideas. Specifically, \nMr. Liu has said, ``The Framers deliberately chose broad words so they \nwould be adaptable over time.''\n\n[[Page S3137]]\n\n  Additionally, in a November 2008 article published in the Stanford \nLaw Review, Mr. Liu wrote,\n\n       The problem for courts is to determine, at the moment of \n     decision, whether our collective values on a given issue have \n     converged to a degree that they can be persuasively \n     crystallized and credibly absorbed into legal doctrine. This \n     difficult task requires keen attention to the trajectory of \n     social norms reflected in public policies, institutions, and \n     practices, as well as predictive judgment as to how a \n     judicial decision may help forge or frustrate a social \n     consensus.\n\n  Mr. Liu's remarks show that he does not subscribe to the philosophy \nthat Federal judges should respect the limited nature of judicial power \nunder our Constitution. Judges who stray beyond their constitutional \nrole believe that judges somehow have a greater insight into the \nmeaning of the broad principles of our Constitution than \nrepresentatives who are elected by the people. These activist judges \nassume that the judiciary is a superlegislature of moral philosophers.\n  Despite this difference in judicial philosophy, I believe Mr. Liu has \nhad a remarkable career in academics and has an inspiring life story as \nthe child of immigrants from Taiwan. However, an excellent resume and \nan inspiring life story are not enough to qualify one for a lifetime of \nservice on the Federal bench. Those who suggest otherwise need only to \nbe reminded of Miguel Estrada who was filibustered by the Democrats \nseven times because many Democrats disagreed with Mr. Estrada's \njudicial philosophy. This was the first filibuster ever to be \nsuccessfully used against a court of appeals nominee.\n  I supported Mr. Estrada's nomination to the DC Circuit Court of \nAppeals, not because of his inspiring life story or impeccable \nqualifications, but because his judicial philosophy was one of \nrestraint. He was explicit in his writings and responses to the Senate \nJudiciary Committee that he would not seek to legislate from the bench.\n  Judicial activism demonstrates a lack of respect for the popular will \nthat is at fundamental odds with our republican system of government. \nAnd, as I stated earlier, regardless of one's success in academics and \nin government service, an individual who does not appreciate the \ncommonsense limitations on judicial power in our democratic system of \ngovernment ultimately lacks a key qualification for a lifetime \nappointment to the Federal bench. For this reason, and no other, I am \nunable to support Mr. Liu's nomination.\n  Shaping the judiciary through the appointment power is one of the \nmost important and solemn responsibilities a President has and \ncertainly one that has a profound and lasting impact. The President is \nentitled to nominate those whom he sees fit to serve on the Federal \nbench, and unless the nominee rises to ``extraordinary circumstances,'' \nI have provided my constitutional duty of ``consent'' for most \nnominees.\n  I regret I am unable to do so for Mr. Liu, but I believe his \ninability to respect the limited nature of the judicial power under our \nConstitution should preclude him from a lifetime appointment to the \nNinth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I rise today to urge my colleagues \nto support Professor Goodwin Liu's nomination to the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n  Professor Liu is abundantly qualified to serve on the bench. He has a \nsharp legal mind, is a careful and rigorous thinker, and understands \nthe proper limited role of a judge. He has shown a commitment to public \nservice throughout his career and his remarkable success reflects well \non the great opportunities our country offers and the qualities of Mr. \nLiu and his family. If confirmed, he would be a credit to the Ninth \nCircuit and to his home State of California.\n  People who know Professor Liu, Republican and Democrat alike, think \nvery highly of him and have commended him for his intellect, integrity, \nand temperament.\n  Among many other Republicans and conservatives, Professor Liu can \ncount as supporters former Whitewater prosecutor Ken Starr, former \nRepublican Congressman Bob Barr, and Clint Bolick, the litigation \ndirector of the Goldwater Institute. Former Republican Congressman Tom \nCampbell has said that Liu ``will bring scholarly distinction and a \nstrong reputation for integrity, fair-mindedness, and collegiality to \nthe Ninth Circuit.'' Susan A. McCaw, who was an ambassador in George W. \nBush's administration wrote that ``Goodwin's strengths are exactly what \n[she] expect[s] in a judge: objectivity, independence, collegiality, \nrespect for differing views, [and] sound judgment,'' and noted that he \n``possesses these qualities on top of the brilliant legal acumen that \nis well-established by his record and the judgment of those most \nfamiliar with his scholarly work.''\n  Furthermore, Professor Liu has the support of leading law enforcement \ngroups and prosecutors, as well as business groups, and the \nendorsements of the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Los \nAngeles Times, the San Francisco Chronicle, and the Sacramento Bee. He \nhas also been deemed unanimously well qualified by the American Bar \nAssociation.\n  These recommendations are part of an ample record on which the Senate \ncan base its decision. Professor Liu's voluminous writings and \nunprecedented thoroughness in responding to questions from the \nJudiciary Committee give us great insight into his temperament and \napproach to the difficult questions of constitutional law.\n  This record reveals a genuine thoughtfulness and intellectual rigor. \nThis has made Professor Liu one of the leading legal academics of his \ngeneration. As Professor Liu himself has said, the scholar's role is \n``to question the boundaries of the law [and] to raise new theories.'' \nProfessor Liu also clearly understands that the scholar's role is \ndifferent from the role of a judge, explaining that it is the function \nof a scholar ``to be provocative in ways that it's simply not the role \nof a judge to be.'' He further elaborated that he would leave his \npersonal views behind if taking the bench: ``What is not transferable \n[from the position of scholar to the position of judge] . . . are the \nsubstantive views that one might take as a matter of legal theory. \nThose are left at the door. When one becomes a judge, one applies the \nlaw as it is to the facts of every case.''\n  I would remind my Republican colleagues that they have been ready in \nthe past to credit academics with the ability to put aside their \nscholarly views when they take the bench. True, this was for \nnominations made by a Republican President, but there is no reason why \nthe rules should be different for President Obama. Consider the \nnomination of Judge Michael McConnell, for example. He was confirmed to \nthe Tenth Circuit in 2002 by a unanimous vote on the Senate floor, \ndespite having, as a scholar, vigorously criticized Roe v. Wade as \n``illegitimate'' and wrongly decided, and having made sundry other \ncriticisms of Supreme Court precedent. The Senate took him at his word \nthat he would follow the law rather than his personal beliefs. A proper \nrecognition of Professor Liu's strong character, integrity, and \ncommitment to the rule of law should lead us to the same conclusion \ntoday.\n  In short, it is time to confirm this highly qualified nominee and I \nurge all my colleagues to support his nomination.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, it is with great reluctance that I vote \nagainst cloture on any nominee, including Professor Goodwin Liu. It is \nmy general view that every nominee deserves an up or down vote.\n  Ever since the tradition was established that filibusters would be \navoided, except in ``extraordinary'' circumstances, I have tried to \napply that standard in an objective way.\n  This is one such occasion when I cannot vote for cloture on the \nnominee. I believe extraordinary circumstances exist. I have serious \nconcerns as to whether Professor Liu could lay aside his ideas and \nideologies and approach cases from a purely objective, unbiased point \nof view. It is very clear he would violate one of the first principles \nof judicial character, which is to approach each case without \nprejudice.\n  I will highlight some specific examples to illustrate my concerns.\n  First, is Professor's Liu's views on the use of foreign law in U.S. \ncourts. He stated:\n\n       [T]he use of foreign authority in American constitutional \n     law is a judicial practice that has been very controversial \n     in recent years. . . . The resistance to this practice is \n     difficult for me to grasp, since the United\n\n[[Page S3138]]\n\n     States can hardly claim to have a monopoly on wise solutions \n     to common legal problems faced by constitutional democracies \n     around the world.\n\n  Of course, judges should never task themselves with finding ``wise \nsolutions'' from ``foreign authorities,'' instead of interpreting U.S. \nlaw. And Americans shouldn't have to walk into a courtroom not knowing \nunder which nation's law they will be judged!\n  Second, is Professor Liu's troubling view of constitutional ``welfare \nrights.'' Professor Liu wrote that courts should interpret ``welfare \nrights,'' such as education, shelter, subsistence, and health care (and \nthe funding for each) as constitutional rights.\n  Of course, no such welfare rights exist in our Constitution, and it \nis inappropriate for the courts to attempt to invent new rights or \nrevise the Constitution to advance an ideological or political \nposition.\n  Third, Professor Liu wrote that he believes the Constitution is a \n``living document,'' ``indeterminate,'' and subject to ``socially \nsituated modes of reasoning.'' Moreover, Professor Liu believes that \njudges should look to ``our collective values,'' ``evolving norms,'' \nand ``social understandings'' in interpreting the Constitution.\n  Again, the Constitution is not subject to new definitions and \ninterpretations. These views may be appropriate in the confines of \nliberal academia, but they have no place in a U.S. courtroom.\n  In addition to his controversial views on judging and the \nConstitution, I have an additional set of concerns, as well. Those \nconcerns relate to Professor Liu's charges against Supreme Court \nJustices Roberts and Alito. Before his own nomination to the bench, \nProfessor Liu led the opposition to their nominations to the High \nCourt. His descriptions of their qualifications show very poor \njudgment.\n  For instance, Professor Liu spoke very disparagingly of Justice \nRoberts stating:\n\n       [b]efore becoming a judge, he belonged to the Republican \n     National Lawyers Association and the National Legal Center \n     for the Public Interest, whose mission is to promote (among \n     other things) `free enterprise,' `private ownership of \n     property,' and `limited government.' These are code words for \n     an ideological agenda hostile to environmental, workplace, \n     and consumer protections.\n\n  Professor Liu also wrote that regardless of Chief Justice Roberts's \nqualifications, ``a Supreme Court nominee must be evaluated on more \nthan legal intellect.''\n  So, in other words, Professor Liu believes that a good judge must \npossess more than intellect and allegiance to the law.\n  Professor Liu also made some inappropriate comments when testifying \nagainst Justice Alito's nomination, stating:\n\n       Judge Alito's record envisions an America where police may \n     shoot and kill an unarmed boy to stop him from running away \n     with a stolen purse; where federal agents may point guns at \n     ordinary citizens during a raid, even after no sign of \n     resistance . . . where a black man may be sentenced to death \n     by an all-white jury for killing a white man . . . and where \n     police may search what a warrant permits, and then some.\n\n  He also criticized Justice Alito because ``[h]e approaches law in a \nformalistic, mechanical way abstracted from human experience.''\n  Again, these comments are inappropriate and demonstrate that \nProfessor Liu does not possess the requisite standards for impartial \njudging.\n  In conclusion, I do not vote against Professor Liu lightly. But the \nPresident has nominated someone who does not possess the requisite \nimpartiality for judging. I am firmly convinced that, rather than apply \nthe law, Professor Liu would apply his own preconceived notions and \nstandards to advance his liberal views. Therefore I oppose his \nnomination.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, today I rise to speak in support of \nGoodwin Liu to be a Federal judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nNinth Circuit.\n  I am confident that Professor Liu, as a nationally recognized expert \non constitutional law, is highly qualified for this prestigious \nposition. His understanding of the role of a circuit judge--to follow \nthe instructions and precedents set by the Supreme Court--will allow \nhim to remain a neutral mediator. This judicial philosophy will be the \nbasis for his restrained actions, and will be balanced by his \nexperiences as a professor and in the public and private sectors. \nProfessor Liu's background speaks volumes about his qualifications and \nhis strong work ethic.\n  Goodwin Liu, the son of immigrant parents from Taiwan, is a graduate \nof Stanford University. He was elected copresident of the student body \nand graduated Phi Beta Kappa. He was also awarded the Lloyd W. \nDinkelspiel Award, the university's highest honor for outstanding \nservice to undergraduate education.\n  After, Stanford, Goodwin Liu attended Oxford University on a Rhodes \nScholarship and earned a master's degree in philosophy and physiology. \nHe continued his education at Yale Law School, where he was an editor \nof the Yale Law Journal and won the prize for best team argument in the \nlaw school moot court competition. His academic accomplishments earned \nhim clerkships with Judge David S. Tatel on the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the DC Circuit and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the U.S. Supreme \nCourt.\n  Between these prestigious clerkships, Goodwin Liu served as a special \nassistant to the Deputy Secretary at the U.S. Department of Education. \nIn that capacity, he advised the Secretary and Deputy Secretary on a \nrange of legal and policy issues, including the development of \nguidelines to help turn around low-performing schools. He also spent 2 \nyears as a senior program officer for higher education at the \nCorporation for National Service, AmeriCorps, leading the agency's \neffort to build community service programs at colleges and universities \nnationwide.\n  Goodwin Liu also worked in the private sector for a prominent \nWashington law firm and maintained an active pro bono practice. In \n2003, he returned to California to join the faculty of Boalt Hall, one \nof the Nation's top law schools, where he established himself as an \noutstanding scholar and teacher. A few years later, Goodwin's work on \n``Education, Equality, and National Citizenship'' won him the \nEducational Law Association's Steven S. Goldberg Award for \nDistinguished Scholarship. He quickly earned tenure and was elected to \nthe American Law Institute. In 2009, after being promoted to associate \ndean, he received Berkeley's most prestigious teaching award, the UC \nBerkeley Distinguished Teaching Award for excellence in teaching.\n  Goodwin Liu is an exceptionally qualified nominee and a shining \nexample of the American dream. I have long been impressed by his \nacademic and career achievements, and after meeting with him yesterday \nI am thoroughly convinced that he will be an outstanding judge for the \nNinth Circuit, which encompasses Hawaii and includes over 40 percent of \nour Nation's Asian-American and Pacific Islander population. Goodwin \nLiu was given the American Bar Association's highest rating of \n``Unanimously Well Qualified'' based on his integrity, professional \ncompetence, and judicial temperament. He is highly qualified, \nintelligent, and he will help the court better reflect the broad \npopulation it serves.\n  He has strong support in the Senate and he deserves an up-or-down \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to inquire how much time we \nhave on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes forty-five seconds.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have a few closing remarks regarding \nthe nomination of Goodwin Liu. Yesterday, I outlined my objections to \nthis nominee in some detail. As I stated, my objections to this nominee \ncan be summarized with five areas of concern: his controversial \nwritings and speeches; an activist judicial philosophy; his lack of \njudicial temperament; his troublesome testimony and lack of candor \nbefore the committee, and his limited experience.\n  I hope the President will withdraw this nomination and send to the \nSenate a consensus nominee to fill this vacancy. We have demonstrated \nover and over again our cooperation in moving forward on consensus \nnominations. The President needs to nominate mainstream individuals, \nwho understand the proper role of a judge.\n  Nominees who would bring a personal agenda or political ideology to \nthe courtroom will have great difficulty in being confirmed.\n\n[[Page S3139]]\n\n  Yesterday, a few Senators met with Mr. Liu. After that meeting, one \nof my colleagues from the other side of the aisle made the following \nstatement, ``The court of appeals is where law is made, and we need the \nfinest minds in the world for that.'' I am troubled by that statement \non more than one level.\n  First, intellect is an important element I consider in the \nconfirmation process. Mr. Liu does have an outstanding academic record. \nHis intellect is not the issue. The nominee himself noted there was \nmore to being a judge than intellect. He stated, with regards to the \nnomination of Chief Justice Roberts, ``[t]here's no doubt Roberts has a \nbrilliant legal mind. . . . But a Supreme Court nominee must be \nevaluated on more than legal intellect.''\n  He then voiced concerns that ``with remarkable consistency throughout \nhis career, Roberts ha[d] applied his legal talent to further the cause \nof the far right.'' Mr. Liu went on, demonstrating a lack of judicial \ntemperament, to disparage Justice Robert's views on free enterprise, \nprivate property and limited government. In my statement yesterday I \nmade my views very clear on how I feel about Mr. Liu's remarks, so \nthere is no reason to repeat that.\n  The point is, intellect is only one component. Using Mr. Liu's \nstandards, a nominee ``must be evaluated on more than legal \nintellect.'' Mr. Liu does have a fine intellect, but he has used his \ntalent to consistently promote views that are far out of the \nmainstream. Shortly after President Obama was elected, he said, ``Now \nwe have the opportunity to actually get our ideas and the progressive \nvision of the Constitution and of law and policy into practice.'' I do \nnot intend to give Mr. Liu that opportunity.\n  The second problem I have with the statement is the assertion that \n``The court of appeals is where law is made.'' We have heard this view \nbefore. While serving as a circuit judge, Sonia Sotomayor stated that \nthe court of appeals ``is where policy is made.''\n  Now I understand there are elements of our society who wish this were \nthe case. Those who can not get their policy views enacted through the \nlegislative process, as our Constitution requires, often turn to the \ncourts. But I flatly reject this notion.\n  The Constitution vests the legislative power in the Congress, not the \ncourts. Judges are simply not policymakers. The court of appeals is not \nwhere law is made. The courts are vested with the judicial power. That \nmeans they are to decide cases and controversies. They are to apply the \nlaw, not make the law.\n  Unfortunately, this philosophical disagreement occasionally finds its \nway into the debates on nominations. But let me remind the Senate where \nthis started. Going back to the nomination of William Rehnquist in \n1971, Democrats have used or attempted to use the filibuster to delay \nor defeat judicial nominees. Fortunately, it is a rare occasion. There \nhave been a total of 46 cloture votes, including this one, on 32 \ndifferent judicial nominations in American history. Of the 32 judicial \nnominees subject to cloture votes, 22 were against Republican nominated \njudges. Between 1971 and 2000, there were 11 cloture votes on judicial \nnominees. Most of those filibusters, attempted by Democrats, were \nunsuccessful and cloture was invoked.\n  However, beginning in 2002, Senate Democrats changed the rules. There \nwere 30 cloture votes on 17 of President Bush's judicial nominees. \nEight of President Bush's nominees are not on the bench because of the \nfilibuster or threatened filibuster by Senate Democrats.\n  This does not include a number of Bush's nominees that were subjected \nto the so-called ``pocket filibuster'' in Committee by the Democratic \nmajority in the 110th Congress, including Peter Keisler to the DC \nCircuit and Robert Conrad to the 4th Circuit, among others.\n  We hear about the notion of ``extraordinary circumstances'' as a \njustification or requirement for extended debate. That was an outcome \nof an agreement in the 109th Congress. However, even after that time, \nSenate Democrats have used a broad and inconsistent application of that \nterm. Even after that agreement, Senate Democrats attempted to \nfilibuster judicial nominees. However, they do not seem to find it \napplicable to the nominee before us today. I disagree. The nomination \nof Goodwin Liu does raise extraordinary circumstances, as I outlined in \ndepth yesterday.\n  I have no personal animosity towards Mr. Liu. I recognize he has a \nfascinating personal story and has accomplished much. This debate is \nnot about his ethnic background or personal history.\n  I wish Mr. Liu well in his academic career. But a lifetime position \non the Federal bench is not where he belongs. Therefore, I will vote no \non the cloture motion and urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record documents in \nopposition to the nomination.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From nationalreview.com, Mar. 3, 2011]\n\n       Miguel Estrada on Goodwin Liu's Contemptible Mud-Flinging\n\n                             (By Ed Whelan)\n\n       More on Richard Painter's insipid argument (see point 2 \n     here) that Goodwin Liu's attacks on the nominations of Chief \n     Justice Roberts and Justice Alito shouldn't be held against \n     him:\n       Former D.C. Circuit nominee Miguel Estrada, whose \n     unsuccessful nomination Richard Painter despicably tried to \n     invoke in support of his shoddy Huffington Post defense of \n     Liu, strongly disagrees with Painter. In an e-mail to me, \n     Estrada writes (emphasis added):\n       No one doubts that Senators from both parties have behaved \n     shamefully toward nominees of the other party. The treatment \n     of then-Judge Alito by Democratic members of the Judiciary \n     Committee is not yet all that far in the rear-view mirror, \n     and some of President Obama's nominees have waited far too \n     long. There is much to be said, therefore, for the \n     proposition that the degradation of the judicial confirmation \n     process is a problem that cries out for a long-term solution. \n     The one thing that ought to be reasonably clear, however, is \n     that someone who personally contributed to the sorry state of \n     the confirmation process, by jumping in the mud pit with both \n     feet and flinging the mud with both hands, is not well \n     positioned to demand that standards be elevated solely for \n     his benefit. Surely Mr. Painter can find a better case than \n     this to dramatize the need for reform.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From nationalreview.com, Mar. 2, 2011]\n\n      Richard Painter's Deceptive Portrayal of Goodwin Liu--Part 1\n\n                             (By Ed Whelan)\n\n       On Huffington Post, law professor (and former Bush White \n     House ethics adviser) Richard Painter offers an extensive, \n     but badly flawed, defense of Goodwin Liu that falsely accuses \n     me of ``invent[ing] a series of myths about Liu with no basis \n     in reality.'' The opening part of Painter's essay consists of \n     regurgitating ill-informed or utterly conclusory endorsements \n     of Liu from various folks, including some conservative who \n     ought to know better. See, for example, my critique of the \n     letter that Ken Starr submitted (jointly with Akhil Amar).\n       Given that Liu's hearing starts soon, I'm going to race \n     through Painter's supposed myths in this post and the next \n     (in the same order as he lists them):\n       1. According to Painter, I have propagated the ``myth'' \n     that ``Liu believes judges `may legitimately invent \n     constitutional rights to a broad range of social ``welfare'' \n     goods, including education, shelter, subsistence, and health \n     care.' '' My actual quote states that Liu argues in a law-\n     review article that ``judges (usually in an `interstitial' \n     role) may legitimately invent constitutional rights to a \n     broad range of social `welfare' goods, including education, \n     shelter, subsistence, and health care.'' It's telling that \n     Painter has to excise the italicized parenthetical in order \n     to falsely accuse me of misstating Liu's views. Nor does he \n     address (much less take issue with) my detailed posts on the \n     matter.\n       2. According to Painter, it is a ``myth'' that Liu \n     ``believes in a `freewheeling constitutional approach' that \n     allows people `to redefine the Constitution to mean whatever \n     they want it to mean.' '' Painter cherry-picks the most \n     innocent-sounding of Liu's statements and ignores the \n     controversial ones. (See, for example, the material in this \n     post of mine.).\n       3. According to Painter, it is a ``myth'' that Liu ``is a \n     supporter of racial quotas in the schools, and he supports \n     school choice only insofar as it furthers that goal.'' That \n     is no myth, as I have documented. Painter doesn't even \n     address my arguments.\n       4. According to Painter, it is a myth that Liu ``supports \n     racial quotas forever.'' Painter doesn't address my argument, \n     and he hides behind a ridiculously narrow definition of \n     quotas.\n       5. According to Painter, it is a ``myth'' that Liu supports \n     ``reparations for slavery'' and a ``grandiose reparations \n     project.'' Painter pretends to provide a full account of \n     Liu's discussion of ``solutions for racial equality'' but \n     somehow completely omits the remarks of Liu's that I've \n     highlighted, including:\n       Then there's a further issue, which is that maybe there are \n     white families who were not\n\n[[Page S3140]]\n\n     involved as directly or even indirectly with the slave trade, \n     but who still benefited from it. And then there is the whole \n     question, which you put on the table, about people who came \n     to America after, and, you know, like my family. And why is \n     it that this movie speaks to me so deeply yet?\n       And so, what I would do, I think I would draw a distinction \n     between a concept of guilt, which locates accountability in a \n     sort of limited set of wrong-doers, and, on the other hand, a \n     concept of responsibility, which is, I think, a more broad \n     suggestion that all of us, whateverour lineage, whatever our \n     ancestry, whatever our complicity, still have a moral duty to \n     . . . make things right.

Because it's gonna require us to give \n     up something, whether it is the seat at Harvard, the seat at \n     Princeton.

Painter says it's a ``myth'' that Liu supports ``direct \n     judicial imposition of interdistrict racial-balancing \n     orders'' in public schools. Painter tries to give his readers \n     the impression that Liu accepts Milliken v. Bradley as \n     settled law. But he somehow doesn't disclose that Liu (in \n     remarks that he failed to disclose to the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee) called for Milliken to ``be swept into the dustbin \n     of history.''\n       7. Painter says it's a ``myth'' that Liu supports ``using \n     foreign law to redefine the Constitution.'' Painter relies \n     entirely on Liu's self-serving confirmation testimony and \n     clips a passage to omit the fact that Liu wrote in 2006 that \n     it ``is difficult for [him] to grasp'' how anyone could \n     resist the ``use of foreign authority in American \n     constitutional law.''\n       8. Painter says it's a ``myth'' that Liu supports ``the \n     invention of a federal constitutional right to same-sex \n     marriage.'' I addressed this matter in detail just yesterday \n     and fully stand by my account. (Painter falsely attributes to \n     me the claim that Liu's amicus brief in the California \n     supreme court was ``truly an argument under the U.S. \n     Constitution.'')\n       I'll briefly add some closing comments:\n       If Painter were really interested in a real debate on Liu, \n     he wouldn't have waited until the day of the hearing to \n     launch his shoddy attack on me. He could have done so at any \n     time over the last eight months. Instead, he's tried to gain \n     some tactical advantage by depriving me of a fair opportunity \n     to respond. (I've had to write these responsive posts within \n     the space of two hours or so of discovering Painter's essay, \n     and I'm sure that there's much that I would say better, or \n     more fully, if I had time.)\n       Painter claims to have ``reached the conclusion that Liu \n     deserves an up-or-down vote in the Senate and ought to be \n     confirmed'' only after ``reading Liu's writings [and] \n     watching his testimony?'' But the fact of the matter is that \n     Painter, evidently suffering a severe case of battered-\n     conservative-academic syndrome, raced onto the Liu bandwagon \n     without having any understanding of what was at issue, and \n     (both now and in a previous op-ed) he has resolutely ignored \n     or distorted the many highly problematic aspects of Liu's \n     record.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From nationalreview.com, Mar. 3, 2011]\n\n      Richard Painter's Deceptive Portrayal of Goodwin Liu--Part 3\n\n                             (By Ed Whelan)\n\n       I'll limit myself to a couple of additional observations \n     (beyond my Part I and Part 2 posts) on Richard. Painter's \n     deeply defective Huffington Post defense of Goodwin Liu:\n       1. In addition to failing to confront my actual arguments, \n     Painter relies heavily on the argument-by-authority fallacy. \n     As he puts it:\n       ``Now, you can believe the top experts in the areas of \n     Liu's scholarship and prominent conservatives such as Ken \n     Starr and Clint Bolick--or you can believe National Review \n     Online's Ed Whelan. I know where I would put my marbles.''\n       Set aside that Painter, having evidently lost his marbles, \n     would have to find them first before he could put them \n     anywhere. Painter leaves the false impression that folks like \n     Starr and Bolick have actually responded to my critiques of \n     Liu and of their misunderstandings of his record. So far as \n     I'm aware, they haven't.\n       (It's also amusing that Painter can't even be evenhanded in \n     his mistaken argument by authority. While he invokes various \n     credentials of Liu supporters, he identifies me only as \n     ``National Review Online's Ed Whelan.'')\n       2. Towards the end of his piece, Painter tries to dismiss \n     the relevance of Liu's demagogic and irresponsible arguments \n     against the confirmations of Chief Justice Roberts and \n     Justice Alito. According to Painter, ``[i]t is critically \n     important . . . that people feel free to speak their minds \n     about Supreme Court and other judicial nominations without \n     fear of retribution.'' But as I explained ten months ago when \n     Painter made the same bad argument, Painter completely misses \n     the point: The shoddy quality of Liu's opposition to Roberts \n     and Alito reflects very poorly on him. There is no reason to \n     encourage cheap attacks like Liu's by not holding him \n     accountable.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From nationalreview.com, Mar. 3, 2011]\n\n              Painter Shouldn't Distort Whelan's Arguments\n\n                             (By John Yoo)\n\n       I've seen Richard Painter's post criticizing Ed Whelan for \n     his posts on the nomination of Goodwin Liu.

Obviously, opinions vary \n     regarding the merits of the nomination, but Painter is off-\n     base on several crucial assertions.\n       Given our bottom-line differences on the Liu nomination, I \n     am particularly grateful to Clint Bolick, as I also am to \n     John Yoo, for standing up against Painter's smears. It's \n     striking that two of the very small number of conservatives \n     that Painter relies on for their support of Liu have \n     repudiated Painter (versus zero, so far as I'm aware, who \n     have endorsed his smears).

I am not arguing that the reader must accept my word \n     on Painter (or Bolick's or Yoo's) or on Liu. Rather, the \n     interested reader should carefully examine the competing \n     accounts (both on the matters that Bolick identifies above \n     and on those he doesn't address) and determine who has argued \n     responsibly and effectively and who hasn't.

Starr have \n     sent the Senate Judiciary Committee a badly confused letter \n     in support of Goodwin Liu's nomination to the Ninth Circuit. \n     The core of their letter is dedicated to the proposition that \n     Liu has ``independence and openness to diverse viewpoints as \n     well as [the] ability to follow the facts and the law to \n     their logical conclusion, whatever its political valence may \n     be'' (or, as they later put it, the ``ability to discharge \n     faithfully an abiding duty to follow the law'').\n       Amar and Starr offer two examples in purported support of \n     their proposition, but neither helps. First, they cite Liu's \n     limited support of school-choice programs. As I've explained, \n     Liu supports school-choice programs only insofar as they \n     advance racial quotas. Once one understands that (and there's \n     no indication that Amar and Starr do), it's difficult to see \n     how Liu's position on school choice evidences his \n     ``independence and openness to diverse viewpoints,'' and his \n     position certainly has no relation to his supposed ``ability \n     to follow the facts and the law to their logical \n     conclusion.''\n       Second, Amar and Starr cite Liu's correct prediction that \n     the California supreme court would uphold Proposition 8 \n     ``under applicable precedents'' (their phrase). They assert\n\n[[Page S3141]]\n\n     that his correct prediction shows that Liu ``knows the \n     difference between what the law is and what he might wish it \n     to be.'' But this is a glaring non sequitur. Liu wasn't \n     stating how he would rule; he was predicting how the \n     California supreme court would. Moreover, in an op-ed, Liu \n     stated that the challenge to Proposition 8 was a ``good \n     argument, but one that faces difficult precedents,'' and he \n     argued that ``there are good reasons for the California \n     Supreme Court to rethink its jurisprudence in this area.'' So \n     much for his ``know[ing] the difference between what the law \n     is and what he might wish it to be.''\n       Amar's and Starr's assertion of Liu's ``ability to follow \n     the facts and the law to their logical conclusion'' is also \n     curious, as it's not really his ``ability'' that anyone has \n     questioned. It's his willingness and commitment. Further, \n     anyone familiar with Liu's gauzy constitutional theorizing \n     would recognize that the whole concept of following the law \n     doesn't have much substance in his framework. Take, for \n     example:\n       The problem for courts is to determine, at the moment of \n     decision, whether our collective values on a given issue have \n     converged to a degree that they can be persuasively \n     crystallized and credibly absorbed into legal doctrine. This \n     difficult task requires keen attention to the trajectory of \n     social norms reflected in public policies, institutions, and \n     practices, as well as predictive judgment as to how a \n     judicial decision may help forge or frustrate a social \n     consensus.\n       It is, of course, theoretically possible that someone who \n     advocates a freewheeling judicial role could himself be quite \n     scrupulous in following a whole body of precedent that he \n     detests. But Amar and Starr provide zero reason for anyone to \n     believe that Liu would carry out the judicial role in that \n     manner, and there is nothing in his record to support \n     speculation that he would.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have listened to a lot of the debate \nabout Professor Liu, and having sat in on the hearings with him, having \nmet with him, having gone through the whole record, I sometimes wonder \nwho this is everybody is talking about. It is not the man I heard from, \nthe man who testified under oath and had to speak very candidly, very \nhonestly about his positions. He is a man who is admired by legal \nthinkers and academic scholars from across the political spectrum.\n  He has spent his career in public service, private practice, and as a \nteacher since receiving degrees from Stanford University and Yale Law \nSchool. He is a Rhodes scholar. After law school, Professor Liu clerked \nfor DC Circuit Judge David Tatel, and Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader \nGinsburg. No one can question his intellect or his qualifications. He \nshould be treated with respect and admired, not maligned and \ncaricatured. His honest testimony during two hearings before the \nJudiciary Committee should be credited, rather than ignored.\n  Professor Liu's parents, wife, children, friends and community are \njustifiably proud of him and have looked forward to his confirmation to \nthe court of appeals since he was first nominated in February 2010. We \nsaw his beautiful children at each of his two confirmation hearings--\nindeed, the first was born only weeks before his first hearing and was \nnearly a year old at his second. The son of Taiwanese immigrants, \nProfessor Liu would bring much-needed diversity to the Federal Bench. \nThere is no Asian Pacific American judge on the Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals, which, of course, includes California and Hawaii and a number \nof Western States.\n  If we look at the record, Professor Liu is a nominee with significant \nsupport from across the political and ideological spectrum. Among the \nletters I will have printed in the Record is one from Kenneth Starr, \nthe former Solicitor General during President George H. W. Bush's \nadministration. For those who have may have forgotten, he was the \nindependent counsel who investigated President Clinton during the \nClinton administration.\n  He and distinguished Professor Akhil Amar wrote:\n\n       [I]t is our privilege to speak to his qualifications and \n     character, and to urge favorable action on his nomination in \n     the discharge of your constitutional duties of advice and \n     consent. In short, Goodwin is a person of great intellect, \n     accomplishment, and integrity, and he is exceptionally well-\n     qualified to serve on the court of appeals. The nation is \n     fortunate that he is willing to leave academia to engage in \n     this important form of public service.\n\n  We also heard from Clint Bolick, who is the director of the \nconservative Goldwater Institute, named after a former colleague of \nmine, Barry Goldwater. He said:\n\n       Having reviewed several of his academic writings, I find \n     Professor Liu to exhibit fresh, independent thinking and \n     intellectual honesty. He clearly possesses the scholarly \n     credentials and experiences to serve with distinction on this \n     important court.\n\n  A bipartisan group of eight chief corporate executives who know \nProfessor Liu from his service on the Stanford University Board of \nTrustees recently wrote to the Senate in support of Professor Liu's \nnomination:\n\n       In short, Goodwin's strengths are exactly what we expect in \n     a judge: objectivity, independence, collegiality, respect for \n     differing views, sound judgment. Goodwin possesses these \n     qualities on top of the brilliant legal acumen that is well-\n     established by his professional record and the judgment of \n     those most familiar with his scholarly work.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that these letters be printed in the Record \nat the conclusion of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. I could put in the Record many more from the broad set of \npreeminent lawyers, organizations, and leaders in the academic world \nwho support this nomination. Professor Liu's nomination merits our \nsupport, not this filibuster.\n  The Senate should vote on this nomination. In 2005, when the \nRepublican majority threatened to blow up the Senate to ensure up-or-\ndown votes for each of President Bush's judicial nominations, Senator \nMcConnell, then the Republican whip, said:\n\n       Any President's judicial nominees should receive careful \n     consideration. But after that debate, they deserve a simple \n     up-or-down vote. . . . It's time to move away from advise and \n     obstruct and get back to advise and consent. The stakes are \n     high . . . . The Constitution of the United States is at \n     stake.\n\n  Other Republican Senators made similar statements back then. Many \ndeclared that they would never support the filibuster of a judicial \nnomination. Some have tried to stay true to that vision and principle. \nThat is why the filibuster against Judge Hamilton failed and that \nagainst Judge McConnell was ended. This filibuster should also be \nended.\n  Now the Senators, many of whom are still serving on the other side of \nthe aisle, claim to subscribe to a standard that prohibits filibusters \nof judicial nominees, except in ``extraordinary circumstances.'' None \nof them have shown there are any extraordinary circumstances here. The \nPresident has nominated an outstanding lawyer, supported by his home \nState Senators and favorably reported by a majority of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. This nomination is to fill a vacancy, a judicial \nemergency, on the Ninth Circuit.\n  The 14 Senators who signed the Memorandum of Understanding in 2005, \nthe then-Gang of 14, wrote about their ``responsibilities under the \nAdvice and Consent Clause of the United States Constitution'' and that \nfulfilling their constitutional responsibilities in good faith meant \nthat ``[n]ominees should only be filibustered under extraordinary \ncircumstance.'' Well, let's be responsible. Let's bring it to a vote.\n  I had hoped 2 weeks ago, when 11 Republican Senators joined in voting \nto end the filibuster against Judge Jack McConnell of Rhode Island that \nthe Senate was moving away from the narrow partisan attacks of judicial \nnominations that have slowed us almost from the day President Obama \ntook office. Instead, for the sixth time since President Obama took \noffice just over a couple of years ago, we have had to seek cloture to \novercome a Republican filibuster of one of President Obama's well-\nqualified judicial nominations.\n  The 14 Senators who signed the Memorandum of Understanding in 2005 \nwrote about the need for the President to consult with Senators. Well, \nthis President, unlike his predecessor, has been a model in that \nregard. Unlike President Bush, President Obama actually has consulted \nwith both Republican and Democratic Senators in the home States. And \nunlike my predecessor, the Republican Chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, I have not proceeded with any nominee against the wishes of \na home State Senator. So apparently we have one rule if it is a \nRepublican President and a Republican chairman of the committee, but \neverything changes if we have the nominees of a Democratic President. I \nprotected Republican home State Senators. In return, I would expect \nRepublican Senators to respect the views of other Senators, and to work \nwith the President.\n\n[[Page S3142]]\n\n  In 2005 they called for a return to our earlier practices and the \nreduction of rancor in the confirmation process and a return to the \ntraditions of the Senate. I have worked very hard to do just that. I \nthink of the vote on Janice Rogers Brown to the DC Circuit. She was a \nnominee who had argued that Social Security was unconstitutional, \nsaying that ``[t]oday's senior citizens blithely cannibalize their \ngrandchildren.'' I think most of us disagreed with her on that, but she \ngot an up-or-down vote. They agreed to invoke cloture on the nomination \nof Priscilla Owen to the DC Circuit. Owen, a nominee whose rulings on \nthe Texas Supreme Court were so extreme, they drew a condemnation of \nother conservative judges on that court. In fact, President Bush's \nWhite House counsel and later Attorney General, called one of her \nopinions an unconscionable act of judicial activism. But she was a \nRepublican and she got a vote.\n  By the standard utilized in 2005 to end filibusters and vote on \nPresident Bush's controversial nominees, this filibuster should be \nended and the Senate should vote on the nomination.\n  There were no ``extraordinary circumstances'' to justify the \nRepublican filibuster of Judge David Hamilton, President Obama's very \nfirst judicial nomination. David Hamilton of Indiana was a 15-year \nveteran of the Federal bench. President Obama nominated Judge Hamilton \nin March 2009, after consultation with the most senior and longest-\nserving Republican in the Senate, Senator Dick Lugar of Indiana, who \nthen strongly supported the nomination. Rather than welcome the \nnomination as an attempt by President Obama to step away from the \nideological battles of the past, Senate Republicans ignored Senator \nLugar's support, caricatured Judge Hamilton's record and filibustered \nhis nomination. After rejecting that filibuster, Judge Hamilton was \nconfirmed. The majority leader has had to file cloture on four other \nhighly qualified judicial nominations, and now Professor Liu's \nnomination is the sixth.\n\n  No Senator could claim the circumstances surrounding the filibusters \nof President Obama's other circuit court nominations to be \nextraordinary. Republicans filibustered the nomination of Judge Barbara \nKeenan, a nominee with nearly 30 years of judicial experience, and who \nhad been the first woman to hold a number of important judicial roles \nin Virginia. Once the filibuster was ended, she was ultimately \nconfirmed 99-0 as the first woman from Virginia to serve on the Fourth \nCircuit.\n  Senate Republicans filibustered the nomination of Judge Thomas \nVanaskie, despite his 16 years of experience as a Federal district \ncourt judge in Pennsylvania. That filibuster ended when the Senate \nagreed to vitiate the cloture, end the filibuster, and proceed to a \nvote. There were no extraordinary circumstances.\n  Last year, Senate Republicans filibustered the nomination of Judge \nDenny Chin, an outstanding judge with 16 years experience. They delayed \nhis Senate consideration for months. There was no reason to do it. \nFinally, when that filibuster ended, the Senate proceeded to vote and \nconfirm the only active Asian Pacific American judge serving on the \nFederal appellate court. The only one in all of our courts. This \nnominee is likewise deserving of a vote and not a partisan filibuster.\n  Following the recent filibuster of the nomination of Judge Jack \nMcConnell to the district court in Rhode Island, this filibuster is the \nsixth time the majority leader has had to seek cloture to bring a \njudicial nomination to a vote.\n  I will say how it is unusual to have a second hearing on a \nnomination, at the request of Republican members of the committee. I \nsaid at the time that I hoped they would evaluate him fairly with open \nminds. Any Senator who listened to Professor Liu's answers during hours \nof questions at two confirmation hearings and considered his responses \nto hundreds of written followup questions--hundreds--should come away \nunderstanding this is an exceptional lawyer and scholar who will make \nan outstanding judge, a judge who respects the rule of law and reveres \nthe Constitution.\n  Professor Liu's answers under oath and his reputation as a well-\nrespected constitutional law professor paint a very different picture \nthan the caricature created by the attacks from the special interest \ngroups. Republican Senators did not wait for his hearing before \ndeclaring their opposition.\n  Senator Feinstein noted at Professor Liu's first hearing over a year \nago that he has an extraordinary legal mind and is a person of \nintegrity. I agree. No fairminded person can or should question his \nqualifications, talent, or character. Nobody can doubt his temperament. \nThrough hours and hours and hours of questioning, we saw his judicial \ntemperament. Unlike some of the nominees supported by the other side, \nhe actually answered the questions. He assured the committee time and \ntime again that he understands the role of a judge and the need for a \njudge to follow the law and adhere to the rule of law. He met every \ntest presented to him by Senators on the Judiciary Committee from \neither side of the aisle. He exceeds every standard we have used to \nmeasure judicial nominees.\n  Yet in the course of the debate on this nomination we have heard \ntroubling and baseless attacks on Professor Liu's character and \nintegrity. Incredibly, despite this nominee's testimony at two \nconfirmation hearings and his answers to hundreds of written questions, \nhe has been accused of lack of candor. Professor Liu has not been a \nstealth nominee. In fact, his record as a professor, public servant and \nadvocate has been a remarkably open and public one. Senators have been \nable to review an unprecedented volume of information provided by this \nnominee and ask him hundreds of questions about it. He has been \navailable to meet with Senators and many have taken him up on the \nopportunity. So accusations that Professor Liu has been less than \ncandid are misplaced, and a decision to simply ignore his record, his \ntestimony before the committee, and his assurances under oath that he \nunderstands the role of a judge and would follow precedent if confirmed \nis misguided.\n  The many letters of strong support we have received from \nconservatives and Republicans who have reviewed Professor Liu's record \nand know the nominee show the hollowness of the partisan attacks on \nProfessor Liu's character. In their letter, Ken Starr and Professor \nAmar describe Professor Liu as, ``a person of great intellect, \naccomplishment and integrity.'' A bipartisan group of eight CEO's based \ntheir support for Professor Liu's nomination on their observation of \n``his character and intellect.'' A bipartisan group of 22 leaders in \neducation law, policy and research cited Professor Liu's ``independence \nand intellectual honesty'' as among the many of his exemplary traits \nleading them to support his nomination. Senators can in good faith \noppose this nomination, though I disagree with them, but the attacks on \na fine man's character have no place in this debate.\n  Nonetheless, each time the Judiciary Committee considered Professor \nLiu's nomination a total of three times--Republican Senators voted \nagainst. When Senators are not willing to give serious and open-minded \nconsideration to nominations it reduces the hearings and committee \nprocess to a game of delay and partisan points-scoring. That, too, is \nwrong.\n  I urge Senators to reject the special interest pressure groups and to \napproach this nomination the way I approached a similar nomination of a \nlaw professor by President Bush, the nomination of Professor Michael \nMcConnell to the Tenth Circuit. He was a widely regarded law professor. \nLike Professor Liu, Professor McConnell was nominated to a Federal \nappeals court without having first served as a judge. He was one of two \ndozen such nominations confirmed after being nominated by President \nBush.\n  Professor McConnell's own provocative writings included staunch \nadvocacy for reexamining the first amendment free exercise clause and \nthe establishment clause jurisprudence. He had expressed strong \nopposition to Roe v. Wade and to the clinic access law, and he had \ntestified before Congress that he believed the Violence Against Women \nAct was unconstitutional. Professor McConnell's writings on the actions \nof Federal District Court Judge John Sprizzo in acquitting abortion \nprotesters could not be read as anything other than praise for the \nextra-legal behavior of both the defendants and the judge.\n\n[[Page S3143]]\n\n  Some thought Professor McConnell would turn out to be a conservative \nactivist judge on the Tenth Circuit. I was concerned about his refusal \nto take responsibility for his harsh criticism of the Supreme Court's \ndecision in the Bob Jones case. But I put faith in Professor \nMcConnell's assurance that he understood the difference between his \nrole as a teacher and an advocate and his future role as a judge. He \nassured us that he respected the doctrine of stare decisis, and that as \na Federal appeals court judge he would be bound to follow Supreme Court \nprecedent. I valued the fact that his home State Senator, Senator \nHatch, supported him. The similarity there--except for the philosophy--\nis exactly the same with McConnell and Liu. McConnell was reported \nfavorably by the Judiciary Committee with my support, and he was \nconfirmed to the Tenth Circuit by the Senate just one day after his \nnomination was reported. We voted for McConnell. They want to stop Liu.\n  Numerous conservative legal scholars have praised Professor Liu's \nunderstanding of constitutional law, stating that it falls well within \nthe mainstream of American legal thought. Nothing I have read or heard \nfrom Professor Liu gives me any reason to doubt his conviction about \nthe critical importance of the rule of law as the guiding principle of \njudicial decisionmaking. As a professor he has done what great \nprofessors do--challenge our view of the law. But he has left no doubt \nthat as a judge he would do what great judges do in applying the law \nfairly to each case.\n  I thank Professor Liu's home State Senators, Senator Feinstein and \nSenator Boxer, for their staunch advocacy for his nomination. I also \nthank the many Senators who have come to the floor to speak in support \nof Professor Liu's nomination, including the majority leader, Senator \nReid, the assistant majority leader, Senator Durbin, and Senators \nBlumenthal, Coons, Cardin, Franken, and Lieberman.\n  I hope Senators from both sides of the aisle will join me in ending \nthe filibuster of Professor Liu's nomination. He has demonstrated a \ncommand of the law and devotion to it. He has shown that he understands \nthe role of the judge and how it differs from his career as an advocate \nand an academic.\n  I hope every Senator will treat Professor Liu with the same fairness \nthat we gave Professor McConnell, and give the same weight to Professor \nLiu's assurances that we gave to McConnell's identical assurances. Then \nthe Senate will finally be able to consider and confirm this \nextraordinary nominee.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 13 minutes 30 seconds remaining.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                   March 19, 2010.\n     Senator Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman,\n     Senator Jeff Sessions,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Sessions: As your \n     Committee considers the nomination of Goodwin Liu to serve on \n     the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, it is our \n     privilege to speak to his qualifications and character, and \n     to urge favorable action on his nomination in the discharge \n     of your constitutional duties of advice and consent. In \n     short, Goodwin is a person of great intellect, \n     accomplishment, and integrity, and he is exceptionally well-\n     qualified to serve on the court of appeals. The nation is \n     fortunate that he is willing to leave academia to engage in \n     this important form of public service.\n       The Committee is no doubt familiar with Goodwin's personal \n     story as the son of immigrants from Taiwan and his sterling \n     record of achievements and accolades. We know Goodwin as a \n     fellow teacher and scholar of the law; we have read some of \n     his writings, and we have seen him speak in academic and \n     public settings. What we wish to highlight, beyond his \n     obvious intellect and legal talents, is his independence and \n     openness to diverse viewpoints as well as his ability to \n     follow the facts and the law to their logical conclusion, \n     whatever its political valence may be. These are the \n     qualities we expect in a judge, and Goodwin clearly possesses \n     them.\n       Two examples help make the point. First, Goodwin (and his \n     co-author Bill Taylor) wrote an article in Fordham Law Review \n     in 2005 defending the use of school vouchers to provide \n     better educational opportunities for children trapped in \n     failing schools. The article provides a careful and candid \n     review of the evidence on how vouchers have worked in \n     practice, and it responds to the critics of vouchers in a \n     direct and forceful way. We are fairly sure that this piece \n     did not win Goodwin any friends in the liberal establishment, \n     but it reflected his sincerely reasoned view about one way to \n     improve the life chances of some of our most disadvantaged \n     children. Goodwin's commitment to this issue brought him to \n     Pepperdine in 2006 for a meeting organized by Clint Bolick, \n     then president of the Alliance for School Choice. Given how \n     far apart he and Clint are on other issues, Goodwin's \n     enthusiastic participation in that meeting demonstrates his \n     willingness to find common ground even with people who have \n     quite different beliefs from his own.\n       A second example hits closer to home for one of us. In \n     2008, Goodwin joined an amicus brief by constitutional law \n     professors in support of the plaintiffs who challenged \n     California's marriage laws in the state supreme court. The \n     court ruled for the plaintiffs, but in November 2008 the \n     voters of California effectively reversed that ruling by \n     enacting Proposition 8, a state constitutional amendment that \n     limits marriage to opposite-sex couples. In October 2008, \n     before Proposition 8 passed, Goodwin was called to testify at \n     a joint hearing of the California Assembly and Senate \n     Judiciary Committees on the legal issues raised by \n     Proposition 8. He was asked to testify as a neutral legal \n     expert (indeed, he was the sole witness tapped for that \n     role), and on the core issue that later became the subject of \n     a state constitutional challenge, Goodwin correctly \n     forecasted that Proposition 8 would be upheld by the \n     California Supreme Court under applicable precedents. Again, \n     Goodwin's position, which he also stated in a Los Angeles \n     Times editorial, could not have pleased his friends who \n     sought to invalidate Proposition 8. But, as the example \n     shows, Goodwin knows the difference between what the law is \n     and what he might wish it to be, and he is fully capable and \n     unafraid of discharging the duty to say what the law is.\n       As his academic colleagues, we would add a further point. \n     Given what we know of Goodwin, it seems no accident that he \n     was asked by his dean (literally before the ink was dry on \n     his tenure review) to assume the role of associate dean. If \n     Berkeley is like other law schools, the duties of that \n     position include planning the curriculum and, importantly, \n     serving as something of a catch-all for faculty requests and \n     complaints. His appointment to that role is additional \n     evidence of his reputation for collegiality, fairness, and \n     good judgment.\n       In sum, you have before you a judicial nominee with strong \n     intellect, demonstrated independence, and outstanding \n     character. We recognize that commentators on all sides will \n     be drawn to debate the views Goodwin has expressed in his \n     writings and speeches. In the end, however, a judge takes an \n     oath to uphold and defend the Constitution, and in the case \n     of a circuit judge, fidelity to the law entails adherence to \n     Supreme Court precedent and (apart from the en banc process) \n     adherence to circuit precedent as well. Thus, in our view, \n     the traits that should weigh most heavily in the evaluation \n     of an extraordinarily qualified nominee such as Goodwin are \n     professional integrity and the ability to discharge \n     faithfully an abiding duty to follow the law. Because Goodwin \n     possesses those qualities to the highest degree, we are \n     confident that he will serve on the court of appeals not only \n     fairly and competently, but with great distinction. We \n     support and urge his speedy confirmation.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n     Akhil Reed Amar,\n       Sterling Professor of Law and Political Science, Yale Law \n     School.\n     Kenneth W.

Orrin Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Sen. Hatch: I hope the new year is off to a good start \n     for you.\n       I understand that the President will send to the Senate the \n     nomination of Goodwin Liu to serve on the U.S. Court of \n     Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. He is associate dean and \n     professor of law at Boalt Hall at the University of \n     California, and a former Rhodes Scholar and clerk to Justice \n     Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Although Prof. Liu and I differ on some \n     issues, I strongly support his nomination.\n       I have known Prof. Liu for several years, since reading an \n     influential law review article he co-authored with William \n     Taylor of the Citizens' Commission on Civil Rights supporting \n     school choice as a solution to the crisis of inner-city \n     public education. It took a great deal of courage and \n     integrity for Prof. Liu and Mr. Taylor to take such a strong \n     and public position. Subsequently, Prof. Liu participated in \n     a program hosted by the Alliance for School Choice bringing \n     together diverse supporters of expanded educational \n     opportunities.\n\n[[Page S3144]]\n\n       Having reviewed several of his academic writings, I find \n     Prof. Liu to exhibit fresh, independent thinking and \n     intellectual honesty. He clearly possesses the scholarly \n     credentials and experience to serve with distinction on this \n     important court.\n       Thank you for considering my comments, and I hope our paths \n     cross soon. With all best wishes.\n           Very sincerely,\n                                                     Clint Bolick,\n     Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     May 17, 2011.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     U.S. Senator, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senator, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid and Senator McConnell: We are a \n     bipartisan group of eight business leaders who write in our \n     personal capacities in support of University of California \n     law professor Goodwin Liu's nomination to the Ninth Circuit \n     Court of Appeals. We know Goodwin from his service on the \n     Stanford University Board of Trustees, and having observed \n     his character and intellect in the intimate setting of a \n     high-level fiduciary board, we have no doubt that he would \n     make a superb federal judge.\n       The Stanford Board of Trustees is the university's \n     governing body. It is the custodian of the university's \n     endowment and properties, and it sets the annual budget, \n     appoints the president, and determines policies for operation \n     and control of the university. Election to the board involves \n     a rigorous screening process that considers an individual's \n     temperament, collegiality, professional accomplishments, \n     leadership abilities, and judgment, among other qualities. \n     The 32 current trustees include leading venture capitalists, \n     foundation and university presidents, and more than a dozen \n     chairmen or CEOs of major corporations and private equity \n     firms. The board meets five times a year for two days at a \n     time, so board members get to know each other quite well.\n       Goodwin's election as a trustee is indicative of his \n     professional stature and integrity, as well as his record of \n     public service. Through the careful and confidential scrutiny \n     involved in the board's screening process, Goodwin emerged as \n     a person widely admired for his intellect, fairness, and \n     ability to work well with people of differing views.\n       On the board, Goodwin has lived up to his reputation. \n     Across a wide range of complex issues, Goodwin routinely asks \n     thoughtful and incisive questions. He is good at thinking \n     independently and zeroing in on important issues that need \n     attention. Even in a room full of highly accomplished \n     leaders, Goodwin is impressive. He is insightful, \n     constructive, and a good listener. Moreover, he possesses a \n     remarkably even temperament; his demeanor is unfailingly \n     respectful and open-minded, never dogmatic or inflexible. \n     Given these qualities, it was no surprise that he was asked \n     to chair the board's Special Committee on Investment \n     Responsibility after serving just one year of his five-year \n     term.\n       In short, Goodwin's strengths are exactly what we expect in \n     a judge: objectivity, independence, collegiality, respect for \n     differing views, sound judgment. Goodwin possesses these \n     qualities on top of the brilliant legal acumen that is well-\n     established by his professional record and the judgment of \n     those most familiar with his scholarly work.\n       The confirmation of exceptionally qualified nominees like \n     Goodwin should not be a partisan issue. We believe Goodwin \n     deserves the support of Senators from both parties; at the \n     least, he deserves a timely up-or-down vote. We are pleased \n     to join the diverse range of individuals who endorse \n     Goodwin's nomination and urge his swift confirmation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Mariann Byerwalter,\n       Chairman, JDN Corporate Advisory LLC.\n     Steven A. Denning,\n       Chairman, General Atlantic LLC.\n     John A. Gunn,\n       Chairman, Dodge & Cox.\n     Frank D. Lee,\n       CEO, Dragonfly Sciences, Inc.\n     Hamid R.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, over the past two years, our Nation has \nbeen engaged in a great debate about the kind of country we want \nAmerica to be--a place of maximum liberty and limited government, or a \nplace where no problem is too big or too small for the government to \nget involved.\n  This debate arose because of a President who made no apologies about \nwanting to move America to the left, and it continues today, despite \nwidespread opposition to the President's policies, because of the \nPresident's clear determination to forge ahead.\n  But just as Rome wasn't built in a day, neither is President Obama's \nvision assured. Rather, it is a work in progress.\n  A big part of the President's plan was to put government in charge of \nour Nation's health care system.\n  Another part was making sure government calls the shots over private \nindustry and elections--so much so that we are actually having a debate \nright now about whether businesses need to ask the White House's \npermission to move to another State, and whether private businesses \nshould be forced to disclose political contributions in order to get a \nFederal contract.\n  And still another part of the President's vision involves the people \nhe wants to put on our Nation's courts.\n  Do we want people who have reverence for the U.S. Constitution and \nwho believe it means what it says or do we want people on our courts \nwho care more about advancing an ideology that is antithetical to the \nConstitution than they do about upholding it.\n  This is the question Presidents need to ask themselves when it comes \nto judicial nominees. And I think this President's preference in this \narea is clear.\n  Based on some of the nominations we have seen, President Obama wants \nmen and women on the courts who will advance his vision, who would \nexpand the scope of government beyond anything the founders could have \never imagined.\n  Yet not until now has the Senate been asked to confirm someone who \nhas so openly and vigorously repudiated the widely accepted meaning and \npurpose of the Constitution. And here I am referring, of course, to the \nnomination of Goodwin Liu to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  So this afternoon I would like to take a moment to explain why I \nbelieve it is so critically important that the Senate reject this \nnomination now by opposing cloture on it.\n  The first thing I would say about Mr. Liu is that I have nothing \nagainst him personally. No one disputes that he has a compelling \npersonal story or that he is possessed of a fine intellect. But earning \na lifetime appointment isn't a right, nor is it a popularity contest.\n  Rather, it is incumbent upon those of us who are required to vote on \njudicial nominees like him to evaluate each one of them closely--to \nexamine their judicial philosophies, to look at their records, and to \nconsider their temperaments. And that's just what we have done here. \nWhat have we found?\n  When it comes to Mr. Liu's record as a practicing lawyer, the first \nthing to say is that it is almost nonexistent. He has no prior \nexperience as a judge and minimal experience actually practicing the \nlaw.\n  This means that in evaluating what kind of judge Mr. Liu would be, \nand in trying to determine his judicial philosophy, we are necessarily \nlimited to what he has written.\n  And what do Mr. Liu's writings reveal? Put simply, they reveal a \nleft-wing ideologue who views the role of a judge not as that of an \nimpartial arbiter but as someone who views the bench as a position of \npower.\n  As recently as 2 years ago, Mr. Liu said he believed that the last \npresidential election gave liberals, as he put it, ``a tremendous \nopportunity to actually get [their] ideas and the progressive vision of \nthe Constitution and of law . . . into practice.''\n  Here is an open acknowledgement by Mr. Liu that a judge should use \nhis position to advance his own views. This is repugnant. Anyone who \nholds such a view as a judge would undermine the integrity of the \ncourts.\n  And what are Mr. Liu's views?\n  In an article he published 3 years ago, Mr. Liu wrote that courts \nshould interpret the U.S. Constitution as containing a right to \neducation, shelter,\n\n[[Page S3145]]\n\nsubsistence, and health care--a constitutional right. By this he meant \nthat the courts should determine how ``particular welfare goods'' \nshould be distributed rather than the people themselves, through the \ndemocratic process.\n  The point is that Mr. Liu appears to view the judge not as someone \nwhose primary job is to interpret the Constitution but as someone whose \nlifetime tenure liberates him to advance his views of what the \nConstitution means and empowers him to impose it on others. In his \nview, it is the job of a judge to create new rights, regardless of what \nthe Constitution says or what the American people, acting through the \ndemocratic process, want.\n  And while this philosophy may be popular on left-wing college \ncampuses, it has no place whatsoever in a U.S. courtroom. Everyone who \nenters our courtrooms should have the assurance that judges will uphold \ntheir rights equally and that they won't overstep their bounds. Mr. \nLiu's writings provide no such assurance. On the contrary, they suggest \na deeply held commitment to the view that the Constitution can mean \npretty much whatever a judge wants it to, that judges can just make it \nup as they go along.\n  In Mr. Liu's court, the defendant couldn't expect to be protected by \nthe Constitution and the laws, because the law is subject to the whim \nof the judge. This is precisely the opposite of what Americans expect \nin a judge. It also happens to be the opposite of what the Founders \nenvisioned for the courts. As it says in Federalist 78, the Judiciary \n``has neither force nor will, but merely judgment.''\n  Compare this with Mr. Liu, whose writings suggest again and again \nthat a judge shouldn't look so much at the words of the Constitution \nwhen setting out to interpret it, as they should ``our collective \nvalues'' or our ``evolving norms''.\n  Let's be clear. It is the judge, in Mr. Liu's view, who will \ndetermine what ``norms'' are ``evolving,'' not the American people.\n  Clearly, the Constitution itself would take a backseat in his court.\n  Indeed, even a brief review of his writings suggests that, as a \njudge, Mr. Liu might very well accord greater respect to foreign law \nthan he would to our own Constitution.\n  As he once wrote:\n\n       The U.S. can hardly claim to have a monopoly on wise \n     solutions to common legal problems faced by constitutional \n     democracies around the world.\n\n  Again, this might fly in a left-wing classroom--but it is cold \ncomfort to those who look to the courts for equal justice under the \nlaw. Americans shouldn't have to wonder when they walk into an American \ncourtroom which Nation's laws they will be judged under.\n  So, as I see it, there is no question, based on his writings, that \nMr. Liu's judicial philosophy is completely antithetical to the \njudicial oath that he would be sworn to uphold.\n  Upon his own nomination to the bench, Professor Liu has sought to \ndistance himself from his legal writings. He has also told the \njudiciary committee that he stands by them. Well, he can't have it both \nways. And as others have pointed out, if we can't go by what Professor \nLiu has written, there is nothing left upon which to evaluate him.\n  On the question of qualifications, Mr. Liu just doesn't have much \nlegal experience outside of the classroom. And while no one is saying \nteachers can't be good judges, this particular teacher's judicial \nphilosophy, as evidenced by his writings, is so far outside the \nmainstream that anyone who believes in the primacy of the U.S. \nConstitution should be deeply troubled by the prospect of his \nappointment to the court.\n  I believe this nominee is precisely the kind of judge we want to \nprevent from getting on the bench. He should not be confirmed. I will \nvote against cloture. I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will use leader time to give my remarks. I \nask unanimous consent that as soon as I have finished my remarks, the \nvote go forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, 2 days ago I came to the floor to talk about \nthe nomination of Goodwin Liu, an extremely well-qualified, fairminded, \nand widely respected legal scholar. The President has nominated him to \nserve his country on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n  All week, this body has heard speeches about Mr. Liu's merits, so I \nwill repeat them only briefly. He was a Rhodes Scholar and clerked on \nthe U.S. Supreme Court. He served as associate dean at the California \nBerkeley School of Law and is a professor there right now. He has done \na lot of pro bono work and even helped launch AmeriCorps. On top of all \nthat, he has lived the American dream. He is the highly successful son \nof immigrants.\n  His integrity has been praised by Democrats and Republicans, not just \none or two but many. Former Republican Congressman--and a very \nconservative Congressman--Bob Barr commended Liu's commitment to the \nConstitution. One of President Bush's former lawyers said Liu falls \nwithin the mainstream. Even Ken Starr, the Whitewater special \nprosecutor, endorsed this man who served in the Clinton administration.\n  The record is clear. Any claims that Goodwin Liu is anything but \ndeserving of our confirmation is simply inaccurate. But I recognize \nevery Senator has the right to vote how he or she feels they should \nvote. It is worth noting, however, that the vote before us now is not a \nvote to confirm him; it is a vote on whether he deserves an up-or-down \nvote. There is no question he does deserve an up-or-down vote.\n  A simple up-or-down vote is hardly a controversial request. This is \nnot only my view and the view of my fellow Democrats, it is a view of \nmy Republican friends as well. In a 2004 Law Review article, one of our \nRepublican colleagues, the junior Senator from Texas and longtime \nmember of the Texas Supreme Court, wrote the following:\n\n       Wasteful and unnecessary delay in the process of selecting \n     judges hurts our justice system and harms all Americans. It \n     is intolerable no matter who occupies the White House and no \n     matter which party is in the majority party in the Senate . . \n     . Filibusters are by far the most virulent form of delay \n     imaginable.\n\n  The junior Senator from Texas is in the Chamber today. We will see if \nhe still feels that way or if he will, in his own words, hurt our \njustice system and harm all Americans with intolerable virulent delays. \nWe will carefully be watching how he votes.\n  We will also be carefully watching another Republican Senator, the \nsenior Senator from Tennessee, who said this in 2005:\n\n       I pledged, then and there, I would never filibuster any \n     President's judicial nominee, period. I might vote against \n     them, but I will always see them come to a vote.\n\n  The senior Senator from Tennessee is here today. ``Never'' is about \nas unambiguous as it gets. We will be watching to see if he upholds his \npublic pledge.\n  A third Republican Senator, the junior Senator from Georgia, said \nthis in 2005:\n\n       I will vote to support a vote, up or down, on every \n     nominee, understanding that, were I in the minority party or \n     the issues reversed, I would take exactly the same position \n     because this document, our Constitution, does not equivocate.\n\n  The junior Senator from Georgia will be voting this afternoon. Now, \nas he predicted, he is in the minority and the issue is reversed. We \nwill see if, as he promised, he will take the same position or if he \nwill equivocate.\n  Here is a fourth. Four years ago, another Republican Senator, the \nsenior Senator from Utah, former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nsaid this on this floor:\n\n       We may not use our role of advise and consent to undermine \n     the President's authority to appoint judges . . . It is wrong \n     to use the filibuster to defeat judicial nominees who have \n     majority support, who would be confirmed if only we could \n     vote up or down. That is why I have never voted against \n     cloture on judicial nominations.\n\n  Yet another pledge never to vote against cloture on a judicial \nnomination. That is four. There are more.\n\n[[Page S3146]]\n\nThat is precisely the vote before us now. We will be watching to see if \nthe senior Senator from Utah follows his own counsel or if he, in his \nown judgment, undermines the authority of the President of the United \nStates.\n  These pledges were made publicly and plainly.

Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon during \nWorld Trade Week to urge President Obama to submit pending free-trade \nagreements: Korea, Panama, and Colombia. I hope this is the last time I \ncome to the floor on this issue until we are actually debating these \njob-creating agreements, but I must admit I feel as though I am holding \nmy breath.\n  Mr. President, 1,420 days have passed since the U.S.-Korea Free Trade \nAgreement was signed; 1,422 days have passed since we signed an \nagreement with Panama, and it has been 1,640 days since we completed \nnegotiations with our close ally, Colombia.\n  We have heard the administration tout the job-creating benefits of \nthe agreements, so why more roadblocks? Our unemployment rate is nearly \n10 percent. Our workers deserve a consistent message on job creation \nfrom this administration. It has been over a month since President \nObama and the President of Colombia made an announcement. The \nannouncement was that negotiations had been completed, I might add, yet \nagain. I was relieved that President Obama finally announced there was \nan agreement and that there was a need to complete the long overdue \nagreement.\n  I am confident the agreement brought to the Senate and the House \nwould finally win bipartisan support, and I still am today. In fact, \nover a month ago, in the Wall Street Journal, my colleagues, Senators \nBaucus and Kerry, called for Congress to ``restore a broadly-shared \nbipartisan consensus on trade.'' Now the administration seems to be \nmoving the goalposts, suggesting continued delay. They are trying to \nhold up these agreements to force us to make spending increases that \nwere contained in the ill-fated economic stimulus bill.\n  During the challenging economic times that our Nation has endured, we \nshould all be doing all we can to exert every single ounce of energy to \nget our economy moving again and create jobs. This is not done by \nheavyhanded government, massive new spending, and new entitlements when \nour current programs are unsustainable. It is accomplished by lowering \nand removing barriers to our job creators so they can flourish. Korea, \nPanama, and Colombia all have much higher barriers to our exports than \nwe have to their imports. These three bipartisan votes should have been \nnear the top of the agenda 2 years ago. By now we should be voting on \nnew agreements that this administration has negotiated, not the \nleftovers from the previous administration.\n  We will need an even greater focus on leveling the playing field \nthrough trade agreements if we are going to double our exports in the \nnext 5 years, which is the goal the President has set. Yet the \nadministration, claiming that reopening negotiations with Korea, \nColombia, and Panama was necessary, continues to talk through these \nagreements. I am not saying every single agreement before us, or \nhopefully before us, is perfect. No agreement ever is. However, let's \nnot forget that these agreements were originally negotiated in good \nfaith between allies. What does this delay do to our reputation as a \nreliable negotiating partner?\n  Back where I come from in Nebraska, a lot of business is still done \nwith a handshake. We trust our neighbors because they are good people \nwith good values. But if one makes a deal with someone and shakes on \nthe deal and they keep changing the terms or delaying the \nfollowthrough, one tends to stop dealing with those people. I sure hope \nthat does not happen to us.\n\n[[Page S3147]]\n\n  The fastest growing opportunities for American businesses, farms, and \nranches are outside of our borders. Our greatest opportunities are \noverseas in rapidly developing countries. I fear that these long delays \nhave hurt our ability, the ability of our government to negotiate high-\nquality trade agreements. But, most importantly, it has hurt the \nability of Americans to compete in these growing marketplaces.\n  Let's not pretend this delay has not cost American workers. Since the \nColombia agreement was initially signed all those days ago, our \nbusinesses and our agricultural producers have paid nearly $3.5 billion \nin tariffs for goods exported. That is enormous, especially when we \nconsider that the U.S. International Trade Commission estimates that an \nAmerican job is supported for every $166,000 in exports.\n  Instead of wasting money on tariff payments, the U.S. manufacturing \nand agricultural sectors could have spent billions of dollars creating \njobs at home.\n  I hope we can soon get past the continued delays and the \nadministration can signal to us that they are serious about doubling \nexports in 5 years.\n  On July 1, less than 2 months away from now, the trade agreement \nbetween the European Union and South Korea goes into effect. It is also \nthe date that the FTA between Canada and Colombia goes into effect. The \nnegotiators for other countries are watching the United States, and \nthey have seen a lack of trade policy. They have seen a change here, \nand they are doing everything they can to fill that vacuum with \nnegotiated and approved agreements. Now our exporters will face even \ngreater competition when our trade agreements are approved, and \nhopefully they will be.\n  The President said it very well in his State of the Union Address:\n\n       If America sits on the sidelines while other nations sign \n     trade agreements, we will lose the chance to create jobs on \n     our shores.\n\n  That is exactly what is happening. I will give one example. In 2007 \nAmerican wheat farmers supplied Colombia with almost 70 percent of the \nwheat market, even though they faced tariffs of 10 to 35 percent. By \n2010 our wheat farmers' share of the market had dropped to 46 percent. \nWhere did that business go?\n  Meanwhile, Canada's share grew from 24 to 33 percent. That percentage \nwill skyrocket when Canadian farmers can export their products duty \nfree on July 1. Our wheat farmers may effectively be shut out of a \nmarket that they dominated at one point in time.\n  Americans who are out of work know firsthand that an opportunity is \nbeing missed. Nebraska farmers, businesses, workers, those across the \ncountry know we can compete with anyone given a level playing field. \nAfter the absence of leadership on trade in Washington during the last \n2 years, though, the job of competing is harder and harder.\n  In proclaiming this week as World Trade Week, the President noted the \nconnection between the global economy and prosperity in our own \ncountry. ``To ensure our success,'' he called for ``a robust, forward-\nlooking trade agenda that emphasizes exports and domestic job growth.'' \nIt is disappointing that the positive steps forward we have seen over \nthe past few months have slowed in recent days, and we just cannot \nafford more setbacks.\n  I look forward to working with the administration over the next 2 \nyears on forward-looking trade efforts. Real progress forward would \nproduce great opportunity in our country, but we have to get this work \ndone first. Therefore, it is my hope that the President will bring to \nus, without delay, the Korea, Panama, and Colombia Trade Agreements for \nus to vote yes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/19/senate-section/article/S3147-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3147-S3148]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FREE-TRADE AGREEMENTS\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I appreciate the words of the \nSenator from Nebraska about these trade agreements. I take them at face \nvalue. I know he means well. I know he believes these trade agreements \nhelp the American people.\n  I also know every time there is a major trade agreement in front of \nthis Congress--the Presiding Officer's first one, I believe, and mine, \nwas something called the North American Free Trade Agreement. They \npromised and promised, saying there would be all kinds of jobs and our \ntrade surplus would grow; that it would be not just more jobs but \nbetter paying jobs. It did not quite work out that way with NAFTA.\n  Then they did the same kind of promise and overpromise with PNTR, \nnormal trade relations with China. In Mexico with NAFTA we had a trade \nsurplus not too many years before NAFTA was signed, and it turned into \na multibillion-dollar trade deficit.\n  With China we had a small trade deficit. A deficit in trade means we \nbuy more from that country than we sell to that country. President Bush \nsaid a $1 billion trade surplus or deficit turns into--he had different \nestimates, but between 13,000 and 19,000 jobs is what he used to say. \nWhether or not that is precise is a bit beside the point. The point is, \nif we are selling a lot more than we are buying, it is going to create \njobs in our country. If we are buying a lot more than we are selling, \nwe are going to lose manufacturing jobs.\n  We went to literally hundreds of billions of dollars in trade deficit \nwith China after PNTR. If we go into any store in the country we see \nthe number of products made in China that used to be made in Vermont or \nOhio or Michigan or Pennsylvania or Mississippi or wherever. So we know \nwith these trade agreements, every time they come to the floor the \npromise is they are going to create jobs for Americans. They did it \nwith NAFTA. They did it with PNTR with China. They did it with the \nCentral American Free Trade Agreement. Now they are saying the same \nthing with South Korea, Panama, and Colombia, that it is going to \ncreate American jobs. Well, it doesn't ever. Maybe the theory is good. \nI don't think the theory is very good, but maybe it is, but it doesn't \nseem to work out that way.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to listen to what these supporters of trade \nagreements say, to be sure; trust but verify. Ask the tough questions: \nWhy is this going to create more jobs? We know the cost of the South \nKorea trade agreement is literally $7 billion. It is going to cost us a \nlot of money. They are not paying for it. These fiscal conservatives \nhere don't want to take away the subsidies from the oil industry. They \nalso don't want to pay for the trade agreement that is going to cost us \n$7 billion, plus the lost jobs that come about as a result.\n  We know what these lost jobs mean to Mansfield, OH. We know what they \nmean to Sandusky and Chillicothe and Cleveland and Dayton, proud cities \nwith a proud middle class that have seen these manufacturing jobs so \noften go straight to Mexico, go straight to China, go straight to \ncountries all over the world after we sign these trade agreements or \nafter we change these rules about trade.\n  At a minimum, I have asked the President of the United States by \nletter, with 35 or so Senators who also signed this letter--and we will \nrelease it and send it to the President tomorrow--underscoring the \nPresident's commitment and the commitment of the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative, Ambassador Kirk, and the President's economic adviser, \nGene Sperling, who said they will not send these free trade agreements \nto the Congress until the President has had an opportunity to sign \ntrade adjustment assistance.\n  Trade adjustment assistance simply says when you lose your job \nbecause of a trade agreement, you at least are eligible for assistance \nfor job retraining. To me, the problem is the trade agreements and they \nare costing us jobs. But at a minimum, the great majority of Democratic \nSenators here understands, along with the President, that we don't pass \nthese trade agreements without helping these workers who are going to \nlose their jobs.\n  To me, it is a little bit counterintuitive: Why pass these trade \nagreements at all if we expect job loss to come from them. But the \nother side of the argument is that jobs will increase overall, although \nit doesn't seem to work that way. But everybody knows some people are \ngoing to lose jobs as a\n\n[[Page S3148]]\n\nresult of these trade agreements. That is a bit of circular thinking \nthat I don't particularly buy. But at a minimum, because so often when \nthese trade agreements pass, conservative Republican--sort of pro \ncorporate interest--Senators, will say, Well, we want to take care of \nthese workers and let's pass a trade agreement, and then they don't get \naround to taking care of the workers. That is why we have to do trade \nadjustment assistance first and to begin to enforce these trade rules.\n  We saw in Ohio alone in the last 3 or 4 years, because we enforced \nsome trade rules--because the President of the United States, President \nObama, and the Commerce Department and the International Trade \nCommission stood up and enforced trade rules on China's gaming the \nsystem on tires, on oil country tubular steel, and less so, but on \ncoded paper--we have seen jobs in the United States come back because \nwe are leveling the playing field so they can't game the system as \nmuch.\n  That is why it is important that we take care of workers before these \ntrade agreements come to the Congress and then we will debate trade \nagreements. I hope we can defeat them--I think it is going to be hard--\nand we make sure we do the enforcement of these trade rules that are \nnow in existence that are now part of the law and get that in place and \nstrengthen that before we pass these trade agreements.\n  It is a pretty simple thing to do, but it is important. In one of the \ntrade agreements the Senator from Nebraska mentioned, he was talking \nabout the Colombia Free Trade Agreement. I could speak on each of the \nthree to the point of perhaps boring some of my colleagues. But on the \none trade agreement that is particularly egregious with the country of \nColombia, just last year, 50 trade unionists, 50 labor activists in \nColombia were murdered--50 murders. They are saying, the supporters of \nthese trade agreements say yes, but they are getting better in Colombia \nand fewer trade activists are getting murdered so it is getting better.\n  Not that long ago, a labor rights lawyer was shot. He did not die. He \nsurvived, was injured badly. There is something a bit untoward about \nsaying to this country, because you are getting better and fewer trade \nunionists are getting murdered, we ought to give them free trade, we \nought to do a free trade agreement. I hope we will stand back. If we \ncare about justice and human rights and about the values we embody of \ndemocracy and fair play, we shouldn't be passing a trade agreement with \na country where the labor environment is such that these labor union \nactivists who believe in collective bargaining and free association, \ncollective bargaining--such as the consensus we have in this country \naround collective bargaining--at least we did until some radicals in \nOhio and Wisconsin tried to write and pass legislation that unwinds \nsome of that which has helped create a middle class. But if we believe \nin collective bargaining, if we believe in free association, if we \nbelieve in the right of the people to voluntarily organize and then \nbargain collectively, we shouldn't be passing a trade agreement with a \ncountry that has an environment where so many labor activists have been \nmurdered.\n  I wish to remind my colleagues again how important this trade \nadjustment assistance is before we pass these trade agreements.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/19/senate-section/article/S3148-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3148-S3149]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  NLRB\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I rise today to voice my concerns about a great deal of controversy \nsurrounding a complaint issued under the National Labor Relations Act \nagainst the Boeing Company. Boeing recently decided to open a new plant \nin South Carolina. The National Labor Relations Board's acting general \ncounsel issued a complaint because of evidence that this decision was \nmade in retaliation for recent strikes at the Boeing plant in the Puget \nSound area.\n  I hope there is no dispute about a couple of points. First, Boeing is \na highly reputable company that produces great products valued around \nthe world, and great jobs. Not just jobs but good jobs. There should be \nno doubt also about the importance of public debate, robust criticism \nof government agencies, including the National Labor Relations Board, \nwhen it makes decisions that spark disagreement. I have the greatest of \nrespect for my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who may have been \ncritical of NLRB decisions in the past and of this action in the \npresent. There should be no doubt also about the importance of the \nintegrity of the NLRB process which begins with a complaint, which is \nall we have here against Boeing, and then has a procedure for \nconsideration by an administrative law judge of the facts and the law, \nthen to the full board of the NLRB, and a right of appeal to the Court \nof Appeals for the District of Columbia circuit.\n  Here, in this instance, there has been a series of attacks on the \ncomplaint and the acting general counsel that involve apparent efforts \nto impede or derail that process and to prejudge and even preempt that \nprocess. The effect is to politicize and potentially stop what should \nbe a legal proceeding handled under the appropriate rules and laws and \nstatutes by an independent government agency. This issue is about the \nintegrity of the process.\n\n  At this point there is only a complaint against Boeing. This \ncomplaint was issued on the basis of statements and documents and \nactions by the company itself. There is certainly evidence, including \nat least one Boeing executive's statements, that the company may have \nretaliated against workers. The NLRB and Lafe Solomon, the acting \ngeneral counsel, have not only the right but the responsibility to \ninvestigate and act where the facts and the law establish a right and \nobligation to do so. So no one should be trying to prejudge this case \nbefore it goes before the administrative judge, and no one should be \nseeking a pass from the appropriate process, and no one should be \nseeking to intimidate or to interfere with this lawful proceeding. I \ncome to the floor today because of the prospect of exactly that danger \noccurring.\n  On May 12, Chairman Darrell Issa, representing the House Committee on \nOversight and Government Reform, sent a letter to the acting general \ncounsel of the NLRB requesting that it produce virtually all internal \ndocuments relating to this case. Indeed, the letter has a number of \nspecific paragraphs that are sweeping in their scope, requesting, for \nexample--demanding--that all documents and communications referring or \nrelating to the Office of General Counsel's investigation of Boeing, \nincluding but not limited to all communications between the Office of \nGeneral Counsel and the National Labor Relations Board. The House \ncommittee, with all due respect, is not a court. It is not the \nadministrative judge. It is not a proper party to be demanding these \ndocuments in the course of a lawful judicial proceeding. The chairman's \nattempt to insert the committee into this case by conducting its own \nround of discovery at this point would interfere with the NLRB's \nability to prepare and present its case before a real judicial officer.\n  These actions and some others are an attack on the integrity of the \nNLRB, an attack on its ability to make decisions and enforce the law as \nthe Congress has instructed it and required it to do based on decisions \ninvolving the facts and the law alone. The NLRB is part of our justice \nsystem, and it should be given the opportunity to do justice in this \ninstance. It should be given the opportunity to protect fairness and \npeace at the workplace, which is ultimately its mandate and its very \nsolemn responsibility, and its tradition. Its mandate from the Congress \nis to protect jobs and foster economic growth by maintaining peace and \nfairness at the workplace. These priorities should be shared by all of \nthe country. I certainly believe and hope that the people of \nConnecticut want fairness and peace in the workplace, as we do in our \nworkplaces.\n  The NLRB, very simply, should be given that opportunity to do justice \nwithout improper or inappropriate interference by Members of the \nCongress or anyone else. My hope is that it will be vindicated and the \nattacks will cease, and that it will be given the opportunity to go \nforward lawfully and appropriately and properly.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S3149]]\n\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR.

I rise to speak for 10 minutes on an issue that is very \nimportant to not just my State but really important to the country.\n  We know flooding is going on around the country. This is a picture \nfrom Arkansas, and clearly there are people all over the country or all \nover the South along the Mississippi River who are underwater. You can \nsee the very end here; this little end is a lawn mower that is sticking \nup out of the water. The water is coming up to the bottom of the \nwindowsill in this home over in east Arkansas. So we certainly send our \nprayers and any sort of assistance we can to people in my State, in \nLouisiana, Mississippi, other places, Missouri--obviously in Missouri \nthey have had a lot of water up there--and Tennessee and other places \nthat are really underwater right now.\n  What I want to talk about today, though, is not this flooding the \ncountry is experiencing right now but a flood in my State that happened \n3 years ago. We had a situation 3 years ago where we had some flooding \non the White River near a town called Mountain View, and FEMA paid out \nsome money to flood victims there. It turns out some of that money was \npaid out wrongly.\n  I want to talk about that in just a minute, but let me start with \nJune 1, 1865. In President Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, he described \nour government as a government of the people, by the people, and for \nthe people. I like President Lincoln's description of our government, \nand I firmly believe our government was created by our citizens to \nprotect our citizens. It is there for the benefit of our citizens. That \nis what I want to talk about today.\n  Many of you have heard me talk about FEMA's disaster assistance \nrecoupment process, which, by the way, I am 100 percent for recoupment. \nOur Federal agencies make mistakes, and they send out things in error. \nThere is some double-dipping. There is some lack of oversight. There \nare poor systems in place from time to time. There is some fraud, some \ndishonesty out there. I think the Federal Government owes it to the \ntaxpayers to go out and recoup as much of that money as possible. I \nwant to focus on one sliver of that, and even within that sliver, a \nvery small piece of that small sliver; that is, FEMA's disaster \nassistance recoupment process.\n  I have a bill on this subject, and since the last time I have spoken \nabout this on the floor, we have taken our bill, we have been in the \nHomeland Security Committee, and it has been reworked and modified. Our \nstaff and many other staffs on the committee worked on this late last \nweek and over the weekend and early this week, and I think they spent \nover an hour with FEMA on the telephone to make sure they understand \nall of FEMA's processes and how this really works.\n  But the bottom line is, yesterday in Homeland Security, I was able to \noffer my new substitute bill, which was adopted in the committee, the \nsubstitute was adopted--the amendments were adopted to the bill. So we \nnow have a new bill in terms of the text of the bill. The changes were \nnegotiated. Again, we spent a lot of time talking to staff and Members \nfrom both sides of the aisle, both sides of the committee.\n  Basically what it does is very simple, and it is much simpler than \nwhat we were doing a week ago. It is very simple. What our bill does is \nit gives the FEMA Administrator the authority to waive disaster \nassistance recoupment efforts if three conditions are met. You have to \nmeet all three conditions. First, the disaster assistance must have \nbeen distributed based solely on a FEMA error. So there can be no fault \non the part of the person but solely on a FEMA error. Second, there \ncannot be any fraud or any misrepresentation on the part of the debtor. \nThird, the collection of the debt would be against equity and good \nconscience. And the reason we chose that phrase, ``equity and good \nconscience,'' is not because we made it up but because that is the \nstandard that is in current law. The Department of Defense uses that \nlanguage when they talk about recoupment, the Social Security \nAdministration uses that language, but also OPM has that language in \ntheir law as well. So this is not setting a precedent; this is \nbasically applying other standards, recognized standards in the Federal \nGovernment, to FEMA.\n  The reason this is important is FEMA technically has discretion right \nnow. FEMA can't tell us the statistics because they don't keep the \nstatistics, but basically what we hear over and over from FEMA and \nother folks who are familiar with this process is that they cannot--or \nthey are very reluctant to waive these debts. They feel they have a \nmandate to go recoup this money and collect this money, and that is \nwhat they do.\n  Quite frankly, in some circumstances what they will do is they will \nforce someone to go through this appeal process, they will make a \ndetermination that maybe that person may have $100 a month in \ndisposable income, and they will basically take that $100 a month from \nthat person every month for, say, 5 years.\n  In the case in Arkansas I want to talk about here in just a moment, \nthe people supposedly owe back, according to FEMA, $27,000. So if they \ndid that and they took all of their disposable income--let's just say \nit is $100, and we don't know what it is because we do not know all of \nthe facts. They are in the process of going through the process, but we \ndon't know all of the facts. I am not trying to get in their personal \nfinancial information. But the bottom line is, let's say it is $100 a \nmonth, the disposable income. These folks are on Social Security, so \nyou know it is not going to be a whole lot more than that, if that. But \nfor 5 years, FEMA taxes all of their disposable income. At the end of 5 \nyears, FEMA has collected $6,000 on a $27,000 debt. I mean, are we \nreally getting what we want out of this? Are we trying to squeeze blood \nout of a turnip?\n  I have been working on this legislation for 2 months. All we are \ntrying to do is give FEMA clearly in the statute some discretion to let \nthem make decisions, again, when equity and good conscience would \ndictate that there ought to be a waiver. And it is not that hard.\n  I know that right now in the Congress--and this is a good thing--\npeople are very money-conscious. That is good. We are pinching pennies. \nThat is good. We are trying to recover every Federal dollar we can. \nThat is good. I know the Presiding Officer right now has been leading \nthe charge on that, and that is good, and we applaud her. We are \ncheering for her to continue to do that. We want her to do that. We \nwant that for the government. But one of the things our government \nshould do in dealing with its citizens is consider the equity and \nconsider doing things in good conscience.\n  I want to talk about the situation here in Arkansas. I want to talk \nabout one family who has received one of these letters from FEMA. There \nare not very many. We don't know the exact number, but we know there \nare not very many who will fall under this statute we are trying to \naddress.\n  But in this one family, they are in their seventies. They are on \nSocial Security. They bought or built this home--I am not sure which--\nyears and years ago on the White River near Mountain View. When they \npurchased the home, they bought flood insurance. They knew they were on \na river. They knew it might flood. It is a river, for crying out loud. \nIt is in Arkansas. It rains a lot from time to time. They knew it might \nflood, so they bought flood insurance.\n  Well, after so many years, the flood insurance company said: We are \nnot going to do any more flood insurance. We are not even offering that \nline anymore.\n  They went to Lloyd's of London and they bought flood insurance. They \nwent overseas to buy flood insurance so they would have protection. \nThey carried that for a number of years. Finally, Lloyd's of London \nsaid: We are not doing flood insurance anymore.\n  So then they tried to buy flood insurance through the National Flood \nInsurance Program. They could not do that because the county where they \nreside\n\n[[Page S3150]]\n\nhad not passed an ordinance that FEMA had approved. Now, I don't know \nwhy they had not, haven't gotten into the merits of that, but the \nbottom line is that FEMA knew this county did not pass this ordinance. \nThey knew it. They had to know it because FEMA keeps it all by ZIP \nCode. They keep it all by county. They keep it all by flood zone maps. \nThey knew this. Nonetheless, they show up at her house a day or two \nafter the disaster, they take photos, they give her the paperwork, and \nthey assure this couple--they assure them--that they are entitled to \nthis money, and they walk them through the process. The people did it. \nThey got $27,000 from FEMA in this individual assistance money. Those \npeople took every dime of it and put it back in their home--every dime, \nput it back in their home. They played by the rules from the very \nbeginning to the very end.\n\n  Then, 3 years later--3 years later--FEMA writes them a letter and \nsays: Oh, by the way, we made a mistake. We should have never given you \nthat money in the first place because your county had not passed this \nordinance. So you owe us $27,000. You have 30 days to pay it back or \nyou are going to face penalties and interest.\n  Well, again, this couple is in their seventies. They are on Social \nSecurity. They don't have much else. They have their home. That is \nabout it. This could ruin them financially--probably will ruin them \nfinancially. I do not know how in the world they would ever pay this, \nanywhere close to the $27,000. But nonetheless FEMA says: Look, our \nhands are tied. We have to pursue this. We have to squeeze everything \nwe can get out of these folks.\n  My view is that this was completely FEMA's mistake. That is why I \nopened with the quote that we are supposed to be a government of the \npeople, by the people, and for the people. This doesn't sound as if \nFEMA is acting like that type of government right now. FEMA has caused \nthese people harm. Our government should never harm its own people--\nshould never harm its own people--but that is exactly what they have \ndone here. Because of FEMA's incompetence back 3 years ago, they are \nharming these people.\n  These people, 3 years ago, had they known they were not eligible, had \nthey known they shouldn't apply for this, had they known FEMA shouldn't \nhave given them this money, would have taken a different course. They \nwould have made decisions based on the circumstances they had at the \ntime. Who knows if they can ever pay this money back. Who knows if they \ncan ever borrow any money. Who knows how this is going to work out.\n  I feel as if, if we gave FEMA the discretion in this particular case, \nyou would see a different result; you would see FEMA say: OK, we will \nwaive this entirely, and we are just not going to pursue you because it \nwas all our fault.\n  I think FEMA clearly needs to have discretion in the statute. Again, \nif you look at their regs, look at some of their law, look at their \npractices, they do technically on paper have this discretion, but \napparently they are very reluctant to use it, and their inspector \ngeneral is really pressuring them to collect every dime they can. So \nFEMA feels as if their hands are tied.\n  Let me say a couple more words about this. I have asked the Homeland \nSecurity Committee to allow us to reconsider this in the committee. \nThere was a little bit of an odd circumstance in the committee \nyesterday. We had the votes, but some of the Senators who were there \nand for this either had to leave or were on the way when we voted, and \nwe ended up not having enough to pass it. If everyone was there, we \nwould have passed this. Now we are asking them to reconsider, that we \nbe allowed to bring this back up on the next markup, which I think is \ngoing to be next week. We would like to do that. We think it is a \nmatter of fairness.\n  The reason I am asking this and I am so insistent on this is because \nthis is not limited to my State. I am not just trying to help a few \npeople in the State of Arkansas. I think there are very few in number \nhere in my State. But what is happening around the country is--I saw it \ntoday. There were two stories; I believe one was from Tennessee, one \nwas from Mississippi. The same thing is happening in those States. \nPeople are starting to get these letters from FEMA. What is going to \nhappen is all of my colleagues are going to start coming to the \nHomeland Security Committee, and they are going to say: Do something \nabout this. We have these hardship cases in our State that need to be \naddressed.\n  Trust me on this, this is going to happen for most people in this \nChamber in their home States because FEMA has a backlog of 165,000 of \nthese cases. They have only gone through a little over 5,000 of them to \nsend these back--process these and send these letters out. They have \n165,000. They have done about 5,000, and they have 160,000 to go. You \ncan bet your bottom dollar most Senators in this Chamber will have \npeople in their home States who need a little equity, a little grace, \nand need to have their government stop beating up on them.\n\n  Again, I feel very strongly that, in this particular case, FEMA has \ndone these people harm. They have put them in a very dangerous position \nfinancially. They gave them some money, and now they are trying to jerk \nthe rug out from under them and take it back. I think that is unfair. I \nthink that once these cases--and there will not be many of them; there \nmay be a couple hundred around the country--but once people get into \nthese cases, they are going to want FEMA to clearly have this \ndiscretion. The first numbers we ran--it was only about three-tenths of \n1 percent, but now probably it may be a little higher, but we don't \nknow because FEMA doesn't keep accurate statistics.\n  One last thing on FEMA. I feel like FEMA has fixed this for the \npresent time and going forward. When Director Fugate came in, this is \none of the many cleanups he had to do from the previous FEMA \nadministration. I think they have done that, and they have better \nsystems in place. I think their competence level has gone up in the \nlast couple years. I don't agree with him on everything, but I think he \nhas done a pretty good job. We have asked questions of him before the \ncommittee. He took over an agency that was in distress, and he is \ntrying. Generally, he has done a great job, and he thinks he has fixed \nthis. As far as I know, he has. I think they have their act together \nmuch more than they did back then.\n  My point is, hopefully, we will not see these kinds of cases come \nfrom the flooding we are seeing right now. These are legacy cases from \nthe previous FEMA administration.\n  I thank my colleagues for being aware of this. I ask my colleagues on \nthe Homeland Security Committee to allow us to bring this back up, put \nthis back on the markup, and let's get it out of the committee.\n  One of the great things about Homeland Security is that very seldom \ndo we have party-line votes in that committee. That committee is very \nnonpartisan. The chairman and the ranking member insist on that. When \nwe sit in that committee, we actually sit around the table, Democrat, \nRepublican, Democrat, Republican. It is a great committee to serve on. \nI love being on that committee. I hope my colleagues on the committee \nand also in the Chamber will encourage us to move this through the \ncommittee next week and try to get this done to help a lot of people \naround the country.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise to commend the work of our Navy \noperating off the coast of Somalia.\n  Over the weekend, the USS Stephen W. Groves encountered a pirate \nmothership, a captured Taiwanese fishing vessel, the Jih Chun Tsai. The \npirates aboard exchanged fire with the Stephen W. Groves. Once the \nfirefight ended, a boarding party found that the Taiwanese captain had \nbeen murdered along with three pirates. The crew of\n\n[[Page S3151]]\n\nthe Groves captured 19 surviving pirates, but, unfortunately, by much \nhigher command, was instructed to return them directly to Somalia.\n  I recently visited the Groves, shortly after a previous engagement \nwith the Jih Chun Tsai in April. I, personally, commend CDR Matthew \nRick and his crew aboard the Stephen W. Groves for the work they have \ndone fighting piracy in the Gulf of Aden. Their actions over the \nweekend eliminated the pirate threat of one mothership, but, \nunfortunately, there are many more to take out.\n  Also, on Monday, a helicopter from the USS Bulkeley responded to a \ndistress call from the M/V Artemis Glory, a German-owned crude carrier. \nThe helicopter crew from the Bulkeley saw the pirates firing on the \nmerchant ship and returned fire, sinking the skiff and killing the four \npirates aboard.\n  Also, on Monday, the USS Bainbridge responded to a distress call from \na cargo carrier, the MSC Ayala. After the crew of the Ayala repelled a \npirate attack, the Bainbridge arrived and located the mothership \nresponsible for the attack. The crew made contact with the pirates, who \nultimately agreed to abandon the mothership they had hijacked just 4 \ndays before. Ironically, the skiff the pirates tried to flee in sank, \nand the pirates were rescued by the Bainbridge.\n  I commend the men and women serving on the USS Stephen W. Groves, the \nUSS Bulkeley, and the USS Bainbridge for jobs very well done. My hope \nin the future is that we can have far more robust rules of engagement, \nempowering Commander Rick and his fellow commanders to eliminate the \nthreat of piracy.\n  Of course, this mission would be in the highest traditions of the \nU.S. Navy and in the tradition of the Jefferson administration, which \nso ably handled this threat when it emerged in the early part of the \n19th century. My only hope is that, in the coming administration review \nby Secretary of State Clinton, she adopts a more Jeffersonian policy \nwith regard to this threat, so the sealanes, which control 70 percent \nof the world's supply of oil, and so the ransoms, one-third of which \nare now being paid to terrorists who operate the largest terror \ntraining camps on Earth, can be eliminated.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today to speak about the \nimportance of getting our young people involved in our electoral \nprocess and to highlight a West Virginia school with a standout record \nfor going the extra mile to encourage students to register and \nparticipate in voting.\n  I tell young people all the time: You cannot sit on the sidelines and \nwatch life happen. You have to get in the game and start making the \ncalls. The same can be said about our democracy. If you want results, \nyou have to first become an informed and active voter.\n  Voting is one of the greatest rights the free people of a free nation \npossess. Over the course of our Nation's history, many have fought \ntirelessly to gain voting rights. In fact, it was West Virginia's very \nown Senator Jennings Randolph who relentlessly pushed for the 26th \namendment to our Constitution, ensuring those 18 years of age or older \nhad the right to cast a ballot. It took him almost 30 years to get it \npassed. He started during World War II. It did not pass until 1971.\n  Each vote matters and the individuals casting those votes matter even \nmore. I know that firsthand because I was honored to serve as West \nVirginia's highest elections officer, secretary of state. I served from \n2000 to 2004.\n  During my tenure, we established a program called Saving History and \nReaching Every Student Program, which was known as the SHARES Program \nwhich promoted democracy in West Virginia schools. We registered 42,000 \nhigh school students. In my State, so many of the students, if they are \n17 years of age but they turn 18 on election day of November 4 or \nbefore, can vote in the primary while they are 17. They did not know \nthat. We started promoting it. We had ambassadors. They were all \nworking and trying to get 100 percent of their class eligible to \nparticipate--to register and then vote. Then we rewarded them with a \nschool of excellence. My staff and I traveled the State speaking with \nhigh school seniors, encouraging them to complete a voter registration \nform and to participate in our elections.\n  A decade after that program began, it gives me great pleasure to \nstand on the Senate floor today and recognize a school--one school--\nthat truly takes it to a whole other level with their students. They \ntook it very seriously as far as democracy and their right and their \nresponsibility to participate.\n  Every year for the past decade, the staff and the members of Fayette \nCounty's Meadow Bridge High School, with their outstanding principal, \nhave registered 100 percent of each senior class. This is truly a \nremarkable accomplishment. I am unaware of any other school in our \ngreat State or across this Nation that has produced voter registration \nnumbers such as those for 10 years in a row. Think of it: Every student \nin the senior class of this school for 10 years registered to \nparticipate.\n  The school takes important steps such as explaining the registration \nform, the election process, and the importance of one's vote--all of \nwhich go a long way in opening the minds of young adults and showing \nthem that it is easy to become involved, cast a vote, and make a \ndifference.\n  I have said this to so many young students and the students who come \nand work with us every day: The most valuable thing you will ever own \nin your life is your vote. It belongs to you and nobody else. There is \nonly one--your vote. Nobody can take that away from you.\n  I applaud Meadow Bridge High School's students, faculty, and staff \nfor their commitment to our democracy. I challenge other high schools \nto follow Meadow Bridge's example.\n  Let us work together to encourage our Nation's young adults, even \nmore when it comes to our democracy and national issues. This is not a \npartisan issue, as so many things might be in this body. This is not. \nIt is all of us working together to continue to lead this great \ncountry. It is all of us being Americans and that we should support, \nfor the future of our great Nation, this democracy of ours and the \nfreedom to vote.\n  I am so proud that West Virginia's own Meadow Bridge High School is \nsuch a good example, not only for the State of West Virginia but for \nyoung students all over this Nation.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today to talk about President \nObama's speech today on the support of the Arab spring, at least what \nwe are calling the Arab spring. I believe and hope, as many of my \ncolleagues do, that it is in the best interests of the United States to \nadvance freedom in the Middle East.\n  Supporting free people and democratic governments has always guided \nAmerican foreign policy. Lending our support to people who yearn for \nfreedom is really part of our national DNA. Doing so in a practical and \npragmatic way within the context of regional stability is imperative to \nour own national security.\n  In recent weeks I have been very supportive of the President's \nactions as they related to Osama bin Laden and the decisions that were \nmade there. In recent months I thought the President has been a little \nunsteady in advancing the principles I mentioned earlier. He \ndemonstrated uncertainty in dealing with President Mubarak before \nwithdrawing his support and, if I can say so,\n\n[[Page S3152]]\n\nwithdrawing his support suddenly. After hesitating for several weeks \nand allowing Mr. Qaddafi to regroup, we then authorized U.S. \nparticipation in a NATO air operation with a confusing mission that \ndoes not have the kind of U.S. leadership that it might have benefited \nfrom.\n  Then in Syria we stood on the sidelines for weeks while terrible \nthings happened to profreedom demonstrators before we finally announced \na series of sanctions just this week.\n  Of course, we all recall that in 2009, the Iranian regime possibly \ncould have been unseated by proponents of freedom. At that time the \nPresident and the United States barely lifted a finger to support those \nelements.\n  Indeed, the President's entire narrative has been unclear since he \ntook office, from the time of his Cairo speech in 2009. I think that \nspeech has left our friends in the Arab world both disillusioned and \nconfused.\n  Nobody, from the American people to the Arab street, seems sure of \nwhat our policy is in support of freedom. So I was very interested in \nthe President's speech regarding a new American policy in the region \ntargeted toward rapidly changing situations in the Middle East.\n  The President laid out a plan for an AID program for some Middle \nEastern countries whose internal stability is challenged by recent \nevents. The plan would consist of a combination of grants, of loans, of \ndebt forgiveness, and the President's plan, I believe, has merit and \nthere is value to a robust role for the United States to support \ncertain governments at a critical time.\n  However, it is important that we recognize that any support given to \nthese emerging or existing Arab governments can only be helpful to them \nif they are helpful to themselves. I believe Congress must be a partner \nin the development of this package for it to work. Congress will have \nto ensure that whatever aid is given is both targeted toward an outcome \nthat is in the national security interests of the United States and \ndoes not increase the U.S. deficit. It will be a matter of looking at \nwhere we can find resources to use them in this new and different way.\n  My support for the President's idea will also be contingent on \nseveral principles being met by the government that receives any U.S. \naid. As a member of the Foreign Operations Appropriations Committee I \nam going to be looking for things where the President would certify \nthat the following conditions are being met to proceed further with \nthis plan he outlined today.\n  First, I think the government and its leaders must reject all forms \nof terrorism if they expect to receive this kind of assistance from us.\n  Second, they must demonstrate a credible plan for economic \ndevelopment and poverty reduction. Lack of access to economic \nopportunity has been the driving force behind what has happened in \nthese countries. It was not about us; it was not about Israel; it was \nabout jobs and food and economic opportunity. So that has to be one of \nthe criteria that these governments would be looking at.\n  Third, they need to demonstrate a record of support for the rule of \nlaw, a prerequisite for ensuring that U.S. aid dollars will not be used \nto subvert the system of justice or to veil opponents or undermine \nconstitutional government.\n  Fourth, they must respect minority and religious freedoms, including \nwomen's rights.\n  Fifth, they must have a sustained commitment to democratic reform and \ninstitution building. Nobody believes that democratic societies spring \nup overnight, but recent months remind us that failing to demonstrate \ncommitment to more open systems of government can end in upheaval and \nforce change.\n  Sixth, these governments, if we help them, must respect international \nnorms such as honoring their treaty obligations and respecting \nuniversal human rights.\n  Last, but certainly not least, any government participating in the \naid package like the one the President talked about today must be \ncommitted to regional peace. In particular, that includes peace with \nIsrael. Israel has both the most to gain and the most to lose as new \nattitudes toward freedom and democracy spread throughout the Middle \nEast. Leaders who are tempted to bait their populations with \nantisemitism and then respond to their passions may be even more \ndangerous to Israel than the regimes they are replacing. But an adage \nof international relations is that truly free and democratic societies \nrespect one another's existence, recognize one another's right to \npeace, and resolve their conflicts through peaceful resolution, not \nviolence, not threats, not terror.\n  As nations throughout the Middle East undergo change, we should \nclosely monitor their attitude toward Israel. Only nations that are \nconstructive in their attitudes and policies toward our ally, Israel, \nshould be eligible for the kind of aid the President discussed in his \nspeech.\n  None of these conditions are meant to suggest these governments must \nbe identical or that their leaders must always agree with the United \nStates. I believe, for example, the Kingdom of Jordan currently meets \nthese standards. I am hopeful Egypt's new leaders will commit to these \nprinciples as well. Leaders in the Palestinian Authority should look to \nthem as a model for receiving aid from the United States and other \nwestern governments.\n  The President also addressed the need for a peace settlement between \nthe Israelis and the Palestinians. It would be hard to find anyone in \nthis body who does not agree with that concept. We need peace, the \nIsraelis need peace and the Palestinians need peace. But we need to be \nvery careful that we do not set expectations so high that we create \ndeep challenges not only for that process but also for the kind of \nregional acceptance of Israel that must occur in order to achieve \npeace.\n  In particular, I am concerned that the President believes that \nunilateral concessions by Israel, including redefining its borders, are \na pathway to peace. I simply do not think that makes sense. There does \nnot even appear to be a Palestinian partner capable of making the hard \ndecisions that must occur in order to get an agreement.\n  Do we really think that Hamas, which has recently joined the \ngovernment, is going to be a party to a peace deal with Israel? The \nPalestinian Authority has made real progress on the West Bank in recent \nyears, while Hamas has brought chaos to Gaza.\n  A Palestinian Authority that cannot recognize Israel cannot make \npeace. That is why any financial relationship the United States has \nwith the Palestinian Authority needs to be based on the principles I \njust described.\n  In his famous Westminster speech in 1982, President Reagan told the \nworld the following:\n\n       While we must be cautious about forcing the pace of change, \n     we must not hesitate to declare our ultimate objectives and \n     to take concrete actions to move toward them. We must be \n     staunch in our conviction that freedom is not the sole \n     prerogative of a lucky few, but the inalienable and universal \n     right of all human beings.\n\n  I believe those words are no less true today, 30 years later, than \nthey were then. We are at an extremely important moment as we watch a \nmovement toward freedom unprecedented in the history of the Arab world \nunfold. It is important to note that those taking to the streets are \nnot burning American flags or shouting anti-Western slogans. It is also \nprobably important to note that they are not waving American flags. It \nis simply not about us; it is about them.\n  Their passions are driven by generations of economic stagnation and a \nlack of political and economic freedom that has left them behind much \nof the free world's prosperity. These freedoms are exactly what the \nUnited States stands for. America's role is to support responsible \nleaders committed to peace and sustainable democratic change. I am \nhopeful the President will work with my colleagues in the Congress to \nextend a helping hand to those leaders who are truly committed to these \nvalues. If he does, I hope to be part of that process as well.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S3153]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/19/senate-section/article/S3153-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3153-S3160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     FOR-PROFIT EDUCATION COMPANIES\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, over the past 6 months, I have come to the \nfloor several times to discuss the findings of an ongoing investigation \nby the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee into the for-\nprofit education sector, and the growing role they play in higher \neducation. This investigation has been now ongoing for over a year.\n  Today, I want to focus my remarks on our men and women in uniform and \nhow the for-profit schools are focusing on recruiting them to their \nschools, and what this means for the taxpayers of America.\n  The first GI bill made it possible for many of the servicemembers \nreturning from World War II to go to college and get ahead in life. In \nthe process, that ushered in a new era of American prosperity. That GI \nbill continued, of course, with Korea, through the Cold War, and \nthrough Vietnam. I myself used the GI bill after my service time so I \ncould go to law school.\n  Over the decades, we have built on that success by extending Federal \nfinancial aid to active-duty members of our Armed Forces, and indeed to \nall Americans who seek to build a better life through higher education. \nOn the whole, this has proved to be one of the Federal Government's \nsmartest investments--an investment in human capital that has produced \nhuge dividends for our Nation. We in Congress have been eager to ensure \nthat this new generation of veterans returning from Iraq and \nAfghanistan--those who sacrificed so much for our country--are getting \nthe education benefits they earned and the quality of education they \ndeserve.\n  Led by Senator Webb and others, we have enacted new laws and expanded \nexisting programs to provide generous new educational benefits to \nveterans, to active-duty servicemembers, and to their families. This is \na historic achievement, and I am sure all of us were proud to support \nit.\n  Implemented in August of 2009, the post-9/11 GI bill provides that \nveterans who serve 90 days or more on active-duty effort, after \nSeptember 10, 2001, are eligible for up to 36 months of educational \nbenefits; and for the first time ever in history, veterans can transfer \nthese benefits to a spouse or to a child. Over the last decade, the \nDepartment of Defense has also expanded aid available to active-duty \nsoldiers, sailors, and airmen through its tuition assistance program. \nThis program will pay up to a maximum of $4,500 a year toward a \nservicemember's classes.\n  Also in 2009, Congress created the military spouse career advancement \naccount, designed to expand employment and career opportunities for \nactive-duty spouses, and that provides for a grant of $4,000 over a 3-\nyear period of time.\n  When the Congress acted to give new and better benefits to veterans \nand active-duty members and their families, we fully expected that for-\nprofit schools might have an important role to play in providing higher \neducation. Obviously, they are flexible, and some of the primary work \ndone is suited to veterans and active-duty soldiers and students \njuggling work and family obligations.\n  During my time in the military, of course, we had the University of \nMaryland, which still obviously provides a lot of online work. At that \ntime, it was called ``distance learning,'' and you did it by mail. The \nUniversity of Maryland provided a lot of educational benefits for many \nyears to active-duty personnel serving in far-flung places around the \nworld. Of course, that was not a for-profit school; that was a \nnonprofit school.\n  Unfortunately, when we enacted this whole new benefits package for \nservicemembers and veterans and their families, we didn't anticipate \nwhat would happen by opening up a new stream of funding to the for-\nprofit schools. We didn't foresee that the for-profit sector, which is \neager to please Wall Street investors, would go after student funding \naggressively, in ways not in the best interests of veterans and \nservicemembers. We didn't recognize that by allowing servicemembers to \ncombine, transfer, and borrow against these various Federal benefit \npackages we were giving for-profit schools an opening to enroll \nservicemembers, veterans, and family members in very expensive \neducational programs.\n  My committee's investigation over the past year has revealed an \nindustry dominated by the very same Wall Street companies and equity \ninvestors who brought about the subprime mortgage crisis. These \ninvestors are focused on rapid growth and quick profits. In relatively \nshort order, for-profit colleges and universities have succeeded in \nenrolling 10 percent of the students and claiming fully 25 percent of \nthe Federal financial aid budget, including $7 billion a year in Pell \ngrants. So the for-profit sector has 10 percent of all of the students \nin the country and gets 25 percent of all Federal financial aid.\n  Many of these companies generate big profits, and there is a big \nproblem. The committee has compiled data for 30 companies that own for-\nprofit schools, including the 15 largest publicly traded ones, showing \nthat more than half of the students these institutions enroll drop out \nwithin the first year. Two-thirds of the students who are there for a \n2-year program drop out in the first year. Some of the worst performing \ninstitutions have been the most aggressive to enroll servicemembers and \nveterans.\n  Because profitability and the for-profit education industry is driven \nby enrollment growth, my committee's investigation has focused largely \non the extraordinarily aggressive marketing and recruitment practices \nat these schools. Building on the findings of last year's undercover \ninvestigation by the GAO, which found abusive recruitment practices at \neach of 15 campuses visited, we have uncovered additional evidence that \nmisleading and deceptive recruiting tactics are not the exception but \nthe norm.\n  Several months ago, on the floor of the Senate, I spoke about \ndocuments uncovered in my investigation. Those documents instruct \nrecruiters in tactics designed to manipulate and emotionally exploit \npotential students in order to convince them to enroll. As I will \ndemonstrate later in my speech they are going after the military by \nexploiting fear, uncertainty, and doubt.\n  We should be concerned that Congress may have unintentionally created \nan opening for the current generation of veterans and active-duty \nservicemembers to be victimized by these abuses simply because of their \neligibility for expanded Federal aid that we enacted in the Congress.\n  My committee found evidence that large for-profit schools are \naggressively recruiting active-duty servicemembers and veterans \nexpressly because of their generous educational benefits packages. It \nis not just that these military benefits provide a new revenue stream \nfor the companies. The point is that it is an especially valuable kind \nof revenue stream for these companies--more valuable than even going \nafter nonveterans and non-GIs. Why is that?\n  Well, military money helps these for-profit schools to meet a key \nstatutory requirement that no more than 90 percent of their revenue can \ncome from Federal financial programs. That is in the law. No more than \n90 percent of the income coming into a for-profit school can be from \nFederal financial programs. If a school is getting close to that 90 \npercent, guess what they do. They go after military people. Why is \nthat? Because a military person, active duty or veteran, enrolled in a \nfor-profit school doesn't count towards the 90 percent; it counts \ntowards the 10 percent. So the school could actually have--and there \nare some--92 or 94 percent of all their money coming from Federal \nfinancial programs, even though the law says you can only get 90 \npercent, because military doesn't count. So you can see why, when close \nto 90 percent, they would want to go after the military. And that is \nexactly what is happening.\n  With their eyes on this 90/10 ratio, the for-profit schools have \nmoved aggressively to exploit this opportunity. They have created \nmarketing plans and a sales force specifically designed to target and \nenroll as many veterans, servicemembers, and family members as \npossible. Schools spend billions on sophisticated marketing campaigns \nand large sales teams to get those students in the door. Documents \nobtained by the HELP Committee paint a picture of an industry with a \nlaser-like focus on enrolling military students.\n  For example, I have a 56-page document from Kaplan. This lays out \ntheir strategy for recruiting military students. If you go through it, \nyou will see\n\n[[Page S3154]]\n\ntheir objective. As I said, they have a laser-like focus on enrolling \nmilitary students.\n  Objective No. 1:\n\n       Grow our military enrollments to 9,000 per year by 2011.\n\n  At the time, Kaplan signed up about 2,200 military students each \nyear. They were aiming at more than a four-fold increase in the \nmilitary. The document goes on to lay out the marketing and sales plan \nfor achieving this enormous growth. This is in this document:\n\n       Drive awareness via print advertising in key military \n     publications and targeting key military installations.\n\n  To do this, the document suggests that Kaplan plans to spend $30 \nmillion over 3 years for new military-specific recruiting staff, \nadvertising, and public relations--just on the military.\n  In a later brainstorming exchange between Kaplan executives, the No. \n1 item on the list of initiatives to deal with Kaplan's 90/10 because \nthey were getting close to that 90 percent was:\n\n       Accelerate military billings/collections. Go to DC and pick \n     up the check if you have to.\n\n  Go get that military money so we do not go over that 90-percent \nlimit.\n  At Education Management Corporation--another for-profit school--the \nstory is similar. Let me quote from a 2010 memorandum prepared by a \nconsultant to the CEO of EDMC, Education Management Corporation. The \nmemo begins:\n\n       Thanks for the call outlining the interest of EDMC in \n     learning more about potential areas of funding that could add \n     revenue that would also address the 90/10 issue.\n\n  No. 1 on the list says:\n\n       Probably one of the most important potential short and \n     long-term targets for EDMC are the 800,000-plus military \n     spouses who have been authorized--\n\n  And this is in italics--\n\n     for the first time in history, for a one-time entitlement of \n     up to $6,000 . . . An aggressive effort to reach these \n     spouses at the military bases with various career fairs, \n     direct communications, and visibility with the Office of \n     Military Families in Washington would be very important.\n\n  A subsequent e-mail message between EDMC's executives recommends that \nthe company should be ``leveraging military spouse benefits to the \nfullest extent possible'' in order to overcome the 90/10 regulation.\n  Executives of for-profit schools are candid about the value of \nmilitary students in trying to ease investors' concerns about \nregulatory compliance. The CEO of Bridgepoint Education told investors:\n\n       Our military enrollment grew from 1 percent in 2007 to 17 \n     percent at the end of September 2009.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       We believe that when we are able to report our 90/10 for \n     2009 that it should decrease due to our penetration in \n     particular into the military market.\n\n  We know these for-profit schools, in their own words, are \naggressively pursuing military personnel and their families. How are \nthey enticing them to enroll? A Kaplan training manual entitled \n``Military Learning Modules'' tells recruiters how to utilize fear, \nuncertainty, and doubt in the sales process with regard to competitors' \noffers and teaches them to overcome objections that potential students \nmay raise in signing an enrollment agreement.\n  This is the one from Kaplan:\n\n       Fear, uncertainty, doubt. This technique was originally \n     created within the computer hardware industry and uses these \n     emotions to attempt to influence perceptions or beliefs. The \n     technique is especially effective when prospects introduce \n     the ``need'' to examine other online schools.\n\n  In other words, a Kaplan recruiter calls up a veteran or a military \nperson on Active Duty and wants to get them to enroll. If that person \nsays: I have seen some ads for Phoenix, I have seen ads for ITT and \nothers, maybe I will look them up, they want to use fear, uncertainty, \nand doubt when prospects introduce the need to examine other online \nschools.\n  Statements such as the following:\n\n     instill fear, uncertainty and doubt regarding the features of \n     competitors' programs.\n\n  It is one thing if you are selling a keyboard or hard drive. That is \none thing. But when you are doing it to enroll a young man or woman \nwhose family may never have gone to college--they enlisted in the \nmilitary out of a patriotic sense of duty; they have had no college \nexperience whatsoever; maybe they did not do all that well in high \nschool, but now they are thinking about what they are going to do, and \nthey get hit with this. And I find really objectionable when these for-\nprofit schools exploit fear, uncertainty, and doubt in our young \nmilitary people.\n  I will have more to say about how onerous it is when they do this to \nget them to sign up with their school, to get students take taxpayers' \nmoney and turn it over to the school, only to find out they do not have \nany support, nothing to help them, and they drop out within a year. \nThey have debt. They went through all their military benefits, which \nthey can never get back, and the for-profit schools have the money.\n  A military recruiter at Colorado Technical University--another for-\nprofit school--owned by the publicly traded Career Education \nCorporation, told the New York Times:\n\n       There is such pressure to simply enroll more vets--we knew \n     that most of them would drop out after the first session . . \n     . Instead of helping people, too often I felt like we were \n     almost tricking them.\n\n  Robert Songer, the coordinator of all education programs for \nservicemembers at Camp Lejeune Marine Corps Base in North Carolina, \nexpressed his reservations to the Bloomberg news service.\n\n       Some of these schools prey on Marines . . . Day and night, \n     they call you, they e-mail you. These servicemen get caught \n     in that. Nobody in their families ever went to college. They \n     don't know about college.\n\n  These recruiting tactics are nothing short of disgraceful. When \nstudents are enrolled through deception or fear, not only are they \nbeing tricked, they are also more likely to be unprepared for the \nchallenges of college. These strong-arm, emotionally abusive tactics \nare indicative of schools that see students strictly as a means to an \nend of higher profits. They appear to have little or no interest in \nproviding students the academic help and support they need to succeed. \nThe end result is that servicemembers, veterans, and their spouses end \nup enrolling in high-cost programs, dropping out in staggering numbers, \noften winding up with a mountain of student debt. This often happens \ndespite the availability of similar or better quality programs in the \npublic and nonprofit sectors of higher education.\n  The tactics have certainly paid off for the company's bottom line. I \nreleased a report last December documenting the absolutely tremendous \nincrease in the amount of money these companies are receiving from \nmilitary education programs. Building on the already substantial growth \nin revenues generated from the traditional financial aid programs--\nwhich went, by the way, from $14 billion in 2005 to $29 billion in \n2009--the relentless focus for-profits have brought to military \nrecruiting has yielded an astonishing growth in the funds they get both \nfrom the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs. \nAgain, keep in mind we are talking about two entities: Active-Duty \npersonnel and veterans.\n  As the new post-9/11 GI bill was implemented, 18 large for-profit \noperators pushed their intake of VA dollars from $26 million in 2006 to \nan astonishing $286 million in 2010. This is what happened. This chart \nillustrates what happened in VA. Here we are at $26 million in 2006; \n$25 million in 2007; $27.6 million in 2008; and in 2009, when we passed \nthe bill, it goes up to $55 million. Look what happened in 1 year, \n2009, $55 million up to $285.8 million in 1 year. That is the amount of \nmoney they took in. That is just the Veterans Affairs funds.\n  The same companies increased their collection of Department of \nDefense benefits by 337 percent--$40 million in 2006 to $175 million in \n2010. Again, this is for Active Duty. We see the steady increase all \nthe way into 2010--$40 million in 2006 to $175 million in 2010.\n  This did not just happen; it happened because the for-profit \ncompanies decided they were going to go after the military because they \nwere getting close to their 90-percent threshold. Keep in mind, these \ndollars do not count towards the 90-percent, so they can keep under the \nthreshold by getting more military students.\n  Let's be clear. These exorbitant amounts of Federal dollars are not \ngoing to small, family-owned institutions. They are going to some of \nthe largest Wall Street-owned companies. Out of the $640 million in \npost-9/11 GI benefits that flowed to for-profit schools just in 2009 \nand 2010--that is $\\1/2\\ billion; $640 million, $\\1/2\\ billion in 1\n\n[[Page S3155]]\n\nyear--$439 million went to the 15 publicly traded companies. This \namount is equal to 69 percent of the military money going to for-profit \nschools and 25 percent of all post-9/11 GI bill benefits.\n  Let me repeat that. Let's just say this: 25 percent--one-fourth--of \nall of the GI bill benefits post-9/11 went to 15 publicly traded \ncompanies. It would be one thing if the for-profit schools were using \nthis for educational expenses, but unfortunately the lion's share of \nthat money--taxpayers' dollars--went into profits, marketing, and--\nguess what--Wall Street executive salaries and bonuses.\n  What are we getting in return for this enormous investment of \ntaxpayers' dollars? We are getting a lot of questions.\n  We know student outcomes for the general population at for-profit \nschools are pretty dismal. On average, 55 percent of students who \nattend these schools drop out within a year, and there is no evidence \nthat military students are faring better. Eight of the ten top \nrecipients of VA dollars see more than half of the associate degree \nstudents they enroll drop out within the year, and five of the schools \nsee more than a 60-percent drop.\n  This is what our investigation revealed. Here are the 10 schools \nreceiving the most Department of Veterans Affairs funds. You see ITT, \nand they got the most--$79.2 million, and that is a 1-year amount. Of \nthose who enrolled for a 4-year degree program, 44 percent withdrew; of \nthose who signed up for a 2-year program, 53 percent withdrew. We look \ndown here to Kaplan, and they got $17.3 million. On their bachelor's \ndegree, 68.2 percent withdrew--69 percent of the 2-year students \nwithdrew in the first year.\n  Here is with what is startling. That is bad enough as it is, but our \ninvestigation showed that neither the Department of Defense nor the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs has any method to assess what is \nhappening to these students. The money flows out, and neither the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs nor the Department of Defense has any \nway to assess whether they are getting a good education.\n  I might also add, Senator Carper has looked into this in his \nsubcommittee. He has looked into this, and we have discussed the \npossibility of working on something to get the Department of Defense to \nstart taking better care of their Active-Duty personnel and the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs to take better care of veterans. We need \nto have better assessment of what is happening to these students, how \nmuch debt they are accumulating, and what is happening to their \neducation.\n  We are basically handing over huge and growing sums of military money \nto for-profit schools without any ability to assess whether these \nschools are giving our Active-Duty members or veterans the kind of a \nquality education they deserve.\n  The complaints I have gathered in the course of our investigation \npoint to a deeply disturbing willingness on the part of for-profit \nschools to exploit veterans. I repeat, our investigation shows clearly \nthat a number of these for-profit schools are out to exploit veterans. \nI received this letter from a veteran who attended ITT Technical \nInstitute, the greatest recipient of VA funds. Here is what he said:\n\n       Unlike other institutions I reached out to, as soon as I \n     expressed interest in ITT Tech, they began to actively and \n     aggressively pursue me. Minutes after I filled out an online \n     form, a recruiter called me. He then called every day, \n     telling me it was urgent for me to enroll.\n\n  The letter writer notes that due to the high cost of tuition, he had \nto take out loans. But he writes:\n\n       The expensive tuition did not seem to go toward a quality \n     education.\n\n  He concludes with this:\n\n       Within 2 months of leaving ITT Tech, they sent me a bill \n     for $2,000 and a transcript that showed clear signs that it \n     was altered in a way to specifically make my positive balance \n     disappear and create a negative balance.\n\n  This letter writer ends with these chilling words:\n\n       I regret attending ITT Tech. The institution provided at \n     best an absolute minimum education and left me with nearly \n     insurmountable debt.\n\n  This is a veteran.\n  Here is another veteran who attended Bridgepoint Education Inc.'s \nAshford University who wrote the following:\n\n       I was extremely disappointed, confused and angry. I felt I \n     had been misled, deceived or even outright lied to in an \n     effort to gain my contractual agreement.\n\n  He was repeatedly assured by Bridgepoint recruiters that his post-\n9/11 GI bill benefits would cover the entire cost of his degree, only \nto find out after he was enrolled that he would owe close to $11,000.\n  Another student, this one at the University of Phoenix, sent this \nletter to the Arizona attorney general after trying to resolve his \ncomplaint with the school:\n\n       I have been a police officer for over 20 years. I am also \n     an Iraq war veteran. I believe that the University of Phoenix \n     is using deceptive practices in order to lure students into \n     the school. The enrollment counselors tell students that they \n     should be complete with their course of study in a short \n     period of time fully knowing exactly how long it is going to \n     take. The enrollment counselors eventually tell the student \n     it is going to take a lot longer to finish their program but \n     not until the student has committed all of his financial aid \n     and invested so much money that it would be senseless to \n     leave and waste his invested time and money.\n\n  A letter to the attorney general of Arizona.\n  What are the consequences for a student who enrolls at one of these \nschools but is not satisfied with their experience? The post-9/11 GI \nBill benefit package can be depleted rapidly. If benefits are used up \nwithout completing a program or for credits that can't be transferred, \nthe benefits cannot be recovered. In fact, because of the high tuition, \nmany students, have to apply for additional grants or loans to pay for \nschool. That means many veterans are pressured into signing up for one \nof these for-profit schools, told they have free money to pay for their \ntuition and then, all of a sudden, they find that is not quite enough \nmoney. Now they have to apply for a loan. They get a loan, they drop \nout within 1 year or so, the schools keep the money--some of it grant \nmoney, some of it loan money--and the GI or the military person is left \nwith debt and no diploma.\n  Here is a letter addressed to the Ohio for-profit school regulator \nthat just tears your heart out. This is from a mother:\n\n       Normally, a 26-year-old man doesn't need his mom advocating \n     for him. But this is anything but a normal situation. I \n     expected my son to be changed by his tour of duty in Iraq. \n     But I could not have been prepared for the reality of those \n     changes. My son struggles on a daily basis with symptoms from \n     PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) and TBI (traumatic \n     brain injury). He suffers from bouts of depression, anxiety, \n     headaches, nightmares, vision problems, mental confusion, \n     insomnia, and many other symptoms. You have to pretty much \n     ``bottom-line'' your conversations with him. He can't \n     mentally process a lot of details. If you continue with your \n     details, he is done with the conversation, unless you can \n     return to a quick ``bottom-line.''\n\n  The mother goes on:\n\n       It is my belief that the ITT Representative may have \n     quickly figured this out and taken advantage of the \n     opportunity. I remember when he called from ITT because I was \n     on my way out to an important occasion. He said the \n     Representative told him he needed a co-signer just so he \n     could start school immediately, but not to worry about it, \n     because the military was going to pay for everything, even \n     give him money to live on and pay his expenses. He sounded so \n     hopeful, something I hadn't heard from him since before the \n     war. It was really hard for him to admit he couldn't continue \n     going to school. He said he just couldn't retain the \n     material. It became too stressful for him to continue. My son \n     is a proud, young man. He is not looking for pity or charity. \n     He is embarrassed that he believed what he was told by the \n     ITT Rep. He could hardly come around me when he found out \n     that Sallie Mae was calling me for payment of his loan. \n     Veterans with PTSD commonly isolate themselves from family \n     and friends. This made it even worse. As a mother and a human \n     being, I am outraged this kind of predatory lending tactic is \n     used on anyone, but especially on an American soldier who \n     gave everything he had and almost lost his life many times, \n     and who continues to suffer. I will pursue this, on my son's \n     behalf, until someone listens and forgives these loans. Thank \n     you all for all of your effort, it is very much appreciated.\n\n  This situation is unacceptable. It is unacceptable that Active-Duty \nmilitary personnel and veterans using their hard-earned benefits are \nbecoming victims of these kind of high-pressure tactics of the for-\nprofit schools--enticing them to enroll, taking their money, causing \nthem to go even further into debt, and then not giving them any support \nwhatsoever.\n  As I said before, the agencies distributing this money do not \ninvestigate or\n\n[[Page S3156]]\n\nact on the reported abuses of for-profit schools. They just don't. \nEarlier this month, the GAO released a report concluding that the VA \nstill faces numerous challenges in implementing a program to start to \nbegin interventions. Many for-profit schools have succeeded in building \na highly profitable business structure while failing to provide the \nstudent services, a learning environment, and career services that \nwould enable their students to graduate and succeed.\n  The Federal Government must be vigilant to ensure that poor \nperforming for-profit schools with huge dropout and student default \nrates are not allowed to continue to receive billions of dollars in \nFederal taxpayer money every year. We owe this to taxpayers, but we \nalso owe this to the men and women who served and sacrificed for our \nNation in uniform. That is why I wanted to take the time on the floor \ntoday to point out this new and disturbing finding of our committee, \nhow much these schools are targeting military personnel, how they are \nusing high-pressure tactics to get them to enroll because they know \nthey can get the money to help keep them below the 90-percent \nthreshold.\n\n  It is shameful that these for-profit schools are allowed to get by \nwith this. They continue it today. They continue reaping huge profits, \npaying their CEOs and their executives enormous amounts of money. Yet \nour men and women in uniform, our GIs, who are taken in are not \nprovided any help or support but now are saddled with a lot of debt or \nhave used up their GI bill benefits. Maybe now they want to go to a \ncommunity college, somewhere to really get a good education, and they \nfind out they cannot get any more GI bill money. They are done. They \ngave it all to one of these for-profit schools.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent to have the documents I referred \nto printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am delighted to yield to my friend from Illinois, who \nhas been a strong fighter for students and also, I would say, over the \nlast several years has focused a lot of attention on these abuses of \nthe for-profit schools.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n       Excerpts from KHE 267362 Kaplan Military University Agenda \n     Objectives Our Military Value Proposition The Pricing Pilot \n     The phases of the military strategy plan Field team \n     deployment Staffing Plan Appendix A.

In mid October we ([High-level Executive], \n     [High-level Executive] and I) projected our 90:10 at year end \n     based on current run rates to be 89.6%. We shared our \n     analysis and actions plans with [High-level Executive], \n     [High-level Executive] and [High-level Executive] and the \n     decision was made to switch SES from an automatic submission \n     process to a manual process.

Although \n     we have implemented a number of initial steps that will help \n     us increase our cash intake in the future, we have a larger \n     list of additional initiatives that we are continuing to move \n     forward and I could walk you through those at your \n     convenience. In response to your suggestions we have added \n     comments below: Accelerate military billings / collection at \n     KU. We have streamlined our internal process on timely \n     billings for our military students. The population of \n     military folks that are awaiting TA vouchers is approximately \n     $400K.

Accelerate military billings / collection at KU. \n     Go to D.C. and pick up the check if you have to.\n       Excerpts from EDMC916000228224 Memorandum Confidential TO: \n     [Director] FROM: [Outside Consultant] DATE: July 8, 2010 \n     SUBJECT: Possible Opportunities for EDMC ``90:10'' Thanks for \n     the call outlining the interest of EDMC in learning more \n     about potential areas of funding that could add students and \n     revenue that would also address the ``90:10'' issue. In light \n     of that dual set of interests, let us briefly review the \n     opportunities we see among recurring sources of government \n     funding, plus some other prospects to consider. THE FEDERAL \n     GOVERNMENT There are a number of emerging opportunities that \n     may present short, medium, and longerterm opportunities that \n     should also be carefully considered, given their size and \n     scale. The Military 1. Military Spouses. Probably one of the \n     most important potential short and longterm targets for \n     EDMC are the 800,000 plus military spouses who have been \n     authorized, for the first time in history, for a onetime \n     entitlement of up to $6,000 that can be used for training, \n     as well as for counseling and other ways to assist them in \n     finding work. We are told by the DOD that the largest \n     demand among the spouses is for healthcare related \n     training, although it can also cover almost all other \n     occupational areas. The Department of Defense has also \n     informed military personnel and their spouses that under \n     the most recent G.I. Bill, they can authorize up to 50 \n     percent of his/her education benefits for the spouse to \n     continue their education. Therefore, in theory, every \n     spouse has access to two separate sources of funding. As \n     you probably know, military spouses are a particularly \n     attractive group of prospective students. Nearly twothirds \n     have at least some college education. The average age is \n     36, they have strong support systems with the military \n     bases and operations and, of course, they tend to be very \n     stable. The big issue that is driving these new training \n     funds is that\n\n[[Page S3157]]\n\n     when the military do their surveys, the primary reason \n     people give for leaving the military is that their \n     ``spouse is not happy.'' When the military spouses are \n     surveyed, they say the reason they are not happy is that \n     they cannot find a job or, more often, they cannot find a \n     good job for which they believe they are qualified with \n     their background and experience. This is the reason for \n     the focus on providing training and other forms of \n     assistance: so that they can get better jobs and, in turn, \n     encourage their spouses to stay in the military. The ``My \n     CAA'' (My Career Advancement Account) program for the \n     $6,000 entitlement for all 800,000 spouses, however, has \n     been thoroughly bungled. The entire webbased system for \n     enrollment literally collapsed in January. Therefore, the \n     DOD is not authorizing any new CAAs at the moment, and \n     they have spent months trying to restore the system. At \n     least 100,000 military spouses had gained eligibility when \n     the system ``crashed.'' Those are approved for their \n     training. Once My CAA gets up and running, one can safely \n     assume an enormous demand will follow, given all the \n     interest that has been shown by the spouses. EDMC was \n     provided information on becoming a ``Military Spouse \n     Friendly School'' in the past. We would strongly encourage \n     this to be a first step since that is the first stop the \n     spouses see on their websites. No doubt, EDMC is already \n     benefiting from some of this, but an aggressive effort to \n     reach the spouses at the military bases with various \n     career fairs, direct communications, and visibility with \n     the Office of Military Families in Washington would be \n     very important. 2. Enlisted Personnel. Of course, there is \n     the longstanding tuition and other support for most \n     members of the military as an entitlement. 3. Veterans \n     also have a variety of tuition and other benefits, plus \n     preferred eligibility for almost all other Federal \n     programs.\n       Excerpts from EDMC916000228222 From: [High-level \n     Executive]: Friday, July 30, 2010 9:22:51 PM To: [High-level \n     Executive] Subject: FW: Possible Opportunities for EDMC \n     ``90:10'' Attachments: [High-level Executive] 0708 re \n     Opportunties.doc Hi I attended the call yesterday with \n     [Director] [High-level Executive] and [High-level Executive] \n     (Strategic Partnerships). The call as expected was to review \n     the areas that had been highlighted on the report as \n     potential opportunities for 90/10 impacting funding sources. \n     The outcome of the call was a followup call with [High-level \n     Executive] and [High-level Executive] on opportunities on \n     the local Workforce Boards and I took the action item for \n     a followup discussion on ensuring we are leveraging the \n     military spouse benefits to the fullest extent possible.

For example, the prospect says she \n     is worried about her financial position. The advisor might \n     ask, ``Do you think in a few years, when you decide you want \n     to pursue an education, you will be in a better or worse \n     financial position?'' TRANSITION STATEMENT Confirm your \n     understanding of what the student has told you. ``So if I \n     understand you correctly . . .'' or ``Let me summarize what \n     I've heard.'' TIE IN THE SOLUTION How the Solution Fits \n     Listen for specific information about the prospective \n     student's dissatisfaction with life as it is now, and tailor \n     solutions specifically for him or her.

The features and \n     advantages of individual schools can often look alike. The \n     key is the value. The advisor must address the benefit each \n     feature brings to the students. Not every feature has a \n     benefit for every student. When showing benefits, choose the \n     features that are meaningful and relevant. Presenting \n     benefits paves the way to what the solution offers. INITIATE \n     AND EXPLAIN THE PROCESS It is at the point in the ACTION \n     sales model where the advisor closes the sale. An \n     effective closer pays attention to buying signals, trial \n     closes, outlines next steps and moves toward gaining \n     commitment. OVERCOME OBJECTIONS An objection is generally \n     a reason or argument presented in opposition or a feeling \n     or expression of disapproval. People usually object when \n     they encounter: A misunderstanding Incorrect information \n     Lack of information Fear or doubt Something which is \n     keeping them from making a commitment to move forward. The \n     Admission Advisor's role is to help prospective students \n     overcome objections when making the decision to achieve \n     their educational goals. Types of Objections As a general \n     rule, objections fall under one of five categories: TIME I \n     don't have time in my life to fit school into it. MONEY I \n     can't afford the deposit, much less the tuition. SUPPORT \n     My friends and family don't think I need to go back to \n     school. COMPETITION XXX school is cheaper, faster, easier. \n     FEAR I doubt that I'd be able to succeed\n       Expect Objections Objection management is an integral part \n     of the advisor's job. Objections may happen during every step \n     of the admissions process. Advisors encounter objections of \n     varying kinds. Successful advisors are able to approach \n     objections systematically. Overcome Objections with \n     Fundamental Skills Listen Actively--to the student's \n     objections and concerns. Interpret the Objection Repeat \n     objection, then empathize. ``I understand your concern about \n     finding 20 hours a week to study.'' Solve Together Jointly \n     find a solution. Ask probing questions to divulge the true \n     nature of the person's objection. ``How do you spend your \n     time?'' ``Can you walk me through a typical day?'' ``What are \n     you willing to sacrifice to fulfill you dream? Get the \n     student involved in overcoming his own objection. Establish \n     Buy in Gain the student's commitment. Ask reaffirming \n     questions. ``Which of these solutions would work best for \n     you?'' ``Do you feel more comfortable now?'' Move person \n     forward. ``Great, let's move on to the next step.'' Don't \n     hesitate! Next Step Lead student to the next step with \n     confidence.\n       Excerpts from ITT00007708 Dear This letter is in response \n     to the concern you filed regarding ITT Technical Institute \n     (``ITT''). In your complaint, you voiced concern over your \n     financial obligation and in particular the Montgomery GI Bill \n     funding you thought you would be receiving. The Board \n     initiated an investigation into this matter and reviewed all \n     of the financial documents involved in your enrollment. In \n     response to the Board's request for information, ITT \n     submitted the attached response to the concerns you raised. \n     The documentation submitted by ITT shows that you completed \n     one term with the school and withdrew late in the second \n     term. When a student withdrawals from school, the school is \n     required to calculate a tuition refund in accordance with \n     Ohio Revised Code Sec. 3332110 and the school may also be \n     required to calculate a refund of federal loan money in \n     accordance with applicable federal regulations. According to \n     the refund calculations, your total financial obligation to \n     the school for those two terms equaled $10,709.68. This \n     tuition charge was financed through two loans for your \n     education, one for $5,760.80 and one for $4,417.00. In \n     addition to the loans that were used to pay your tuition \n     costs, it appears that between March 2007 and July 2007, you \n     received a total of six payments for veteran's education \n     benefits in accordance with the Montgomery GI Bill to \n     subsidize your tuition costs, totaling $6,808.33. For \n     students who receive Montgomery GI Bill funding, It is \n     standard procedure for a school to set up loans or other \n     funding mechanisms for a student before they begin \n     classes. This is due to the fact that the GI Bill funds \n     are dispersed directly to the student after the student \n     has already begun classes. The school cannot control \n     whether the student uses that money to reduce their \n     student loan obligations or whether it is used for other \n     purposes. As such the loans that you applied for while you \n     were enrolled at ITT were properly attributed to your \n     tuition charges and it was within your discretion to use \n     your GI Bill funds to reduce your loan obligations. There \n     is no evidence that ITT is in violation of any law or rule \n     under the jurisdiction of this Board. Finally, I would \n     also note that ITT has served 155 veterans during the last \n     two years and during a visit to the school in December, \n     the State Approving Agency for Veterans Training conducted \n     a review of the ITT's administration of veteran's benefit \n     and nothing out of the ordinary was noted. ITT has offered \n     to meet with you and your mother and assist you in \n     exploring any deferment or forbearance options you may \n     have with your lenders. If you wish to accept their offer, \n     you may contact [Campus Director], School Director, to set \n     up an appointment. Sincerely,\n       Excerpts from ITT00007722 I am writing in response to your \n     August 4, 2008 correspondence. I appreciate you bringing your \n     concerns related to your enrollment at our campus to my \n     attention. I am sorry to hear of your difficulties following \n     your service in our nation's military. However, after \n     reviewing the available information, the facts do not \n     substantiate the refund or waiver of the tuition and fees \n     related to your enrollment in the Information Technology \n     Computer Network Systems program. In your letter,\n\n[[Page S3158]]\n\n     you claim you were told that the military would pay for your \n     schooling. This statement cannot be substantiated. While our \n     institution assists students in seeking financial aid for \n     which he or she may qualify, we do not represent to a student \n     that he or she will have their education paid for by a \n     particular entity. The Catalog you received at the time you \n     enrolled at our campus outlined this further. Specifically, \n     the Financial Assistance section of the Catalog states in \n     pertinent part: The school may, from time to time, provide \n     the student with (I) information on federal, state and other \n     student financial aid for which he or she may apply to \n     receive and/or (II) estimates of the amount of federal, state \n     and other student financial aid for which he or she may \n     qualify, but: (a) the federal, state and other authorities, \n     and not the school, determine the student's eligibility for \n     any federal, state or other student financial aid; (b) the \n     federal, state and other authorities, and not the school, \n     determine the amount of any federal, state or other student \n     financial aid the student may receive. . . . As this language \n     states, the school makes no representation or promise of aid \n     which a student will receive. Rather, such a final \n     determination is that of the agency providing the aid. In \n     speaking with the Financial Aid Administrator (FAA) who \n     assisted you, the FAA does not recall any discussions that \n     the military would be paying the full cost of your education. \n     Rather in assisting you with the financial aid process, there \n     were discussions pertaining to your possible eligibility to \n     receive benefits from the Veterans Administration (VA). For \n     your information, I have enclosed a copy of your Enrollment \n     Agreement and related Cost Summary and Payment Addendum \n     (CSPA). The CSPA provides an outline of the expected cost and \n     funding for your first three quarters of attendance at the \n     campus. Further our records also indicate that you did apply \n     for VA benefits. Any such benefits would have been paid \n     directly by the VA to you. Our school does not receive these \n     funds on your behalf. Again I appreciate you bringing your \n     concerns to my attention for review and response. While I \n     sympathize with the circumstances you have endured since \n     leaving the military, I must review each matter based upon \n     its own merits. In this instance, the facts do not \n     substantiate a refund or waiver of tuition and fees. If you \n     have any questions or wish to provide any further \n     information, please do not hesitate to contact me. Sincerely, \n     [Campus Director]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Iowa. He has led the way. His \ncommittee investigation on this industry is a clarion call to every \nMember of the Senate of both political parties. Are we going to \ncontinue to waste taxpayers' money? Are we going to continue to allow \nthese schools to exploit veterans and students across America?\n  You cannot turn on the local television here in Washington, DC, where \nthere are a lot of military families, without running into ITT ads \ntrying to lure these young veterans into their programs that are \nvirtually worthless, that end up saddling many of them with debt, if \nnot saddling the government with debt before it is all over.\n  I ask the Senator from Iowa, is it not a fact that when the new \nleadership came into the new House of Representatives, that in the \nfirst few weeks of activity, one of the first things they did was to \nattempt to stop the Department of Education from regulating this for-\nprofit school industry?\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator is right on the mark. The House wanted to \nkeep the Department of Education from issuing what we call a gainful \nemployment rule, which basically is a rule saying, if you are going to \ntake all this money and you are supposed to be educating kids to get a \njob or career, what is happening to them? We want to know if they are \nactually getting jobs. What could be more innocent than that? We want \nto know how they are doing. Yet the Republican leadership in the House \nof Representatives wanted to stop the Department from issuing that \nrule.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I might ask the Senator from Iowa, at the end of the day \nis it not true that while these for-profit schools have about 10 \npercent of the students in America, they take in almost 25 percent of \nall Federal aid to education?\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator is absolutely right.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is it not also true that we requested, I think together, \nthat the GAO do a study of the amount of money that was being spent on \nbehalf of our veterans at for-profit schools, and did we not find that \nthe cost to the Federal Government was often two or three times as much \nfor the same education that was being offered at community colleges and \npublic colleges? Isn't it true that the for-profit industry, by all \nobjective measures, is exploiting our GI bill at the expense of our \ntaxpayers, our government in debt, and these veterans who are \nunwittingly signing up for these worthless courses?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend, yes, we did. On December 8, our \ncommittee issued a report, December 8, 2010, a report on, partially--\nwhat the Senator is saying now, how much more expensive these programs \nare in these schools compared to what they could get, say, at a \ncommunity college or a nonprofit school in their States. The Senator is \nright, it is three to four times as much.\n  Plus there is one other thing, I say to my friend. He knows this. \nWhen these students go to a small not-for-profit school that you would \nhave in Illinois or the colleges I have in Iowa, such as Simpson or \nGraceland or Central College--a number of our small private colleges--\nthey do a great job. They do a wonderful job in helping poor students \nwho need a lot of Pell grants. What these colleges do when students \ncome in and they borrow money and use Pell grants, is provide a lot of \nsupport from the university. The university is there to help them with \ntheir studies, to make sure they get the kind of help and support they \nneed. A lot of these students come from families who have never gone to \ncollege, they never had that kind of experience. They come to college, \nand they get that support. What the for-profits do is they sign the \nkids up, and once they get the money, good luck in ever getting any \nhelp or support from the for-profit colleges.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I might say to the Senator from Iowa, the next time you \nare in Chicago and headed out to O'Hare Airport, right before the \nO'Hare exit, look to your right. You will see a tall office building, \nand on the top it says ``Westwood College.'' This has been one of my \nfavorites because I have met many of their so-called students, despite \ntheir best efforts, who have been exploited by Westwood College. I want \nto share with the Senator one story to show it can go from bad to worse \nin Westwood College.\n  There was a veteran named Carlos. He served in Iraq, came home, and \nwanted to get a degree. He saw the ad for Westwood College on \ntelevision. He went to sign up, and they said: Don't worry about it, \nCarlos, because at the end of the day, your GI bill is going to pay for \neverything. He signed up and started going out to this Westwood College \nand was disappointed at how awful the courses were and how the teaches \ndidn't teach anything. He didn't feel he was learning anything.\n  After a year, Westwood called him in and said: Carlos, you are on the \nroad to your degree, but we have run into a problem--the GI bill will \nnot cover all the expenses.\n  If I am not mistaken, I ask the Senator from Iowa, doesn't the GI \nbill pay about $17,000 a year?\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is right. Starting in August, that's about how much \nthe GI Bill will pay per year.\n  Mr. DURBIN. They said to Carlos: You need to take out student loans \non top of the GI bill.\n  He ended up taking out the GI loans, going $21,000 in debt over and \nabove the GI bill, and he couldn't finish. He didn't want to go further \ninto debt.\n  I might say to Carlos that he got off easy. I had a young woman who \nwent to Westwood College for a criminal justice degree. After 5 years \nof extra effort to get her diploma, she ended up with a worthless \ndiploma that she couldn't turn into a job anyplace, at any sheriff's \noffice or anyplace related to criminal justice. I might say to the \nSenator from Iowa, she was $90,000 in debt at the age of 26, with a \nworthless diploma from Westwood College, this for-profit school. She is \nliving in her parents' basement because she cannot get a job that pays \nanything, and whatever she makes goes to the student loans, and she \ncannot borrow a nickel now to get a real education.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Of course not.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Think about this poor girl. She was doing the right \nthing.\n  I will say something to the Senator from Iowa and ask him to comment \non this. I think the Federal Government is at fault here too. Somewhere \nalong the way, Westwood College ended up qualifying for college student \nloans and Pell grants. Who said they are qualified? I would challenge \nthat based on these experiences.\n  Are we doing our job as a Federal Government to make sure these are \ntruly accredited colleges and universities? I ask at this point, is \nthere more we can do to make sure these are real\n\n[[Page S3159]]\n\nschools teaching real courses that can lead to jobs?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend, first of all, Westwood was one of the \nschools that the GAO had an undercover investigation into that had one \nof the most deceptive programs of getting students to sign up. That is \nall documented on film.\n  Second, the accrediting agency that accredits Westwood was out at \nWestwood about the same time. Yet they found none of the things the GAO \nfound. I talked to them. I had a hearing. I had them before our \ncommittee. I asked the accrediting agency: How could it be that on the \none hand the GAO finds out all this, yet you say they are fine and they \nget accredited?\n  They did admit there was some laxness or some loopholes, some things \nthey were not paying attention to, that they needed to do a better job \nin accrediting.\n  I say to my friend, what the Federal Government does is we say to a \nschool: To be able to be eligible for Federal financial aid so you \ncould accept Pell grants and get the guaranteed student loans, you \nwould have to be accredited. The Federal Government doesn't do that \naccrediting. That is done by private agencies.\n  Here is another one, I say to my friend from Illinois, that we need \nto look into. Get this. The accrediting agencies that accredit let's \nsay a Westwood, do you know where they get their funding? From the \nschools they accredit. Talk about a fox in the chicken coop. They go \nout to accredit Westwood, but it is Westwood that is paying them to \naccredit them.\n  This is something that I think we as a Federal Government have to get \ninto. To me, this is a system that has kind of run amok, this whole \naccrediting system. I think there needs to be a better system of \naccrediting schools. I can assure my friend this is something else our \nCommittee on Education will be looking at in the future.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from Iowa, is it not true that when our \nGAO undercover agents went out to look at 15 for-profit colleges along \nthe lines the Senator discussed, they found all 15 made deceptive or \nquestionable statements to potential applicants, including recruiters \nat the so-called Westwood College? Investigators found admissions \nrepresentatives at Westwood misstating the cost of the program, failing \nto disclose the graduation rates, even suggesting falsification of \nFederal financial aid forms.\n  As with the experience of the young veteran I described, the GAO \nreport found the recruiters overstated what it would cost to go to \npublic college. On film, as you said--this is on videotape--when asked \nthe cost, this recruiter from Westwood said: Well, it depends on the \nprogram. Usually with a bachelor's program, coming in with no college \ncredits, this could be--it could range from $50,000 to $75,000, he \nsaid. Most schools, more traditional schools, you are looking at \n$100,000, $150,000, $200,000.\n  I might say to the Senator from Iowa, isn't it true that to obtain \nthe same degree he was offering at Westwood from a public university \ndegree in Texas would cost $36,000? Isn't that what the GAO came in and \nsaid?\n  These people are deliberately misleading these youngsters and new \nveterans trying to make a life for themselves, piling debt on them with \na worthless diploma and ripping off the taxpayers. Why don't we have a \nsense of some rage here in Congress that this is going on?\n  I would say to the Senator, it strikes me first and foremost that we \nshould protect the young people in America and we ought to make an \nequally high, if not higher, priority of protecting our veterans. We \ncreated the GI bill with a great source of pride--I know you are a Navy \nveteran yourself--great source of pride that we were standing up for \nthis generation of veterans. Senator Jim Webb led the way on that. We \nwere good about keeping our word to veterans. Now these same veterans \nare being ripped off because we are not doing our job in Congress.\n  I say to the Senator, when it comes to some of these recruiting \npractices that are being used by Kaplan University, what you have \ndisclosed here on the floor is embarrassing, that we allow this to \noccur to our veterans.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend it is. It is embarrassing, and it is \njust shameful.\n  I said earlier this is from Kaplan's recruiting. They call it their \nmilitary learning module. They call it ``Fear, Uncertainty, and \nDoubt.'' As I said earlier, they say--now, this is an internal \ndocument. This is for the recruiters. This is not something they hand \nout through the public. We got this through our investigation. They \nsay: This technique was originally created within the computer hardware \nindustry and uses these emotions to attempt to influence perceptions or \nbeliefs--and on and on.\n\n  As I said earlier, it is one thing to use high pressure tactics to \nsell someone a hard drive or a new computer or something, but when they \nare exploiting fear, uncertainty, and doubt on a GI who may have post-\ntraumatic stress disorder, who may have served in Iraq, who didn't go \nto college, that is another thing. Young people now, they are worried \nabout their future and what is going to happen to their future. Then \nthese people come in and put the pressure on them with fear, \nuncertainty, and doubt to get them to sign a contractual agreement and \nturn over their GI bill benefits. It is just disgraceful.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask the Senator again, this is Kaplan \nUniversity, which owns the Washington Post?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I think it is the other way around. The Washington Post \nowns Kaplan University.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I see. I also think, for the record, that Kaplan \nUniversity makes more money than the newspaper, but be that as it may, \nthey are linked economically.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes, they are.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I have always respected this newspaper. I just wonder how \nthey can rationalize this sort of activity--the exploitation of \nstudents and the exploitation of veterans.\n  I am sure the Senator has been visited by so many people who have \ncalled and said: Senator Harkin, I loved your speech. I loved your \nhearing. I have to get in to talk to you because we are the good guys. \nWe are the good school. We are the ones who don't exploit students.\n  You know what. I found a couple of them I believe. There are some \nthat are good.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is right.\n  Mr. DURBIN. But the rest of them, at this point it is an \nembarrassment to me. As a person who couldn't have gone to college \nwithout a student loan--and I have voted reflexively now in the House \nand the Senate to give the next generation the same chance--I have to \nsay to the Senator the party is over as far as I am concerned. The next \ntime we have a debate on Pell grants and college loans, I want this \nissue front and center. They are ripping off the taxpayers and ripping \noff the students and ripping off the veterans and we are fools to \nignore it.\n  The House Republicans have announced that they want no part of \nreform, that they are going to take this power away from the Department \nof Education. I think we have to send a different message.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend, the Senator is right on target. What \nhas happened as we have looked at this over the last year and a half \nnow is even the good actors are being sucked into this vortex because \nthe business model itself is bad.\n  For example, how many times has my friend heard from the for-profit \nindustry: Well, the reason we have these high dropout rates--for \nexample, here is Westwood; 57.6 percent dropped out in the first year. \nHere is Kaplan; 69.1 percent dropped out in the first year--the reason \nwe do is because, see, we serve a lot of low-income students. These are \nlow-income people we serve, and they have a lot of problems in their \nlives. That is why we have such a high dropout rate.\n  What they are not telling us is, because of the business model, that \nis exactly who they go after to recruit. Why do they do that? Because \nthe lowest income student gets the highest Pell grant and the most \nguaranteed student loan. So if you are in the for-profit business and \nyou want to make the most money, you don't want to recruit Senator \nDurbin's son or daughter. You want to recruit somebody whose parents \nnever went to college, who is probably a minority, maybe doesn't even \nspeak English all that well, who can get the maximum Pell grant and the \nmaximum student loan, and once they\n\n[[Page S3160]]\n\nget the money--well, if they stay, fine; if they don't, no big deal.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let's stay on that point for a second. I ask the Senator \nfrom Iowa, how long does the student have to stay at the school for the \nschool to get the Federal money? If they left and didn't finish, would \nthe school still get paid?\n  Mr. HARKIN. This is something else we have to look into. Right now, \nthe Federal laws are that a student has to be in for at least 60 \npercent of the term. If they are in for 60 percent of a term, then the \nschool can keep the money.\n  Now, I ask my friend from Illinois, what is a term? I ask people \nthat, and they say: well, isn't that a semester? Well, a term is \nwhatever the school says it is. Some of these schools have a term that \nis 6 weeks long. So you sign up, you turn over your money, you spend 4 \nweeks there, you fulfill 60 percent of the term. If you leave, they \nkeep the money.\n  Mr. DURBIN. And you end up with the student loan.\n  Mr. HARKIN. And, by the way, as the Senator fully knows, these \nstudent loans are not dischargeable in bankruptcy. They are around your \nneck forever.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I might also add, I think Congress made a serious error \nin saying that the private loans from the same schools will be treated \nthe same way. They are not dischargeable in bankruptcy.\n  Here we have someone who could be 19 or 20 years old signing up for \n$4,000, $5,000 or $10,000 worth of student loans. Have they really \nthought and reflected on the fact that that debt they have incurred is \ngoing to be with them for a lifetime and, at some point in their lives, \nwhen they can no longer borrow money to go to school, and they are \nstill facing default on their student loan, they could have their \nincome tax returns attached, they could be prohibited from Federal \nemployment? They cannot discharge this loan in bankruptcy. They are \nstuck with it.\n  That poor girl living in her parents' basement with a $90,000 debt \nfor Westwood College, a rip-off institution, is stuck. She has nowhere \nto turn. The college president wrote to me and said I am just being \ntotally unfair with him about her experience. Well, I know her \nexperience inside and out.\n  I said: You want fairness? You step in and forgive her loan. You pay \nit back. You have the money. You pay it back. Never heard back from \nhim.\n  They don't have the interests of the students at heart. They have the \ninterests of money at heart. That is why I am glad the Senator is \ninvestigating, and we will continue to speak out.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for his great work on this.\n  I just want to add one other thing about the school and about the \ndebt of these students. Some have likened what the for-profit school \nindustry is doing to the subprime bubble we had. But there is a big \ndifference. Even as bad as the subprime mortgages were, a person who \nhad a house they couldn't pay for could walk away from that house. They \ncould always walk away from it, and that is the end of the debt. You \ncan't walk away from this. No way. That is the difference.\n  This is not a dischargeable debt, and these students, as the Senator \npoints out, might end up alone. They might not be able to go to a \nlegitimate school because they can't get any money for that. They could \nbe barred from Federal employment. This will follow them for the rest \nof their lives until they pay it off. Yet these companies are making \nalmost obscene profits and paying their CEOs tremendous salaries and \nbenefits.\n  As I pointed out earlier, many of these for-profit schools are owned \nby the same investment firms on Wall Street that brought us the \nsubprime problem.\n  Well, I say to my friend, we just cannot let this go. There is too \nmuch at stake not only for the taxpayers of this country but for these \nstudents, these young kids, these poor kids who are being preyed upon. \nSo whenever we hear these schools say: Well, the reason we have this \nproblem is because we are servicing all of these poor kids--don't \nforget. That is who they prey on. That is who they go after because \nthey get the most Pell grants and the most student loans out of the \npoor kids. Then after they get the money, hey, if they leave, no sweat. \nThey don't care. It is not a problem with them.\n  I thank my friend from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/19/senate-section/article/S3160-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3160-S3162]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THE DREAM ACT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we have been speaking on the Senate floor \nabout students who are being exploited by for-profit colleges. I think \nabout turning on the television in Washington and the ad that really \ntroubles me which shows a lovely young woman who says: You can go to \ncollege in your pajamas. You don't even have to get out of bed to go to \ncollege. And she has a computer on the bed.\n  It strikes me that--I don't believe anybody should fall for that, but \nsome must, and they end up signing up for these for-profit schools, \ngetting deep in debt, with a worthless diploma when it is all over. The \nexploitation of veterans, Senator Harkin is bringing that out. I hope \nthe people who are going to give the patriotic speeches in this Chamber \nabout our love of country and our love for the men and women in uniform \nwill love them enough to put an end to this exploitation.\n  I wish to speak about the DREAM Act. It is legislation which I first \nintroduced 10 years ago and came to my office when we were approached \nby a Korean-American woman in Chicago whose daughter was brought to the \nUnited States when the little girl was 2 years old. She was brought on \na visitor's visa. Her mom stayed, had other children, started a \nbusiness. Eventually, she became a naturalized citizen. The other \nbrothers and sisters were born in the United States, but this young \ngirl who was brought from Korea literally had no papers filed.\n  Well, she turned out to be an amazing concert pianist. She was \naccepted at the Julliard School of Music. When she went to apply and \nwas asked about her citizenship, her mom realized she had never done \nanything about her daughter's citizenship. So they called our office. \nWe checked, and the laws of the United States were very clear. They \nsaid this young girl who had never remembered ever being in Korea was \ntold to return to Korea and wait at least 10 years to try to get back \ninto the United States. I thought that was unfair. It turns out she \nwasn't alone.\n  Young people all across the United States, who were brought here by \ntheir parents, undocumented, have lived their lives here, have gone to \nschool here, have grown up here, have pledged allegiance to the flag in \nthe classrooms here, have known no other flag or National Anthem, and \nthen they learn as they graduate from high school they are without a \ncountry. They have no place to go.\n  For many of them, it is a rude awakening, after all the effort they \nput into school, to realize they can't do anything. They can't qualify \nfor student loans even at good schools. They can't qualify for a lot of \njobs they might otherwise have if they graduate--engineers, nurses, \ndoctors, teachers--because they have no citizenship.\n  So I said: Let's at least agree on something basic. You shouldn't \nhold a child responsible for the wrongdoing of their parents. I hope we \nall agree on that.\n  Secondly, if we have spent so much time and resources in giving this \nyoung person a chance to be educated, and they have paid us back by \nworking hard at graduating, isn't it in the best interests of America \nto give them a chance to help our country move forward?\n  That is why I introduced the DREAM Act. It says: If you graduated \nfrom high school--if you came to this country under the age of 16 and \nyou graduated from high school, you have had no serious problems with \nthe law, you have had no issues of moral character, and you go on to do \none of two things--either serve in our military or finish at least 2 \nyears of college--we will give you a chance to become legal in America. \nIt is called the DREAM Act. We have been considering it for 10 years.\n  Last December, the Senator from New Mexico knows we voted on it.\n\n[[Page S3161]]\n\nFifty-five votes on the Senate floor--a majority but not enough. There \nwas a Republican filibuster requiring 60 votes. We fell short. We had \nthree Republicans join us in voting for it. We lost a handful of \nDemocrats. We are going at it again.\n  I have reintroduced the bill. The reason I have done it is because \nthe challenge is still there. These young people are still out there, \nand their lives are still hanging in the balance. I think it is time to \ngive these young people a chance. I don't want to give them amnesty. I \nwant them to earn everything they are going to get. If they have to pay \na fine or tax on the way, so be it. They will pay it. They are \ndetermined to become part of America. These are young people who have \nbecome superstars in their own rights.\n  By every account they are the leaders of tomorrow but for the fact \nthat they don't have citizenship or legal status in America. The DREAM \nAct is supported by Defense Secretary Robert Gates. He believes it will \nbring diversity to our Armed Forces. It is also supported by General \nColin L. Powell, a man I respect very much, who believes, as I do, that \nwe should give these young people a chance.\n  This DREAM Act will stimulate our economy with a lot of new people in \nprofessions we need to have filled, including nurses and teachers, \nengineers, doctors, and lawyers. That is why the DREAM Act has the \nsupport of such a diverse group, including Rupert Murdoch and the CEOs \nof companies such as Microsoft and Pfizer.\n  Every day I get contacted by these students across America. They keep \nlooking to us and wondering if the day will come when we will give them \ntheir chance.\n  I wish to share two stories very quickly this evening. This is Elier. \nI will show his photo because he is a handsome young man. Elier's \nparents brought him to the United States in 1994 when he was 4 years \nold. He is a computer wizard. In high school he won awards for \noutstanding achievement in science and information technology. He \ngraduated in the top 5 percent of his high school class. He was named \nTech Prep Student of the Year in Cincinnati, OH. He has even started a \ncomputer repair business.\n  Now, Elier is a 19-year-old honors student at the University of \nCincinnati majoring in information technology with a 3.8 GPA. Here is \nwhat one of his professors said about Elier:\n\n       I have worked with thousands of students over the past 30 \n     years and Elier Lara is that student who comes along every 10 \n     years or so who just makes your heart sing.\n\n  Elier sent me a letter, and here is what he said in the letter:\n\n       Technology and computers is where I want to spend the rest \n     of my life. I'm sure I'll find my place on the forefront of \n     the technological frontier, implementing and discovering the \n     new technologies of the future. I am dreaming big and will \n     continue to do so.\n\n  Can we use a person with those talents in America? You bet we can--in \nIllinois, in New Mexico, in Ohio. Look at leading American technology \ncompanies such as Google, Yahoo, Intel, and eBay. They were founded by \nimmigrants to the United States. That could be Elier's future and part \nof America's future.\n  Here is the sad part of the story of this otherwise amazing young \nman. Elier is in deportation proceedings. After having won all the \nawards for a great academic background and demonstrating the kind of \nleadership we need in America, our government has officially decided it \nis time for him to leave. Here is what he said about being deported:\n\n       I have been living in the United States for the last \n     fourteen years of my life. The most important years of my \n     life were spent here in America. I cannot speak, read or \n     write . . . Spanish. I have never been back to Mexico since \n     the day we moved here.\n\n  At the age of 4.\n\n       Mexico is not home for me and I fear going back.\n\n  So would it be a good use of taxpayer dollars to deport this young \nman and send him back to a country where he can barely speak a few \nwords of the language--a place he can never remember?\n  Elier has asked the Department of Homeland Security to grant him a \nstay, and I am going to work hard to make sure he gets it. I do not \nknow if I will be successful. It makes no sense for us to lose Elier. \nHe has so much to contribute, and we need to have him here.\n  In the past, I have spoken about Oscar Vazquez. Oscar is a student \nfrom Arizona. I would like to update you on Oscar's situation because \nwhile we take our time addressing this issue, the lives of these young \npeople go on.\n  Oscar Vazquez was brought to Phoenix, AZ, by his parents when he was \na child. He spent his high school years in Junior ROTC, as we can see \nfrom his uniform. He dreamed of enlisting in the military. Here is a \npicture of him in his uniform.\n  But at the end of his junior year, a recruiting officer told Oscar he \nwas ineligible to serve in our military because he was undocumented. \nOscar found another outlet for his talent. He entered a college-level \nrobot competition sponsored by NASA. Oscar and three other DREAM Act \nstudents--the four of them--worked for months in a storage room in \ntheir high school. They were competing against students from MIT and \nother top universities. Oscar's team won first place.\n  This is Oscar today. I show you an updated photo--a good-looking \nyoung man.\n  In 2009, he graduated from Arizona State University with a degree in \nmechanical engineering. He was one of the top three students in his \nclass at Arizona State.\n  Following his graduation, he took a brave step. He voluntarily \nreturned to Mexico--a country where he had not lived since he was an \ninfant--and he said:\n\n       I decided to take a gamble and [try to] do the right thing.\n\n  Last year, the Obama administration granted Oscar a waiver to reenter \nthe United States. Without this waiver, Oscar would have been barred \nfrom returning to the United States for at least 10 years. He would \nhave been separated from his wife Karla and their 2-year-old daughter \nSamantha, both of whom are American citizens.\n  When Oscar returned to the United States last year, he did two \nthings. He applied for citizenship, and he enlisted in the U.S. Army. \nHe is in basic training right now. He wants to be an Apache helicopter \npilot.\n  In June, Oscar will complete basic training and be sworn in as an \nAmerican citizen. The story of Oscar Vazquez is the story of America, \nand it is the story of the DREAM Act. This young man, determined to \nserve in our military, was turned away as undocumented. He went on and \nearned a college degree, with no help from Federal programs, graduating \nat the top of his class. He then went to Mexico and took a chance that \nhe could get back here so he could enlist in the Army, and he made it. \nTell me, what is fairness and justice for Oscar Vasquez? That is what \nthe DREAM Act is all about.\n  I introduced this bill in 2001. I have met so many young students \nsuch as these who are my inspiration to come to this floor regularly \nand remind those who follow the Senate this is an issue that will not \ngo away--as these lives will not go away. We need these young people.\n  I wish to call on other students all across America--who were lucky \nenough to be born in America, who never had to question their own \ncitizenship or future--I am asking them to stand in solidarity with \nthese young men and women, people who may be sitting next to them in a \nlecture hall or just across the aisle at a desk. They are like you, and \nthey need you to stand for them. If we can have students across America \nmobilize on behalf of DREAM Act students, we can create a force for \nchange--a force that can pass, even with 60 votes, this DREAM Act in \nthe Senate.\n  I need my colleagues to not forget the DREAM Act, not forget these \nyoung people, and not forget what America is all about.\n  Just a few steps from here is my office, and right behind my desk is \na certificate that I have had displayed as long as I have been in the \nSenate. It is my mother's naturalization certificate. She was an \nimmigrant, and she came here at the age of 2. She would have been one \nof the DREAM kids of her generation. It was not until after she was a \nparent and had two children that she finally took the classes and was \nnaturalized as a U.S. citizen. She was a young mom in East Saint Louis, \nIL, and I have her picture right there on the naturalization \ncertificate to remind me not only who I am but to remind me of her and \nher journey.\n\n[[Page S3162]]\n\n  Her journey to America is the same journey these young people made: \ncoming as an infant and striving to succeed in a place which did not \nalways welcome immigrants. But, thank goodness, this Nation of \nimmigrants, from time to time, will rally and celebrate our diversity, \ncelebrate the length and breadth of the American family and all the \ncultures and all the ethnic backgrounds it comprises.\n  I am so proud of this great Nation, and I am proud of who we are and \nwhat we are. This Nation of immigrants should remember that fine young \npeople such as these DREAM Act students deserve a chance. Given a \nchance, they will continue to prove to America that this is, indeed, a \ngreat and noble experiment in our country, bringing together people \nfrom all over the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/19/senate-section/article/S3162-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3162]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, this week is National Police Week. During \nNational Police Week we pay tribute to the brave men and women who \nserve the U.S. as law enforcement officers and take note of their \nselfless dedication to keeping our communities safe. Last week, peace \nofficers from across the Nation traveled to Washington to honor those \nwho have made the ultimate sacrifice and given their lives in the line \nof duty. This year, two of the names that were added to the National \nLaw Enforcement Officers Memorial belong to law enforcement officers \nfrom Nevada: Nye County Deputy Ian Michael Deutch and Nevada Department \nof Corrections officer Sergeant Vincent Tyrone Tatum.\n  Last April, 27-year-old Ian Michael Deutch was shot and killed while \ninvestigating a domestic disturbance call in Pahrump, NV. When the \ndeputies arrived, the suspect opened fire on them with a high powered \nrifle. Deputy Deutch was struck three times in the abdomen and the \nbullets penetrated his bullet-proof vest. Sadly, Deputy Deutch had just \nsurvived a yearlong deployment in Afghanistan with the Nevada Army \nNational Guard and was shot and killed on his second day back to work \nwith the Nye County Sheriff's Office. He is survived by his wife Vicky, \nson Jonathon, daughter Savonya, his parents, his two brothers and his \nsister. Deputy Deutch's life of public service was tragically cut \nshort, but we honor his sacrifice and know that he will serve as an \nexample of selfless service for generations to come.\n  In 1982, Sergeant Vincent Tyrone Tatum was abducted, beaten and shot \nfour times in the head after he finished his shift at the Southern \nDesert Correctional Center. He had been conducting an internal \ninvestigation involving contraband being smuggled into a southern \nNevada correctional facility by employees, and it is believed he was \nmurdered to hinder the investigation. The murder of Sergeant Tatum is a \nstark reminder of what law enforcement officers risk day in and day \nout, and we are grateful for his sacrifice.\n  Police week is held once a year, but we should remember the important \nand often dangerous work our public safety officers perform every day. \nAmerica could not exist without them, and I am grateful for all they \ndo. This year we honor those courageous Nevadans, and reflect on the \nsacrifices made by all law enforcement officers every day. We will \nnever forget what they do for our communities, and we will forever be \nindebted to them for their dedication and service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/19/senate-section/article/S3162-5", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3162]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CATHOLIC CHARITIES OF SOUTHERN NEVADA\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the Catholic Charities \nof Southern Nevada, which is celebrating its 70th anniversary.\n  Since 1941, the Catholic Charities of Southern Nevada has provided \ncrucial services to southern Nevada's neediest families. From the first \ndiocesan director, Father Thomas F. Collins, to today's chief executive \nofficer, Monsignor Patrick R. Leary, this community service center has \nfocused on addressing the essential needs of a rapidly growing \ncommunity.\n  As times have changed, so has the need to augment the services for \nseniors, children, refugees and the homeless. The Catholic Charities of \nSouthern Nevada has not skipped a beat in this effort. Today, it \nservices more than 2 million residents as one of the largest private, \nnonprofit social service providers in the State. It works hard to treat \nall who seek its help with dignity and respect, while bringing them one \nstep closer to self-sufficiency.\n  I am pleased to stand today and commend the Catholic Charities of \nSouthern Nevada on this important milestone of 70 years of public \nservice to a community that is eternally grateful for its continued \ncharity and kindness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/19/senate-section/article/S3162-6", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3162-S3163]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB OF LAS VEGAS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the 50th anniversary \nof the Boys and Girls Club of Las Vegas.\n  As someone whose life was transformed by youth development programs, \npublic education and athletics, I am proud to share in this momentous \noccasion for the Boys and Girls Club of Las Vegas. Young people in the \nLas Vegas valley have benefited from their excellent programs and \nservices that help develop productive, caring and responsible citizens.\n  They offer robust services in leadership development, education and \ncareer development, the arts, sports and other\n\n[[Page S3163]]\n\nimportant life skills. To build on their efforts to develop the next \ngeneration of responsible and active citizens, they offer many services \nthat equip parents with information about community resources, such as \nfood, housing, and GED classes. They also do an exemplary job of \naddressing the many interests and needs of young people, whether it's a \nt-shirt design contest, tech training or tutoring during their homework \nhour. The Boys and Girls Club of Las Vegas helps Nevada children excel \nas young people in countless ways, and the lessons last a lifetime.\n  In 2007 alone, the Boys and Girls Clubs of Las Vegas served more than \n15,000 youth across the valley. From Mount Charleston to Boulder City \nand many points in between, the clubs continue to reach youth in a \npositive way.\n  I am proud to stand with the Boys and Girls Club of Las Vegas to \ncongratulate the organization for 50 years of helping Las Vegas \nfamilies and young people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/19/senate-section/article/S3163-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3163]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HAITI REFORESTATION ACT OF 2011\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have had the opportunity to visit Haiti \non a number of occasions and have always been moved by the kindness and \ngenerosity of the Haitian people who live under such hard conditions.\n  I have traveled for hours into rural Haiti to visit impressive \nprograms such as Partners In Health's health clinic, which provides \nHIV/AIDS treatment and clean water for nursing mothers.\n  Unfortunately, despite such programs and the efforts of U.N. \npeacekeeping forces to bring some measure of security to Haiti, the \nliving conditions for average Haitians remains deeply troubling.\n  An already weak political system and weak government were then \nconfronted last year with a devastating earthquake that struck Haiti's \ndensely populated capitol of Port au Prince and several surrounding \ntowns.\n  A staggering number of houses and buildings simply collapsed, \nvirtually destroying Haiti's fragile infrastructure.\n  More than 200,000 people were killed and an estimated 1.5 million \nmore were displaced.\n  Americans and people from all over the world donated money, organized \nshipments of medicine, food and water, and traveled to Haiti as \nemergency relief workers to help rescue and treat earthquake victims.\n  Prior to the earthquake, Haiti was already the poorest country in the \nWestern Hemisphere.\n  Today, Haiti suffers from widespread unemployment, with 80 percent of \nthe population living under the poverty line.\n  Historically, Haiti has also been devastated by tropical storms. In \n2004, Hurricane Jeanne struck Haiti, killing approximately 3,000 of its \nresidents, and displacing over 200,000 more.\n  Just last year, Haiti narrowly missed being struck by Hurricane \nThomas, while hundreds of thousands of Haitians were living in \ntemporary tents camps suffering from the spread of cholera.\n  While we cannot undo the terrible damage of the January 2010 \nearthquake, we can show the best of American compassion, generosity, \nand ingenuity in helping the Haitian people rebuild their nation by \naddressing one of the underlying causes of the country's problems--the \ndeforestation of Haiti's once plentiful tropical forests.\n  When you look at the lush green of the Dominican Republic and compare \nit to the stark desolation on Haiti's side of the border, it is easy to \nsee why Haiti is so much more vulnerable to soil erosion, landslides, \nand flooding than its neighbor.\n  It was not always that way. In 1923, Haiti's tropical forest covered \n60 percent of the country.\n  Today, less than 2 percent of those forests remain. In the past 5 \nyears, the deforestation rate has accelerated by more than 20 percent.\n  Since 1990, Haiti has lost 22 percent of its remaining forest and \nwoodland habitat.\n  This deforestation has had terrible, unintended consequences. The \nsoil erosion that has resulted from cutting down all of these trees has \nmade the island more vulnerable to floods and mudslides--substantially \nreducing Haiti's already scarce agricultural land and rendering what \nremains less productive.\n  Haiti's tropical forests, if protected and regrown, would fight the \ndestructive effects of soil erosion.\n  Saving old and growing new tropical forests would help protect \nHaiti's freshwater sources from contaminants, would safeguard Haiti's \nremaining irrigable land, and would save lives during hurricane season.\n  Helping Haiti deal with its deforestation problems is not only the \nright thing to do for our nearby neighbors, it is the smart thing to do \nwith our limited assistance dollars.\n  Senators Collins and Kerry join me in introducing the Haiti \nReforestation Act to reverse the deforestation challenge. The bill aims \nto end within 5 years deforestation in Haiti and restore within 30 \nyears the tropical forest cover in existence in Haiti in 1990.\n  While it is important to start putting trees in the ground, this bill \nis about more than just planting trees. Our government has tried that \napproach in the past and it has proven to be ineffective.\n  This bill empowers the U.S. Government to work with Haiti to develop \nforest-management programs based on proven, market-based models. These \nmodels will be tailored to help Haiti manage its conservation and \nreforestation efforts in ways that can be measured, and it does so \nwithout authorizing any new funding.\n  In last year's supplemental we provided $25 million for reforestation \nprograms in Haiti. This bill would make sure such existing funds are \nspent wisely and productively.\n  Haiti's former Prime Minister, Michele Pierre-Louis, sized up the \nproblem in Haiti perfectly:\n\n       The whole country is facing an ecological disaster. We \n     cannot keep going on like this. We are going to disappear one \n     day. There will not be 400, 500 or 1,000 deaths [from \n     hurricanes]. There are going to be a million deaths.\n\n  We must act to ensure that that day never comes. I urge my colleagues \nto support the Haiti Reforestation Act of 2011.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/19/senate-section/article/S3163-2", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3163-S3164]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO CHRIS GRIGSBY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nincredible endeavors of a hardworking and extremely talented \nKentuckian, Chris Grigsby of Laurel County, KY. Chris's lifetime of \nexperience has taken him to many places, but he has always been proud \nto call Kentucky home.\n  Chris Grigsby graduated from Laurel County High School in London, KY. \nAt the age of nine he taught himself how to play the guitar, mandolin, \nbass, and the fiddle, and continues to play and teach them to his \nfamily, stating that music is a major part of his life. After \ngraduating high school, Mr. Grigsby enrolled in the Marine Corps.\n  Mr. Grigsby's passion for his position in the Marine Corps grew as he \ncontinued to travel the world and experience the endless opportunities \nthat it provided. He was stationed for 2 years at Camp David where he \nwas able to work closely with President Ronald Reagan. As his years in \nthe Marine Corps came to a close, Grigsby found talent in other \nprofessions including, auctioning, truck driving, as well as being a \npolice and security officer.\n  After working as a truck driver for 3 years, then as an officer with \nthe London Police Department, as well as conducting his own truck \nhauling service, Grigsby came to realize his true passion was to be \ncloser to home with his wife Bobbie and their family of five. As he set \naside his traveling days he was offered a job at the U.S. Courthouse \nwhere he continues to be the lead court security officer. This August \n17, Chris and Bobbie will celebrate their 21st marriage anniversary.\n  Chris Grigsby is a man who gives so others can prosper, and leads by \nsetting an example. His life stands as an illustration that kindness \ndoes go a long way. A wonderful article about Mr. Chris Grigsby \nappeared recently in the Sentinel Echo, and I ask unanimous consent \nthat the full article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Sentinel Echo, May 2, 2011]\n\n          All That He's Done, His Children Are His Number One\n\n                            (By Sue Minton)\n\n       If gas prices were as high in 1968 as they are today, then \n     2-year-old Chris Grigsby and\n\n[[Page S3164]]\n\n     his family may have been residents of Rockcastle County \n     instead of Laurel County.\n       Grigsby likes to joke about how his family came to Laurel \n     County.\n       ``They were originally from Perry County. My grandparents \n     and parents were part of the migration north to find jobs in \n     the late 50s and early 60s,'' he said.\n       In 1968 his parents decided to come back to Kentucky from \n     Michigan. ``I joke, they were moving back to Hazard and ran \n     out of gas in London and just stayed,'' Grigsby said. ``But \n     they didn't.''\n       Before the Pomp and Circumstance of his 1984 graduation \n     played out, Grigsby had joined the Marines. He graduated from \n     Laurel County High School in June and reported to boot camp \n     on Halloween Day.\n       He referred to his stay in the Marine Corps as the ``best \n     worst'' thing that has ever happened to him.\n       ``It gave me the opportunity to get out and see a little \n     bit of the world,'' he said. ``I always wanted to be a part \n     of something. If I was going to do anything, I wanted to be \n     the best at it that I could. And the Marines have the \n     reputation of being the toughest `the elite.' You join the \n     Army, you join the Navy, but you become a Marine.''\n       While at Parris Island in boot camp he was selected for the \n     Yankee White Program.\n       ``I was stationed at Marine Barracks `8th and I' in \n     Washington, D.C., the oldest post in the Marine Corps,'' he \n     said. ``While waiting on White House security clearance I got \n     selected to go to the Pentagon. I was there for three months \n     working with Casper Weinberger on a security detail for the \n     secretary of defense,''\n       Once Grigsby received his clearance he was stationed at \n     Camp David for two years.\n       ``We primarily worked internal security for the camp,'' he \n     said. ``I worked my way up through the ranks to the position \n     of platoon sergeant. And that put me in direct contact with \n     President Ronald Reagan.''\n       Grigsby recalls eating lunch with President Reagan once and \n     remembers how nice the event was. ``He was the most wonderful \n     person. There was no faultness to him. Sometimes you meet \n     people and they put on this air of caring, but I felt like he \n     genuinely cared about the people.''\n       In 1988 Grigsby was discharged from the Marines and \n     considers himself lucky.\n       ``I remember vividly, in 1990 we were in the middle of \n     Operation Desert Shield. My trucking partner and I were going \n     to Union City, Tenn., to get a load of tires for Toyota. We \n     were about Elizabethtown when the radio announced that we \n     were taking fire and that was the start of Desert Storm. I \n     was very fortunate that I got in and out before it began.''\n       After his stay in the Marines, Grigsby worked as an \n     auctioneer, long-haul truck driver, police officer and a \n     security officer.\n       ``While in the marines I attended auctioneer school and \n     tried my hand at that,'' he said. ``Vernon Holt, a local \n     agent with Century 21, sponsored me to get my apprentice \n     license. I went to California to help a cousin get his \n     auction business started. But I never really pursued it.''\n       But, while `trying his hand' at it Grigsby met his wife, \n     Bobbie.\n       ``I was working as an auctioneer at the stockyard in \n     Richmond, trying to get my foot in the auctioneer door. She \n     was there with her family buying horses and I met her at the \n     diner, On August 17, we will be married 21 years.''\n       When auctioneering didn't work out, Grigsby decided he \n     would like to learn how to drive a tractor-trailer. He went \n     to truck driving school and long-hauled for about three years \n     traveling to any place that was east of Denver, Colo., \n     delivering mostly Toyota parts.\n       After being laid off from truck driving, he was hired as an \n     officer for the London Police Department. While there he was \n     one of the first officers to implement the narcotics K-9 \n     Unit.\n       After leaving the London Police Department he once again \n     decided to truck. This time buying his own vehicle.\n       ``I went back on the road for financial opportunities,'' he \n     said, ``hauling whatever needed to go wherever for seven \n     years. My claim is I've hauled everything from asbestos to \n     zucchini.''\n       ``I liked seeing the country, but it was difficult for me. \n     By this time we had two of our five children, and we were a \n     close family. It was hard to be gone. There were things at \n     home that needed my attention. In 2002 I got out of the \n     trucking business and went to work at the United States \n     Courthouse.''\n       Currently Grigsby is the lead court security officer. He is \n     the supervisor of a crew of men that are special deputies \n     U.S. Marshals. ``We primarily provide security for the \n     courthouse, the judges and visitors.''\n       Grigsby said on a couple of occasions they have had some \n     excitement.\n       ``We have been fortunate. It is not something that occurs \n     every day. But there is a chance that it could happen,'' he \n     added. ``Security work is not what we do, it is what we can \n     do and what we will do. We put our lives on the line every \n     day. It is kind of like police work, but then it is not. In \n     security you have to be ready to go from zero to all out in a \n     split second. But, I like the job. it has all the \n     necessities--pay is good, home time is good.''\n       Grigsby spends some of what spare time he has playing \n     music.\n       ``I have played music since I was nine years old,'' he \n     said. ``Music is a major part of my life and my family's \n     lives.''\n       Grigsby, a self-taught musician, plays the guitar, fiddle, \n     mandolin and bass. His older children, Emily and Charlie, who \n     have had a few lessons but are taught mostly by their Dad, \n     play several instruments.\n       ``And it will just be a matter of time before Sarah and \n     Grace start playing,'' he said. ``They, Emily and Charlie, \n     along with Sarah sing and Grace does some,'' he said. Grigsby \n     and Bobbie also sing. They perform a wide variety of \n     different music, but mostly gospel.\n       ``Music has always been a part of my life. Some families \n     play sports--basketball, baseball, cheerleading--we play \n     music. And through our music we have been to Laurel Heights, \n     Laurel Village, and assisted living homes playing and singing \n     for the people. We also play at festivals, schools and our \n     church, Corinth Baptist.''\n       Grigsby feels his biggest achievement is his children--\n     Emily, Charlie, Sarah, Grace and 10-month-old Danica.\n       When the interview was almost over, Grigsby referred to a \n     scene in the movie ``Evan Almighty.''\n       ``God contacts Evan to build an ark. There is one part \n     where his wife, Joan, is upset because they are having to \n     leave, and God appears to her and says ``If someone prays for \n     patience, do you think God gives them patience? Or does he \n     give them the opportunity to be patient? That stuck with me. \n     The world would be a much better place if we were kinder to \n     each other. We live in such a traumatic world. If we would \n     just take the time to speak to someone at the store or on the \n     street and just be friendly, that would be the difference. \n     That's what I try to do, just be kind to others.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/19/senate-section/article/S3164-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3164-S3165]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ENDANGERED SPECIES DAY\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, tomorrow, on the sixth annual Endangered \nSpecies Day, we as a nation have a twofold opportunity. First, we have \nthe chance to celebrate the successful recovery of a remarkable number \nof plant and animal species worldwide. Second, we have the opportunity \nto pause in acknowledgement of the hard work that still lies ahead of \nus on behalf of the nearly two thousand species that are endangered or \nthreatened today.\n  Since its enactment in 1973, the Endangered Species Act, ESA, has \nhelped to recover such iconic species as the gray whale, the peregrine \nfalcon, and the bald eagle. In 1967, the bald eagle, one of our \nNation's most recognizable symbols, was in danger from environmental \ncontaminants, human intrusion, and other risk factors, and was listed \nfor protection under the ESA. Through its careful, science-based \napproach, ESA management ultimately resulted in the successful recovery \nof bald eagle populations across the country. The bald eagle was \ndelisted in 2007 and is now thriving. In the State of Maryland, the \nPatuxent Wildlife Research Refuge in Maryland is home to a healthy, \nflourishing bald eagle population. More recently the gray wolf, which \nwas completely extirpated from our Northern Rockies States, is now \nrecovering thanks to the careful protective management of the Fish and \nWildlife Service under the Endangered Species Act.\n  The ESA provides resources and structure that are critical to our \nability to improve the outcomes for threatened and endangered species. \nSince becoming law 38 years ago, with overwhelming support in the House \nof Representatives and unanimous support in the Senate, the ESA has \nbeen one of our Nation's most successful environmental statutes. The \nESA not only improves outcomes for endangered and threatened species, \nit also improves local and regional economies. According to a 2006 Fish \nand Wildlife Service survey, wildlife-related recreation--meaning \nhunting, fishing and wildlife watching--generated more than $122 \nbillion in revenues in 2006. In my home State of Maryland, wildlife \nwatching generated over $1 billion in revenues in 2006, according to \nthe same survey. This wildlife-related spending supports hundreds of \nthousands of jobs.\n  The Endangered Species Act, with its proven record of success in \nrestoring species to health, remains a critically important tool in the \nprotection of our natural environment. At this moment, nearly 2,000 \nanimal and plant species are endangered or threatened worldwide--the \nprotections of the ESA are therefore as important as ever. This \nEndangered Species Day, even as we celebrate the successes of our \nNation's conservation efforts, let us also remember and pledge to \nprotect the robust, science-based legislation that made those successes \npossible.\n\n[[Page S3165]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/19/senate-section/article/S3165-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3165]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   OFFSHORE PRODUCTION AND SAFETY ACT\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the importance of \nresponsibly increasing our domestic drilling and energy production in \norder to secure America's energy future. Montana is home to the Bakken \noil and gasfield, the largest technically recoverable onshore oilfield \nin the United States. In 2007, production from Elm Coulee field in \nRichland County averaged 53,000 barrels per day--more than the entire \nState of Montana a few years earlier. That number is expected to rise \nsignificantly as new pathways to market are put in place. Advancements \nin oil and gas technology are also making it possible for us to extract \nresources that just 5 years ago no one thought was possible.\n  I will continue to push responsible development of the Bakken Field. \nOil and gas development in the Bakken region has applied new technology \noriginally designed to enhance natural gas development and turned a \nsmall field into the largest onshore field in the United States. Our \njob in the Senate should be to encourage these kinds of innovations. \nOur job in the Senate should be to make sure that in places like the \nBakken, where it makes all the sense in the world to develop, \ngovernment agencies approve and permit exploration and development in a \ntimely fashion. The Bakken is a strong example of where Montana is \ncontributing to increasing American-made energy.\n  The Outer Continental Shelf is another good example. We can and \nshould encourage investment in this area so that we increase production \nto meet our needs as the consumer of 25 percent of the world's produced \noil. We must also continue to explore for new resources--and prove \nthose--since as of now we only have 3 percent of the world's reserves.\n  Unfortunately, there are a number of proposals supported by my \ncolleagues across the aisle who do not responsibly balance the U.S. \nenergy needs with our responsibility to protect our coastal communities \nand other economic livelihoods. Specifically, S. 953 does the exact \nopposite of what we need to safely and responsibly increase American \nproduction.\n  The systemic lack of oversight in the Minerals Management Service was \na critical component of last year's Deepwater Horizon explosion and 3-\nmonth oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. The failure of BP, \nHalliburton and others to follow safety requirements, and the failure \nof the Federal Government to enforce these requirements, has cost our \ncountry tens of millions of dollars. These irresponsible oversights \ncaused significant economic and environmental harm to an entire region.\n  In response to this disaster, the National Commission on the BP \nDeepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling stated as their first \nfinding that ``the explosive loss of the Macondo well could have been \nprevented.'' The report key findings also state, ``Fundamental reform \nwill be needed in both the structure of those in charge of the \nregulator oversight and their internal decision making process to \nensure their political autonomy, technical expertise, and the full \nconsideration of environmental protection concerns.''\n  S. 953 does the exact opposite of what the offshore drilling \ncommission recommended by encouraging lax oversight by setting an \narbitrary timeline of 60 days, allowing insufficient time for in-depth \nanalysis. Let's be honest: the practical effect of that policy would be \nfor certain administrations to approve permits that they should not \napprove while other administrations reject permits that could \nultimately have been approved. This kind of rush to judgment will only \ninject even more politics into our energy debates. As the Senate has \nshown time and again, that is the last thing we need.\n  No, it is time for a little less politicking and a little more common \nsense in our energy policy. Yet this bill also forces the Department of \nInterior to reissue leases without any environmental review--the \nopposite of the full environmental consideration the BP oilspill \ncommission suggested. When a group of folks get together and tell you \nhow to prevent another Gulf of Mexico disaster, the commonsense thing \nto do is listen to them.\n  I believe there are responsible measures we can take and should take \nto increase domestic protection, which makes us more energy secure and \nhelps to insulate us from unpredictable ups and downs in world \nproduction. We need to dedicate resources to efficiently and \neffectively processing drilling applications. But tying the agencies' \nhands behind their backs with arbitrary deadlines or forcing them to \nhold lease sales and not process environmental reviews does not address \nthe problem.\n  If the Deepwater Horizon disaster proved anything, it is that cutting \ncorners doesn't promote our economy or protect our environment. \nEncouraging regulators to look the other way or deny permits because \nthey cannot fully consider them is antithetical to good governance. \nThat is not good for American production, American jobs or American \nenergy security.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/19/senate-section/article/S3165-2", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3165-S3166]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              PANCREATIC CANCER RESEARCH AND EDUCATION ACT\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I wish to speak about a devastating \nillness, pancreatic cancer, and what we in the Senate can do to address \nthis serious problem. Winston Churchill once said, ``Healthy citizens \nare the greatest asset any country can have.'' I could not agree more.\n  Pancreatic cancer is a serious disease that affects over 42,000 \nAmericans each year. We have made great strides to expand cancer \nresearch and improve treatments, but unfortunately pancreatic cancer \nresearch is where breast cancer research was in the 1930s. The survival \nrate for pancreatic cancer today is the same as it was 30 years ago. We \nhave little understanding of the causes, no methods of early detection, \nfew effective treatments, and single-digit survival rates.\n  Pancreatic cancer is the fourth-leading cause of cancer death in the \nUnited States, and 75 percent of pancreatic cancer patients die within \na year of diagnosis; the 5-year survival rate is barely 5 percent.\n  According to a recent report on cancer trends, death rates for \npancreatic cancer are increasing while death rates for all cancers \ncombined, including the four most common cancers, prostate, breast, \nlung and colorectal, continue to decline. It is time to do something \nabout this tragedy, this death sentence for tens of thousands of \nAmericans.\n  It is time to make a serious commitment to ensure that advances in \npancreatic cancer research keep up with the progress we have seen in \nfighting other types of cancers. That is why I am proud to be a \ncosponsor of S. 362, the Pancreatic Cancer Research and Education Act, \nintroduced by the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. Whitehouse. This \nlegislation is designed to address the shortfalls in pancreatic cancer \nresearch by developing a comprehensive, strategic annual plan for \npancreatic cancer research and awareness activities.\n  The Pancreatic Cancer Research and Education Act would better target \nresearch, develop a cadre of committed scientists, promote physician \nand public awareness and require accountability for these efforts. The \nbill creates a 5-year pilot project for the highest mortality cancers, \ndefined as those with 5-year survival rates below 50 percent. It builds \nupon the Specialized Programs of Research Excellence, SPOREs, that \nexist for breast and prostate cancer by designating at least two \nadditional pancreatic cancer SPOREs.\n  Finally, the bill promotes physician and public awareness through \npartnerships between the National Institutes of Health, NIH, and \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, and patient advocacy \norganizations to develop a primary care provider education program.\n  The most important thing that we in Congress can do for those who \nhave pancreatic cancer is to resolve to find new ways to improve \ntreatments for those suffering from this devastating disease.\n  The health of our citizens is not a Democratic or Republican issue, \nit is an American priority and one we must all champion. The well-being \nof our country depends on the well-being of our citizens.\n  I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in supporting S. 362, the \nPancreatic Cancer Research and Education Act.\n\n[[Page S3166]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/19/senate-section/article/S3166-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3166]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO MELANIE AH SOON\n\n Mr. AKAKA.

Mr. President, today I wish to memorialize one of \nAlaska's greatest pioneers and statesmen, Mr. George W. Rogers. Born to \nimmigrant parents in 1917, George Rogers died on October 3, 2010, in \nthe Juneau home he designed. By his side were Jean, his wife of 68 \nyears, their children, and several close friends.\n  Often described as a ``Renaissance man,'' George devoted his adult \nlife to the spirit of the Territory and State of Alaska. As an \neconomist, politician, educator, author, architect and artist, his \ncontributions shaped the state and he will always be part of Alaska's \nstory.\n  Armed with a B.S. in economics from University of California at \nBerkeley, George began his long and historic Alaskan career in 1945. \nWith the hope of feeding U.S. troops with less expense, the Office of \nPrice Administration sent him up to negotiate reduced prices for raw \nfish. The job ended with the close of WWII, but George stayed on to \nadvise several territorial governors, among them Ernest Gruening, who \nlater would become one of Alaska's first U.S. Senators. It was Governor \nGruening who encouraged George to attend Harvard for an MPA and a Ph.D.\n  Dr. Rogers saw in economics the effects of dynamic forces of change, \nlargely those related political, bureaucratic, and technical \nconditions. To George, Alaska was the perfect petri dish to study his \n``real world'' of economics, and to that study he devoted his life.\n  At Governor Gruening's request, George created a revenue system for \nthe Territory of Alaska. Later, during the fight for statehood, \nTerritorial Governor B. Frank Heintzelman sent him as a consultant to \nthe Alaska Constitutional Convention where he also served as the stand-\nin for the convention's secretary. He considered his greatest \ncontribution to the convention his work on apportionment to ensure \nAlaska's rural people are fairly represented.\n  Of the convention he said:\n\n       We had been through a decade-long . . . worldwide \n     depression. We had World War II, and so Republicans and \n     Democrats both realized that we've got to put aside political \n     differences and look at the construction of our government. \n     And it was such a wonderful, uplifting experience to have the \n     two competing parties sit together and work this out. . . . \n     it's one of the high points of my whole life because it was a \n     period of great hope.\n\n  George applied this experience of hope and optimism to the rest of \nhis professional and personal life. Believing in the possible, he \ninfluenced the fair development and treatment of Alaska's fisheries, \ntimber, and oil for the benefit of all. He was involved in circumpolar \nresearch, the development of the Alaska Permanent Fund, and he helped \nto establish the Institute of Social and Economic Research at the \nUniversity of Alaska. The Institute observes its 50th anniversary this \nyear, dedicating the celebration to Dr. Rogers.\n  Much of George's personal time was shared with the city of Juneau. \nElected to the assembly both before and after statehood, he served on \nnumerous committees and as a member of the Juneau Rotary Club. His \narchitectural skills provided the design for the Zach Gordon Youth \nCenter, a vibrant recreation facility dedicated exclusively to Juneau's \nyouth.\n  George was a great enthusiast and supporter of the arts. He designed \nsets for local productions, created the art for program covers and \nposters, and acted and sang on the stage. His abilities and openness of \nheart encouraged others to greater heights. He was a lifetime member of \nthe Juneau Symphony Foundation, a member of the Juneau Lyric Opera, and \nthe Juneau Arts and Humanities Council.\n  A loving and caring husband and father, George and his wife Jean were \na unit. With the addition of six adopted children, George redesigned \nand expanded their two-room, 1948 miner's cabin until it became a five-\nbedroom, two-bath home. The house burned in 2000, but the irrepressible \nGeorge began designs for the new one the following day.\n  As we bid farewell to his physical presence, George's many \ncontributions live in perpetuity. Whether through his advisory work, \nhis scholarly work, or the seven books he wrote--some of which have \nbeen adapted as educational textbooks--he made a lasting difference.\n  George's friends not only realize the depth of his impact on Alaskan \nlife, they will also always remember the twinkle in his eye, his quick \nwit, his honesty, and his ability to best them at dominos.\n  George Rogers was a great man, a role model, an Alaskan, and he has \nleft an enduring legacy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/19/senate-section/article/S3166-3", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3166]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   GRANADA HILLS CHARTER HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

Members of the national \nchampionship team include: Austin Kang, Harsimar Dhanoa, Elysia Eastty, \nJoon Lee, Shagun Goyal, Riki Higashida, Eugene Lee, Sindhura Seeni, and \nCeline Ta. The team is coached by Matt Arnold, Nick Weber, and Spencer \nWolf.\n  Each year, hundreds of high schools throughout the Nation compete for \nthe honor of becoming Academic Decathlon national champions. This year, \nGranada Hills Charter High School earned the distinction of winning its \nfirst national championship, as well as California's 9th consecutive \nnational title and 18th overall championship.\n  Competing in an Academic Decathlon is a daunting task.

The noxious odors posed a public health risk \nto the two schools located\n\n[[Page S3167]]\n\nnear the site, Mecca Elementary School and Saul Martinez Elementary \nSchool.\n  I became involved because local citizens, including teachers and \nstudents at the two schools, spoke out about the public health threat \nin Mecca that needed to be addressed immediately.

Mr. President, today I am pleased to recognize a \ncommunity in North Dakota that is celebrating its 125th anniversary. \nFrom July 1-4, the residents of Hankinson, ND, will gather to celebrate \ntheir community's founding.\n  The town of Hankinson was founded in 1886, and was named after COL \nRichard Henry Hankinson. At the time, Colonel Hankinson was promoting a \ntownsite called Kelly a few miles to the south, but development shifted \nto the new site, which had just been reached by both the Great Northern \nRailroad and the Soo Line Railroad. Both of these railroads were trying \nto establish control in the area. The post office was established on \nDecember 6, 1886, with Colonel Hankinson as the postmaster, and the \ntown was named in his honor.\n  Today, Hankinson is the home of Hankinson Renewable Energy, which is \none of the largest ethanol facilities in the United States. The \nfacility began operations in 2009 and produces approximately 110 \nmillion gallons of ethanol per year. Great facilities such as this one \nshow the future of energy in the United States, and help ease our \ndependence on foreign oil.\n  The citizens of Hankinson are proud to mention the many reasons their \ncommunity is so strong. The city offers genuine small town living with \na public library, city park, the ``Caboose'' Museum, and the Jack L. \nBopp Memorial Football Field. The Hankinson area is also known for \nexcellent hunting and fishing.\n  In honor of the city's 125th anniversary, community leaders have \norganized a golf tournament, car and bike show, flea market, children's \ntractor pull, street dances, a parade, a fireworks display, and other \ncelebratory events.\n  I ask that my colleagues in the U.S. Senate join me in congratulating \nHankinson, ND and its residents on their first 125 years and in wishing \nthem well in the future. By honoring Hankinson and all other historic \nsmall towns of North Dakota, we keep the great pioneering frontier \nspirit alive for future generations. It is places such as Hankinson \nthat have helped shape this country into what it is today, which is why \nthis fine community is deserving of our recognition.\n  Hankinson has a proud past and a bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/19/senate-section/article/S3167-2", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3167]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          OAKES, NORTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. CONRAD.

On June 10-12, the residents of Oakes will gather to \ncelebrate their community's history and founding.\n  Oakes is a vibrant community located in Dickey County. This Northern \nPacific Railroad, NPRR, townsite was founded in 1886. The town was \nnamed for Thomas Fletcher Oakes, who was the NPRR president from 1888-\n1893. Its first mayor, Thomas Frank Marshall, later became a U.S. \nRepresentative. Oakes is also the hometown of former NFL player, Phil \nHansen.\n  Citizens of Oakes are proud of their community and what it has to \noffer. They boast that their town is the hub of southeastern North \nDakota, with an excellent school system, a well-established clinic, and \na new hospital facility. While a strong agricultural community, Oakes \nalso has a booming business sector.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize a \ncommunity in North Dakota that will be celebrating its 125th \nanniversary. On July 1-3, the residents of Rugby will gather to \ncelebrate their community's history and founding.\n  Rugby is a vibrant community in North Dakota that was founded in \n1886. This Great Northern Railroad station was platted as Rugby \nJunction, but since its founding has been simply called Rugby, for \nRugby, Warwickshire, England.\n  Today, Rugby is home to almost 200 businesses in a variety of fields \nincluding craftsmanship, manufacturing, agriculture, retail, food \nservices, and health care. Rugby is also part of the North Dakota Wind \nPower Project which consists of several wind turbines that produce \nclean, renewable energy. In addition, Rugby is recognized as the \ngeographic center of North America.\n  In order to preserve the history of the city, Rugby has established \nmuseums including the Dale & Martha Hawk Museum and the Prairie Village \nMuseum. Both of these museums are dedicated to the pioneering families \nand ancestors of the local community. Rugby is also home to a beautiful \ngolf course, the Northern Lights Tower, the historic Pierce County \nCourthouse, and is near the scenic International Peace Gardens.\n  The citizens of Rugby are proud of all of their accomplishments over \nthe past 125 years and have planned a celebration that will include, \namong other things, golf tournaments, a softball tournament, a 5K run/\nwalk, local entertainment, a car show, a parade, and food and craft \nvendors.\n  I ask the U.S. Senate to join me in congratulating Rugby, ND, and its \nresidents on the first 125 years and in wishing them well through the \nnext century. By honoring Rugby and all the other historic small towns \nof North Dakota, we keep the great pioneering frontier spirit alive for \nfuture generations. It is places such as Rugby that have helped to \nshape this country into what it is today, which is why this fine \ncommunity is deserving of our recognition.\n  Rugby has a proud past and a bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/19/senate-section/article/S3167-4", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3167-S3168]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TOWNER, NORTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I am pleased to recognize a \ncommunity in North Dakota that is celebrating its 125th anniversary. \nFrom July 1-4, the residents of Towner, ND, will gather to celebrate \ntheir community's founding.\n  Towner, the ``Cattle Capital of North Dakota,'' was founded in 1886. \nThe town was named after Colonel Oscar M. Towner, who was a Confederate \nveteran of the Civil War and played major roles in the development of \nGrand Forks and McHenry Counties. Towner established a post office on \nDecember 11, 1886.\n  Located in north central North Dakota, Towner is a vibrant community \nand the county seat of McHenry County. Today, Towner is home to many \nlocal businesses, such as Anderson Funeral Home, Farmers Union \nElevator, Gunter Honey, Johnson Clinic, McIntee Law Firm, Towner Foods, \nRanch House Restaurant, and Western State Bank.\n  In honor of the city's 125th anniversary, community leaders have \norganized a number of fun activities. There\n\n[[Page S3168]]\n\nwill be live music, a street dance, pancake breakfast, golf tournament, \nrodeo, fireworks, a classic car show, and a parade.\n  I ask that my colleagues in the U.S. Senate join me in congratulating \nTowner, ND, and its residents on their first 125 years and in wishing \nthem well in the future.

Mr. President, this week marks the 48th annual \ncelebration of National Small Business Week, a time to honor the \nenormous contributions of small businesses to our nation's economy. We \nknow that small firms are truly our country's greatest job creators, \nresponsible for two-thirds of new jobs annually, and they have \nconsistently led us out of economic downturns historically.\n  Presently, we have thousands of servicemembers returning from Iraq \nand Afghanistan each month. As these proud veterans attempt to reenter \ncivilian life, many seek to start their own business. For the past \nseveral years, veterans in the midcoast region of Maine have had a \ncounselor and advocate named Kristine Schuman helping them achieve \ntheir goals. In recognition of her outstanding commitment to these \nbrave men and women, Kristine recently received the Maine Veteran Small \nBusiness Champion of the Year award from the U.S. Small Business \nAdministration. Today I applaud Kristine for her selfless service, and \noffer my sincerest thanks for her work.\n  A resident of Topsham, Kristine is the manager of the Base \nRealignment and Closure, or BRAC, Transition Center at Naval Air \nStation Brunswick, or NASB. The town of Brunswick has been home to NASB \nsince 1943, when it was constructed to assist in the Allied effort \nduring World War II. Over the years, thousands of Navy officers and \ncivilians have worked and trained at NASB, contributing to a sense of \ncommunity at the base. Regrettably, NASB was recommended for closure by \nthe 2005 BRAC Commission, and is expected to close later this year.\n  As the local community undertakes efforts to redevelop the base, many \nwho have served at NASB over the years have stayed in the Brunswick \narea and now call it home. Indeed, Maine boasts the second highest per \ncapita veteran population in the Nation, and those looking to start \ntheir own business or learn new job skills have a phenomenal counselor \nin Kristine Schuman. Since 2008, Kristine and her staff have assisted \nin the retraining and transitioning of over 1,000 servicemembers and \ntheir family members, as well as civilian workers, in the midcoast \nregion. Furthermore, Kristine has served as the project manager for the \nmilitary spouse career advancement account at the base, helping close \nto 200 military spouses receive the training necessary for placement in \nnew employment opportunities.\n  Our Nation owes our veterans in Maine, and throughout the country, a \ndebt of gratitude that can never be fully repaid. Regrettably, the \nunemployment rate for veterans returning from Afghanistan and Iraq is \n12.5 percent--a full 3.5 percent higher than the national unemployment \nrate for the overall population. That is what makes the work of \nKristine Schuman and people like her all the more critical. I thank \nKristine for her incredible work, and wish her success in future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/19/senate-section/article/S3168-2", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3168]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/19/senate-section/article/S3168-3", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3168]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/19/senate-section/article/S3168-4", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3168]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MEASURES DISCHARGED\n\n  The following concurrent resolutions were discharged from the \nCommittee on the Budget pursuant to Section 300 of the Congressional \nBudget Act, and placed on the calendar:\n\n       S.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to enhance the \nnational defense through empowerment of the National Guard, enhancement \nof the functions of the National Guard Bureau, and improvement of \nFederal-State military coordination in domestic emergency response, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce the National \nGuard Empowerment and State-National Defense Integration Act of 2011 \nalong with my National Guard Caucus Co-Chair, Senator Lindsey Graham. \nOur bill builds upon earlier reforms proposed and enacted through the \nwork of the Guard Caucus to give the Guard and Reserve a seat at the \nPentagon's budget and policymaking tables and to update jurisdictional \nand operational lines of authority in Guard matters, recognizing that \nthe Guard has evolved to become a front-line, 21st Century force that \nis still trapped in a 20th Century Pentagon bureaucracy. This bill \nrepresents a bipartisan effort to do the right thing by the men and \nwomen of our National Guard, and Senator Graham and I hope that it will \nreceive speedy consideration and passage.\n  Ten years ago, the National Guard of the United States was very \ndifferent than the Guard protecting our country today. A young private \njoining the National Guard on September 10, 2001, was joining a force \ndesigned to participate in an all-out, no-holds-barred war with the \nSoviet Union, even though the Soviet Union had ceased to exist a decade \nbefore. When that private showed up for drill, he or she found \nfacilities in disrepair, a Guard demoralized by inattention from \nPentagon leaders, and equipment that seemed to predate the Cold War. Of \ncourse, the life of that private, and of our entire nation, would \nchange dramatically in the days to come.\n  September 11, 2001, woke us up to new realities. Yes, the United \nStates still faced threats from overseas, and like the rest of us, the \nNational Guard wanted to do its part. But as we began to call on the \nGuard to deploy, those of us who pay special attention to the Guard \nstarted to ask questions. Was the Pentagon actually going to send our \nGuard overseas to fight with its ancient and decrepit fleet of \nvehicles? What about training? Who would help get these units ready for \nthe battlefield?\n  Senator Graham and I wish we could say that every necessary measure \nwas taken to correct these problems before our National Guard deployed. \nBut we are still correcting them, and that's what this piece of \nlegislation is all about. Ever since 9/11, I worked with my friend \nSenator Bond to make sure that these equipment, staffing, training, and \nother issues that our National Guard faced would be fixed. Our efforts \nculminated just a few years ago in the first National Guard Empowerment \nAct, which accomplished things like getting the Chief of the National \nGuard Bureau a fourth star--and a louder voice in the Pentagon \nbureaucracy. Now Senator Graham and I are continuing that work. We will \nnot rest until every soldier and airman in the Guard has the training, \nequipment, and leadership he or she needs to accomplish the mission.\n  I would like to highlight a few things the bill will do. It will make \nthe Chief of the National Guard Bureau a statutory member of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, a change we have needed for a full decade to make sure \nPentagon decision makers consider the unique nature of the Guard when \nmaking decisions. The bill authorizes appropriations for Guard domestic \noperations. It authorizes the State Partnership Program, which has had \nsuch great success in my home state of Vermont. The bill will also help \nour emergency response operations. During Hurricane Katrina, we saw \nmilitary forces so confused by state and federal distinctions. This \nbill includes a section focused on a new unity of effort plan that the \nPentagon and the Department of Homeland Security have been working on \nwith the Council of Governors and others. The bill will also clarify \nthe relationship between the National Guard Bureau and the U.S. \nNorthern and Pacific Commands and increase the Guard representation in \nU.S. Northern Command.\n  Overall, this bill moves our Guard and our country forward. It makes \nour Guard more effective in accomplishing the missions assigned to it. \nWe ask so much of our men and women in the Guard. Senator Graham and I \nare proud today to continue looking out for them and empowering them to \nget the job done when we call them away from civilian life to put on \nthe uniform. We look forward to many of our colleagues joining us in \nthis effort.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1025\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Packers and Stockyard Act, 1921, to \nprohibit the use of certain anti-competitive forward contracts; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to speak on the introduction of the \nLivestock Marketing Fairness Act. I want to also acknowledge that I am \njoined in introducing this legislation by Senators Tim Johnson, \nGrassley, and Tester. Without their support this bill would not be \npossible. We have always enjoyed bipartisan support on this issue and I \nwant to thank them for their work in making sure that our livestock \nmarkets remain competitive.\n  Our Nation's ranchers and family farmers aren't looking for handouts \nwhen they take their animals to the auction barn, they simply expect \nthat they will receive the price they deserve for the quality they \nproduce. However, there is evidence that there are bad actors out there \nwho stack the deck when it comes to the prices they use in livestock \ncontracts. The Packers & Stockyards Act was enacted at a time when \nthere was significant concentration in the livestock and poultry \nindustry. That law since that time has provided protection and remedy \nfrom manipulative market practices but the growth\n\n[[Page S3176]]\n\nof our markets in recent decades has opened up opportunities for new \nabuses that the original law never could have expected.\n  These opportunities for manipulation have developed as our markets \nhave become increasingly more consolidated. The top four firms control \nover 69 percent of the domestic cattle slaughter and this statistic \ndoesn't even include the acquisitions that have taken place in the \nindustry in recent years. Gone are the days when a simple handshake \nbetween buyer and seller was all you needed.\n  The Livestock Marketing Fairness Act strikes at the heart of one \nparticular anti-competitive practice. Over the years, livestock \nproducers, feeders, and packers have been given a number of new \nmarketing tools for price discovery and hedging risk. One of those \ntools is the forward contract where a buyer and seller agree to a \ntransaction at a specified point of time in the future. However, \ncertain types of forward contracting agreements have become ripe for \nprice manipulation. This is because a growing number of packing \noperations own their own livestock or control them through marketing \nagreements. These firms then can buy from themselves when prices are \nhigh and buy from others when prices are low. Captive supplies are \nanimals that packers own and control prior to slaughter. The Livestock \nMarketing Fairness Act prohibits certain arrangements that provide \npackers with the opportunity use their captive supplies to manipulate \nlocal market prices. First, the legislation requires that forward \ncontracts contain a ``firm base price'' which is derived from an \nexternal source. Though not outlined in the legislation, commonly used \nexternal sources of price include the live cattle futures market or \nwholesale beef market. This ensures that both buyers and sellers have a \nbasis for how pricing in a contract will be derived at the time the \ncontract is agreed upon. Second, the bill requires that forward \ncontracts be traded in open, public markets. This guarantees that \nmultiple buyers and sellers can witness bids as well as offer their \nown. Some livestock markets already do this to ensure transparency but \nthere are others who allow transactions to happen behind closed doors.\n  The Livestock Marketing Fairness Act also ensures that trading of \ncontracts be done in a manner that provides both small and large buyers \nand sellers access to the market. Contracts are to be traded in sizes \napproximate to the common number of cattle or pigs transported in a \ntrailer, but the law does not prohibit trading from occurring in \nmultiples of those contracts for larger livestock orders.\n  I travel to Wyoming nearly every weekend and have heard the same \nconcerns from many of our ranchers. They want to be competitive in the \nmarket and sell the best animals possible so that they can continue the \nwork that so many in their family have done for so many years. However, \nthis problem is not isolated to Wyoming. Livestock producers from coast \nto coast are finding that with consolidation there are fewer and fewer \nbuyers for their animals and their options for marketing too are being \nlost. This legislation not only increases openness in forward \ncontracting but preserves the right for ranchers to choose the best \nmethods for selling their animals without worry that their agreements \nwill be subject to manipulation. The bill does not apply to producer \ncooperatives who often own their processing facility. The legislation \nalso carefully targets the problem, large packers owning captive \nsupplies, by also exempting packers that only own one facility and \nthose that do not report for mandatory price reporting. The Livestock \nMarketing Fairness Act does not apply to agreements based on quality \ngrading nor does it affect a producer's ability to negotiate contracts \none-on-one with buyers. Therefore, sellers can still choose from a \nvariety of methods including the spot market, futures market, or other \nalternative marketing arrangements.\n  This bill is common sense and ensures that our ranchers have access \nto a competitive market in these difficult economic times. All our \nlivestock producers are asking for is a level playing field and this \nbill helps them do what they do best, continue producing the finest \nmeat in the world.\n  By Mr. UDALL of Colorado (for himself and Mr. Brown of \nMassachusetts):\n  S. 1029. A bill to amend the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act \nof 1978 to provide electric consumers the right to access certain \nelectric energy information, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an \nimportant issue, energy consumption. Do each of us know how much energy \nwe actually consume? How much does our energy use affect our \npocketbooks? Consumers should be able to answer these questions. That \nis why I am introducing the Electric Consumer Right to Know Act today.\n  This legislation takes a common-sense step toward broadening \nconsumers' access to data about their electricity usage. I first began \nworking on this issue while serving in the Colorado General Assembly \nback in 1997, when I introduced a bill that would have given consumers \ninformation about the price, water consumption, pollutants, and \nemissions used to generate the electricity they were sold. However, I \nam proud to say that this refined transparency bill--which gives \nconsumers access to their energy use and price--was developed directly \nfrom the input of Coloradans who participated in my energy jobs summit \nin Denver in February 2010.\n  In today's marketplace, consumers have a clear understanding of what \ntheir car mileage means for their wallet. They also have ready access \nto the number of minutes remaining on their cell phone. However, \nconsumers lack clear, timely data about their electricity use and its \nprice. Providing increased transparency will help consumers with their \ndecisions about electricity usage in their homes or businesses.\n  The Electric Consumer Right to Know Act, or E-Know Act, would provide \nthis transparency by establishing consumers' clear right to access data \non their own electricity usage. This right is an important step toward \na more effective, reliable and efficient electric grid, and a step \ntoward helping consumers use electricity more efficiently and save \nmoney on their electric bills.\n  For the past two years, I have been traveling across Colorado as part \nof a work force tour to talk directly to Coloradans and hear their \ninnovative policy ideas to create jobs. I also hosted an Energy Jobs \nSummit in Denver in February 2010. As part of this summit, we asked \nexperts in energy policy and business to join us for a conversation \nabout how we can better position Colorado and the United States to lead \nin the 21st century clean energy economy and win the global economic \nrace.\n  We heard from U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu, then-Governor Bill \nRitter, Senator Michael Bennet, and Congressman Ed Perlmutter. But, \nmore importantly, we heard from Coloradans who came to share their \nviews on what the federal government can do, or in some instances not \ndo, to support job creation and transition to cleaner and more \nefficient energy use.\n  One consumer participant at the summit noted that even though he had \na smart meter at his home, his power company would not let him access \nhis electrical meter readings to learn how he was using electricity. If \nhe could access those readings, he could better understand his energy \nuse, learn how to be more energy efficient and save money. That is why \nI am reintroducing E-Know Act today, to improve communication between \nthe consumers and their utility and spur innovation in developing \ncreative technologies that will save energy.\n  The bill directs the Federal Regulatory Energy Commission to convene \nan open, extensive and inclusive stakeholder process to work through \nthe details of this measure to ensure that implementing the consumers' \nright to access their information also retains consumer privacy, and \nensures the integrity and reliability of the grid.\n  The outcome of this process will create national guidelines \nestablishing the right of consumers to access their electricity data, \nincluding minimum national standards that utilities must meet to ensure \nthat right of access. In developing those minimum standards, the FERC \nwill take into consideration the ongoing and important work at the \nNational Institute of Standards and\n\n[[Page S3177]]\n\nTechnology in developing a smart grid roadmap, as well as the \ninnovative state and local programs already being developed across the \ncountry to integrate smart meters into the electrical grid, including \nColorado, California, Texas, Pennsylvania, and others.\n  In my home state of Colorado, Xcel Energy has been working with the \ncity of Boulder on a pilot program called SmartGridCity to develop a \ncommunity-scale smart grid with over 20,000 residents participating. In \nFort Collins, Colorado, the business community and utilities have \nteamed up to form the FortZED project with the goal of turning the \ndowntown into a net zero energy district using smart technology. I am \nproud to see Coloradans and others around the country taking important \nsteps together in learning how to make the grid more reliable, \nefficient, and help save everyone money.\n  Finally, part of ensuring the right to access your data includes the \nright to retain the privacy of your data. When consumers gain access to \ntheir data, they will also need to clearly understand how it will be \nused, especially when consumers grant third-party access to it. This is \nwhy this bill states that the FERC will establish, among other \nimportant measures, guidelines for consumer consent requirements. \nRetaining privacy is critical to building consumer trust in the smart \ngrid and facilitating the transition of the smart grid to an integral \npart of everyday life for every American family.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues from both parties and \nall interested stakeholders in establishing this right, defining it in \na way that eliminates unintended consequences, and enforcing this right \nin a way that promotes the efficient use of electrical energy.\n  This bill is an important first step in implementing smart meters \nacross the country, moving us toward an electrical grid that is more \nreliable and more efficient, a ``smart grid,'' if you will. There are \nseveral pieces of the puzzle that will be required to realize that \nfuture, and one critical part of that puzzle is the right of consumers \nto access their electricity data. I urge my colleagues of both parties \nto join me in supporting this important legislation.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1029\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Reclamation Wastewater and Groundwater \nStudy and Facilities Act to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to \nparticipate in the City of Hermiston, Oregon, water recycling and reuse \nproject, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing legislation to \nauthorize the Bureau of Reclamation to share in the cost of the \nconstruction of a new wastewater treatment plant for Hermiston, Oregon. \nThe bill is identical to legislation which passed the House of \nRepresentatives in the previous Congress, by voice vote, and which was \nreported by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee without \nopposition last year.\n  The reason for involving the Bureau in this project is quite simple. \nOnce constructed, the plant will provide the Bureau-authorized West \nExtension Irrigation District with enough additional high-quality water \nper year to irrigate approximately 600 acres of high value crops. This \nwill have a significant, long-term benefit to the farming industry in \nthe Hermiston area.\n  The Hermiston project has gotten the sign off at every level from the \nlocal irrigation district to Federal agencies. The City and the Bureau \nhave completed the required feasibility report and the Bureau of \nReclamation has formally concluded that the project meets the \nrequirements of the Title XVI cost-sharing program. The regional office \nof the National Marine Fisheries Service at NOAA has completed a \nbiological opinion approving the project. The City and the West \nExtension Irrigation District have signed a memorandum of understanding \nto work together to develop the project. The Bureau has concluded its \nenvironmental review of the authorization to transfer the water to the \nDistrict and issued a finding of no significant impact or FONSI.\n  Although the Bureau will be sharing in the cost of the project, I \nwant my colleagues to know that the City, not the Bureau, will be \nresponsible for the bulk of the expense. CBO has estimated that the \nFederal share of the $26 million project would be $7 million or just \nover one-quarter of the cost.\n  The Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation have also \nrecognized the benefits of the project and support it. These benefits \ninclude a significant improvement in the quality of water discharged to \nthe Umatilla River in winter and protection of sensitive fish habitat \nduring summer. These benefits have led the tribe to endorse \nconstruction of the Hermiston Water Recycling System Improvement \nProject and the City's effort to obtain federal funding.\n  This project will increase agricultural production while improving \nthe local economy, the environment and habitat for endangered fish. I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues to complete action on this \nlegislation after it had advanced so far in the last Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARDIN (for himself and Mr. Vitter):\n  S. 1036. A bill to amend title 40, United States Code, to ensure that \njob opportunities for people who are blind and people with significant \ndisabilities are met by requiring the application of the Javits-Wagner-\nO'Day Act to certain lease agreements entered into by the Federal \nGovernment for private buildings or improvements; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today Senator Vitter and I are introducing \nlegislation to ensure and protect the jobs of thousands of individuals \nwho are blind or have significant disabilities and provide important \nservices to the U.S. Government and taxpayers alike.\n  In 1938, during the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Administration, \nCongress passed the Wagner-O'Day Act to help provide employment \nopportunities for people who are blind. At the time, most of the work \nthe Wagner-O'Day Act created was in manufacturing mops and brooms that \nwould be sold for use in Federal Government buildings and facilities.\n  In 1971, under the leadership of New York Republican Senator Jacob \nJavits, Congress amended the act to include people with significant \ndisabilities and expand the program to also include services provided \nto the Federal Government.\n  The Javits-Wagner-O'Day Program eventually changed its name to \n``AbilityOne.'' Today, this expanded work program for people who are \nblind or have significant disabilities provides Federal customers, \nincluding the U.S. Senate, with a wide array of products, like wall \nmounted clocks, paint, military uniforms, hardware and cleaning \nsupplies. AbilityOne also helps put people to work in service \npositions, like call center operations, grounds-keeping, food service, \nadministration and processing positions, and vehicle fleet maintenance.\n  People who are blind or have significant disabilities struggle \nparticularly hard to find work. While the current job climate is \nchallenging for all Americans, the employment rate for individuals in \nthis group hovers around 30 percent. Oftentimes these individuals must \nrely on taxpayer funded government entitlement programs like Medicaid, \nSNAPS--food stamps--supplemental security income, and subsidized \nhousing. AbilityOne helps these Americans find jobs and alleviates the \nexpenditures of these entitlement programs.\n  Recent independent studies of the AbilityOne Program found that in \njust the four business lines analyzed, the AbilityOne Program saved the \nGovernment $34 million in both reduction of\n\n[[Page S3179]]\n\nentitlements and increases in income and payroll taxes.\n  AbilityOne provides nearly 48,000 people who are blind or who have \nsignificant disabilities with quality job opportunities, to earn a \nliving which provides a pathway towards increased independence.\n  There are nearly 600 nonprofit organizations across the country \nworking to find job opportunities for people who are blind or have \nsignificant disabilities, through the AbilityOne program. With \nMaryland's proximity to the seat of the Federal Government, AbilityOne \ncreates considerable job opportunities in the service sector for \nMarylanders with disabilities.\n  However, there is a growing trend among Federal facilities that is \nundoing the progress that the AbilityOne Program has made and in turn \nis contributing to the growth of unemployment for Americans with \ndisabilities. The bill Senator Vitter and I are introducing today aims \nto address this problem.\n  More and more Federal facilities are moving out of federally owned \nand operated properties and into leased space in privately owned \nbuildings and facilities. The General Services Administration estimates \nthat the Federal Government leases more than 7,300 buildings in more \nthan 2,000 communities across the country. When GSA has sought lease \nspace in Maryland I have generally supported these moves.\n  Federally leased properties create terrific economic opportunities \nfor the business districts they come to. Federally leased properties \nbring revenues for State and local governments, increase the tax base \nof the regions they come to and often provide the backbone for small \nbusiness growth and consulting services around the federally leased \nfacilities.\n  The economic opportunities a Federal lease on private real estate \nprovides for a community are great for everyone except for service \nworkers with disabilities who are no longer helped by AbilityOne \nbecause federally leased space falls outside the scope of the Javits-\nWagner-O'Day Act.\n  As the law is written, Javits-Wagner-O'Day only applies to federally \nowned and operated facilities.\n  Our bill makes a simple and practical fix to the Javits-Wagner-O'Day \nAct to apply the AbilityOne Program services to federally leased space. \nMy bill states that when the Federal Government occupies 60 percent or \nmore of the usable space within a private building or facility that the \nFederal Government, the lessor, or property manager must comply with \nthe service contract procurement requirements of the Javits-Wagner-\nO'Day Act.\n  The Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act, and the thousands of men and women who \nhave found employment opportunities through the AbilityOne Program, \nhave a proven track record of success in terms of providing exceptional \nservices and products for the Federal Government at rates that make for \nvery sound spending of taxpayer dollars.\n  Finding job opportunities has always been a challenge for individuals \nwho are blind or have significant disabilities. We must maintain the \nFederal Government's commitment to these hard working Americans.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senator Vitter and me in cosponsoring \nthe AbilityOne Improvements Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1036\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

It offers hope to those who \nsuffer in silence, whose cases may be less known or not known at all.\n  While there are many aspects of Sergei's and other tragic cases which \nare difficult to pursue here in the United States, there are steps we \ncan take and an obvious and easy one is to deny the privilege of \nvisiting our country to individuals involved in gross violations of \nhuman rights. Visas are privileges not rights and we must be willing to \nsee beyond the veil of sovereignty that kleptocrats often hide behind. \nThey do this by using courts, prosecutors, and police as instruments of \nadvanced corporate raiding and hope outsiders are given pause by their \nofficial trappings of office and lack of criminal records. Further, we \nmust protect our strategic financial infrastructure from those who \nwould use it to launder or shelter ill-gotten gains.\n  Despite occasional rhetoric from the Kremlin, the Russian leadership \nhas failed to follow through with any meaningful action to stem rampant \ncorruption or bring the perpetrators of numerous and high-profile human \nrights abuses to justice.\n  My legislation simply says if you commit gross violations of human \nrights don't expect to visit Disneyland, Aspen, or South Beach and \nexpect your accounts to be frozen if you bank with us. This may not \nseem like much, but in Russia the richer and more powerful you get the \nmore danger you are exposed to from others harboring designs on your \nfortune and future.\n  Thus many are standing near the doors and we can certainly close at \nleast one of those doors. I know that others, especially in Europe and \nCanada are working on similar sanctions.\n  I first learned about Sergei Magnitsky while he was still alive\n\n[[Page S3180]]\n\nwhen his client William Browder, CEO of Hermitage Capital, testified at \na hearing on Russia that I held as Chairman of the Commission on \nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe in June 2009.\n  At the Helsinki Commission we hear so many heartbreaking stories of \nthe human cost of trampling fundamental freedoms and it's a challenge \nnot to give up hope and yield to the temptation of cynicism and become \nhardened to the suffering around us or to reduce a personal tragedy to \nyet another issue. While we use trends, numbers, and statistics to help \nus understand and deal with human rights issues, we must never forget \nthe face of the individual person whose reality is the issue and the \nstory of Sergei Magnitsky is as unforgettable as it is heartbreaking.\n  Sergei Magnitsky was a young Russian tax lawyer employed by an \nAmerican law firm in Moscow who blew the whistle on the largest known \ntax fraud in Russian history. After discovering this elaborate scheme, \nSergei Magnitsky testified to the authorities detailing the conspiracy \nto defraud the Russian people of approximately $230 million and naming \nthe names of those officials involved. Shortly after his testimony, \nSergei was arrested by subordinates of the very law enforcement \nofficers he had implicated in this crime. He was held in detention for \nnearly a year without trial under torturous conditions. He developed \nsevere medical complications, which went deliberately untreated and he \ndied in an isolation cell while prison doctors waited outside his door \non November 16, 2009.\n  Sadly, Sergei Magnitsky joins the ranks of a long list of Russian \nheroes who lost their lives because they stood up for principle and for \ntruth. These ranks include Natalia Estemirova a brave human rights \nactivist shot in the head and chest and stuffed into the trunk of a \ncar, Anna Politkovskaya an intrepid reporter shot while coming home \nwith an arm full of groceries, and too many others.\n  Often in these killings there is a veil of plausible deniability, \ngunmen show up in the dark and slip away into the shadows, but Sergei, \nin inhuman conditions, managed to document in 450 complaints exactly \nwho bears responsibility for his false arrest and death. We must honor \nhis sacrifice and do all we can to learn from this tragedy that others \nmay not share his fate.\n  Few are made in the mold of Sergei Magnitsky, able to withstand \nbarbaric deprivations and cruelty without breaking and certainly none \nof us would want to be put to the test. A man of such character is \nfascinating and in some ways disquieting because we suspect deep down \nthat we might not have what it takes to stay loyal to the truth under \nsuch pressure. Magnitsky's life and tragic death remind us all that \nsome things are more valuable than success, comfort, or even life \nitself--truth is one of those things. May his example be a rebuke to \nthose whose greed or cowardice has blinded them to their duties, an \ninspiration to still greater integrity for those laboring quietly in \nthe mundane yet necessary tasks of life, and a comfort to those wrongly \naccused.\n  The Wall Street Journal described Sergei Magnitsky's death as a \n``slow-motion assassination,'' while the Moscow Prison Oversight \nCommittee called it a ``murder to conceal a fraud.'' Pulitzer Prize-\nwinning reporter Ellen Barry writing in the New York Times stated that, \n``Magnitsky's death in pretrial detention at the age of 37 . . . sent \nshudders through Moscow's elite. They saw him--a post-Soviet young \nurban professional, as someone uncomfortably like themselves.''\n  Outside the media, President of the European Parliament Jerzy Buzek \nnoted that ``Sergei Magnitsky was a brave man, who in his fight against \ncorruption was unjustifiably imprisoned under ruthless conditions and \nthen died in jail without receiving appropriate medical care.'' While \nTransparency International observed that, ``Sergei did what to most \npeople seems impossible: he battled as a lone individual against the \npower of an entire state. He believed in the rule of law and integrity, \nand died for his belief.''\n  One might have thought that after the worldwide condemnation of \nSergei Magnitsky's arrest, torture, and death in the custody, the \nRussian government would have identified and prosecuted those \nresponsible for this heinous crime. Instead, the government has not \nprosecuted a single person and many of the key perpetrators went on to \nreceive promotions and the highest state honors from the Russian \nInterior Ministry. Moreover, the officers involved feel such a sense of \nimpunity that they are now using all instruments of the Russian state \nto pursue and punish Magnitsky's friends and colleagues who have been \npublicly fighting for justice in his case.\n  They have forced the American founding partner of Magnitsky's firm, \nJamison Firestone, to flee Russia in fear for his safety in the months \nfollowing his colleague's death after learning that the same people \nwere attempting to take control of an American client's Russian \ncompanies and commit a similar fraud. And they have used the same \ncriminal case that was used to falsely arrest Magnitsky to indict \nSergei's client Bill Browder. They have opened up retaliatory criminal \ncases against many of Hermitage's employees and all of its lawyers, who \nwere forced to leave Russia to save their own lives. These attacks have \nonly intensified since my colleague and friend Congressman Jim McGovern \nintroduced the Justice for Sergei Magnitsky Act of 2011, a similar \nmeasure in the House of Representatives, last month.\n  In the struggle for human rights we must never be indifferent. On \nthis point, I am reminded of Elie Wiesel's hauntingly eloquent speech, \nThe Perils of Indifference which he delivered at the White House in \n1999. On this ever-present danger and demoralizer he cautions us, \n``Indifference elicits no response. Indifference is not a response. \nIndifference is not a beginning, it is an end. And, therefore, \nindifference is always the friend of the enemy, for it benefits the \naggressor--never his victim, whose pain is magnified when he or she \nfeels forgotten. The political prisoner in his cell, the hungry \nchildren, the homeless refugees--not to respond to their plight, not to \nrelieve their solitude by offering them a spark of hope is to exile \nthem from human memory. And in denying their humanity we betray our \nown.''\n  Speaking of our humanity, I offer the following words as a contrast. \nThey are from Russian playwright Mikhail Ugarov who created One Hour \nEighteen, which is the exact amount of time it took for Sergei \nMagnitsky to die in his isolation cell at Moscow's Matrosskaya Tishina \nprison. Ugarov asks, ``When a person puts on the uniform of a public \nprosecutor, the white lab coat of a doctor, or the black robe of a \njudge, does he or she inevitably lose their humanity? Do they lose \ntheir ability to--even in a small way--empathize with a fellow human \nbeing? In the case of Sergei Magnitsky, each of the people who assumed \nthese professional duties in the case left their humanity behind.''\n  The coming year will be a significant moment in the evolution of \nRussian politics. With Duma elections scheduled for the end of 2011 and \npresidential elections for early 2012, there is an opportunity for the \nRussian government to reverse what has been a steady trajectory away \nfrom the rule of law and respect for human rights and toward \nauthoritarianism.\n  Private and even public expressions of concern are not a substitute \nfor a real policy nor are they enough, it's time for consequences. The \nbill I introduce today sends a strong message to those who are \ncurrently acting with impunity in Russia that there will be \nconsequences for corruption should you wish to travel to and invest in \nthe United States. Such actions will provide needed moral support for \nthose in Russia doing the really heavy-lifting in fighting corruption \nand promoting the rule of law, but they will also protect our own \ninterests--values or business related.\n  We see before us a tale of two Russias, the double headed eagle if \nyou will. To whom does the future of Russia belong? Does it belong to \nthe Yevgenia Chirikovas, Alexey Navalnys, Oleg Orlovs and countless \nother courageous, hard working, and patriotic Russians who expose \ncorruption and fight for human rights or those who inhabit the shadows \nabusing and stealing from their fellow citizens?\n  Let us not put aside our humanity out of exaggerated and excessively \ncautious diplomatic concerns for the broader relationship. Let us take \nthe long view and stand on the right side--\n\n[[Page S3181]]\n\nand I believe the wise side--with the Russian people who have suffered \nso much for the cause of liberty and human dignity. They are the ones \nwho daily risk their safety and freedom to promote those basic \nprinciples enshrined in Russian law and many international commitments \nincluding the Helsinki Final Act. They are the conscience of Russia. \nLet us tell them with one voice that they are not alone and that \nconcepts like the rule of law and human rights are not empty words for \nthis body and for our government. I urge my colleagues to support this \nbill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1039\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law \n     Accountability Act of 2011''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The United States supports the people of the Russian \n     Federation in their efforts to realize their full economic \n     potential and to advance democracy, human rights, and the \n     rule of law.\n       (2) The Russian Federation--\n       (A) is a member of the United Nations, the Organization for \n     Security and Co-operation in Europe, the Council of Europe, \n     and the International Monetary Fund;\n       (B) has ratified the Convention against Torture and Other \n     Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the \n     International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the \n     United Nations Convention against Corruption; and\n       (C) is bound by the legal obligations set forth in the \n     European Convention on Human Rights.\n       (3) States voluntarily commit themselves to respect \n     obligations and responsibilities through the adoption of \n     international agreements and treaties, which must be observed \n     in good faith in order to maintain the stability of the \n     international order. Human rights are an integral part of \n     international law, and lie at the foundation of the \n     international order. The protection of human rights, \n     therefore, particularly in the case of a country that has \n     incurred obligations to protect human rights under an \n     international agreement to which it is a party, is not left \n     exclusively to the internal affairs of that country.\n       (4) Good governance and anti-corruption measures are \n     instrumental in the protection of human rights and in \n     achieving sustainable economic growth, which benefits both \n     the people of the Russian Federation and the international \n     community through the creation of open and transparent \n     markets.\n       (5) Systemic corruption erodes trust and confidence in \n     democratic institutions, the rule of law, and human rights \n     protections. This is the case when public officials are \n     allowed to abuse their authority with impunity for political \n     or financial gains in collusion with private entities.\n       (6) The Russian nongovernmental organization INDEM has \n     estimated that corruption amounts to hundreds of billions of \n     dollars a year, an increasing share of the gross domestic \n     product of the Russian Federation.\n       (7) The President of the Russian Federation, Dmitry \n     Medvedev, has addressed corruption in many public speeches, \n     including stating in his 2009 address to Russia's Federal \n     Assembly, ``[Z]ero tolerance of corruption should become part \n     of our national culture. . . . In Russia we often say that \n     there are few cases in which corrupt officials are \n     prosecuted. . . . [S]imply incarcerating a few will not \n     resolve the problem. But incarcerated they must be.''. \n     President Medvedev went on to say, ``We shall overcome \n     underdevelopment and corruption because we are a strong and \n     free people, and deserve a normal life in a modern, \n     prosperous democratic society.''. Furthermore, President \n     Medvedev has acknowledged Russia's disregard for the rule of \n     law and used the term ``legal nihilism'' to describe a \n     criminal justice system that continues to imprison innocent \n     people.\n       (8) The systematic abuse of Sergei Magnitsky, including his \n     repressive arrest and torture in custody by the same officers \n     of the Ministry of the Interior of the Russian Federation \n     that Mr. Magnitsky had implicated in the embezzlement of \n     funds from the Russian Treasury and the misappropriation of 3 \n     companies from his client, Hermitage, reflects how deeply the \n     protection of human rights is affected by corruption.\n       (9) The politically motivated nature of the persecution of \n     Mr. Magnitsky is demonstrated by--\n       (A) the denial by all state bodies of the Russian \n     Federation of any justice or legal remedies to Mr. Magnitsky \n     during the nearly 12 full months he was kept without trial in \n     detention; and\n       (B) the impunity of state officials he testified against \n     for their involvement in corruption and the carrying out of \n     his repressive persecution since his death.\n       (10) Mr. Magnitsky died on November 16, 2009, at the age of \n     37, in Matrosskaya Tishina Prison in Moscow, Russia, and is \n     survived by a mother, a wife, and 2 sons.\n       (11) The Public Oversight Commission of the City of Moscow \n     for the Control of the Observance of Human Rights in Places \n     of Forced Detention, an organization empowered by Russian law \n     to independently monitor prison conditions, concluded, ``A \n     man who is kept in custody and is being detained is not \n     capable of using all the necessary means to protect either \n     his life or his health. This is a responsibility of a state \n     which holds him captive. Therefore, the case of Sergei \n     Magnitsky can be described as a breach of the right to life. \n     The members of the civic supervisory commission have reached \n     the conclusion that Magnitsky had been experiencing both \n     psychological and physical pressure in custody, and the \n     conditions in some of the wards of Butyrka can be justifiably \n     called torturous. The people responsible for this must be \n     punished.''.\n       (12) According to the Financial Times, ``A commission \n     appointed by President Dmitry Medvedev has found that Russian \n     police fabricated charges against an anti-corruption lawyer \n     [Sergei Magnitsky], whose death in prison in 2009 has come to \n     symbolise pervasive corruption in Russian law enforcement.''.\n       (13) The second trial and verdict against former Yukos \n     executives Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev evokes \n     serious concerns about the right to a fair trial and the \n     independence of the judiciary in the Russian Federation. The \n     lack of credible charges, intimidation of witnesses, \n     violations of due process and procedural norms, falsification \n     or withholding of documents, denial of attorney-client \n     privilege, and illegal detention in the Yukos case are highly \n     troubling. The Council of Europe, Freedom House, and Amnesty \n     International, among others, have concluded that they were \n     charged and imprisoned in a process that did not follow the \n     rule of law and was politically influenced. Furthermore, \n     senior officials of the Government of the Russian Federation \n     have acknowledged that the arrest and imprisonment of \n     Khodorkovsky were politically motivated.\n       (14) According to Freedom House's 2011 report entitled \n     ``The Perpetual Battle: Corruption in the Former Soviet Union \n     and the New EU Members'', ``[t]he highly publicized cases of \n     Sergei Magnitsky, a 37-year-old lawyer who died in pretrial \n     detention in November 2009 after exposing a multimillion-\n     dollar fraud against the Russian taxpayer, and Mikhail \n     Khodorkovsky, the jailed business magnate and regime critic \n     who was sentenced at the end of 2010 to remain in prison \n     through 2017, put an international spotlight on the Russian \n     state's contempt for the rule of law. . . . By silencing \n     influential and accomplished figures such as Khodorkovsky and \n     Magnitsky, the Russian authorities have made it abundantly \n     clear that anyone in Russia can be silenced.''.\n       (15) Sergei Magnitsky's experience, while particularly \n     illustrative of the negative effects of official corruption \n     on the rights of an individual citizen, appears to be \n     emblematic of a broader pattern of disregard for the numerous \n     domestic and international human rights commitments of the \n     Russian Federation and impunity for those who violate basic \n     human rights and freedoms.\n       (16) The tragic and unresolved murders of Nustap \n     Abdurakhmanov, Maksharip Aushev, Natalya Estemirova, Akhmed \n     Hadjimagomedov, Umar Israilov, Paul Klebnikov, Anna \n     Politkovskaya, Saihadji Saihadjiev, and Magomed Y. Yevloyev, \n     the death in custody of Vera Trifonova, the disappearances of \n     Mokhmadsalakh Masaev and Said-Saleh Ibragimov, the torture of \n     Ali Israilov and Islam Umarpashaev, the near-fatal beatings \n     of Mikhail Beketov, Oleg Kashin, Arkadiy Lander, and Mikhail \n     Vinyukov, and the harsh and ongoing imprisonment of Mikhail \n     Khodorkovsky, Alexei Kozlov, Platon Lebedev, and Fyodor \n     Mikheev further illustrate the grave danger of exposing the \n     wrongdoing of officials of the Government of the Russian \n     Federation, including Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, or of \n     seeking to obtain, exercise, defend, or promote \n     internationally recognized human rights and freedoms.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to enhance public safety by making more spectrum \navailable to public safety entities, to facilitate the development of a \npublic safety broadband network, to provide standards for the spectrum \nneeds of public safety entities, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today, with my colleague Senator \nMcCain, to introduce legislation to ensure that we take advantage of a \nonce-in-a-lifetime opportunity to build a coast-to-coast communications \nnetwork for our Nation's first responders that is secure, interoperable \nand resilient.\n  As it stands now, the mobile device the average teenager carries has \nmore capability than those of the men and women who put their lives on \nthe line for us each and every day and that is just wrong.\n  Today, we introduce the Broadband for First Responders Act of 2011, \nwhich will set aside the so-called D Block of spectrum for public \nsafety entities and provide them the bandwidth they need to communicate \neffectively in an emergency. Companion legislation has been introduced \nin the House of Representatives by Representatives Peter T. King and \nBennie G. Thompson, the Chairman and Ranking Member of the House \nCommittee on Homeland Security.\n  I am proud to stand with the representatives of more than 40 \norganizations representing public safety officials, and with the ``Big \n7'' associations representing State and local governments, to call on \nCongress to put the D Block in the hands of public safety. Those groups \ninclude the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the \nInternational Association of Fire Chiefs, the National Sheriffs \nAssociation, the Major Cities Chiefs Association, the Major County \nSheriffs Association, the Metropolitan Fire Chiefs Association, the \nAssociation of Public-Safety Communications Officials--International, \nAPCO International, the National Emergency Management Association, the \nNational Association of State EMS Officials, the National Governors \nAssociation, the National Conference of State Legislatures, the Council \nof State Governments, the National Association of Counties, the \nNational League of Cities, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, and the \nInternational City/County Management Association.\n  I am pleased that President Obama has pledged his commitment to \nreserve\n\n[[Page S3183]]\n\nthe D Block for public safety. I also look forward to working with \nSenator Rockefeller, the Chairman of the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation, who has championed this cause and has \nsignaled his determination to see a bill move through Congress this \nyear.\n  Today, public safety communicates on slices of scattered spectrum \nthat prevent interoperable communications among agencies and \njurisdictions, and that do not allow the large data transmissions that \nwe take for granted in today's commercial communications.\n  Securing the D Block for public safety will allow us to build a \nnationwide interoperable network for emergency communications that \ncould prevent the kinds of communication meltdowns we had during 9-11 \nand Hurricane Katrina.\n  But setting aside the D Block will also allow first responders to \nsend video, maps, and other large data transmissions over their mobile \ndevices. For example, firefighters' lives may be saved because they \nwill be able to access building specifications on their handhelds and \nknow all the exits of a burning building before they enter it. A police \nofficer at the scene of a crime would be able to feed video back to \nheadquarters. Emergency response officials would be able to exchange \ndata with hospitals while treating patients at the scene of an \naccident.\n  I do not think it is wise, as the Federal Communications Commission, \nFCC, proposed in its National Broadband Plan, to auction the D Block to \ncommercial interests and then to hope that public safety will be able \nto piggy-back on it. In a crisis, first responders need secure, \nreliable and quick communications that are not disrupted by commercial \ntraffic.\n  The Broadband for First Responders Act of 2011 would ensure that the \nD Block is licensed to the same public safety broadband licensee that \ncurrently holds the license for 10 MHz in the 700 MHz band. The bill \nwould also provide up to $5.5 billion for a construction fund to assist \nwith the costs of constructing the network and up to $5.5 billion for \nan operation and maintenance fund for long-term maintenance. These \nfunds would come from revenues generated by the auction of different \nbands of spectrum to commercial carriers. By dedicating those auction \nrevenues to the public safety network, we can help public safety \nofficials build the system they need without adding to the deficit.\n  Under our bill, the FCC would set rules for the public safety \nnetwork, ensuring interoperability across the nationwide system. The \nrules would also allow public safety to share spectrum with other \ngovernmental and private entities, as long as public safety services \nretain priority access to the spectrum. This authority would help hold \ndown costs of the system by allowing public safety to leverage existing \ninfrastructure.\n  The grants to build and maintain the public safety network would be \nadministered by the Department of Homeland Security and would be \nawarded directly to States and municipalities, who are in the best \nposition to know how to deploy the network in their jurisdictions.\n  Achieving nationwide interoperability through adequate spectrum is a \nmajor recommendation of the 9/11 Commission that is unfulfilled. We \nshould not let the 10th anniversary of 9/11 pass without legislating to \nremedy that failure. The Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Commission, \nthe Honorable Thomas H. Kean and the Honorable Lee H. Hamilton, \nappeared before our Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs in March and urged the immediate allocation of the D Block to \npublic safety, bluntly, and rightfully, delivering a message to \nCongress that further delay is intolerable. I urge my colleagues to \ntake bold action to remedy Congress's past inaction by promptly passing \nthe Broadband for First Responders Act of 2011.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr, President, today I share the honor with Chairman \nLieberman of introducing the First Responders Protection Act of 2011. \nThis bill would provide 10 MHz of spectrum in the 700 MHz spectrum band \nto the public safety broadband licensee, make available funding for the \nconstruction, operation and maintenance of a nationwide interoperable \ncommunications network, and ensure proper governance.\n  In 2004, the 9/11 Commission's Final Report recommended the \n``expedited and increased assignment of radio spectrum to public safety \nentities.'' Shortly thereafter, Senator Lieberman and I introduced a \nbill to provide spectrum to public safety; however the Senate voted \ndown that bill. We reintroduced the bill in 2005, month before \nHurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast. But our efforts were blocked. \nFortunately, Congress finally wrestled some spectrum away from the \ntelevision broadcasters in 2009 and provided it to public safety. \nHowever, public safety has additional spectrum needs.\n  Almost every other recommendation of the 9/11 Commission has been \nimplemented, but this important recommendation remains unfulfilled. I \ncan only imagine how many lives could have been saved on 9/11 if this \nspectrum had been available at that time. How many firefighters would \nbe alive today if they could have communicated with their battalion \nchief at the base of the World Trade Center?\n  In 2007, I introduced legislation to auction the remaining public \nsafety spectrum to a commercial carrier that would then build out a \nnetwork for public safety. The FCC held such an auction, but no bidder \nmet the reserve price. Ten megahertz of spectrum remains available for \npublic safety's needs. The FCC had announced its intention to auction \nthis spectrum to a commercial provider. Thankfully, the White House \nannounced late last year that it now supports the spectrum being \nprovided to first responders for the construction of a nationwide \npublic safety network, as did the Chairman and Ranking Member of the \nSenate Commerce Committee.\n  Specifically, this legislation would license the remaining spectrum \nto the public safety broadband licensee that has been previously \napproved by the FCC as a qualified licensee and represents more than \nthree dozen national public safety organizations. The legislation \nprovides authority to local jurisdictions to make decisions on the \nspectrum use, network build-out and equipment. The men and women \nfighting crime and saving lives know what communications systems and \ntechnology are best for them. Not Washington.\n  Lastly, this bill provides funds for grants to localities for the \nconstruction, operation and maintenance of an interoperable \ncommunications network. These funds will come from the proceeds of a \ncommercial spectrum auction, thereby not adding to our Nation's \nburgeoning debt or raising taxes on all Americans.\n  As we approach the 10 year commemoration of the horrific events on \nSeptember 11th and the six year remembrance of the devastating tragedy \nof Hurricane Katrina, it is a disgrace that police officers, sheriffs \nand fire fighters still don't have a nation-wide interoperable \ncommunications system. Our legislation provides the spectrum and \nfunding to first responders, while being fiscally responsible and \nensuring local control and conscientious governance.\n  Providing ten megahertz of spectrum to public safety, as this bill \ndoes, is supported by the International Association of Chiefs of \nPolice, the International Association of Fire Chiefs, the National \nSheriffs Association, the Major Cities Chiefs Association, the Major \nCounty Sheriffs Association, the Metropolitan Fire Chiefs Association, \nthe Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials, \nInternational, APCO, the National Emergency Managers Association, the \nNational Governors Association, the National Conference of State \nLegislatures, the Council of State Governments, the National \nAssociation of Counties, the National League of Cities, the U.S. \nConference of Mayors, and the International City/County Management \nAssociation.\n  We have slightly more than one hundred days until the ten year \nanniversary of the horrific events of 9/11. I hope over the next 100 \ndays the Senate Majority Leader will consider bringing this bill to the \nfloor for full consideration and that at that time my colleagues will \njoin me and Senator Lieberman in providing public safety with the \ninteroperable communications network they deserve. It is the least we \ncan do for those who put their lives in danger each and every day to \nprotect all of us.\n\n[[Page S3184]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/19/senate-section/article/S3184-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3184]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 191--DESIGNATING JUNE 2011 AS ``NATIONAL APHASIA \n   AWARENESS MONTH'' AND SUPPORTING EFFORTS TO INCREASE AWARENESS OF \n                                APHASIA\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota submitted the following resolution; which \nwas referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Res. 184\n\n       Whereas Hubert H. Humphrey was born in Wallace, South \n     Dakota, on May 27, 1911;\n       Whereas Hubert Humphrey, from his early years, recognized \n     the importance of public service by becoming a registered \n     pharmacist and serving his friends and neighbors in the \n     Humphrey Drug Store in Huron, South Dakota, from 1933 to \n     1937;\n       Whereas Hubert Humphrey received a Bachelor of Arts degree \n     in political science from the University of Minnesota in 1939 \n     and a Masters of Arts degree from Louisiana State University \n     in 1940, subsequently teaching political science at \n     Macalester College from 1943 to 1944 and at Macalester \n     College and the University of Minnesota from 1969 to 1970;\n       Whereas Hubert Humphrey served in a variety of leadership \n     positions in Minnesota during World War II, dealing with war \n     production, employment, and manpower;\n       Whereas Hubert Humphrey served as Mayor of Minneapolis from \n     1945 to 1948, and during his tenure as mayor, he drove \n     organized crime from the city and, among other achievements, \n     created the Nation's first municipal equal employment \n     opportunity commission;\n       Whereas Hubert Humphrey was a driving force behind the \n     creation of the Democratic Farmer-Labor Party in Minnesota \n     and was a founding member of Americans for Democratic Action \n     in the aftermath of World War II;\n       Whereas Hubert Humphrey led forces at the 1948 Democratic \n     National Convention in Philadelphia in support of the \n     minority platform plank on civil rights and equal \n     opportunity, challenging the delegates to ``walk out of the \n     shadow of States' rights into the bright sunshine of human \n     rights,'' resulting in the convention's adoption of the \n     minority plank;\n       Whereas in 1948, Hubert Humphrey became the first Democrat \n     from Minnesota elected to the Senate;\n       Whereas during his total 23 years of service in the Senate \n     (including service from 1949 to 1964 and service from 1970 to \n     1978), Hubert Humphrey compiled a record of accomplishment \n     virtually unmatched in the 20th century, encompassing, among \n     other issues, civil and human rights, workforce development, \n     labor rights, health care, arms control and disarmament, the \n     Peace Corps, small business assistance, education reform, \n     wilderness preservation, immigration reform, and agriculture;\n       Whereas his service as floor leader during the Senate's \n     consideration of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was essential \n     to the eventual passage of the Act in the aftermath of \n     breaking the filibuster against this historic legislation;\n       Whereas Hubert Humphrey, although a dedicated leader of the \n     Democratic Party, always sought bipartisan support for his \n     legislative goals and routinely shared credit with other \n     Senators for his legislative victories;\n       Whereas Hubert Humphrey, as Vice President of the United \n     States, loyally served President Lyndon Baines Johnson and \n     successfully carried out a number of domestic and overseas \n     assignments;\n       Whereas Hubert Humphrey, as the Democratic Party's nominee \n     for President of the United States in 1968, waged one of the \n     most courageous and hard-fought campaigns in the history of \n     the United States, losing to Richard Nixon by less than 1 \n     percentage point of the popular vote when he started the \n     campaign some 15 points behind;\n       Whereas Hubert Humphrey was reelected by the people of \n     Minnesota (in 1970 and 1976) to 2 additional terms in the \n     Senate, thereby continuing his extraordinary record of \n     legislative achievement with passage of such bills as the \n     Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment Act;\n       Whereas Hubert Humphrey, terminally ill with cancer, \n     pursued his active public life with great courage, fortitude, \n     and good humor, and in the memorable words of Vice President \n     Walter F. Mondale at Hubert Humphrey's memorial observance in \n     the rotunda of the United States Capitol, ``Hubert Humphrey \n     taught us how to live and he taught us how to die''; and\n       Whereas the life and service of Hubert Humphrey were \n     posthumously honored by Congress with the presentation of the \n     Congressional Gold Medal, and by the President of the United \n     States with the award of the Medal of Freedom: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) honors the life, achievements, and distinguished career \n     of Senator and Vice President Hubert H.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed \nto the consideration of S. Res. 192 submitted earlier today.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the \nresolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 192) designating May 21, 2011, as \n     ``National Kids to Parks Day.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise to talk about an issue \nthat is close to my heart: introducing our children to National Parks \nacross the country.\n\n[[Page S3202]]\n\n  Enjoying the outdoors has been a lifelong passion for me and it began \nin my youth. Growing up in the American Southwest, my parents would \ntake our family on frequent trips to the nearby parks. This helped \ninspire my brother, Randy, and I to take a 10-day backpacking trip to \nGlacier National Park in Montana when we were in college. I know now \nthese important visits to the parks were the building blocks of a life \nfilled with enthusiasm for mountains and the outdoors.\n  I have always enjoyed being outdoors with others, first as an \ninstructor with Outward Bound and then with my wife and kids. In \nCongress, I have similarly tried to ensure that open spaces in both \nurban and rural areas are preserved so that families in Colorado and \nacross America have ample opportunity to get out and take advantage of \nour greatest natural resources, our parks and open spaces.\n  I believe today more than ever it is important that we are \nencouraging our Nation's youth to get outdoors. In America today, one \nin three children are overweight or obese. Kids between the ages of 8 \nand 18 spend an average of 7\\1/2\\ hours a day using some sort of \nentertainment media such as TVs, computers, video games, cell phones \nand movies. I believe this is a major reason why only one-third of all \nchildren get the recommended level of physical activity every day, \ncontributing to childhood obesity.\n  In this spirit, on Saturday families all across the Nation will get \noutside and visit a city, State or national park in honor of the first \nannual National Kids to Parks Day. National Kids to Parks Day \ncelebrates America's commitment to getting kids outdoors and highlights \nthe importance of preserving open spaces for American's to recreate.\n  That is why today I will be submitting a bipartisan resolution that \nrecognizes Saturday, May 21, 2011, as the first annual National Kids to \nParks Day. National Kids to Parks Day encourages more of our Nation's \nyouth to get outdoors and enjoy the great system of city, State and \nnational parks we have in this country.\n  I thank Senator Burr, Senator Murkowski, and Senator Bingaman for \ntheir cosponsorship and support.\n  Getting kids outdoors won't completely solve our childhood obesity \nproblem, but it may help them get excited about being active and \nhealthy outdoors, and it may help inspire the next generation of \nAmerican stewards to enjoy and protect our Nation's special places.\n  I plan to celebrate National Kids to Parks Day by attending the 100-\nyear anniversary of Colorado National Monument near Grand Junction, CO. \nI encourage my colleagues to do something similar--highlight the \nnational, State, and local parks in your State and encourage American \nfamilies to get outdoors.\n  I ask my colleagues to support my National Kids to Parks Day \nresolution.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the resolution be \nagreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, with no intervening action or debate, and any \nstatements relating to the matter be printed in the Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The resolution (S.

Res. 192\n\n       Whereas the first National Kids to Parks Day will be \n     celebrated on May 21, 2011;\n       Whereas the goal of National Kids to Parks Day is to \n     empower young people and encourage families to get outdoors \n     and visit the parks of the United States;\n       Whereas on National Kids to Parks Day, rural and urban \n     Americans alike can be reintroduced to the splendid National, \n     State, and neighborhood parks that are located in their \n     communities;\n       Whereas communities across the United States offer a \n     variety of natural resources and public land, often with free \n     access, to individuals seeking outdoor recreation;\n       Whereas the United States should encourage young people to \n     lead a more active lifestyle, as too many young people in the \n     United States are overweight or obese;\n       Whereas National Kids to Parks Day is an opportunity for \n     families to take a break from their busy lives and come \n     together for a day of wholesome fun; and\n       Whereas National Kids to Parks Day aims to broaden the \n     appreciation of young people for nature and the outdoors: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates May 21, 2011, as ``National Kids to Parks \n     Day'';\n       (2) recognizes the importance of outdoor recreation and the \n     preservation of open spaces to the health of the young people \n     of the United States; and\n       (3) calls on the people of the United States to observe the \n     day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/19/senate-section/article/S3202-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3202]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            HONORING THE BICENTENNIAL OF THE CITY OF ASTORIA\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.
