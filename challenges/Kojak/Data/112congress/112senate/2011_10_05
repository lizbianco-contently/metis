Madam President, Franklin Roosevelt said that no man can \ntruly be free without economic security. With 14 million people \nunemployed--out of work--in America, there are far too many people \nliving in the richest Nation in the world, yet unable to enjoy the full \nfreedom and independence for which America stands. So this Congress has \nno greater challenge--none--and no more important responsibility than \nto enact the policies that help American businesses flourish and grow, \nput American citizens to work, and get our struggling economy back on \ntrack to prosperity. So I was disappointed yesterday when my Republican \nfriends chose to play political games with not one but two pieces of \nimportant job-creating legislation.\n  The bill before the Senate will even the odds for American workers \nand manufacturers in the global marketplace by stopping unfair currency \nmanipulation by the Chinese Government. It would support 1.6 million \nAmerican jobs, and it has the support of Democrats, Republicans, labor \nleaders, and business groups. We should pass it quickly so we can move \non to other important work facing the Senate this month. But yesterday \nRepublicans threatened to derail this legislation, even though they \noverwhelmingly support it, and allow China to continue to tilt the \nplaying field.\n  Also up for debate this work period, which ends in 2 weeks, is \ncommonsense jobs legislation proposed by the President of the United \nStates. President Obama's plan would invest in roads, bridges, dams, \nand other construction efforts to create jobs. It would put \nconstruction crews back to work building and renovating schools. It \nwould extend unemployment insurance for Americans who are still \nstruggling to find work. In that regard, Mark Zandi, who certainly is \nno Democratic spokesperson--in fact, he was the economic adviser for \nJohn McCain's Presidential\n\n[[Page S6146]]\n\nelection--said there is no more important stimulus for the economy than \ngiving an unemployment check to somebody who is out of work. President \nObama's legislation would expand the payroll tax credit, which has been \nvery popular. It is a tax credit that will provide immediate relief to \nmiddle-class families and businesses. This legislation would revitalize \ncommunities that have been devastated by foreclosures.\n  The President's plan includes some ideas proposed by Republicans and \nothers offered by Democrats. No matter what, this legislation is fully \npaid for. We may have different ideas on how to pay for it, but we know \nthe President's legislation is a smart, effective way to spur job \ncreation.\n  Democrats have listened to the American people, and they have been \nvery clear. The American people believe it is time for millionaires and \nbillionaires to pay their fair share to help this country thrive. \nAmericans from every corner of the country and every walk of life \nagree. Democrats, Republicans, and Independents agree. Asked if they \nsupport a plan that would require people who make more than $1 million \na year to contribute a little more to ensure this country's economic \nsuccess, the results were resounding, stunningly strong: Nearly 80 \npercent of Americans said yes. Wealthy Americans agree. Two-thirds of \nthe people making more than $1 million a year said they would gladly \ncontribute more. A supermajority of Republicans agree, with two-thirds \nsaying they supported the idea. And even a majority--52 percent--of the \ntea party members agree. So when Democrats bring this commonsense jobs \nlegislation to the floor, we will ask Americans who make more than $1 \nmillion a year to contribute a little more to help this country reduce \nits jobs deficit.\n\n  I am sure my Republican colleagues would like the opportunity to \ndebate how this Congress tackles the most important issue facing our \nNation today: the unemployment crisis. So I will happily work with the \nRepublican leadership to ensure a fair process that gives Senators the \nopportunity to be heard. That is why I was so disappointed yesterday \nwhen my friend the Republican leader attempted to snuff out debate and \nprevent a bipartisan discussion about how to move the American Jobs Act \nforward. Rather than debating this bill on the floor as we usually do, \nhe wants to tack this important job creator onto an unrelated measure \nsimply as an afterthought.\n  I was willing to proceed to debate on the legislation yesterday, but \nthe Republicans blocked that request. They even blocked that. Instead, \nthey demanded an immediate up-or-down vote, with no opportunity for \ndebate, discussion, or amendments. Again and again during the last few \nweeks, Republicans have rejected an all-or-nothing approach to this \nlegislation. So imagine my surprise when they were unwilling to engage \nin the thoughtful debate this bill deserves. Instead, they took the \nvery all-or-nothing approach they were so concerned about only a few \nhours earlier.\n  This Nation's unemployment crisis is very serious business, but \nRepublicans are more interested, it seems, in partisan games much of \nthe time and political stunts than serious legislating. Fourteen \nmillion unemployed Americans deserve better. We live in a nation \nfounded on the principle that every American has a right to personal \nliberty. But if Franklin Roosevelt was correct that no man is free who \nlacks economic security--and I am confident he was right--then we must \ndo better as a Congress and as a country. I assure everyone within the \nsound of my voice that Democrats will do whatever we can to heal our \nailing economy, even if it means the richest of the rich in America \nhave to contribute a little bit more tomorrow than they do today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/05/senate-section/article/S6146-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6146]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, for the past 3 weeks President Obama \nhas been racing around the country trying to rally public support for a \nsecond stimulus bill and demanding that Congress pass it right away. \nThe President has not been demanding that Congress debate the bill or \nbe allowed to amend the bill. He has demanded in no uncertain terms \nthat we hold a vote on the bill as it is, right away.\n  A couple weeks ago in Denver, the President said he has the pens all \nready, lined up on his desk, ready to sign the bill into law. Just \nyesterday in Texas, he called on Congress to put the bill up for a vote \nso the entire country knows exactly where every Member of Congress \nstands. One of the President's top advisers, David Axelrod, summed up \nthe President's position this way: ``We want them to act now on this \npackage,'' David Axelrod said. ``We're not in negotiations to break up \nthe package. It's not an a la carte menu.''\n  So yesterday I tested the President's rhetoric. I proposed that we do \nexactly what he wants and vote right away on this second stimulus bill \nhe has proposed as the supposed solution to our jobs crisis. And the \nDemocrats blocked it. In other words, the President's own party is the \nonly obstacle to having a vote on his so-called jobs bill. Now I \nunderstand our Democratic friends want to jettison entire parts of the \nbill altogether, not to make it more effective at growing jobs, not to \ngrow bipartisan support. No, they want to overhaul the bill to sharpen \nits political edge. So my suggestion to the White House is that if the \nPresident wants to keep traveling around the country demanding a vote \non this second stimulus, he focus his criticism on Democrats, not \nRepublicans, because they are the ones who are now standing in the way \nof an immediate vote on this legislation.\n  But, of course, the President knew as well as I did that many \nDemocrats in Congress do not like the bill any more than Republicans \ndo. Despite his rhetoric, he knew Republicans were not the only \nobstacle, which means one thing: The President is not engaged right now \nin a good-faith effort to spur the economy or create jobs through \nlegislation. He is engaged in a reelection campaign. By the way, the \nelection is not until 14 months from now.\n  Madam President, 1.7 million Americans have lost jobs since the \nPresident signed his first stimulus, and his idea of a solution is to \npropose another one. Even Democrats know it is a nonstarter, which is \nwhy so many of them do not want to have to vote for it. That is what we \nall witnessed here in the Senate yesterday.\n  It is time the President put an end to this charade. Stop campaigning \nfor a bill written in a way to guarantee it will not pass and work with \nus on the kind of job-creating legislation both parties can agree on, \nthings such as the trade bills, rolling back overburdensome \nregulations, domestic energy production, and tax reform. Republicans \nare ready to act on any and all of those issues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/05/senate-section/article/S6146-3", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6146-S6147]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, it has come to my attention that the \nmajority leader has written to the chairman and ranking member of the \nArmed Services Committee asking them to modify the committee-reported \nNational Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2012 before he will \nallow the Senate to consider that bill.\n  The White House has made it clear that it objects to certain \nprovisions dealing with the detention of unlawful enemy combatants and \ncaptured members of al-Qaida and associated groups. As the ranking \nmember of the Armed Services Committee explained to the Senate, the \ncommittee voted in favor of those provisions overwhelmingly.\n  My request to the majority leader would be to move to the National \nDefense Authorization Act at the soonest possible moment to allow the \nSenate to debate and amend the bill. If there are Members on the other \nside who support the White House's effort to bring unlawful enemy \ncombatants into the United States for purposes of detention and \ncivilian trial, the Senate can debate that matter during consideration \nof the bill. I know many Members on my side would very much appreciate \na debate on the importance of keeping detainees currently held at \nGuantanamo from returning to the battlefield, especially in places such \nas Yemen.\n  Once the Senate completes consideration of the Defense Authorization \nAct,\n\n[[Page S6147]]\n\nit could then move to consideration of the Defense appropriations \nbill--another measure I assume would be subject to debate and \namendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/05/senate-section/article/S6147-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6147]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      IN MEMORY OF OWSLEY BROWN II\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ngreat friend of the city of Louisville, a giant in both business and \nphilanthropy who made Kentucky products famous around the globe, and a \nman whom I was proud to call a friend for more than 30 years. It is \nwith great sadness that I report to my Senate colleagues that Owsley \nBrown II of Louisville, KY, passed away September 26 at the age of 69. \nHe will be mourned and missed by many, not only by his family and those \nfortunate enough to know him but also by the countless Louisvillians \nwho did not get to meet the man personally but benefited from his \nnumerous volunteer efforts and initiatives on behalf of our community.\n  Owsley Brown II was born in 1942, the son of William Lee Lyons Brown \nand Sally Shallenberger Brown, who herself passed away just a few \nmonths ago at the age of 100, as I noted at the time on the Senate \nfloor. After graduating from Yale University and Stanford University's \nGraduate School of Business, Owsley spent 37 years at Brown Forman, the \ncompany his great-grandfather founded, including 12 years as chief \nexecutive and 12 years as chairman. He started at Brown Forman in 1961 \nas a summer employee.\n  Owsley continued a family legacy that dates back to Brown Forman's \nfounding in 1870. Brown Forman is one of Louisville's most significant \ncompanies and a major corporate citizen of our community. It provides \nalmost 1,200 local jobs and still makes whiskey in Jefferson County.\n  As CEO, Owsley was a visionary in expanding the company's \ninternational footprint and modernizing the marketing of its brands. As \na result, labels such as Jack Daniel's and Southern Comfort are now \nrecognized worldwide. Under his leadership, Brown Forman stock more \nthan quadrupled in value.\n  But to describe Owsley as merely a businessman, even a brilliant one, \nwould be to just scrape the surface of the ice cube in a tall glass of \nOld Forester bourbon with water--Owsley's favorite drink. With his wife \nChristy, he did much to improve the quality and character of life in \nLouisville. He led organizations to support art and music, historic \npreservation and environmental protection. He was a leader in the \nfounding of Actors Theatre of Louisville and a longtime board member. \nHe served on the board of the Speed Art Museum and was active in the \nFund for the Arts and River Fields. His family's Owsley Brown \nCharitable Foundation, of which he was president, gave millions of \ndollars to local churches and community groups.\n  Owsley did a lot more than just write checks. He was passionately \ninvolved in everything he took part in. As the Actors Theatre board \npresident, he was often seen cleaning the windows or moving props. His \ndeep knowledge of art came in handy on visits to art fairs on behalf of \nthe Speed Art Museum. He could inspire others to donate more of their \ntime, efforts, and resources on behalf of the causes he cared so deeply \nabout just by setting the example.\n  I first met Owsley more than 30 years ago and saw then that he \nrepresented the very best Louisville and the Commonwealth of Kentucky \nhave to offer. Elaine and I send our deepest condolences to his family, \nincluding his wife Christy, his three children: Owsley III, Brooke \nBarzun, and Augusta Holland, and his many other beloved family members \nand friends.\n  Madam President, the Louisville Courier-Journal published recently an \nobituary of Owsley Brown II that only begins to describe a full life \nwell lived. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Courier-Journal, Sept. 29, 2011]\n\n                            Brown, Owsley II\n\n       Brown, Owsley II, 69, died September 26, 2011, in \n     Louisville with his family by his side.\n       Mr. Brown was born September 10, 1942, the son of William \n     Lee Lyons Brown and Sara ``Sally'' Shallenberger. He was a \n     graduate of Woodberry Forest School, Yale University, where \n     he received his B.A. in history in 1964, and Stanford \n     University's Graduate School of Business.\n       The great-grandson of Brown-Forman Corporation founder \n     George Garvin Brown, Owsley spent 37 years of his \n     professional life with the company, starting as a summer \n     employee in 1961. He became president in 1983, chief \n     executive officer from 1993-2005 and chairman from 1995 until \n     2007. While at the helm of the company, he led efforts to \n     dramatically expand its international presence and \n     significantly modernized its marketing efforts. The strategy \n     worked exceptionally well, as brands such as Jack Daniel's, \n     Southern Comfort and Finlandia became internationally \n     recognized names, producing stellar financial returns.\n       He served as an Army intelligence officer at the Pentagon \n     from 1966-1968 and in 2010 was appointed by the Obama \n     Administration to serve on the U.S. Department of Defense \n     Business Board. In addition to his service on the Brown-\n     Forman board, Owsley served on the board of NACCO Industries, \n     Inc.\n       Owsley was a leader in the founding of Actors Theatre of \n     Louisville and a longtime board member, twice serving as \n     president during major fund drives as it built its \n     facilities. He served on the boards of the Speed Art Museum, \n     where he most recently headed up the Capital Campaign and \n     Building Committee for its expansion; Fund for the Arts (as \n     chairman and president); Kentucky Center for the Performing \n     Arts; and Partnership for Creative Economies. Previous boards \n     he served on include River Fields, the Advisory Council of \n     the Yale School of Forestry and Environment and the National \n     Council of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. He \n     also served on the International Council of Trustees for the \n     World Conference of Religions for Peace. He was a former \n     director of the Louisville Gas and Electric Company and its \n     successor LG\n       He received the Governor's Milner Award, Kentucky's highest \n     award for contributions to the culture of his state, and this \n     year received the Woodrow Wilson Award for Corporate \n     Citizenship. Also this year he and his wife Christy received \n     the Greater Louisville Inc.'s Gold Cup Award for \n     distinguished service to Louisville. He earned the J. Russell \n     Groves Citizens Laureate Award, honoring individuals who \n     consistently encourage quality architecture in their \n     communities. His lifetime interest in historic preservation \n     was demonstrated in many projects, including the restoration \n     and expansion of Actors Theatre of Louisville.\n       He is survived by his wife, Christina Lee; son, Owsley III \n     (Victoire) and their children Chiara, William and Catalina; \n     daughters, Brooke Barzun (Matthew) and their children, \n     Jacques, Eleanor and Charles; and Augusta Holland (Gill) and \n     their children Cora, Owsley and Lila; brothers, W. L. Lyons \n     Brown Jr. (Alice Cary) and Martin S. Brown; sister, Ina Brown \n     Bond (Mac); brother-in-law, O'Donnell Lee (Jeanie); and \n     numerous nephews, nieces, great-nephews and great-nieces.\n       Owsley will be remembered as profoundly wise, earned from a \n     life of curiosity, honesty, and discipline. From his wisdom \n     flowed humility and passionate kindness. It made him a great \n     leader, father, husband and friend, and it made him a great \n     man.\n       He loved and supported the things that enrich the soul and \n     spirit--his wife and children, the creative arts, the natural \n     world, public-spirited enterprises, and, above all, \n     Louisville. Nothing pleased him more than bringing all these \n     things together at a party--welcoming all with his special \n     brand of Kentucky hospitality. He knew how to find joy in \n     work and obligations. Owsley knew when to listen and when to \n     laugh.\n       He will be missed.\n       The funeral will be celebrated 10 a.m. Friday at Christ \n     Church Cathedral, Episcopal, 421 S.

Madam President, our country has endured a 9-percent \nunemployment rate for a longer period of time than at any other time \nsince\n\n[[Page S6148]]\n\nthe Great Depression. Yet, unfortunately, the Democratic leader is \nreluctant to address this problem of joblessness in a serious way.\n  One way to address it would have been to take the three trade \nagreements, which were negotiated 4 and 5 years ago--one with Colombia, \none with South Korea, one with Panama--and send them up to the Senate \nand House and let us ratify them and let us move ahead to avoid losing \n350,000 jobs--that is an estimate of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce--or \ncreate as many as a quarter of a million jobs--that is the estimate of \nthe White House. Yet those three trade agreements had been sitting on \nthe President's desk since the day he took office nearly 3 years ago. \nThey arrived yesterday--or Monday, I suppose it was--and they are here \nwaiting for us to act on them.\n  Every day we do not act on them delays the day when we avoid losing \n350,000 jobs or create 250,000 jobs. That has been the case every day \nfor the last nearly 1,000 days. That would be a good way to address the \njobs issue, but we have not. Instead, we had the President going around \nthe country during the summer blaming Republicans for not acting on the \nthree trade agreements when, in fact, the President had not sent them \nto us. There is no way the Congress can act on them until the President \nforwards them, which he now has. And if he has, why are we not debating \nthem today? That would be a good way to deal with the jobs issue.\n  Here is another example. On September 8, the President came before \nthe Congress and proposed his jobs bill. He said, if I counted \ncorrectly, and I was sitting respectfully in the second row, almost in \nthe front row--I think he said as many as 17 times: Pass this jobs bill \nnow. And if that were not enough, he has said it almost every day since \nthen. The Republican leader mentioned it a few times. He was in Dallas \nyesterday. Pass this jobs bill now; I am ready to enact it, said the \nPresident of the United States. Well, it has been sitting there on the \nDemocratic leader's desk for the last couple of weeks, ever since the \nPresident sent it up here. He spoke about it on September 8.\n  The person in this body whose job it is to set the agenda is the \nDemocratic leader, a member of the President's own Democratic Party. \nWhy doesn't he bring it up? So yesterday the Republican leader said: I \nwill show courtesy to the President. I will ask the Senate to do what \nthe President has asked that we do, which is pass this jobs bill now, \nand the Democratic leader objected.\n  So here for the second time we have the President running around the \ncountry saying one thing, and then we try to do it, and his leader in \nthe Senate objects. What are we doing instead? Well, a couple weeks ago \nthe Democrats manufactured a crisis over disaster aid when we could \nhave been debating the trade bill, the jobs bill, and we could have \nbeen offering the Republican proposals we have to encourage trade, to \ngive this President and future Presidents new trade authority, to \nreform the tax law, and to have a timeout on regulations that are \nthrowing a big, wet blanket, making it more expensive and harder to \ncreate new jobs in America. That would have been the kind of debate we \ncould have had on the Republican proposals we believe would make a \ndifference in this urgent jobs situation which has given us 9-percent \nunemployment for a longer period of time than at any other time since \nthe Great Depression.\n  So now this week, what are we doing? Well, we are debating a piece of \nlegislation. The Democratic leader has decided this is the important \npiece of legislation to deal with jobs this week. And what will it do? \nIt will give a punch in the nose to China, our second largest trading \npartner, our third largest export market, our fastest growing export \nmarket, and the second largest economy in the world. History teaches us \nwhat will happen. We saw that during the Great Depression. Perhaps it \nwas the cause of the Great Depression. We remember the Smoot-Hawley \ntariff, the trade war that developed, the reciprocal punches in the \nnose that countries gave to themselves over trade, plunging the world \ninto a depression.\n  So here we are in a fragile moment, when headlines are saying we may \nbe about to dip into a second recession, and what do we do? The \nDemocratic majority says their best idea about creating jobs is to \npunch in the nose our second largest trade partner, our third largest \nexport market, and our fastest growing export market, even though we \nknow exactly what they will do to us. History teaches us they will \npunch us right back in the nose, and the result will be a trade war, \nwhich destroys jobs rather than creates jobs.\n  Such legislation as that now pending on this floor is not how the \nworld's strongest economy, the United States of America, should conduct \nitself. Such legislation is a sign of weakness or lack of self-\nconfidence or defeatism that is not worthy of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  In Tennessee, we see the advantages of trading with the world, \nincluding with China. China is our third largest export market, after \nCanada and Mexico. Our leading exports are chemicals and agricultural \nproducts. Tennessee exports to China totaled $1.85 billion, a 43-\npercent increase over 2009. A little over 7 percent of all of our \nexports went to China. In Tennessee, 116,000 jobs are related to the \nexport of manufactured goods; 5.3 million jobs in America. At a time of \njoblessness, why should we be punching in the nose someone to whom we \nmight sell goods and that would create jobs in the United States?\n  What should we do instead? Of course, there is legitimate concern \nabout the way China values its currency. The administration should work \nwith China to change that. China should accelerate the appreciation of \nits currency. But what else should the United States of America do? We \nmight take a lesson from history.\n  I remember 30 years ago, when I was just beginning my time as \nGovernor of Tennessee, China was not the country in the news. It was \nJapan. There were books written: Japan, No. 1. The United States was, \nas it is today, the world's largest economy, but everybody was \npredicting: Watch out for Japan. Japan is becoming No. 1. The United \nStates cannot keep up with Japan, it was said. Their autos, their \ncomputers, their electronic goods, their other sophisticated goods were \ngoing to overwhelm our markets, and we would quickly fall behind.\n  There was in the early 1980s a $46 billion trade deficit with Japan. \nWhat did we do? Well, we did not act defeatist. We did not play games. \nWe did not act as if we were the fifteenth largest economy in the world \ninstead of the first. We asserted ourselves. We went to Japan and said \nto them: Make in the United States what you sell in the United States \nand take down your trade barriers so we can sell in your country what \nwe make in ours.\n  I went there myself. I remember vividly going to Tokyo in 1979, in \nNovember. I met with the Nissan officials. They were considering \nlocating a manufacturing plant in the United States. At that time, they \nwere making all of the Nissan cars and all the Nissan trucks in Japan \nthat they sold in the United States. But they wanted to be in this \nmarket, which was and is the most profitable automobile market in the \nworld. So we said to them: Make here what you sell here. And they did. \nThey came to the United States. And where are we 30 years later? Nissan \nis saying to us that they have operated for 25 years now the most \nefficient automobile and truck plant in North America, and they are \ngoing to be making 85 percent of what they sell in the United States \nhere in the United States.\n  Nothing has done more to create higher incomes and better jobs in \nTennessee than the arrival of Nissan and the Japanese industry, \nfollowed by the American auto industry, in our State over the last 30 \nyears. That is how a strong and confident country asserts itself in \nworld competition. That is not just true with automobiles, it is true \nwith many other manufacturing companies that have come to our State \nfrom Japan and from other places. That is exactly the way we ought to \ndeal with China.\n  Our administration can assert itself in a variety of ways about the \ncurrency issue. But we should not act as though we are afraid of China \nanymore than we were afraid of Japan 30 years ago. We should seize this \nas a moment of opportunity. We should not escalate a trade war that no \none will win. We should grow trade in sales and investment in China and \nurge them to make\n\n[[Page S6149]]\n\nin the United States what they sell in the United States. If they \nshould do that, that will create jobs here rather than destroy jobs, as \nhistory teaches us a trade war will do.\n  I hope the Senate will decisively reject the legislation that is \nbeing proposed to initiate a trade war with China.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/05/senate-section/article/S6149-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6149-S6150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            REPEAL OBAMACARE\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, in February of last year, we had a \nfairly extraordinary event at the Blair House here in Washington. The \nPresident invited a large number of Members of Congress--must have been \n20 or 30 of us around the table. He sat there the whole day, and we sat \naround the table and we talked about health care. It was called the \nHealth Care Summit.\n  A great many Americans watched that live on television, and because \nof the Internet and other explosions of new media, they still watch \nsome of the things that were said that day. The reason I know that is \nbecause people have come up to me often and talked about an exchange I \nhad with the President of the United States.\n  The issue was about health care premiums in the individual market. \nCiting a Congressional Budget Office letter, I said to the President: \n``Mr. President, respectfully, your new health care law that you \npropose is going to increase individual premiums.''\n  He stopped me and said:\n\n       Now Lamar, let's get our facts straight. You are wrong \n     about that.\n\n  He proceeded to explain to me why I was wrong and he was right. With \nall respect, I believe I was right and even just a little year later, \nwhat the Congressional Budget Office was saying then, which was that \nindividual premiums would go up as a result of the health care law, the \nlast 17 months have shown that we were exactly right. This last week \nthe Kaiser Family Foundation released a survey that showed the average \nfamily premium for employer-sponsored insurance was $15,000 in 2011, a \n9-percent increase over the previous year. Let me quickly say that \nemployer-sponsored insurance is not the same as the individual \ninsurance I was talking about with the President a year ago. But it is \nthe same subject. Republicans were saying that we opposed the health \ncare bill because it would increase premiums, and what we wanted to do \nwas to lower the cost of health care for Americans by going step by \nstep in that direction rather than expanding an expensive health care \nsystem that was already too expensive for more Americans, and doing it \nin a way that would increase premiums for many Americans.\n  ABC News said the Kaiser Family Foundation report ``underlines that \nmany of the promises surrounding President Obama's health care \nlegislation remain unfulfilled. Though the White House argues that \nchange is coming.''\n  Even the New York Times on September 27 said: The steep increase in \nrates is particularly unwelcome at a time when the economy is still \nsputtering. Many businesses cite the high cost of coverage as a factor \nin their decision not to hire. And health insurance has become \nincreasingly unaffordable for many Americans.\n  I reported on this Senate floor my conversations with the chief \nexecutive officers of restaurant chains around the country. Together \nthey are the second largest employer in the country after the \ngovernment, and they employ a great many young people and low-income \npeople, the kind of men and women who are looking for jobs today. What \nthey were telling me was that the mandates of the health care law will \nmake it more difficult for them to hire people. In one specific \nexample, one of the largest of the restaurant chains was saying that he \noperates his store with 90 employees today, and because of the health \ncare mandates, he will seek to operate his store with 70 employees a \nday. That is not a way to increase the number of jobs.\n  But there are other provisions in the health care law that cause \npremiums to go up, which was the point of my discussion with the \nPresident in February of 2010.\n  The CMS Chief Actuary predicted in 2010, saying that by 2014--still a \ncouple of years away, 3 years away--growth in private health insurance \npremiums is expected to accelerate to 9.4 percent, 4.4 percent higher \nthan in the absence of health reform.\n  The President had said in his discussion with me that under the law \nhe proposed, the individual market would cost 40 to 20 percent less. \nThat was also in the Congressional Budget Office letter. But those \nreductions were overwhelmed by other costs that were identified in the \nCBO letter that would produce a 27- to 30-percent increase. So the net \nresult, according to the predictions in November 2009 by \nthe Congressional Budget Office, was there would be an increase in \nindividual premiums of 10 to 13 percent.\n\n  These individual market premiums, premiums that individuals buy \nwithout an employer's help, are not the largest share of insurance \npolicies in America, but they affect roughly 12 to 15 million \nAmericans. That is a lot of people who are having their insurance costs \ngo up.\n  Aon Hewitt's recently released 2011 Health Insurance Trend Driver \nSurvey reports that for 2011, individual health care plans reported \nestimated 4.7-percent increases directly due to the new health care \nlaw.\n  Then according to the September 8, 2010 Wall Street Journal article:\n\n       Health insurers say they plan to raise premiums for some \n     Americans as a direct result of the health overhaul in coming \n     weeks, complicating Democrats' efforts to trumpet their \n     significant achievement before the mid-term elections. Aetna, \n     some Blue Cross Blue Shield plans and other smaller carriers \n     have asked for premium increases of between 1 and 9 percent \n     to pay for extra benefits required under the law.\n\n  In the same article it says Aetna said that extra benefits forced it \nto seek rate increases for individual plans of 5 to 7 percent in \nCalifornia, and 5.5 to 6 to 8 percent in Nevada. That was precisely the \ndiscussion I was having with the President in February 2010, when I \nsaid that under the health care law, because of the mandates in the \nlaw, individual health care premium costs will go up.\n  In Wisconsin and North Carolina, according to that same article, \nCeltic Insurance Company says half of the 18-percent increase it is \nseeking comes from complying with health care mandates.\n  Then in a September 16 article last year in the Hartford Courant, \nConnectiCare is seeking an average 22-percent hike for its individual \nmarket HMO plans. Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield in Connecticut say \nin a letter, it expects the Federal health reform law to increase rates \nby as much as 22.9 percent for just a single provision.\n  These increases happen for predictable reasons. Because of the \nrequirements in the law for minimum credible coverage--in other words, \nif you are required to buy a better kind of health insurance, if you \nare required to buy a Cadillac instead of a Chevrolet, it is going cost \nmore. And it does cost more.\n  Another factor that will cause insurance premiums to rise is the new \ntaxes on insurance, lifesaving medical devices and medicines in the \nhealth reform law. Someone has to pay for those costs, and the ones who \nare going to pay for them are the people who buy health insurance.\n  Then there is the question of what we call cost shift. When we add 25 \nmillion Americans to Medicaid, premiums will increase because the costs \nwill shift to private insurers to help pay for those costs. That is \naccording to the Chief Actuary of CMS which is in this administration.\n  Then, finally, age rating is going to cause insurance premiums to go \nup. What it basically says is that older Americans will not have to pay \nas much, so younger Americans are going to have to pay more. It is no \nsurprise that under the new health care law, health insurance premiums \nare going up, becoming an even bigger drag on employment and on family \nbudgets. This was predicted by the Congressional Budget Office while we \nwere debating the health care law. It was predicted by Republicans who \noffered an alternative to take steps to decrease costs in health care, \ninstead of this big, comprehensive law that expanded the system that \nalready costs too much.\n  It offers even more reasons why we should repeal or make significant \nchanges in the health care law if we want to create an environment in \nwhich we can make it easier and cheaper to grow private sector jobs, \nand in which more Americans can afford a reasonable cost health \ninsurance.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S6150]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. It is rare that I am down here on the floor with the \nsenior Senator from Tennessee, but it is always a pleasure.

The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, as a cosponsor, I rise today in strong \nsupport of the Currency Exchange Rate Oversight Reform Act. This is a \nbipartisan effort that will protect U.S. manufacturers from economic \nharm caused by unfair and damaging currency manipulation.\n  Unemployment throughout Rhode Island and the Nation has been \npersistently high and corrosive. It is caused in part by the effects of \ncurrency manipulation, particularly China's devaluation of the yuan. \nThis is one of the challenges that manufacturers and hard-working \nindividuals in Rhode Island and across the Nation face each day.\n  The effects of unfair currency manipulation have caused far too much \nharm for far too long. It has resulted in distorted trade balances that \nhurt U.S. workers and our Nation's economy as a whole.\n  Confronting Chinese currency manipulation sends a very strong signal. \nIf implemented correctly, it will create jobs, aid our economic \nrecovery, and lead to the creation of an estimated 1.6 million American \njobs. Free trade only works when it is fair. China is not playing by \nthe rules, and U.S. workers are harmed as a result.\n  China is, by any measure, keeping its currency artificially weak and \nengaging in trade practices that are harming the U.S. economy. By \ndevaluing the yuan relative to the dollar, China is essentially \nsubsidizing its exports and taxing U.S. imports at the expense of U.S. \ncompanies and workers.\n  It has been estimated that the yuan is undervalued relative to the \ndollar by as much as 40 percent, effectively subsidizing Chinese \nmanufacturers and spurring our $273 billion trade deficit with China.\n  The Economic Policy Institute has estimated that the trade deficit \nwith China has cost the U.S. economy 2.8 million jobs--1.9 million of \nthese were manufacturing jobs--between 2001 and 2010. This resulted in \napproximately 12,000 jobs lost in Rhode Island.\n  A recent study by a team of three economists confirmed what many in \nmy State already know: Jobs in Rhode Island are among the most \nvulnerable to cheap Chinese imports. And job losses are directly \nattributable to the U.S. trade deficit with China, which has been \nexacerbated by China's persistently undervalued currency.\n  Our trade deficit with China, which grew over 10 years from $83 \nbillion to $273 billion, has had an outsized impact on my State because \nChinese goods compete directly with many products that were produced \nand that will continue to be produced in Rhode Island. From textiles to \ntoys, Rhode Island has been harmed as the artificially cheap yuan and \nexports from China have hollowed out industries, jobs, and communities.\n  If China and other Asian economies such as Singapore, Taiwan, \nMalaysia, and Hong Kong let their currency float freely against the \ndollar, U.S. GDP would increase by as much as $287.5 billion, that is a \n1.9-percent increase, creating up to 2.25 million jobs in the United \nStates.\n  So much of our efforts are focused today, and they should be, on \ngrowing our economy, measured not just by GDP but, more importantly, by \njobs. This bill is one of those measures that is consistent with \ngrowing jobs in America and also respects the fact that in order for \ntrade to work in the world, the trade has to be fair as well as free--\nthat everybody has to follow the rules, and there is no exception. What \nwe expect of ourselves, we should demand of others. That is at the \nheart of this bill.\n  Currently, private businesses in the United States are not able to \ncompete on a level playing field with Chinese manufacturers and \nexporters who have an unfair advantage because the Chinese Government \nis manipulating its currency. Undervaluing the yuan isn't even in the \nbest interest of the Chinese economy because it wastes resources and \nerodes wages of Chinese workers. The benefits of an undervalued yuan \nprimarily flow to politically powerful Chinese companies dependent on \ntrade, many of which are state owned.\n  According to China's own national economic census, Chinese state-\nowned enterprises control over 40 percent of the assets in their \nindustrial sector. When countries stack the deck for companies and \nindustries they control, it hurts businesses in the United States. This \nis not free trade or fair trade. Those who hold up China's economic \ngrowth and favorable tax conditions, as one Fortune 500 company CEO \nrecently did, should realize this: After all, China has little reason \nto tax corporations when so many of the country's largest corporations \nare state owned.\n  We would not dare to suggest the form of ownership or government \nintervention in our economy China uses consistently and persistently as \na major way to fund their government and fund their activities. So I \nthink we have to recognize what is being posed in the guise of their \nversion of free trade.\n  It is not fair trade, it is not free trade, and it doesn't even help \nthe people of China. But it certainly helps the powerful forces of the \nChinese Government and their favored business partners.\n  So we have a clear choice, and we have legislation that will be \neffective because it is consistent with what we do, which is follow the \nrules. We are simply asking every nation to follow the rules when it \ncomes to currency.\n  The legislation before us today would level the playing field for \nbusinesses in Rhode Island and throughout the country. It requires the \nDepartment of Treasury to identify misaligned currencies using \nobjective criteria and requires the administration to take action if \ncountries fail to correct this misalignment.\n  It ensures that our trade laws can address currency undervaluation \nwhen it harms American workers and manufacturers by offsetting the \nbenefit foreign producers and exporters receive from their country's \ncurrency manipulation.\n  The effects of unfair currency manipulation have caused far too much \nharm for far too long. It has resulted in distorted trade balances that \nhave hurt U.S. workers and our Nation's economy as a whole. This \nlegislation will strengthen the tools we have to make sure our \nbusinesses can compete on a fair and level playing field against \nforeign companies that benefit from undervalued currency.\n  Let me be clear that this is not a silver bullet for our economy, and \nthere are many other steps we have to take. As we continue to press for \nsolutions to revitalize our economy--with a front-and-center focus on \nsaving and creating jobs--addressing unfair subsidies and trade \npractices must be part of this effort. So I would urge swift passage of \nthe Currency Exchange Rate Oversight Reform Act.\n\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I rise as a proud cosponsor of the \nCurrency Exchange Rate Oversight Reform Act, S. 1619. We are all aware, \nin this Chamber and around the country, that China has been \nmanipulating its currency flagrantly and blatantly at the expense of \nour businesses in Connecticut and New York and around the country at \nthe expense of American workers. This measure is necessary to protect \nAmerican jobs and American workers.\n  Chinese currency manipulation is a job killer, very simply. At a time \nwhen so many are desperate for work and so many Americans and citizens \nof Connecticut are seeking good jobs, this\n\n[[Page S6151]]\n\nmeasure will help protect American workers and save American jobs, \nwhich is why I am proud to be a cosponsor of this measure.\n  I am proud to have begun this fight well before I became a Senator \nand well before I even thought of becoming a Senator, when I was \nattorney general of the State of Connecticut, because I heard from \nConnecticut businesses about the effects of Chinese currency \nmanipulation in their efforts to sell their goods and services not only \nin China but around the world and even in America. Undervaluing Chinese \ncurrency puts American businesses at a disadvantage. It is a hidden \nexport subsidy. It is a means of underpricing Chinese goods and \nservices at the expense of ours. That affects not only our exports to \nChina, but it affects our sales of airplanes in Europe, it affects the \nsales of all kinds of products--both high-tech and others--in this \ncountry, and it deprives the United States and its businesses of a \nlevel playing field.\n  The extent of that undervaluation is actually unknown, even as we \nspeak. It is probably in the range of 25 percent. Economists tell us it \nis anywhere between 20 percent and 50 percent. The Chinese have \npermitted their currency to rise slowly, perhaps about 6 percent since \nJune of 2010, but the extreme undervaluation before that period of \ntime--in the years that led to June 2010--was relentless and tireless \nand successful. One of the great success stories of currency \nundervaluation is the Chinese doing so with theirs. We are at a point \nwhere, rightly, we have lost patience.\n  When I first asked the Treasury of the United States to label and \nconclude that China is a currency manipulator--months, even years ago--\nthere was an opportunity to take the kind of action this measure would \nreadily lead it to do, and it must do it now. This bill provides \nconsequences for countries that fail to adopt appropriate policies to \neliminate currency misalignment and includes tools to address the \nimpact of currency misalignment on American manufacturers, including \nthe use of countervailing duty law to impose tariffs on imports \nbenefiting from government subsidies.\n  Very simply, it provides tools that the American Government can and \nshould use when there are misalignments of currency that result from \ngovernment policies, and it eliminates some of the barriers in our \ncurrent law that now exist and restrict the American Government from \ntaking action to protect American businesses. So it is a good measure, \na commonsense step toward fairness and a level playing field for \nAmerican businesses, and it means we would protect ourselves, as we \nhave a right to do in an ongoing trade war. It is a war, not a shooting \nwar--perhaps not explicit--but it is a trade war we should acknowledge \nand recognize as a fact of life for our businesses.\n  All this talk about currency and renminbi and the abstract and \nseemingly arcane discussion, in economic terms, may seem far away to \nmany citizens of Connecticut, but it is not arcane or abstract to Steve \nWilson at Crescent Manufacturing of Burlington--a company that makes \nprecision fasteners, many of them used in defense of our country, sold \nin this country as well as abroad. Crescent Manufacturing has hard-\nworking, skilled workers who compete with Chinese manufacturers whose \nproduction costs are dramatically lower because of the undervalued \nChinese currency. Steve Wilson came to me and said, in effect: Give us \na level playing field. That is what this bill does. He said it not only \non his own behalf, as a manager and an owner, but on behalf of his \nworkers because the number of those workers was reduced as a result of \nthe lack of a level playing field.\n  Earlier this year, I worked with my colleague in the House of \nRepresentatives, Congressman Chris Murphy, to conduct a survey of \nConnecticut manufacturers. We gathered data from 151 different \ncompanies all across the State of Connecticut, and the information they \nshared paints a dramatic picture of the business climate for companies \nin Connecticut and America today and the challenges they face as they \nseek to create jobs and stay competitive. Of 151 manufacturers that \nparticipated in our survey, 73 percent say they have Chinese \ncompetition--73 percent are competing with Chinese companies--and 57 \npercent--almost 60 percent of all those companies--said China's refusal \nto operate on a level playing field is harming their businesses. The \nmajority of those companies that responded to that survey--\nmanufacturers in Connecticut--say they want a level playing field or \nthey are harmed by unfair practices in China's undervaluing their \ncurrency.\n  We all know, at this point, China deliberately manipulates its \ncurrency to boost its exports, and Connecticut manufacturers know it \nbetter than anyone. They have made it clear, if we are serious about \nkeeping American manufacturing competitive, if we want to make it in \nAmerica, if we want ``Made in America'' to mean what it should, and if \nwe want our economy to grow, we need to stand up to countries that rig \nthe system in their favor--unfairly in their favor.\n  The Alliance for American Manufacturing estimates our surging trade \ndeficit with China--largely caused by Chinese currency manipulation--\ncost 2.8 million American jobs over the last decade, and that is 31,600 \nin Connecticut alone. These were jobs lost to our workers unfairly.\n  On March 25, 2011, the IMF declared that China's currency remains \n``substantially undervalued.'' That is a serious charge from an \ninternational agency that is not biased toward one country or another, \nand it implies that China, in failing to address the undervaluing of \ntheir currency, is in direct violation of the General Agreement on \nTariffs and Trade, which it has signed. Far from being contradictory to \ninternational law, this bill serves the interests and intent of the \nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. It serves article XXI of the \nGATT Uruguay Round and allows a member of the World Trade Organization \nand America to take action which it considers necessary for the \nprotection of essential security interests.\n  Nothing is more essential to our security than jobs. Nothing is more \ncritical than dealing with our trade deficit. Nothing is more important \nthan stopping the undervaluation of the Chinese currency that \nconsistently, unfairly, and unacceptably works against our exporters. \nWe must fight these fundamentally unfair trade practices of China. \nAmerican manufacturers deserve this level playing field, and this bill \nwill help to assure that for them.\n  I will continue to fight to protect Connecticut manufacturers and \nbusinesses against any unfair trade practices anywhere in the world, \nand this bill stops China and any other country that would misalign its \ncurrency to the detriment of our security as a country and \nConnecticut's manufacturers and businesses as well as those in the \ncountry as a whole.\n  I thank the Chair, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Madam President, I come to the floor as one of a \nbipartisan group of my colleagues, proud to be a cosponsor of the \nCurrency Exchange Rate Oversight Act, legislation that will send a \nclear and direct message to China that the time for playing games with \nAmerican jobs is over.\n  As many of my colleagues have already explained on the floor, the \neffects of China's currency manipulation are damaging to our economy. \nIt is estimated that China is undervaluing their yuan by more than 28 \npercent.\n  What does that mean? It means Chinese goods coming into the United \nStates are unfairly cheap, while goods made in the United States are \nunfairly expensive when they are exported to China. In other words, it \nmeans U.S. goods are less competitive in China, and Chinese goods do \nhave an unfair advantage in the United States. The results of this \ndistorted arrangement are harrowing: reduced American wages, decreased \nGDP, and lost American jobs.\n  Since China entered the World Trade Organization in 2001, our trade \ndeficit with them went from $84 billion in 2001 to $273 billion in \n2010, an increase of\n\n[[Page S6152]]\n\nclose to $200 billion. Madam President, $273 billion is larger than the \nU.S. trade deficit with the OPEC countries, the EU countries, Canada, \nJapan, and Mexico combined. This trade deficit has eliminated or \ndisplaced over 2.8 million American jobs over the last 10 years. That \nis an average of 310,000 jobs every year, and 70 percent of those jobs \nlost from our trade with China were in one sector--manufacturing.\n  Ask anyone in my home State, and they will say the same thing: North \nCarolina is a manufacturing State. From furniture to yarn, we are known \nthroughout the country and throughout the world for the quality of the \nwork we produce. But we are hurting. Between 2001 and 2010, North \nCarolina has lost over 107,000 jobs. Those are 107,000 jobs due to \ntrade with China. Only five States in the entire country have suffered \na greater net job loss from our country's trade with China. Across the \ncountry, the Nation has lost approximately 6 million manufacturing jobs \nand has seen 57,000 manufacturing plants across our country shut down.\n  Last week, I traveled throughout the foothill regions in North \nCarolina, in Burke, Rutherford, and Gaston Counties, three of our \ncounties with some of the deepest manufacturing and textile roots in \nthe State. The unemployment rate in these counties is close to 13 \npercent in Burke, close to 15 percent in Rutherford, and 11.3 percent \nin Gaston, even higher than the all-too-high 10.4 percent average \nacross the State of North Carolina.\n  The No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 concerns I heard at every stop I made \nlast week were: jobs, jobs, jobs. There were people, many of them \nformer manufacturing employees, who have lost their jobs. Many of them \nare continuing to work hard, fighting for small businesses that they \nnow run and looking for survival. At the same time, so many people are \nattending every job fair they can make. They cannot afford for \nWashington to continue to allow China to get away with economic deceit \nand manipulation. They cannot afford for us to continue competing with \nChina with one hand tied behind our back. What they need is for \nWashington to draw a hard line, to act now, and to get tough on China's \ncurrency manipulation.\n  The Currency Exchange Rate Oversight Act is straightforward. If the \nTreasury Department, using objective criteria, determines that the \nvalue of a currency is fundamentally misaligned, it will trigger a \nprocess to correct that unfair misalignment. In other words, it allows \nthe United States to use every tool in our toolbox, including \ncountervailing duties, to ensure that American workers and companies \nare competing on a level playing field.\n  Even though the legislation is simple, its positive effects would \nripple through the economy.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. I ask for 2 more minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. I thank you, Madam President.\n  A full revaluation of the yuan would mean 2.25 million jobs in the \nUnited States, reducing the U.S. unemployment rate by at least 1 full \npercentage point; an increase of the U.S. GDP of about $285 billion, a \nnearly 2-percent boost; and a reduction to our budget deficit by as \nmuch as $857 billion over 10 years. These are new jobs, more growth, \nand lower deficits. That is exactly the kind of bill our country needs \nright now.\n  It is going to require us to be tough. That is why America's workers \nand North Carolina workers need us to draw this line in the sand. They \nhave always been told that if they work hard and play by the rules, \nthey can get ahead. But now China is not playing by the rules, and it \nis undermining the ability of our workers and companies to succeed. We \nneed to hold them accountable.\n  American and North Carolina workers are some of the best and most \nproductive in the world. We know this. China knows this. If we compete \non a level playing field, we can prosper together. I encourage all my \ncolleagues to join in this bipartisan measure and vote for this bill. \nIt is what America's workers and companies need, and it is what they \ndeserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/05/senate-section/article/S6152-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I rise to urge my colleagues to support \nthe Currency Exchange Rate Oversight Reform Act, S. 1619, of which I am \nproud to be an original cosponsor. I wish to thank my colleague and \nfriend, Mr. Brown, the Senator from Ohio, for his leadership in \nbringing forward this very important legislation.\n  This legislation is about jobs. We all talk about ways we can \nincrease job opportunity in America. Yes, we have to do a better job in \nour infrastructure and rebuilding America, our roads, our bridges, our \nschools, our energy infrastructure, our water infrastructure. That is a \nvery important part of job growth in America. We have to help our small \nbusinesses.\n\n  The President is right to focus a program that will help small \nbusinesses because that is the job growth energy in America. But \nanother area that is critically important for us on job growth is \ntrade.\n  I represent the State of Maryland. The Port of Baltimore is an \neconomic engine of our State, where we employ many people because of \nthe Port of Baltimore. We want to see products that not only come into \nAmerica, but we want to see products that leave America for the \ninternational marketplace. American manufacturers, producers, and \nfarmers can outcompete their competition anywhere in the world as long \nas we have a level playing field. If we have a level playing field, we \nwill not only keep jobs in America, we will create new jobs in America \nbecause we can outcompete the world. But we can't do it if we give away \na huge advantage to other countries. Currency manipulation allows other \ncountries to have unfair competitive advantage over American \nmanufacturers, producers, and farmers. That is what this bill is aimed \nat: to give us a level playing field, to allow us to be able to compete \nfairly.\n  I also wish to acknowledge that this legislation is bipartisan. I \nthink it is nonpartisan. This is legislation that makes sense for our \ncountry to keep jobs and create jobs. The legislation provides \nnecessary mechanisms to help halt currency manipulation committed by \nany country. Currency manipulation is an unfair trade practice that \nreduces the price of imported goods while raising the price of American \ngoods.\n  We are talking about giving a discount to our competitors. How do we \nexpect an American manufacturer to be able to compete with an imported \nproduct if they get a discount on the price? That is what happens when \nthey arbitrarily undervalue their currency as a foreign competitor, and \nthat is what is happening to American manufacturers. Trying to end this \npractice is just common sense and will finally allow us to address our \nnet exports, helping us reduce trade imbalances and, most importantly, \ncreate jobs in America.\n  Of course, China is one of the largest abusers of this type of \nmanipulation. Despite a pledge from China in 2001 to adhere to open and \nfair trade, it continues to violate global trade rules which, in turn, \nerodes the U.S. manufacturing base and economy.\n\n[[Page S6153]]\n\n  One of these market-distorting practices is China's effort to keep \nits currency severely undervalued. Unlike other currencies, the Chinese \nyuan does not fluctuate freely against the dollar but is artificially \npegged in order to boost China's exports. Bringing the Chinese yuan to \nits equilibrium level at 28.5 appreciation is essential to creating \nmuch needed jobs in this country as well as a fair and global \nmarketplace.\n  Let me repeat this. Because of what China does on pegging its \ncurrency to ours, not allowing it to freely fluctuate, Chinese \nproducts, in effect, get a 28.5-percent discount. If a company is \nmanufacturing a product and trying to compete with an imported Chinese \nproduct, how can they do that if their competitor gets a 28.5-percent \ndiscount? That is what is happening in America today.\n  This legislation would allow those who are being harmed by this \nunfair trade practice to be able to bring a trade remedy against that \nunfairly imported product.\n  Inexpensive Chinese imports have caused a great deal of harm to the \nU.S. manufacturing sector. New studies show that 2.8 million American \njobs, including 1.9 million manufacturing jobs, were lost or displaced \nover the past decade due to the growing U.S. trade deficit with China, \nfueled, in part, by currency manipulation.\n  So we have documented millions of jobs that we have lost and that \nhave been lost because we have allowed, without challenge, China to \ngive discounts to its manufacturers bringing products into America. \nAgain, if it is a level playing field, American manufacturers and \nproducers can compete. But they can't compete with such an unfair \ntrading practice.\n  Many U.S. industries have been hard hit by unfair trade practices and \ncurrency manipulation, impeding their ability to compete here and \nabroad. The Alliance for American Manufacturing says that addressing \nthis currency manipulation would lead to the creation of up to 2.25 \nmillion American jobs, an increase in the U.S. gross domestic product \nof $285.7 billion, a 1.9-percent--or $190 billion--reduction in our \nannual trade deficit; finally, an annual deficit of $71 billion, or \nbetween $600 to $800 billion over the next 10 years, if sustained.\n\n  No wonder this is bipartisan. No wonder this is nonpartisan. Here, by \njust standing up for American manufacturers and allowing them to be on \na level playing field, we can not only increase jobs in America, we can \nnot only reduce the trade imbalance, we can also reduce the budget \nimbalance. All that can be done if we can establish a level playing \nfield to give our manufacturers, producers, and farmers the opportunity \nto challenge this unfair practice. That is what this legislation does.\n  With figures such as this, this bill is seemingly a noncost, \nbipartisan, long-term jobs measure. This would not only spur economic \ngrowth but economic stability that would ensure a better and more \nsecure future for U.S. manufacturers, workers, and communities. This is \nto keep jobs here in America but also give us the opportunity to create \nmore jobs, helping our economy grow. Simply put, this legislation will \nallow U.S. manufacturers the ability to use existing countervailing \nduty laws to obtain relief from injury caused by imported goods which \nbenefit from currency manipulation as export subsidies while also \nproviding the U.S. Treasury a new framework by which to identify \nmisaligned currency.\n  In September 2010, the House adopted a similar measure with \noverwhelming bipartisan support. Passage here in the Senate will lead \nto real consequences for countries that abuse currency manipulation, \nand empower the United States to create a more level economic playing \nfield.\n  We can get this done. This is something that can get done. The House \nhas already passed it. We have bipartisan support in the Senate. We \nhave the votes to pass it. I urge my colleagues, let us get this done. \nDon't try to put other amendments on it. All they are going to do is \nmake it difficult for us to achieve something great for our economy and \ngreat for American production. Let's get this matter up for a vote and \nnot try to do all these unrelated amendments.\n  I applaud my colleague Senator Brown from Ohio. He is on the floor. I \nmentioned earlier I thank him for his leadership for not only bringing \nthis bill together but keeping the bipartisan group together so we can \nshow we can get this done. Now we need the Members of the Senate to say \nit is time for us to vote on this bill. Let's get it done. Let's send \nit to the President for the President to sign it. Let's do something \nthat will not only create jobs but help us deal with our trade \nimbalance and deal with our budget imbalance.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I appreciate the words of Senator \nCardin. He sits on the Finance Committee and was a long-time member of \nthe House Ways and Means Committee and understands these issues as well \nor better than almost any Member of the Senate. I appreciate his work \non that, and his leadership. He said a couple of things I want to \nemphasize.\n  He said, first of all, this is the biggest bipartisan jobs bill we \nhave considered this year, 79 votes out of 98 when it advanced to being \nconsidered on the Senate floor. He has talked about this is a discount \nwe give to our competitors. Imagine two gas stations in Schenectady, \nNY, or in Frederick, MD, or in Akron, OH. One gets its gasoline and \npays 25 or 30 percent less for its gasoline than does the station \nacross the street. The station that does not get the 25- or 30-or 35-\npercent subsidy goes out of business almost in a matter of days. That \nis the kind of unfair competition we face because we have given this \ndiscount to our competitors.\n  The second is Senator Cardin mentioned what this does with our budget \ndeficit. It is pretty clear this is not a jobs bill that costs a lot of \nmoney. That is why we got 79 votes. That is why so many Republicans \njoined all but three Democrats in moving this bill forward. We save \nmoney. If a thousand more people go to work in Cleveland, OH, or in \nBuffalo, NY, or in Baltimore, MD, that is a thousand people who are not \nreceiving unemployment benefits, who do not have to apply for food \nstamps, a thousand people who are paying taxes instead of being \nconsumers of public services.\n  When you look at the lost jobs because of this trade policy, because \nChina has gamed the currency system for so many years and \nadministrations of both parties have failed to enforce laws or use the \ntools they have--in addition to this extra tool, this very compelling, \nvery effective tool we are giving them--it clearly has meant that we \nhave been behind the eight ball in that way and we have lost the \nopportunity when we have not enforced these trade laws.\n  When you look at the number of jobs lost and the number of jobs \nestimated to be gained, it is in the millions over time. This is \nexactly what the Senate should be doing this week, moving this bill to \nthe House. There are 250 cosponsors in the House, 60 Republicans, \nroughly, 190 Democrats, roughly. Republican leadership has some \ndifficulty with this bill, apparently. In the Senate, that is not an \nissue. In the House, among rank-and-file Members there is huge support.\n  As we pass this bill later this week, next week at the latest, we \nhope to move it to the House where it can be passed quickly.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, as the manager of this bill and the \nsponsor of S. 1619, I am, first of all, pleased with the bipartisan \nsupport we have seen. We have five Republican and five Democratic \nsponsors as the lead 10 sponsors and another dozen or so sponsors in \naddition to that.\n  The support from Senators Graham and Sessions and Burr--all three \nsouthern Republicans--and Senators Snowe and Collins--northern \nRepublicans--joining with the first five Democratic sponsors, Senators \nSchumer, Stabenow, Casey, Hagan, and myself, have set the bipartisan \ntone here. That is why we had 79 votes in the first go-round on the \nbill.\n\n[[Page S6154]]\n\n  But what concerns me most, and what I hear from people in the House \nof Representatives--and I have heard it from opponents in the Senate, \nand I have heard it from large multinational corporations that have \noutsourced so many jobs to China--is this is going to start a trade war \nwith China. That seems to be the thrust of their comments: This is \ngoing to start a trade war.\n  First of all, I don't know where they are that they think that \nbecause most of America thinks we are in a trade war right now with \nChina and, frankly, China is doing pretty darn well. It is not going \nthat well for American workers, and it is not going that well for \nAmerican manufacturers.\n  Go to downstate Illinois or Albuquerque or Akron and look at the \nnumber of plant closings. In many cases, companies--large companies \nespecially, because smaller companies can't do this the same way--will \nshut down their production in the United States--they will shut down \nproduction in Youngstown or Dayton--and they will move to Wuhan or \nXian, China, start production there, and then sell their products back \nto the United States. I don't know that that has ever been done in \nworld history.\n  So the trade war was started by the Chinese, waged by the Chinese, \nand that is why we have lost 100,000 manufacturing jobs in my \nState. That is why we have seen the trade deficit triple in the last 10 \nyears with China. That is why we go to the store and darned near \neverything we pick up, including sometimes American flags and things \nyou can buy at the Capitol Visitor Center, are made in China. It is \nclear China has cheated. They cheat on currency. They just cheat, pure \nand simple. It is long overdue that we do something about it.\n\n  They were admitted to the World Trade Organization because of a very \nbad vote 10 years ago that too many of my colleagues cast in support of \nChina doing that for PNTR. The Presiding Officer, as I did, voted \nagainst it. The Presiding Officer from New Mexico was prescient enough \nto see that. But they said, if you let China into the WTO, they are \nthen going to be a trading partner and they will play fair. Well, they \nnever have accepted, frankly, the basic governing rules from the World \nTrade Organization. They don't follow the rule of law. So when we say, \nno, we are not going to let them do that, we are accused of a trade \nwar. Excuse me, I don't understand that.\n  It is a little bit like two sort of real-life examples. If somebody \nis eating your lunch and you take their dessert away, they are \ncomplaining? Of course they are going to complain. They want their \ndessert. But they can't say you are starting a war when they are \nalready eating your lunch.\n  Or if you have two gas stations, you go to Springfield, OH, and there \nis a gas station on one side of the street and another gas station on \nthe other side of the street, the one gets a 30-percent discount on its \noil for its gasoline from Shell, and the one from Exxon on the other \nside of the street doesn't get a subsidy on its oil or its gasoline, of \ncourse, the one is going to put the other out of business.\n  That is what we do to China. We give them a 20- to 30-percent \ndiscount because they cheat on currency. And you call that a trade war \nbecause we are saying, no, we are taking that discount away? It is \nChina that has played this protectionist game.\n  Mr. Fred Bergsten, who is the director of the Institute for National \nEconomics, the Peterson Institute, hardly a flaming liberal--free fair \ntrade group; it is a conservative, generally free trade organization--\nsaid that China's currency policy is the most protectionist policy of \nany major country in the world since World War II. And for us to say, \nLet's play fair, we are starting a trade war? It doesn't make sense.\n  Let's debate the real issues. Let's not call names. Let's not say so-\nand-so is starting a trade war, so-and-so is protectionist, so-and-so \nis doing class warfare. We want more exports, we want more trade. But, \nremember, currency undervaluation makes our exports more expensive when \nwe sell them into China and puts our manufacturers at a competitive \ndisadvantage.\n  I think this legislation makes so much sense. That is why it got 79 \nvotes. That is why it has such a high number of bipartisan cosponsors. \nThat is why people in this country understand that passing this \nlegislation to level the playing field, to give our manufacturers an \nopportunity, makes so much sense.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Carper are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator from \nIllinois is recognized.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I would like to take this time to talk on \nthe pending legislation with regard to China. In these times of deficit \nand debt, I think we should not launch a trade war with China. We are \nhere because we borrowed too much. We have a spending habit that has \nweakened our economy. That spending habit was aided by China, but we \ncan only blame ourselves for much of the economic weakness the United \nStates now faces.\n  A trade war with China would put in jeopardy a number of jobs from my \nState of Illinois. Illinois exports to China in 2000 totaled about $533 \nmillion. Roughly 2,500 people received their employment by virtue of \nsales to China 10 years ago. Today, exports to China total about $3.18 \nbillion. The number of people employed by sales to China has grown from \naround 2,500 jobs to 15,000. In a State with a higher than average \nunemployment, where unemployment is growing faster than almost any \nother region of the country, I do not think we should put these jobs at \nrisk with an unnecessary trade war with China.\n  When we look at Illinois very directly, we see a major Peoria \nemployer like Caterpillar, whose sales to China last year totaled about \n$3.2 billion roughly related to about 10,000 jobs in the direct and \ncontractor and subcontractor area for sales to China. With Motorola, \nbased in Schaumburg, sales totaled about $2 billion directly to China, \nimpacting about 7,000 jobs. For Boeing, headquartered in Illinois, \nsales to China totaled about $3 billion--around 10,000 jobs directly \nrelated to sales into the Chinese market.\n  This bill would seek to blame all of our economic ills on a power \noverseas despite so much of the weaknesses related to our own \noverregulation, a flawed health care bill, and too many taxes that are \ncausing small employers--the engine of employment in our country--to \nhold back on hiring an American full time. I believe this bill places \nthe blame in the wrong place and diverts the needed attention of the \nSenate from where it should be placed in fixing our economy.\n  For 10 years, I served in the House of Representatives. In 2005, \nduring that rendition of anti-Chinese legislation, I decided to form a \nbipartisan caucus, the China Working Group, with Democratic \nRepresentative Rick Larsen of Washington. We decided to bring together \nthe three warring China tribes of the House of Representatives. That \nwould be the panda huggers, a very small number of Members; the dragon \nslayers, a very large number of Members, especially on my side; and the \npanda slayers, who are growing in number, who dislike almost anything \nrelated to China. We welcomed everyone to discuss China because of its \ngrowing role in the world because, according to one of our leading \nbanks, China could be the largest economy on Earth, replacing a status \nthat the United States had until our policy was misplaced and that we \nhave had since around the 1870s.\n  Should we trigger a trade war with the coming largest economy on \nEarth? I would say we should not. In the 21st century, China can be the \nsource of the greatest ill or greatest good for the United States, \ndepending on how we manage this relationship.\n  One of the key audiences I listened to, as chairman of the China \nWorking Group, with Congressman Larsen, was Americans who actually sold \nAmerican-manufactured goods in China. Oftentimes, we would ask: Is your \nNo. 1 concern with regard to selling more\n\n[[Page S6155]]\n\ngoods in China related to the currency? Overwhelmingly, they would say \nit was not their No. 1 concern. Their No. 1 concern instead was the \ncomprehensive theft of intellectual property by Chinese entities from \nU.S. patent holders. This is most clearly evidenced in the Hollywood \nDVD industry but also elsewhere. When you look at this issue in a \nserious way, you find currency is not the No. 1 issue, although I admit \nit polls rather well. But our job is to actually add employment to the \nUnited States, and one of the key audiences we should listen to is \npeople who sell U.S. goods in China.\n  If you delve into the intellectual property issue and the \ncomprehensive theft of intellectual property, you will find that China \nhas some fairly reputable intellectual property laws, but they are not \nenforced. A common thing you hear about China is a phrase that is often \nused in the Chinese language. It goes something like this: The \nmountains are very high and the Emperor is far away, meaning despite \nlaws that may be on the books in Beijing, they are not enforced in the \nprovinces where so much theft of intellectual property happens.\n  I would argue that a bipartisan agenda that would add to jobs and \nstrengthen our relation with China would be a greater enforcement of \nintellectual property laws between the United States and China. There, \nwe would actually have allies, such as the man who is most likely to \nbecome President of China, Xi Jinping, who wants China to be a strong \ninnovator, and he knows China cannot be an innovative nation if it \nrepresents a comprehensive theft of intellectual property worldwide. He \nknows China's intellectual property law has to be actually enforced in \nthe provinces if they are to have technological development. His \ninterests are actually in line with the interests of U.S. exporters, \nand here we could have a very productive dialog which actually stops \nthe theft of intellectual property in China and enhances the export \npotential of Americans.\n  I worry that we are diverting the time of the Senate from the big \ngame, which is the joint committee and its work on reducing the \ndeficit. I have heard that the President of the United States has \ncalled Senators, asking that this bill not come up. When you look at \nthe prospects for this legislation in the House, you will learn the \nprospects for this legislation are dim at best.\n  What should we do rather than trigger a trade war with a country that \nis about to be the largest economy on Earth? What should we do rather \nthan trigger job losses at Caterpillar and Motorola and Boeing, at \nSchaumburg and Peoria and in Chicagoland? I think instead we should \nfocus the Senate legislation on passing the Gang of 6 legislation that \nwould reduce the net borrowing of the United States by $4 trillion. We \nshould adopt the Collins moratorium on job-killing regulations costing \nover $100 million to reassure the engine of our job economy--small \nbusinesses--that they should go ahead and begin to hire Americans \nagain. We should do the big idea that is in the bipartisan deficit \ncommission report of tax reform, wiping out all special interest tax \nprovisions and then using the money, A, to lower the deficit and, B, to \nlower the top rate from 39 percent to 29 percent. We should also \nrapidly pass, as has now been proposed, the Panama and Colombia and \nSouth Korea Free Trade Agreements that open new markets for the United \nStates. Particularly in the case of Colombia, the markets would be \nopened for Illinois corn growers. For South Korea, I think it would end \nthe beef impasse we have had and also open high-technology aviation \nmarkets for the United States.\n  When I talk about the Gang of 6, when I talk about the Collins \namendment, when I talk about tax reform, when I talk about free-trade \nagreements--these are all positive agreements on which large numbers of \nDemocrats and Republicans in the Senate can agree and which would pass \nthe House of Representatives, rather than the underlying legislation \nwhich the President of the United States has indicated he would rather \nnot come up, which has a dismal future in the House of Representatives, \nand which directly puts at risk any job subject to Chinese retaliation \nfrom this legislation.\n  I also note that when you read the basic text of this legislation, it \nis not serious because it has a big waiver in it. Even if it made it to \nthe President's desk, given his calls to legislators on this issue, \nthere is no doubt in my mind that the President would execute the \nwaivers in this legislation.\n  So what are we doing? We are probably advancing a well and poll-\ntested piece of legislation in the Senate. I imagine some people would \nwant to take advantage of that dialog. But have we made it into enacted \nlaw? Overwhelmingly, likely no. Are we actually going to take any \nlegitimate action? Even by the terms of the legislation and its waiver, \nit would be exercised by the chief executive officer of the United \nStates, and therefore no action would be taken. But we would open the \nvery people whom we want to crawl this economy out of recession--U.S. \nexporters--to vulnerabilities for retaliation by the Chinese. Sometimes \nyou have to think about the basic principle of medicine when you look \nat legislation; that is, first, do no harm.\n\n  As Europe crumbles in a wave of outdated and out-of-gas socialism, \nthreatening our economy, as we teeter on the edge of a new recession \nbecause of too many regulations--10 new taxes in the health care bill--\nand an uncertain political future for deficit reduction under the \nbipartisan joint committee, ladling onto that--and our markets and the \nfuture of our retirement savings--a trade war with the second largest \neconomy on Earth would be unwise at best and put the jobs of many \nAmericans at risk at worst.\n  That is why I oppose this legislation. That is why, regardless of the \naction in the Senate, I do not think it is going anywhere in the House. \nCertainly, given the action and calls of the President to certain \nlegislators, it doesn't appear to have any real future in enforcement \nif it ever even did make its way to the White House.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I appreciate the words of my \nfreshman colleague, Senator Kirk. I think he recognizes from his days \nas a foreign policy expert, when he worked for the government on \nforeign policy, that a Presidential waiver is essential. My guess is he \nwould have attacked this bill if it had not had a waiver for the \nPresident, saying there is no way the President could possibly look out \nfor national security at the same time as he executes this legislation.\n  So that clearly is a nonstarter around here. Everybody recognizes \nthat not having a Presidential waiver--because there is a case \nsometimes when the President does need the authority when it comes to \nnational security, and I am concerned about national security in our \ntrade with China. I have seen China, over a period of years--with our \nacquiescence as a nation, frankly--I have seen China build more and \nmore national security infrastructure and in some cases seeing our \nnational security infrastructure weakened because we don't do as well \nwith steel and chemicals and all the things that go into our national \nsecurity apparatus. So I am, in fact, concerned about that.\n  I am also concerned; I hear two things, two main arguments. I have \nsat on the Senate floor as the manager of this bill for several hours \nover the last couple or 3 days and listened to this debate. It seems \nthe Republicans' opposition--most Republicans voted for this, so I \ndon't want to say it is overwhelming, but the people who have spoken \nagainst it have mostly been conservative Republicans who seem to pay a \nlot of attention to Club for Growth and those most conservative parts \nof their party. But I have heard two things. I have heard ``trade war, \ntrade war, trade war,'' and that is interesting because that echoes the \nwords of the People's Bank of China. It echoes the words of the \nMinistry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China. It echoes the \nwords of the Foreign Affairs Ministry of the Communist Party of the \nPeople's Republic of China. It mimics their words when I hear them say \n``trade war, trade war, trade war.''\n  But what also concerns me is I listen to this debate and hear some of \nthe opponents of this bill kind of playing the ``blame America first'' \ngame. They seem to say this is not China doing this to us, this is us \ndoing this to us--or perhaps we doing this to us, to be more \ngrammatically correct. I am aghast\n\n[[Page S6156]]\n\nthat China games its currency system, that China undercuts our \nmanufacturing because they ``cheat,'' and that there are some Members \nof the Senate who stood up right here and took the oath of office to \nthe United States of America who are blaming America first for what \nChina is doing to us.\n  I can see blaming our government for not enforcing trade rules \nbetter. President Obama, while he has not come out yet for this bill, \nhas enforced trade laws better than any President since Ronald Reagan, \nwho actually probably set the gold standard for trade enforcement. We \nhaven't seen it since President Obama. I am a bit intrigued that my \ncolleagues are blaming the United States for this. It is a little like \nif there are gas stations on Detroit Avenue in Cleveland, in Westlake \nor in Rocky River or in Cleveland, one on each side of the road and one \ngets the gas 25 percent cheaper than the other from the supplier--from \nExxonMobil or Shell--they can put the other one out of business. Do we \nblame the one that doesn't get the discount for going out of business? \nIs that what we are doing? To blame America first on this is blaming \nthe United States when China cheats, and I don't buy that. I don't \nthink there is any credence in that argument.\n\n  I appreciate Senator Kirk's admonition, and I appreciate his \ncelebration, if you will, of Caterpillar and many of these companies \nthat are exporting tens of millions and, in a few cases, billions of \ndollars to China. More power to them. I want them to do more exports.\n  Look at this chart. Look what happened. Exports to China have gone \nup. The year 2000 was when this Senate and the House--where the \nPresiding Officer from New Mexico and I sat--voted no on this when \nPNTR, permanent normal trade relations, with China was passed. Look \nwhat happened since then. Exports to China went up. I am glad U.S. \nexports with companies all over our States--Senator Kirk mentioned a \nhandful in Illinois--went up. Look what happened to imports. Look at \nthe number of imports that went up. Do we know why? Part of that reason \nis China has cheated on currency. When we did the first vote on Monday \nnight--and all of us predicted what the Chinese Government is going to \ndo. They are going to squawk and say: trade war, trade war, trade war. \nI didn't know a bunch of American politicians would mimic what they \nsaid and say: trade war, trade war, trade war.\n  Here is what happened--listen to this--an article in the South China \nMorning Post on October 5, the day after that vote: In a rare move, the \ncentral bank, the People's Bank of China, the China Ministry of \nCommerce, the People's Republic of China's Foreign Affairs Ministry \ntook simultaneous, coordinated action yesterday to express Beijing's \nstrong opposition to the bill, aimed at forcing Beijing to let its \ncurrency float. They accused Washington of politicizing global currency \nissues.\n  Where I come from, they say when you throw a rock at a pack of dogs, \nthe one that yelps is the one you hit. Of course, the Chinese are going \nto yelp because they don't like this. We are saying to them they have \nto follow the rules--no more breaking the rules. They cannot cheat the \nway they have cheated.\n  Of course, in the Communist Party, in the People's Republic of China, \nthe Ministry of Commerce is going to squawk. Of course, the People's \nBank of China is going to squawk. These are all arms of the Chinese \nCommunist Party and arms of the Chinese Government. Of course, they are \nnot happy when we do this. It does not mean it is not the right thing \nto do.\n  It bothers me when I see American politicians mimic what the Chinese \nCommunist Party officials are saying, their government is saying: trade \nwar, trade war, trade war. This is not a trade war. Fred Bergsten, head \nof the Peterson Institute for International Economics, is a trade \nofficial--I believe an economist. He is very smart. The Peterson \nInstitute for International Economics is a generally conservative \noperation that generally plays it straight on trade. If anything, they \nare a bit too free trade, in my mind, instead of fair trade. Fred \nBergsten said:\n\n       I regard China's current policy as the most protectionist \n     measure taken by any major country since World War II. Its \n     currency manipulation has been undervalued by 20 to 30 \n     percent.\n\n  Here is the key point:\n\n       That is equivalent to a 20 to 30 percent subsidy on all \n     exports and a tariff on all imports by the largest trading \n     country in the world.\n\n  The 30-percent penalty is why our exports don't go up very much. The \n25-percent bonus for the Chinese is why our imports go up so much. We \ncannot sell into China's market very well because they are cheating. \nThat is why our exports don't grow as much, and they can sell so much \ninto our markets because we are giving that 25 or 30 percent bonus.\n  This isn't a trade war--well, it is a trade war. The Chinese declared \ntrade war on us in 2000 and look how they benefited from this trade \nwar, and we are just going to stand here and allow them to do that? It \ndoesn't work. That is why this legislation is so important.\n  Last point. There are an awful lot of American businesses that think \nwe need to fix this. I hear my friend from Illinois and other Senators \ncome to the floor who oppose this bill. There are only 19 who voted no \nout of the 98 who voted. I have heard them come to this floor and talk \nabout exports, that their businesses have exported. Some have and more \npower to them. I hope they can export more and create more jobs in the \nUnited States. We need to understand that those are mostly large \ncompanies that have in some cases the wherewithal to outsource jobs to \nChina and in other cases to be able to export large numbers.\n  There was a historic split in the National Association of \nManufacturers, the largest trade organization for American \nmanufacturers, over the last several years on what to do about this.\n  Many of the small companies such as Automation Tool & Die in \nBrunswick, OH, and a company in Dayton that does printing, where I just \nspoke to Jeff Cottrell, who owns that company and has a number of \nemployees in Dayton, OH--those companies understand currency undercuts \nthem. The Bennett brothers at this company in Brunswick told me in \nCleveland a couple days ago why they support this bill. They said they \nhad a contract they thought was a million-dollar contract, and they \nbegan to change their assembly line, their production facilities, their \nproduction operation capacity. At the last minute, a Chinese company \ncame in and underpriced them by 20 percent and got the contract. Why \ndid they underprice them 20 percent? Because we gave them a 25-percent \nbonus to do it. We have disarmed this trade war that we are not \nbeginning. We are playing defense and we are fighting back.\n  I think the American public overwhelmingly says fight back when they \nplay the games, fight back when they game the system. Don't blame \nAmerica on this one. Stand for American interest. It is good for our \nexporters, big companies and small companies alike. It is good for \nAmerican manufacturing. We know what that means to workers in \nChillicothe, Zanesville, and Toledo. We know what it means for our \nlocal vitality and prosperity. It means so much as we begin to restore \nAmerican manufacturing.\n  I ask for support for S. 1619.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, exports are absolutely critical to our \neconomic growth in this country. In fact, there are nearly 10 million \ngood-paying American jobs that are related to exports. The President, \nMembers of Congress, and so on talk about that a lot. But I am \ndisappointed we are not moving forward with an aggressive agenda to \nactually open new markets for our exports.\n  I am encouraged that the administration, finally, this week, sent \nforward three trade agreements that do just that--the Korea, Colombia, \nand Panama trade agreements. These open markets to U.S. workers and \nfarmers, those who provide services, so it is going to be good for jobs \nin this country. The President's own metrics indicate these three \nagreements alone will create 250,000 new jobs. We need them badly.\n  I also want to congratulate Chairman Dave Camp and the House Ways and\n\n[[Page S6157]]\n\nMeans Committee for reporting out all three of these agreements this \nafternoon. My understanding is, each agreement received a strong \nbipartisan vote, and I am hopeful those agreements will now come to the \nSenate for us to be able to move forward--again, opening these critical \nmarkets that will create over 200,000 jobs for Americans.\n  I will tell you, these three agreements were all negotiated and \nsigned over 4 years ago. During that interim period, the United States \nhas been absent from the kind of trade-opening negotiations we ought to \nbe involved with. This President--for the first time since Franklin \nDelano Roosevelt--has not asked, as his predecessors did, for trade \npromotion authority to be able to negotiate new agreements. So we are \nlosing market share.\n  Every day there are American workers who do not have the same \nopportunities to compete in foreign markets as those workers from other \ncountries do because the United States is not actively engaged in \nopening markets. We need to do that.\n  Right now, we have no ongoing bilateral trade agreements. We have one \nmultilateral agreement, which I support moving forward on--the Trans-\nPacific Partnership--but, frankly, there are over 100 bilateral \nnegotiations going on right now, and America is not a partner in any of \nthem. We need to get engaged because it is so critical to growing our \neconomy.\n  During the debate we have had over the last couple of weeks on trade \nadjustment assistance, where I was supportive of a version of trade \nadjustment assistance to get the trade agreements moving, we had a \ndiscussion about giving the President trade promotion authority. We \nwere not able to get support from the administration for that. This is \ncritical to move forward. It is because growing goods and services is \nabsolutely critical to our economic health.\n  Over 95 percent of consumers in the world, of course, live outside of \nour borders. We want to access those consumers, we want to sell more to \nthem. Export growth and a healthy trading system depends on these \nexport-opening agreements, but it also depends on having a healthy \ninternational trading system where all the players play by the \ninternational rules. So the export-expanding agreements are good. We \nneed to do more of that. We should be much more engaged, but we also \nhave to insist that everybody plays by the same rules.\n  Today the Senate is debating legislation that has to do with one of \nthose rules, and that is the issue of currency, and specifically the \nissue of China and their currency manipulation. China is a country, as \nyou know, where we have a persistent and unprecedented trade deficit. \nIt is also a very important trading partner for us. So it is critical \nwe keep that strong trade relationship but do it on a basis that is \nfair for us and for China.\n  I consistently hear about this China currency issue when I am back in \nOhio. I hear about it a lot from manufacturers and the workers at those \nplants who tell me it is just not fair that in the global marketplace \nOhio products are not able to compete on a level playing field.\n  Just this year I have worked with a lot of Ohio companies that are \nfacing various problems, including Ohio candle makers, steel \nmanufacturers, diamond saw blade producers, rare earth magnet \nmanufacturers, and others who are concerned about getting a fair shake \nin the global economy and want to be sure they are not competing with \nunfair Chinese competition.\n  Again, I believe in the benefits of trade. I know they work. I \nbelieve in reducing barriers, but I also believe opening export markets \nand vigorous enforcement of trade laws go hand in hand. They both \nshould be something that the United States pursues.\n  China's undervalued currency does provide, in my view, an export \nsubsidy, making Chinese exports to the United States less expensive in \nthe global marketplace and making our exports to China relatively more \nexpensive.\n  I have long had concerns about this. Actually, when I was before the \nSenate Finance Committee in my confirmation hearings to be U.S. Trade \nRepresentative years ago I stated that I believed China currency does \naffect trade, and I stated that China should revalue their currency. I \nstill believe that. I believe this administration should label China a \ncurrency manipulator because I think it is clear there continues to be \nmanipulation.\n  The legislation before us today is not the perfect answer, and I do \nhope the Senate will permit my colleague, Senator Hatch, to offer his \namendment, which I think is a constructive amendment to improve parts \nof the legislation. But I do support the bill with the expectation that \nit is compliant with our international trade obligations and that it \ngives the administration the flexibility it needs to implement this \nbill in a smart and sensible way.\n  However, I would also say this bill has been described on this floor \nmany times over the last couple days as I have listened to the debate \nas doing more than it does. We should not overstate it. It does not \naddress some other issues that, frankly, I think would make a bigger \ndifference in our important trade relationship with China.\n  One of these issues would be indigenous innovation, which I believe \nto be an unfair practice that China is currently practicing. Also, \nthere is the issue of violations of intellectual property rights. It is \nnot so much that the laws are not in place; it is that many times there \nis not adequate enforcement of the intellectual property laws that are \nin place. Of course, there is the issue of anticompetitive practices \nand subsidies that continue with regard to state-owned enterprises. I \nam also working with Senator Wyden and others--a bipartisan group of \nSenators--on combatting transshipment and customs duty evasion \nproblems, which involve companies from various countries but include \nChina.\n  So we have a growing list of complex issues facing our relationship \nwith China. I believe they should all be addressed together. I hope the \nnext round of diplomatic and commercial negotiations with China will \nbring about some of that discussion and bring about some solutions, not \njust more broken promises.\n  I understand the JCCT, called the Joint Commission on Commerce and \nTrade, between the United States and China will meet in November--next \nmonth--and that the next round of the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic \nDialogue will take place next year. I urge the administration to use \nthese negotiations as leverage to get some of these real results that \nare so necessary.\n  We should also look at multilateral approaches, including the World \nTrade Organization, and certainly the International Monetary Fund. I \nwill tell you, as someone who has sat across the table in negotiations \nwith tough Chinese negotiators, endless dialog is not the answer. \nSometimes that is what occurs. We are not just looking for more talk. I \nthink it is important we get serious--both U.S. leaders and Chinese \nleaders--about some of our lingering trade problems that we have had \nthrough the years so we can have a healthy trade relationship based on \nmutual respect.\n  Each country is important to the other. We cannot overlook the fact \nthat China continues to be a very vital U.S. export market, despite the \nissues I talked about. Right now, China is the third largest export \nmarket for Ohio goods, for instance. The State I represent sends over \n$2.2 billion a year in exports to China. With 25 percent of Ohio \nmanufacturing jobs dependent upon exports, this is incredibly important \nto us.\n\n  One out of every three acres of land in Ohio is planted for export, \nso agricultural exports are also important. There is also an important \nissue with China that relates to investment both ways: our investment \nin China and Chinese investment here. Let me read to you from an \neditorial that was in the Cleveland Plain Dealer last Thursday. Its \ntitle is: ``Chinese investors are welcome here.''\n\n       If Greater Cleveland is going to prosper in the 21st \n     century, it has to build strong two-way connections with the \n     rest of the world. The region has to sell more of its \n     services and products abroad and welcome talent and capital \n     from overseas. That's the path to jobs and wealth.\n\n  The editorial goes on to talk about the collaboration between Chinese \ncompanies and investors looking to build relationships with Cleveland's \nworld-renowned medical device industry.\n  Just last week, the mayor of Toledo, OH, Mike Bell, returned from a \n12-day\n\n[[Page S6158]]\n\ntrade mission to Asia in order to boost job creation in northwest Ohio. \nSince Mayor Bell's trip, plans have been announced for increased \ncommercial ties between Chinese and Ohio job creators and companies, \nincluding launching a new international business center in downtown \nToledo.\n  These are just a couple of examples in my State of the importance of \nthis relationship and why it needs to be taken so seriously. This \nrelationship is vital to the future not just of our two countries but, \nin my view, to the global economy. So we need to be sure, again, it is \na healthy relationship. It needs to be fair. It needs to be on a basis \nwhere, again, there is a level playing field on both sides. So it is \ntime for our trading partners to play by the rules so that, indeed, we \ncan have a fair trading system.\n  Trade is key to growth. But, again, it is only one part of a broader \nproblem that is holding back our economy today, holding back Ohio \nmanufacturers from hiring and innovating. Another big issue that has \ncome to the attention of this Senate time and time again is the \nincredible regulatory burden that is placed on Ohio's job creators. So \nin order to be successful in trade, we need to have more open markets. \nWe talked about that: a level playing field. But, also, we need to be \nmore competitive at home or else we are not going to be able to create \nthe jobs in this century that we need to keep our economy moving \nforward.\n  At a time when we have over 9 percent unemployment, it is critical we \nbe sure our economy is more competitive. This regulatory burden is one \nissue that I think all sides can agree ought to be addressed.\n  I am joined today by the junior Senator from Nevada, my friend and \ncolleague, to offer a couple of amendments designed to give American \nemployers some relief from the regulatory mandates that continue to \nhold back our economy and hinder job creation.\n  There is no official counting of this total regulatory burden on our \neconomy, and estimates do vary. But one study that is often cited is \nfrom the Obama administration's own Small Business Administration where \nthey report the regulatory costs exceed $1.75 trillion annually. That \nis, of course, even more than is collected by the IRS in income taxes \nevery year. So it is a huge burden. We can talk about what the exact \nnumber is, but the fact is this is something that is forcing Ohio \ncompanies and other companies around our country to have higher costs \nof creating a job.\n  The Office of Management and Budget estimates that the annual cost of \na narrow set of rules--these are just what are called the major rules \nthat are reviewed by OMB over one 10-year period--registers at $43 \nbillion to $55 billion per year.\n  I have been encouraged by what the current administration has \nrecently been saying about regulations. I have been less encouraged \nabout what they have done. The new regulatory costs on the private \nsector are real, and they are mounting.\n  Compared to historic trends, we have seen a sharp uptick over the \nlast 2 years in these new so-called major or economically significant \nrules that have an economic impact of over $100 million on the economy. \nThey also have an impact, of course, on consumer prices and American \ncompetitiveness.\n  George Washington University Regulatory Studies recently told us that \nthis administration has been regulating at an average of 84 new major \nrules per year, which, by way of comparison, is about a 35-percent \nincrease from the last administration and about a 50-percent increase \nfrom the Clinton administration.\n  These figures do include the independent agencies which must be \nincluded in the calculations. So there has been an uptick in \nregulations, and continues to be, again, despite much of the rhetoric \nto the contrary. One commonsense step we can take to address this issue \nis to improve and strengthen what is called the Unfunded Mandates \nReform Act of 1995, UMRA.\n  I worked on this along with some of my colleagues who are now in the \nSenate back when I was in the House. It was a bipartisan effort that \nbasically said Federal regulators ought to know the costs of what they \nare imposing. We also ought to know what the benefits are, and we ought \nto know if there are less costly alternatives.\n  The two amendments I am offering today are drawn from a bill that I \nintroduced back in June called the Unfunded Mandates Accountability \nAct. It is an effort that now has over 20 cosponsors. Again, it seems \nto me it is a commonsense effort that should be bipartisan.\n  The first amendment would strengthen the analysis that is required in \nsome very important ways. First, it requires agencies to specifically \nassess the potential effect of new regulations on job creation, which \nis not currently a requirement, and in this economy it must be. Also, \nto consider market-based and nongovernmental alternatives to \nregulation, again, something we need to look at.\n  It also broadens the scope of UMRA to require a cost-benefit analysis \nof rules that impose direct or indirect economic costs of $100 million \nor more. It requires agencies to adopt the least costly and least \nburdensome alternative to achieve the policy goal that has been set \nout. So, currently, agencies have to consider that, but they do not \nhave to follow the least costly alternative. We simply cannot afford \nthat, again, because of the tough economic times we have.\n  The second amendment extends those same requirements to the \nindependent agencies. This is incredibly important, and these are \nagencies such as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the newly \nformed Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, agencies that are very \nimportant on the regulatory side and are currently exempt from these \ncost-benefit rules that affect all other agencies.\n  On this issue I was very pleased to see that President Obama issued \nan Executive order in July which was specifically related to \nindependent agencies. That order and the accompanying Presidential \nmemorandum called on independent agencies to participate in a look-\nback, but also, very importantly, called on independent agencies to \nevaluate the costs and benefits of new regulation just as, again, all \nexecutive agencies were already required to do.\n  It is a step in the right direction, but the problem is that the \nPresident's order is entirely nonbinding because a President cannot \nrequire independent agencies to do that. Congress can. We can do it by \nstatute. And independent agencies do not answer to the President. So \nsince this order was issued in July--by the way, we have not seen a \nrush by independent agencies to pledge to comply with these principles. \nAgain, they are not required to, so this amendment, this second \namendment, would effectively write the President's new request into law \nso it can be effective.\n  Independent agencies would be required under UMRA to evaluate \nregulatory costs, benefits, and less costly alternatives before issuing \nany rule that would impose a cost of $100 million on the private sector \nor on State, local, and tribal governments. The fact is, independent \nagencies are not doing this on their own. According to a 2011 OMB \nreport, not one of the 17 major rules issued by independent agencies in \n2010 included an assessment of both cost and benefit. Not one.\n  Closing this independent agency loophole is a reform we should be \nable to agree with on both sides of the aisle. Certainly, the President \nshould agree with it since it is part of his Executive order and \nmemorandum, and this is the right vehicle to do it.\n  This a jobs issue again and a commonsense approach. No major \nregulation, whatever its source, should be imposed on American \nemployers on State and local governments without a serious \nconsideration of the costs, the benefits, and the availability of less \nburdensome alternatives. These amendments move us further to that goal.\n  I would urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support \nthem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of the two \namendments filed by my good friend from Ohio, Senator Portman, my \namendment No. 674, and above all the issue of the day, jobs.\n  Americans have had to endure great hardship over the past few years. \nThis recession has robbed millions of people of their jobs, their \nhomes, their businesses, and their sense of security. No\n\n[[Page S6159]]\n\nState has been hit harder than the State of Nevada. My State has the \nunfortunate distinction of leading the Nation in unemployment, \nforeclosures, and bankruptcies. And there is no question that the \nstatus quo of dysfunctional government must end.\n  People from all over the country are struggling just to get by and \nare desperate for real solutions. The underlying legislation takes the \nwrong approach to job creation and can be very detrimental to economic \ngrowth in our country. Inciting a trade war with China will not create \njobs.\n  In my home State of Nevada, a trade war would hurt tourism. It would \nstifle growth in renewable energy development and increase costs to \nconsumers at a time when they can least afford it.\n  Working to sell American goods in foreign markets is what we should \nbe fighting for. Instead, it seems job creation and economic growth \nhave taken a back seat to political posturing and grandstanding in \nWashington. It is clear that the approach this administration and its \nsupporters have taken for economic recovery has failed miserably. Out-\nof-control spending, a health care law no one can afford, and seemingly \nendless streams of regulation are crippling employers, stifling \neconomic growth, and killing jobs. Instead of fighting for measures \nthat create and protect jobs, this administration has created more \ngovernment that continues to impede economic growth at every turn.\n  This government continues to tax too much, spend too much, and borrow \ntoo much. The American public and businesses alike are waiting on a \nplan that can plant the seeds of economic growth and bolster job \ncreation. Instead, all they get from this government when it comes to \njob creation is a big wet blanket.\n  They need Washington to provide relief from new burdensome and overly \nintrusive regulations. Congress must help job creators by ensuring \nevery regulation is vetted with a full understanding of the impact it \nwill have on businesses across the country.\n  So I am pleased to join with Senator Portman in this fight to rein in \nexcessive government regulation and to implement a market-benefit \nanalysis for all agencies, both executive and independent, so the \nAmerican public will know the true cost of these regulations. As \nPresident Obama said: We must rein in government agencies and force \nthem to help businesses when they refuse to do so. I could not agree \nmore.\n  There are a number of actions Congress can take immediately to help \nbolster our Nation's economy. The adoption of Senator Portman's \namendments is one of those actions. I look forward to continuing to \nwork with him on these issues. I believe our best days are still ahead, \nbut we need to change course now. We need to roll back the regulations \nthat are tying the hands of entrepreneurs across America. We can help \nhasten an economic recovery by embracing progrowth policies that place \nmore money in the pockets of Americans.\n\n  I would also like to highlight another issue that would help create \njobs and provide certainty for the businesses across the country; that \nis, Congress should pass a budget. Congress has not passed a budget in \nnearly 2\\1/2\\ years. Passing a comprehensive budget is one of the most \nbasic responsibilities of Congress, but it has failed to accomplish \nthis task.\n  America desperately needs a comprehensive 10-year plan that offers \nreal solutions to the economic and fiscal problems in this country. We \ncannot lower unemployment rates in Nevada or restore the housing market \nwithout a holistic approach to reining in Federal spending and lowering \nthe national debt.\n  Congress passed another continuing resolution that lacks a long-term \napproach to restoring our Nation to fiscal sanity. Instead, this bill \nfunds the government for just a few more months. Congress cannot \ncontinue to function without a measure of accountability to hold \nMembers of Congress to their constitutionally mandated responsibility, \nwhich is why I introduced the no budget, no pay amendment, amendment \nNo. 674.\n  This measure requires Congress to pass a budget resolution by the \nbeginning of any fiscal year. If Congress fails to pass a budget, then \nMembers of Congress do not get paid. How can Congress commit to a debt \nreduction plan without a budget? Any serious proposal to rein in \nFederal spending and create jobs starts with a responsible budget.\n  At home in Nevada and across this country, if people do not \naccomplish the tasks their jobs require, they do not get paid. Somehow \nthis very basic standard of responsibility is lost upon Washington.\n  The no budget, no pay amendment is not an end-all solution to our \neconomic difficulties. It is, however, an important measure that \nCongress should adopt in order to show the American people that Members \nof Congress are serious about restoring our country to a period of \neconomic prosperity.\n  Nevadans work hard for their paychecks. So should Congress. And since \nthe majority believes the legislation before us today is a jobs bill, I \nencourage them to take up other measures that will help with job \ncreation, such as opening our country to energy exploration, \nstreamlining the permitting process for responsible development of our \ndomestic resources, and taking the aggressive step of reforming our Tax \nCode. Let's make the Tax Code simpler for individuals and employers. \nCut out the special interest loopholes while reducing the overall tax \nburden for all Americans.\n  Instead of looking for new ways to tax the American public, we should \nmake our Tax Code more competitive and provide businesses the stability \nthey need to grow and to create jobs. The continual threat of increased \ntaxes feeds the uncertainty that serves as an impediment to economic \ngrowth. These are all things that both this administration and Congress \ncould do immediately to boost economic recovery.\n  Let's give the American people a government that works for them. \nRemoving impediments to job creation will get Americans working again \nand ensure our children and grandchildren have a brighter future.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I would like to talk on the bill that we \nare debating on the floor about China currency. Let me say a few \nthings. To me and to many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, \nvery little we could do could be more important in both the short term \nand the long term than to require China to pay a price if they continue \nto flaunt international trade rules and manipulate their currency, \ncausing their imports to America--their exports to America, our \nimports, to be much cheaper than they should be, and causing American \nexports to China--their imports of our goods--to be more expensive than \nthey should be.\n  In the short term, it has been estimated by EPI that 2 million jobs \ncould be created over 2 years if we pass this legislation and China's \ncurrency were no longer misaligned. But there is a long-term issue, and \nthat is this: The bottom line is, what is our future in this country? \nIt is good, high-paying jobs. It is companies, large and small, that \ncreate high-end products, products that take a lot of know-how, \nproducts that take a lot of skill to create, products that basically \nare the high end in terms of both manufacturing and services. That is \nour future.\n  Those are our crown jewels. When I ask--as many of us have asked the \nquestion--how in a worldwide economy can America compete, the answer is \nthose companies. I admit that most of those companies are not large; \nthey are smaller companies. They are small business people with great \nideas for new ways of providing a service or creating a product. They \nare the people who employ about 65 percent of the new jobs in America. \nThey are our future. Some of them will grow into very large companies. \nMany will stay employing 100, 200, 300, or 400 people. But they are on \nthe front lines of world trade.\n  What have we found over the last decade? In almost 10 years, since \nChina joined the WTO, we have lost 2.8 million jobs, simply due to the \nChinese\n\n[[Page S6160]]\n\nGovernment's manipulation of currency. We have lost thousands more jobs \nelsewhere, because China steals our intellectual property. China has a \nmercantilist policy of taking an industry and nurturing it with local \nsubsidies and making products so cheap that they export and overwhelm \nour market. That is what happened with solar cells, solar panels. They \ncan take an advantage such as rare earths and oppose WTO rules and say \nto companies, if you want these rare earths, which you need for your \nproducts, you have to make it in China.\n  They do this over and over. Why do Senator Brown and Senator Graham \nand I and many others feel so strongly about this? Because we know if \nthe present trend continues, as Robert Samuelson, the economist, noted \nin an op-ed in the Washington Post the other day, basically it is a \ndisaster for America. If, when a young entrepreneur creates a product \nor service, that entrepreneur is overwhelmed by a Chinese product that \nhas unfair advantage, we don't have a future. That is it. Many people \nworry about the budget deficit as the biggest problem America faces. It \nis a large problem and I hope we solve it. I will work hard to solve \nit. But, to me, the No. 1 problem America faces is how do we become the \nproduction giant we were over the last several decades but no longer \nseem to be. We are indeed a consumption giant. We consume more than \nanybody of our own products and other people's. But you cannot be a \nconsumption giant for many years on end if you are not also a \nproduction giant.\n  What is a major external factor that contributes to making us a \nconsumption giant rather than a production giant? It is the Chinese \nmanipulation of currency, because it discourages production in America \nand encourages consumption of undervalued Chinese goods at the same \ntime. The anguish that many of us feel about the future of this country \ntranslates directly into this legislation. I know there are lots of \nacademics who sit up in their ivory towers, editorial writers, who love \nto look at this legislation and without even examining its consequences \nsay that is protectionism. This is not protectionism. In fact, this \nlegislation is in the name of free trade, because free trade implies a \nfloating currency. That is what was set up at Bretton Woods. That was \nthe equilibrium creator when things got out of whack. But it doesn't \nexist for China. A lot of countries have pegged their currency in the \npast and we paid no attention, because if you have .01 percent of GDP, \nand you are worried your tiny little currency will be overwhelmed, to \npeg it by world trends, that doesn't create much trouble. When you are \nthe second largest economic power in the world, largest or second \nlargest exporter in the world, to peg your currency totally \ndiscombobulates the world trading system.\n  Given the danger to the future of our country, and given the danger \nto the continuation of world trade by China continuing its currency \nmanipulation, why isn't there more of an outcry? That is the question I \nask myself. I don't have a good answer. Perhaps it is because those \neditorial writers and big thinkers don't talk to the manufacturers of \nhigh-end products in New York State I talk to, who see they cannot \ncontinue against China unfairly because of currency manipulation. \nWhether it is a ceramic that goes into powerplants, which I talked \nabout yesterday, or even a high-end window that is used for major \noffice buildings and museums, China uses its currency manipulation to \ngain unfair advantage over our companies up and down the line. Maybe \nthose in the ivory towers don't talk to the manufacturers on the ground \nas so many of us do because that is our job and that is our living. \nMaybe it is because global companies have fought our provision in the \ninterest of their shareholders.\n  I don't begrudge the big companies. Their job is to maximize their \nshare price. If firing 10,000 American workers and moving them to \nChina, and creating those 10,000 jobs in China gives them more \nprofitability, in part because of currency manipulation, yes, that is \nwhat corporations are supposed to do. But that is not in America's \ninterest. It may have been in General Electric--a company that has lots \nof New York presence and that I like very much--it may have been in \ntheir interest to sign a contract for wind turbines and give to China \nintellectual property in return. But it sure wasn't in the interest of \nthe workers in Schenectad, even if it might have been in the overall \ninterest of the GE shareholder. Maybe it is because the Business \nRoundtable and the Chamber of Commerce, which is dominated by the \nlarger manufacturers and service companies and the larger financial \ninstitutions. They don't care about American wealth and jobs; they care \nabout their own profitability and sales and share price, and if China \nhas an unfair advantage, so be it. That is not their job. Maybe that is \nthe reason. That is beginning to change, by the way.\n\n  When I last visited China, I met with the heads of the China \ndivisions of many of our largest companies, and I had met with the same \npeople several years before--and intermittently some of them in \nbetween--and their tone has totally changed. They are exasperated with \nChina's mercantile policy. One of the manufacturers, who had been one \nof the leaders in saying don't touch China, because they exported a ton \nof goods there, had a different tone. He said: We can only export \ncertain of our goods--the ones China doesn't make--and the rest we have \nto make in China and in certain provinces. That is a large, huge \nmultibillion dollar U.S. company.\n  Another company, a major retailer, told us they cannot run their \nstores the way they wish in China because China dictates what they can \nand cannot have on their shelves. Half of the products on their shelves \nin American stores cannot, by Chinese Government dictate, be on the \nChinese store shelves. Some of our large companies are sort of \nrealizing that letting China get away with all of these violations of \nfree trade, all these violations of WTO, no longer serves their \ninterests, though, admittedly, they have not come around to support our \nbill.\n  Then there are those who are fearful that the Chinese will retaliate. \nThat one drives me the craziest. I grew up in Brooklyn. When there were \nbullies and you didn't stand up for yourself, they bullied you and \nbullied you some more. If you stood up to them, yes, there was going to \nbe some retaliation, but it was a lot better than giving in. That is \nwhat we have done with China. Will China retaliate if this bill becomes \nlaw and hundreds of American companies grow to have countervailing \nduties imposed? Yes. But the Chinese know they have far more to lose in \na trade war than we do. Their economy is far more dependent upon \nexports--just look at the percentage in terms of GDP--than ours. They \nare far more dependent upon the American market than we are on the \nChinese market, as important as it is to many of our companies.\n  While China will retaliate in a measured way, they will not create a \ntrade war. It is not in their interest; they cannot afford to. I have \nnews for those who are worried about a trade war: We are in one. When \nChina manipulates its currency, steals intellectual property, and uses \nrare earths to lure businesses and takes our intellectual property and \nbrings it to factories in China, subsidizes them against WTO rules, and \nthen tries to export the product here, as they are doing with solar \npanels, that is a trade war, as millions of Americans who have lost \ntheir jobs realize. So we are in the war. We may as well arm ourselves \nso that we might win.\n  The bottom line is very simple: I hope this bill moves forward. I \nhope it goes through the House. A large vote in the Senate tomorrow \nwill be a message to the House--Senator Brown's bill and, of course, \nhis and ours have been combined. But Senator Brown's bill passed in the \nHouse a few years ago, and I hope the President rethinks things and \nsigns it, because if he does, my prediction is that China, which never \nbacks off when it is in their own economic interest, will, because it \nwill no longer be in their economic interest because penalties will be \nimposed and equality will be imposed upon them once this bill is law. \nSo they will let their currency float--maybe not as quickly as we want \nbut far more quickly than it happens now, once this bill becomes law.\n  In my view, the arguments that have been raised against America \ntaking action to deal with unfair Chinese currency manipulation are \noutdated, wrong, and ineffectual. I have been arguing the other side, \nour side, for 5\n\n[[Page S6161]]\n\nyears. When Senator Graham and I first started talking about currency \nmanipulation, imposing a tariff, both the Wall Street Journal and New \nYork Times editorial boards--one very conservative and one very \nliberal--said China should be allowed to peg its currency. We have made \nprogress in the strength of our intellectual arguments. We have to take \nthat strength and translate it into action. Millions of American jobs, \nand ultimately trillions of American dollars of wealth, and nothing \nless than the future of our country are at stake.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I ask unanimous consent the order for the quorum call be \nrescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I rise to speak in opposition to the Chinese tariff bill \nbeing proposed by my colleague from New York. I understand the \nfrustrations that motivated this legislation, and I share serious \nconcerns over China's currency manipulation and trade practices. I have \nworked for years to ensure that trade happens and that free trade \nhappens on a level playing field. We still have a long way to go.\n  The answer to these frustrations with China is not to start a trade \nwar that will raise prices on many goods for American families at a \ntime when they are already struggling, especially when this approach \nhas already been tried and failed to gain any positive results for \nAmerican workers. The absolute last thing our floundering economy needs \nright now is retaliatory tariffs on American products that will destroy \nmore jobs. If we want to strengthen our currency, we should start by \ngetting control of our own monetary policy. We don't need to start a \ntrade war with China; we need to stop the class warfare that is \npreventing jobs from being created right here in America.\n  American workers are the best in the world, but they cannot fairly \ncompete in a global economy when the U.S. Government is keeping one arm \ntied behind their back. The solution is to free American workers, not \nto try to tie up our competitors with more misguided policies that will \nhurt American families with higher prices on household goods. The U.S. \nGovernment needs to give American workers the freedom to work, and that \nfreedom starts with the freedom to get a job.\n  If President Obama and the Democrats want to know who is preventing \njobs from being created in America, all they have to do is look in the \nmirror. Let's be clear about a few things: Other countries are not \nthreatening to massively raise taxes on our Nation's job creators and \ndrive jobs overseas. President Obama is. Other countries did not jam \nthrough a health care takeover bill that is raising the cost of health \ncare, making it harder for businesses to hire people and adding \ntrillions of dollars to our national debt. The Democrats in Congress \ndid. Other countries did not force us to pass the Dodd-Frank financial \ntakeover with thousands of new regulations that are raising costs on \nAmerican consumers and crippling businesses. Democrats in Congress did. \nOther countries are not writing hundreds of new regulatory rules that \nare destroying jobs in our Nation's energy sector and keeping us \ndependent on foreign oil. The administration's EPA is. Other countries \nare not blocking Boeing from creating thousands of American jobs in the \nState of South Carolina. The President's National Labor Relations Board \nis. Other countries are not forcing 28 U.S. States to require employees \nto join labor unions that make businesses less competitive. Democrats \nare the ones protecting labor bosses and hurting workers in America.\n  The Wall Street Journal has called this Chinese tariff bill ``the \nmost dangerous trade legislation in many years,'' and for good reason. \nIf we pass this bill, it is likely to spark a trade war. It is unlikely \nto create new jobs in America but will result in higher prices for U.S. \nconsumers. Businesses will pay more for raw materials from China, which \nwill increase prices on their goods and reduce employment. President \nObama and the Democrats should know better after seeing the results of \nthe tariff that was put on Chinese tires in 2009. In response, China \nretaliated with tariffs on American auto parts and poultry. This well-\nintended bill will have the same unintended results.\n  I understand the economic frustrations people have with China, but as \nso many of Obama's policies have done, this bill will only make things \nworse. This bill doesn't export the best of what American workers have \nto offer, it exports bad economics. Taxes and tariffs do not create \njobs, competition and markets do. Freedom will work if we let it.\n  I urge the Senate to reject this bill and start helping American \nworkers compete more freely here in America and around the world \ninstead of simply trying to hold others back.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. I ask that the order for the quorum call be \nrescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. I have just a couple comments with regard to those \nof the Senator from South Carolina. He was the ranking member on the \nEconomic Policy Subcommittee on which also sat the Presiding Officer \nfrom Oregon in 2009 and 2010. We held a series of hearings on \nmanufacturing policy, and there were some agreements between Senator \nDeMint and me on having a manufacturing strategy. We are the only major \nindustrial country in the world without a real strategy on \nmanufacturing. There are three ways to create wealth in this society: \nmanufacturing, mining, and agriculture. Manufacturing has been a \ndominant force and a significant creator of the middle class, and I \nthink we agree on that. We agree we want more of it in our country. \nThirty years ago, more than 25 percent of our gross domestic product \nwas manufacturing. Today that number is less than half that, and there \nare countries around the world--Germany, for instance, which has had a \nmanufacturing strategy, and they have almost twice the GDP and twice \nthe workforce.\n  So while Senator DeMint and I disagree on this China trade bill, I \nagree with the other Republican Senator from his State, Mr. Graham, who \nhas been a significant leader. He and Senator Schumer have worked on \nthis for, I believe, more than half a decade on responding to the \ncheating the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Republic of China \nhave done in the world trade structure. I don't believe, in any way, we \nare starting a trade war. Almost any economist will tell us the Chinese \nhave been committing a trade war for a decade. That is why our trade \ndeficit is three times what it was 10 or 11 years ago. It is why so \nmany manufacturing jobs in Senator Graham's and Senator DeMint's State \nof South Carolina, the Presiding Officer's State of Oregon, and my \nState of Ohio have been lost, not only because of China's currency, but \nthat is clearly a significant contributing factor. I go back to the \nillustration of gas stations, one across the street from the other, in \nAkron, OH. If one gas station could buy its gasoline with a 25-percent \ndiscount, it would soon put the other gas station out of business. That \nis really what has happened with China. China understands they have a \n25-percent advantage given to them because they game the currency \nsystem. I know what that means. The Presiding Officer from North \nCarolina has seen what has happened to manufacturing in her State, a \nmajor manufacturing State. Our trade problems are not so much with \ncompanies in China, they are with the government. It really is our \ncompanies against the government. When they can game the system with a \n25-percent bonus--when they sell into the United States, they get a 25-\npercent bonus, and when we try to sell into China, we get a 25-percent \npenalty on our companies' products--that hardly seems fair to me.\n\n  So as Senator Graham and Senator Schumer, the two leaders in this for \nmany years, have said, they just want to level the playing field. They \ndon't want us to have an advantage over China. Let's play fair and \nstraight. Really, that is what the question is, and that is what this \ncurrency bill will finally do.\n\n[[Page S6162]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I wonder if my colleague from Ohio \nwould consider a bit of a discussion for a few minutes.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Love to.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I found it very interesting, listening to some of the \ndebate today, that there seems to be some policymakers in the Senate \nwho haven't come to understand that when another nation pegs its \ncurrency, rather than letting it float, it does so deliberately to put \nin effect what is essentially a tariff against imports. In our case, \nthat is a tariff against American imports, and in some cases it \nprovides a subsidy to exports.\n  Now, here we are in America. Why would we say it is OK for China to \npeg its currency in a fashion that puts a tariff against American \nproducts and subsidizes Chinese exports to America? Because that is \nguaranteed to strip jobs out of America. Why would some Members of this \nChamber consider that to be just fine? I am puzzled by that, and I am \nwondering if the Senator could help me understand.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. I appreciate that. I was listening to one of the \nprevious speakers who opposed this bill and characterized the bill as a \nChina tariff bill. The Senator said it exactly right. When we sell to \nChina, it is as if they put a tariff on our products. When we buy from \nthem, we give them a 25-percent bonus--excuse me--when we try to sell \nto them, they ban that import. When we buy from them, they have a 25-\npercent bonus. It is putting us at such a disadvantage, as the Senator \nsaid.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. In Oregon, we recently had the shutdown of a company \ncalled Blue Heron. It has operated for the better part of a century, \nmaking paper. The point Blue Heron was making was that because of the \npegging of the currency, the paper they tried to sell to China faced a \n25-percent tariff, while China's paper enjoyed a 25-percent subsidy if \nit was sold in the United States, and it created an absolutely unfair \ninternational trade playing field that was going to be putting American \npapermakers out of business. No matter how efficient they could \npossibly be, China, with this subsidy, could sell into the U.S. market, \nundercutting American products. Well, that plant shut down. It is one \nof a series of paper plants that have shut down. I think the Senator \nhas some similar situations in Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. We do. The Senator from Oregon and I have talked \nabout this, that there is a gentleman who worked for a paper company \nwho illustrated to me what China has done. It was a specific kind of \npaper, a glossy, coated paper for magazines. The Chinese bought their \nwood pulp in Brazil, they shipped it to China, milled it there, and \nsold it back to the United States, and they undercut Blue Heron and \nOhio paper companies because they had that 25-percent subsidy.\n  There is no way, when labor costs are only about--labor is only about \n10 percent of the cost of paper production--there is no way they could \npossibly buy something as heavy and voluminous as wood pulp, ship it \nacross the ocean, mill it, ship it back in the form of paper, and not--\nthe only way they can undercut prices is by huge subsidies. There may \nhave been other subsidies to it. It may have been water and energy and \ncapital and land, but it surely was that 25-percent subsidy these \ncompanies have when they undercut our manufacturers.\n  I just know that in 15 years, I say to the Senator, or 10 years, we \nwill look back on the history of our country and say: Why did we let \none country undercut our manufacturing base so substantially and lose \nall those jobs and lose all that technology? When the products are \ninvented in this country, the production is done offshore, and so much \nof the innovation that is done on the shop floor ends up in that \ncountry rather than here, it makes it harder for us, when we lose that \ninnovative edge, to catch up.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I think it is important to understand as well that the \npegged currency isn't the only tool China is using to create an unlevel \nplaying field against American products. Another is that they use \nsomething economists call financial repression. That is a fancy word \nfor artificially lowering the interest rates on savings on a level \nbelow inflation. So if you are a Chinese citizen and you are saving \nmoney and the inflation rate is 5 percent, the interest rate you are \ngoing to get is going to be less than 5 percent. It is a way, \nessentially, of taxing the entire nation, and then the Chinese \nGovernment takes those funds and they give massive subsidies to \nmanufacturing in China. Those subsidies include grants, and they \ninclude below-market loans.\n  So on top of the huge tariff on American products which basically \nstems from this currency manipulation, we have these huge subsidies to \ndomestic manufacturers who export to the United States. China is \nsupposed to disclose those subsidies under WTO, but it may come as a \nsurprise to some in this Chamber that China doesn't do it. They only \ndid it one year, in 2006. So they are taking the structure that was set \nup and they are abusing it. This adds to, on top of the currency \nmanipulation, further driving jobs out of the United States, \ndiscriminating against U.S. products.\n  Isn't there a time when we as policymakers need to stand for American \nworkers, stand for the American middle class, and say we are not going \nto allow another nation in a major trading relationship to break the \nrules in order to discriminate against the very products that put \nAmerican workers out of work?\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. As a result of the work Senator Schumer did early \non this bill, with the cosponsorship of the Senator from North Carolina \nwho is presiding, this bill really is the first major bipartisan jobs--\nmajor, biggest jobs bill we have brought in front of this Chamber, and \nthis is a chance to finally begin to look toward ways of \nreindustrializing our country and building manufacturing that matters \nin places such as Buffalo and Charlotte and Portland and Toledo.\n  This bill is a real opportunity. I think that is why we got 79 votes \non the first go-round on Monday night. I think it is why we have so \nmany Republican sponsors of this bill. It is a result of the work \nSenator Schumer and Senator Graham have been doing for years to begin \nto build that foundation, and that is why the passage of this bill is \nso important.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I wish to thank the Senator from Ohio, Mr. Brown, for \nhis work, along with the work my colleague from New York, Senator \nSchumer, has done. It is time we stand for workers across our Nation \nwho have been systematically losing the good-paying manufacturing jobs \nbecause China has been pegging its currency and discriminating against \nAmerican products to subsidize the export of their own. This must be \ndiscussed in every corner of our Nation and must be discussed here on \nthe floor of this Chamber because it is affecting the success of \nAmerican families in Oregon, in Ohio, in New York, in North Carolina, \nand throughout our Nation.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, if Washington is going to force new \nregulations on the job creators of this country, I think America needs \nto know the cost of those regulations. That is why I rise today to \ndiscuss an important amendment, an amendment I am offering to the \nunderlying China currency bill. It is Barrasso amendment No. 671. This \namendment, which is a bipartisan amendment--it is cosponsored by \nSenator Manchin and Senator Blunt--will force the U.S. Government to \nlook before it leaps when it comes to issuing job-crushing regulations.\n  Simply put, the administration would be required to do a \ncomprehensive and transparent jobs-impact analysis--a jobs-impact \nanalysis--before issuing any job-crushing regulations.\n  Job creation in this country has almost come to a halt. The Labor \nDepartment reported that zero jobs were created in August. The economic \nrecovery that was promised by the administration failed to materialize. \nUnemployment remains at 9.1 percent. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate \nin China is 4.1 percent. Our economy is stagnant. China's economy is \ngrowing. It\n\n[[Page S6163]]\n\nhas been this way since President Obama took office.\n  The President blames the American people by saying the country has \ngrown soft. In September, he stated in a TV interview in Florida:\n\n       The way I think about it is, you know, this is a great, \n     great country that has gotten a little soft and, you know, we \n     didn't have that same competitive edge that we needed over \n     the last couple of decades. We need to get back on track.\n\n  Yet, despite the repeated assurances of improvement, President \nObama's own economic policies have failed. The only people who have \ngained from these policies live in countries overseas. We see it in \nChina. These are people who are benefiting from American companies \nmoving operations outside the United States. Why? Well, it is to escape \nWashington's redtape.\n  The President's stimulus plan failed to produce the 3.5 million jobs \nthe President had promised. His so-called green jobs initiative gave us \nmore red ink but never came close to the 5 million new jobs he \npredicted.\n  All the while, the Washington bureaucracy that he controls has \ncontinued to churn out extensive as well as expansive new regulations \nthat amount to an assault on domestic private sector job creation. The \nfacts are inescapable. Since President Obama took office, America has \nlost approximately 2.3 million jobs. We have been in an economic \ncrisis, a crisis that extends to America's confidence in the President, \nconfidence in this President to do anything that will change the \ncurrent course.\n  What the American people want is leadership, and they have rejected \nthe President's insistence that the only way forward is through more \nspending and more Washington redtape on those in this country who \ncreate jobs.\n  In September, the President addressed a joint session of Congress. He \nactually said he wanted to eliminate regulations, regulations he said \nput an unnecessary burden on businesses at a time, he said, they can \nleast afford it. Well, we heard this same message from the White House \ntime and time again. The rhetoric coming out of this White House simply \nhas not matched the reality.\n  In fact, Washington continues to roll out redtape each and every day. \nThe redtape makes it harder and more expensive for the private sector \nto create jobs while making it easier to create jobs in foreign \ncountries such as China. The President said his administration has \nidentified over 500 reforms to our regulatory system, he said, that \nwould save billions of dollars the next few years.\n  Well, I appreciate that the White House may have identified wasteful \nregulations, but it will not help our economy unless the White House \nrepeals those wasteful regulations. The President's jobs plan does \nnothing to fix the regulatory burdens faced by America's job creators. \nHis jobs plan actually adds to the burden on job creators in this \ncountry.\n  The President has tried to justify this increasing avalanche of \nredtape. He said he does not want to choose between jobs and safety. \nWell, in today's regulatory climate, the choice is a false one. \nWashington's wasteful regulations are not keeping Americans safe from \ndangerous jobs. The American people cannot find jobs because no one is \nsafe from the regulations coming out of Washington.\n  For every step our economy tries to take forward, Washington \nregulations continue to stand in the way. The expansion of the Federal \nbureaucracy is suffocating the private sector economy. Federal agency \nfunding has increased 16 percent over the past 3 years, while our \neconomy has only grown 5 percent over the same 3 years.\n  The regulatory burden is literally growing three times faster than \nour own economy. This massive increase in Washington's power has only \nmade the U.S. economy worse and China's better. Americans know \nregulating our economy makes it harder and more expensive for the \nprivate sector to create jobs. The combined cost of new regulations \nbeing proposed by the Obama administration in July and August alone was \n$17.7 billion. Much of this cost was borne by Americans working in red, \nwhite, and blue jobs.\n  Those who try to justify these policies claim they will help us \ncreate green jobs at some unknown time in the future. Our economy, our \njob market, is not a seesaw. Pushing one part down does not make the \nother side pop up. This administration's out-of-control regulations \nscheme is dragging down large portions of our economy.\n  Now the President has promised to stop this kind of overreach. \nPresident Obama issued an Executive order at the start of this year. \nWay back in the beginning of 2011 he said he wanted to do that, to slow \ndown Washington's regulations.\n  Let's see how effective the President has been with his Executive \norder. Well, it has failed. In the month the President issued his \nExecutive order, way back in the beginning of 2011, all of those months \nago, hundreds of new rules and regulations have been either enacted or \nproposed. For every day that goes by, America's job creators face at \nleast one new Washington rule to follow.\n  When the President announced his Executive order, he said he wanted \nto promote predictability and reduce uncertainty. These are very \nlaudable goals, but a new rule every day does nothing to promote \npredictability and is the very definition of uncertainty. The main \nsource of uncertainty in the economy right now is Washington \nregulations.\n  To make things worse, the people most victimized by this uncertainty \nare the very people the President claims he wants to help. The \nPresident said last year that when it comes to job creation, he wants \nto ``start where most new jobs do, with small businesses.''\n  Well, the sentiment is right, but, again, what has he done about it? \nAccording to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, businesses with fewer than \n20 employees, well, those businesses incur regulatory costs that are 42 \npercent higher than larger businesses which have up to 500 employees. \nThese figures do not include the avalanche of new regulations coming \ndown the road.\n  Since January 1 of this year, over 50,000 pages of regulations have \nbeen added to the Federal Register. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has \nsaid the President's new health care law alone will produce 30,000 \npages of new health care regulations. At whom are many of those aimed? \nWell, it is these same small employers the President claims to want to \nhelp.\n  The President said he will keep trying every new idea that works, and \nhe will listen to every good proposal no matter which party, he said, \ncomes up with it. Well, I have a pretty simple idea. If the President \nwants to know which proposals will work to create jobs, maybe he should \nrequire his regulatory agencies to tell him how their own actions will \naffect the job market.\n  The amendment I am offering is going to do just that. It is a \nbipartisan amendment. It is based on a bill that I have introduced \ncalled the Employment Impact Act. This amendment will force every \nregulatory agency to prepare what is called a jobs impact statement--a \njobs impact statement--for every new rule proposed.\n  The impact statement must include a detailed assessment of the jobs \nthat would be lost or even gained or sent overseas upon enactment of a \nrule coming out of Washington. Agencies would be required to consider \nwhether new rules would have a bad impact on our job market in general. \nThis job impact statement would also require an analysis of any \nalternative plans that might actually be better for our economy.\n  The amendment requires regulatory agencies to examine and report on \nhow new rules might interact with other proposals that are also coming \ndown the road. The problem with Washington regulations is not only that \nthey are too sweeping, but there are also too many. It makes no sense \nto look at any one individual rule or regulation in a vacuum and then \nenacting hundreds of them without identifying and understanding their \ncumulative impact and effect.\n\n  The cumulative effect of those regulations is going to spell death by \na thousand cuts for hard-working Americans who are trying to work, \ntrying to support their families. In keeping with the principles of \ntransparency that President Obama regularly proclaims is a priority for \nhim, this bill, this amendment, will require every jobs impact \nstatement prepared by a Federal agency to be made available to the\n\n[[Page S6164]]\n\npublic. The American people deserve to know--have a right to know--what \ntheir government is actually doing.\n  Federal agencies in Washington need to learn to think, to think about \nthe American people before they act. Requiring statements from these \nagencies on what their regulations will do is nothing new. For 40 years \nthe Federal Government has required an analysis of how Federal \nregulations will impact America's environment. They have to file what \nare called environmental impact statements. What I am asking for is \nsimply a jobs impact statement.\n  Past generations of legislators rightly recognized the importance of \nAmerica's land, air, and water. It is equally important that we \nrecognize the importance of America's working families as well. \nAmerica's greatest natural resource is the American people. We are \ntalking about people who want to work, who are willing to work, who are \nlooking for work, and yet cannot find a job.\n  This amendment, the Barrasso amendment, will force Washington \nbureaucrats to realize Americans are much more interested in growing \nour Nation's economy than they are in growing China's economy.\n  I urge a vote and adoption of this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I rise today to, first of all, congratulate all of my \ncolleagues, the 79 Members who came together to vote to proceed to a \nvery important measure, a jobs bill that is currently before us.\n  The great news is that it is a jobs bill that will cost us zero \ndollars to be able to implement in terms of about 2.25 million new \njobs, new jobs that will come. Why? Because we are saying as a group, \nas the Senate: Enough is enough, and we want China as well as other \ncountries to follow the rules. We want them to follow the rules so when \nour companies and our workers are competing in a global economy they \nwill have a level playing field and the ability to compete. We know if \nthe rules are fair, if there is a level playing field, we in America \nwill compete, and we will win. We know that.\n  The biggest violator on any number of trade issues we know of right \nnow is China. When they joined the WTO 10 years ago, the whole point of \nthem being able to join the world community under a world set of \neconomic agreements was to make sure they would have to follow the \nrules like everybody else. But ever since that time they have done \nnothing but flagrantly violate the rules.\n  When China does not play by the rules, it costs us jobs. It puts our \nbusinesses in Michigan, our workers in Michigan and across the country \nat a severe disadvantage. It has to stop. We in Michigan have been \nthrough more, deeper and longer than any other State in the Union, and \nwe are coming back because of a great work ethic and ingenuity and \nideas and entrepreneurship. We are moving forward and creating new \nideas. More clean energy patents are being created in Michigan than in \nany other place in the country.\n  We just had news today that, in fact, we are--last year 2010--the \nfastest growing high-tech sector. There are more high-tech research and \ndevelopment jobs in Michigan than any other place in the country. So we \nknow how to compete and we know how to win.\n  But we are in a global economy, where our companies are competing \nagainst countries. When we have an entity, a country like China that \ndoes not believe they need to follow the rules--whether it is stealing \nour patents, whether it is blocking our businesses from being able to \nbid to do business in China, or whether it is the huge issue of \ncurrency manipulation, which is in front of us today, we know the rules \nmatter. We know it is our job to stand for American businesses and \nAmerican workers, and that is what the bill in front of us does.\n  It says to China and any other country involved in currency \nmanipulation that we have had enough. It directs Treasury to take \naction; to look around the globe, determine where there is currency \nmisalignment, and to prioritize the countries that are most egregious \nin their actions--we know China is at the top of that list--and then it \nrequires them to act.\n  It requires Commerce to work with our businesses to act. We have had \nenough talk. We have had enough of hearing about give China time. We \nare now past 10 years when they entered the WTO, and every time we \nstart talking about this, they say: Well, we are going to change it. We \nare starting to change it.\n  There are those in Congress who say not only has it not changed but \nmaybe it is even getting worse. The point is, we are losing jobs as a \nresult of the way China cheats. Enough is enough.\n  How do they do that? In this case, when we say currency manipulation, \neyes glaze over. The reality is, because of the way they value their \nmoney--their currency--they are able to get an artificial discount. \nTheir products appear to cost less coming to the United States--the \nsame product made the same way. Ours artificially gets an increase in \nthe price. It can be up to a 40-percent difference, not because of \nanything other than the fact that they do not value their currency the \nway every other country in the world does in the world economy. They \nalways make sure they peg it in a way that they get a discount, no \nmatter what.\n  That is illegal under the WTO. It is unfair. It is cheating. That is \nwhat this bill fixes. A real-world example: We have some great auto \nparts manufacturers in Michigan, and a very common story would be that \na part breaks and to get another part, it costs $100 in Michigan, but \nthe Chinese were able to peg their cost at $60--not because it was any \ndifferent, other than the fact that they value their currency in a way \nthat allows them to have it appear that it costs less. So this is \nsomething we intend to take action on.\n  We know right now that if the Chinese currency was revalued, if they \ndid what everybody else does and followed the rules, we would see up to \n$286 billion added to the U.S. GDP right now. We would see 2.25 million \nU.S. jobs being created if China and others around them followed the \nlead and revalued their currency--2.25 million jobs. We don't need a \nline item in the budget to do that.\n  We are not talking about a new program. We are simply talking about \nleveling the playing field and stopping China from cheating. We can \ncreate those jobs. Our deficit would be reduced by between $621 billion \nand $857 billion, at no cost to taxpayers. At a time when we are \nstruggling with the largest deficit we have ever had, and we are \nstruggling with how we address that, the ability to have up to $857 \nbillion reduced in our deficit at no cost to taxpayers--that sounds \nlike a pretty good deal to me. People in Michigan would say: Why has it \ntaken so long to be able to address this?\n  Now is the time that we have a strong, bipartisan coalition. I am so \nproud of all our colleagues who have come together from every part of \nthe country, every part of our economy, whether it is manufacturing, \nagriculture, textiles or those involved in high tech, saying it is time \nfor us to stand for America, for American jobs, and for American \nbusinesses. That is what this is all about. What else are we hearing \nabout this particular effort? The Federal Reserve Chairman, Ben \nBernanke, said:\n\n       The Chinese currency policy is blocking what might be a \n     more normal recovery process in the global economy. It is . . \n     . hurting the recovery.\n\n  Again, that is something we can do to reduce the deficit and create \njobs. China is proceeding with a policy that is hurting the recovery, \nat a time when we need to get everything out of the way so we can come \nroaring back as a country. We are the greatest country in the world. We \nhave tremendous challenges right now, economically, that we will work \nour way out of. But one of the first things we can do is say to China: \nStop cheating.\n  We also have C. Fred Bergsten, a former Assistant Treasury Secretary, \nsaying this:\n\n       I regard China's currency policy as the most protectionist \n     measure taken by any major country since World War II.\n\n  Over the years, we have debated fair trade and free trade, whether it \nis protectionist to stand up for American businesses or workers, and \nhere we have an expert saying to us that China's policy on currency \nmanipulation is the ``most protectionist measure taken by any major \ncountry since World War II.''\n  The reality is, we can compete with anybody and win--and we will. But \nit is\n\n[[Page S6165]]\n\nour job to make sure there is a level playing field. This is about \nAmerican competitiveness. This is about being a global economy and \nmaking sure the rules are fair, making sure everybody is following the \nsame rules, and then let's go for it. I will put America's ingenuity \nand entrepreneurship, research and development, and skilled workforce \nup against anybody's.\n  Some say--and we have heard from the highest levels of the Chinese \nGovernment--it could spark a trading war if we stand for our businesses \nand require there be a level playing field. We know we have a \ncomplicated relationship with China. We borrow funds to offset our \ndebt. But we also are the largest consumer market in the world. They \nwant to be able to sell to us. I cannot believe they will decide that \nthey suddenly don't want to sell to the United States all those things \nthey make, the largest consumer market in the world. The difference is, \nthey would not be able to cheat, to get artificial discounts that will \nhurt an American small business that is making the same product.\n  As for the American textile industry, I had an opportunity to visit \nsome folks who make denim for jeans and folks in the cotton industry \nand talk about competitiveness and what this protectionist policy in \nChina is doing to the American textile industry, which is beginning to \ncome back--and will come back if, in fact, there is a level playing \nfield on trade. But they are up against a situation where they \nartificially are facing a 28- to 30-percent discount because of \ncurrency manipulation. Yet they are still competing. Can you imagine if \nthe rules were fair?\n  This is about American competitiveness, and it is about the fact that \nwe are responsible for making sure there is a level playing field for \nAmerican businesses and American workers. We will not have a middle \nclass in this country if we don't make and grow products. We want to \nmake products here and grow products here and the jobs will be here and \nthen we are happy to export products. We want to export our products, \nnot our jobs. That is the difference. We are sick and tired of \nexporting our jobs because of the fact that China does not follow the \nrules. Enough is enough. After more than 10 years, they have not had to \nstep up and do what they are supposed to be doing under the agreements \nthey have entered into. Enough is enough.\n  Again, I look forward to our final vote on this legislation. I think \nthis is a very important moment, at a time when there are many \ndisagreements, and there have been many difficult times in the Senate--\nbeing able to move forward and take action, the fact that colleagues on \nboth sides are standing together on behalf of businesses and workers at \nevery corner of this country, saying we are going to fight for American \njobs and businesses, large and small, and we are going to make sure we \ncreate a level playing field so we have the competitiveness structure \nwe need in this country, because we know if we have that level playing \nfield, there is nothing that can stop American ingenuity and American \nworkers, who are the best in the world and will continue to be.\n  I urge adoption of this bill and congratulate all my colleagues who \nhave been involved with this issue for many years--colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle. I am very pleased we have been able to get the \nlegislation to this point. It is now time to act on behalf of American \nworkers and American businesses.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as we discuss our relationship with China, \nit strikes me that we are ignoring one of the most critical issues \nimpacting U.S. competitiveness in regard to China--namely, China's \ninadequate protection of U.S. intellectual property, or what I call IP.\n  Let's remember that intellectual property is our Nation's No. 1 \nexport. American IP underpins the knowledge economy, providing our \nworkers and companies with a significant competitive advantage. In \nshort, IP equals jobs for American workers. It is that simple. Studies \nhave shown that IP-intensive industries employ more than 19 million \nworkers, create higher paying jobs across all skill levels, and support \nmore than 60 percent of total U.S. exports. That is why throughout my \nservice here I have endeavored to ensure that U.S. innovators and \ncontent creators are able to operate in an environment in which their \nIP, or intellectual property, is adequately protected.\n  I am pleased to have been the lead Republican sponsor of the recently \nenacted America Invents Act, which resulted in long overdue reforms to \nour Nation's patent system that will strengthen our economy, create \njobs, and provide a springboard for further improvements to our \nintellectual property laws. I was very pleased to see Senator Grassley \ntake that over as the new ranking member of the committee and do such a \ngreat job with it. And I want to pay tribute to the distinguished \nSenator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy, as well and to my colleagues in the \nHouse who saw the importance of that particular new law. It is the \nfirst time we have modified the patent laws in over 50 years, and that \nwas a historic event.\n  So it is pretty apparent that I take a great interest in intellectual \nproperty and all aspects of it. I am the chairman of the Senate \nRepublican High-Tech Task Force. I have to say it is really a privilege \nto work with these brilliant people who work in the intellectual \nproperty area, and while many of them are in Silicon Valley out in \nCalifornia, we have our own Silicon Valley in Utah that is becoming \nvery well known, a lot of innovation. So we have most of the really \ngreat companies right there in Utah as well.\n  U.S. leadership in innovation has not gone unnoticed by our economic \nand strategic competitors, who are adopting and evolving innumerable \ntactics to steal, expropriate, or otherwise undermine our intellectual \nproperty rights. Few, however, have been as overt in these efforts as \nChina. The statistics on counterfeiting and piracy alone are \nstaggering. According to a recent report by the U.S. International \nTrade Commission, firms in the U.S. IP-intensive economy that conducted \nbusiness in China in 2009 reported losses of approximately $48.2 \nbillion--that is billion with a ``b''--in sales, royalties, or license \nfees due to IP infringement in China. Now, that bears repeating: $48.2 \nbillion in losses for U.S. companies due to intellectual property \ninfringement in China.\n  Perhaps most disturbingly, the ITC report noted that companies \nreported that an improvement in IP protection and enforcement in China \nto levels comparable to that in the United States would likely increase \nemployment by 2.5 percent. Think what that would do for our country. \nThat amounts to almost 1 million U.S. jobs. And these aren't just jobs, \nthese are really good jobs. These are jobs that would benefit our \ncountry a great deal.\n  But counterfeiting and piracy does not stop at China's border. Based \non U.S. border seizure statistics, China is the primary source of \ncounterfeited products in the United States. These counterfeited \nproducts from China run the gamut. We are talking about counterfeit \ntoys, fake drugs, fake auto and aircraft parts, counterfeit computer \nchips, and counterfeit software, music, movies, and games--in essence, \nanything and everything that has value in the sights of Chinese \ncounterfeiters. Imagine if you are flying on an airplane and the parts \nthey thought were valid and good parts all of a sudden quit working. \nThis is a very important point I am making.\n  Clearly, this is not incidental. It is pervasive. Given China's \nsystem of government, it is fair to draw the conclusion that piracy and \ncounterfeiting have explicit or implicit government approval, for there \nis little doubt that China would deal severely with any other activity \nthey found objectionable well before it became pervasive. If they \nwanted to, they could clean this up. I hope they will because it is \nvery much to the disadvantage of our country.\n  It is becoming clearer every day that China's failure to protect U.S. \nintellectual property is part of a well-coordinated government-led \nnational economic development plan. Nowhere is\n\n[[Page S6166]]\n\nthis more obvious than in China's adoption of plans to promote \n``indigenous innovation.'' China's indigenous innovation policies \ndisadvantage U.S. innovators through rules and regulations which \nmandate the transfer of valuable technology and rules which provide \npreferential treatment for intellectual property which is developed in \nChina. In addition, there have been continued attempts to use \ntechnology standards as both a means to erect barriers to U.S. \ntechnology and as a means to unfairly acquire very valuable U.S. \ntechnology.\n  This is not to say China has not made any progress in combating the \ntheft of U.S. intellectual property. Certainly the commitments made at \nthe recent JCCT meeting regarding indigenous innovation and government \nprocurement were a positive step, as was the recent agreement by the \nBaidu Web site to license legitimate content from certain IP owners. \nBut while these actions are a good start, there is a lot more that \nneeds to be done.\n  We can debate currency manipulation all day long, but if we want to \nfoster immediate job growth in the United States, we should focus our \nenergies on working to find ways to staunch the bleeding when it comes \nto the theft of American innovation by China. Again, we are talking \nabout close to 1 million good-paying U.S. jobs which stand to be \ncreated if we can get this problem under control.\n  I stand ready to work with my colleagues on this important set of \nissues, but these are important issues, and it is time for China to \ngrow up and get into the world community and do what is right. It is a \nwonderful land. They have tremendous capacities. They are brilliant \npeople. A lot of their engineers were educated here. They are people \nwho really deserve to be leaders in the world community if they live in \naccordance with the basically honest rules of the world community. But \nright now they do not live in accordance with these rules, and they \ncould do a much better job on intellectual property than they have \ndone.\n  I have been there a number of times, and each time I have gone there, \nI have raised the intellectual property issues and I have raised the \npiracy issues. They always say they are going to do something about \nthese issues, but when push comes to shove, they really don't do what \nreally needs to be done.\n  Another important issue we need to discuss is enforcement, and that \nis why I filed amendment No. 679. My amendment requires the Comptroller \nGeneral of the United States to submit an annual report to the Congress \non the trade enforcement activities of the Office of the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative--or we refer to it as USTR. This is a simple amendment \nthat serves a vitally important purpose.\n  USTR is a relatively lean agency as compared to much of the bloated \nFederal bureaucracy. It is at the front lines in our efforts to open \nnew markets to U.S. goods and services providers, and it leads the way \nin holding our trading partners accountable when they fail to live up \nto their trade commitments. It is a tough job. U.S. companies face an \nunrelenting onslaught of governments and NGOs which collaborate in \nseeking new ways to hamper America's economic competitiveness by \nundermining our intellectual property rights, by imposing unwarranted \nphyto-sanitary measures that have no basis in science, by enacting new \ntechnical barriers to trade, imposing unfair pricing and regulatory \nregimes upon our industries, and other equally harmful measures. Our \ngoal, of course, should be to eliminate every single one of these. But \nthe reality of the situation is that, in a world of limited resources, \nwe must prioritize.\n  To my mind, the No. 1 priority should be removing barriers to our \nexports of goods and services, and eliminating foreign government \npractices which most impact U.S. jobs and economic well-being. \nUnfortunately, that has not been the case under this administration. \nUnfortunately, that is the situation we find ourselves in.\n  To cite an example, most people realize that China is an enormous \nproblem for U.S. innovators and content creators. Our companies face \npolicies designed to foster Chinese innovation at the expense of U.S. \ninnovators, the imposition of standards-based barriers, the continued \nrefusal to direct adequate resources toward stemming counterfeiting and \npiracy in both the online and physical realms, and other policies, \nlaws, and regulations that diminish the value of U.S. intellectual \nproperty. To date, this administration has not filed a single \nintellectual property-related enforcement action against China.\n  Similarly, Chile continues to flagrantly violate the terms of our \nbilateral free-trade agreement with regard to crucial protections for \nintellectual property. Despite the direct and demonstrable harm to \nAmerican innovators and workers, no dispute settlement process has been \ninitiated with regard to Chile's failure to adequately protect \nintellectual property in accordance with the terms of our free-trade \nagreement that we have entered into with them.\n  In contrast, after 3-plus years of devoting significant resources to \nintensive negotiations with the Government of Guatemala, the Obama \nadministration announced the initiation of the first ever bilateral \nlabor dispute against an FTA partner. The administration also recently \nannounced that it will investigate allegations by a Peruvian union that \nthe Government of Peru has violated its labor under the United States-\nPeru Free Trade Agreement. To me, these actions demonstrate skewed \nenforcement priorities.\n  It is hard to believe that Guatemala's alleged failure to adequately \nenforce its own domestic labor laws is anywhere near the top of the \nlist when it comes to trade barriers facing U.S. companies and workers. \nI also find it hard to believe that expending critical enforcement \ndollars to defend the interests of a Peruvian labor union should be \namong the top trade enforcement policies for this administration.\n  China, India, Brazil, Russia, and Chile are some of the many \ncountries where we face very real threats to American industry and \ncompetitiveness due to unfair trade practices and barriers. But instead \nof focusing on these immediate, ongoing, and very real economic harms, \nthe administration seeks yet again to instead score political points \nwith labor union leadership.\n  I can hardly blame them for that, in a sense, because the trade \nunions in this country are the biggest supporters of the President and \nof the Democrats, but it is outrageous to not put our country first \nunder the circumstances. It really is outrageous. I think even the \ntrade unions are going to have to stop and think about, is this \nadministration doing what is right with regard to our interests in all \nof these countries I have mentioned.\n  It is outrageous to direct the limited resources of our most \nimportant trade agency toward activities that have little to do with \nopening new markets or protecting U.S. jobs. This inability to \nprioritize based upon what is best for workers in the economy, as \ncompared to what is best for building labor union support, is another \nunfortunate example of the administration's inability to lead on trade.\n  My amendment requires the Comptroller General, on a yearly basis, to \ndetail the enforcement activities undertaken by the USTR and assess the \neconomic impact of each such activity, including the impact on \nbilateral trade and on employment in the United States. It would also \ninclude an assessment of the cost of, and resources dedicated to, each \nsuch activity.\n  I am hopeful my amendment will assist this and future administrations \nin setting rational enforcement priorities. By providing an objective \nmeasure of the likely impact on trade and employment of any enforcement \nactivities undertaken, it will also be an important resource for this \nand future Congresses in the conduct of our oversight responsibilities.\n  I would hope all of my Senate colleagues could support an amendment \nwhich provides us with important information and insights which will \nhelp us in ensuring that USTR utilizes taxpayer funds in the most \neffective manner possible toward opening markets and removing barriers \nto U.S. companies and workers.\n  I rise again today in support of my amendment No. 680. First, allow \nme to further explain some of my underlying concerns with the current \nbill's approach.\n  We have heard many estimates of job losses in the United States \nassociated\n\n[[Page S6167]]\n\nwith our trade deficit with China, following China's entry into the \nWTO, the World Trade Organization. Unfortunately, most of those \nestimates are highly unreliable and should be taken with a large amount \nof skepticism.\n  We have heard numbers coming out of the labor-backed Economic Policy \nInstitute, or EPI, saying that 2.8 million U.S. jobs have been lost or \ndisplaced because of trade deficits with China since that country's \nentry into the WTO, with 1.9 million of those jobs estimated to have \nbeen in manufacturing. Unfortunately, those estimates come from an \nunreliable static analysis which essentially says imports displace \nlabor used in domestic production and, therefore, lead directly to job \nloss and unemployment.\n  Looking at this particular chart here, you can see from that chart \nthe relation between U.S. imports, which is the blue line, and the \nunemployment rate, which is the red line, and you can see how it has \nshot up since 2008, and it is still wavering at the top--does not seem \nto conform the jobs and unemployment claims being made with some of the \nnumbers being used in our current debate. If anything, a casual \nobserver might even say that when import growth is strong, it tends to \nbe associated with a strong underlying economy, one in which \nunemployment is relatively low.\n  You can see from this chart that the imports were going up throughout \nthe first part of 2002 to 2008, when they hit the pinnacle and then all \nof a sudden drop down with this administration. Now they are coming \nback up. But the unemployment rate has now gone up tremendously, and it \ndoesn't seem to be coming down very far. So there is a correlation \nhere. And, frankly, one that concerns me, as the chart suggests, \nfollowing the pro-growth tax relief of 2003, the economy began to pick \nup some steam, imports correspondingly grew, and the unemployment rate \nfell until the financial crisis hit. That unemployment rate went down. \nThe 2.8 million job loss number from the labor-funded think tank, or \nthe 1.6 million job loss number the majority leader recently mentioned \nhere on the floor, and many of the other job loss numbers associated \nwith the China currency issue that are being offered by many of my \ncolleagues on the other side of the floor, are highly unreliable and \noften not much different from numbers simply picked out of thin air.\n\n  The jobs numbers do not account for dynamic flows of workers from \nindustry to industry, and the message being delivered is that if a job \nand an industry went away and net imports were going up, then the job \nmust have been lost or displaced because of trade. Well, that is \nfoolish.\n  What happened to the displaced worker? The analysis doesn't take that \ninto account, and merely suggests, misleadingly, that the worker is \nunemployed. What happens to the dollars that are associated with \nfinancing any increased net increase in imports? The analysis doesn't \ntake that into account.\n  If we run a higher trade deficit, finance it with dollar outflows, \nand foreign countries recycle the dollars back into Treasury bills to \nfinance the President's stimulus spending spree, does the analysis take \ninto account the resulting jobs that the President claims become \n``saved or created''? No. Those jobs numbers are only convenient when \nadvocates of the stimulus, such as the EPI, wish to promote more debt-\nfueled government spending.\n  I do not dispute that there are important dynamic effects of \ninternational trade on the U.S. labor market. I do dispute many of the \nnumbers being tossed about and offered as estimates of job losses \nstemming from trade with China. I do dispute that dealing with our \nbilateral trade deficit with China is the most important thing we can \ndo for jobs today, as the Senate majority leader has suggested. Those \ndoubts, of course, are not reasons to not act on the Chinese currency \nissue, but they do lead me to doubt the job creation priorities of my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle.\n  The President has been actively campaigning for congressional \nconsideration and passage of the so-called American Jobs Act--right \nnow, today--yet the majority leader here in the Senate refuses to let \nus consider the President's proposal right now, despite the minority \nleader having introduced a proposal for Senate consideration. \nEvidently, Senate Democrats believe that construction of a new \nmechanism to use to confront China and raise prospects of trade wars is \nmore important to jobs than the President's plan. I don't think so.\n  The President states--rightfully so--that unemployed American workers \ndon't have 14 months to wait for action on jobs. Yet we are considering \na currency bill that, at best, would set in motion a lengthy process of \ncurrency misalignment determinations and perhaps ensuing trade \nsanctions. If anyone believes that the process set up in the currency \nbill to confront any currency misalignment in existence today will lead \nto job creation right now or in the next 14 months, then I suggest they \ndo not understand much about international trade, labor markets, and \nthe often painfully slow processes of international trade negotiations.\n  It took President Obama over 2\\1/2\\ years to send free-trade \nagreements to Congress, bills that were all set to go from the day he \ntook office. Do you believe the legislation before us, even if it went \ninto effect right now, would lead to a fundamental misalignment finding \nimmediately, along with rapidly ensuing dialogue and action that would \nlead to job creation right now? Even if the legislation before us today \nwere implemented today, it would likely take months and years before it \nachieved any results.\n  It is important to confront existing currency misalignments and \nglobal imbalances, the sources of which include persistently high \namounts of U.S. debt made significantly worse during the past 3 years \nof deficits in excess of $1 trillion that were used wastefully on so-\ncalled ``stimulus'' and commercially non-viable green energy \nexperiments that just plain did not work. People are starting to wake \nup to this type of approach to government.\n  To say that the issue of China's managed currency peg is the most \nimportant issue for job creation today is telling, and it certainly \ndoes not speak well for how the President's jobs act is perceived by \nhis Senate Democratic colleagues as a job creator.\n  My concerns go beyond some of the claims related to job creation. I \nam afraid the current bill will be ineffective, and could actually end \nup harming our exporters through retaliation. That is a real fear, it \nis a real concern, especially since the Chinese have said they will \nretaliate. We don't need that right now, with the economy the way it \nis. But that is what they are going to do if this bill passes, even \nthough some might think that is the right thing to do. And I am not the \nonly one with concerns. Today, according to an article by the \nAssociated Press, the White House finally publicly stated that it has \nconcerns with this legislation. While we still don't know what those \nspecific concerns are, we do know that they believe approval of the \nbill would be counterproductive.\n  We know that. Why doesn't the administration come out and say it? Why \nis it the President cannot lead on these issues? Why is it he always \ncalls on Congress to lead on these issues? That is why we elected him \nas President--or should I say, that is why they elected him as \nPresident, because I did not vote for him, even though I like him \npersonally. I did vote for my colleague, John McCain.\n  Similar concerns were expressed in an opinion editorial by the New \nYork Times entitled ``The Wrong Way to Deal with China.'' They call \nthis bill a ``bad idea'' and ``too blunt of an instrument.'' \nSpecifically, they state that the bill is very unlikely to persuade \nChina to change its practices, noting that it will instead ``add an \nexplosive new conflict to an already heavy list of bilateral \nfrictions.''\n  That is the New York Times. My goodness. That is pretty much the \nBible for folks on the other side, and they do write very effectively \non some of these issues.\n  I agree currency manipulation is a serious problem, and I have \nproposed a better way to address it. My amendment empowers the \nadministration to work within existing frameworks to mitigate the \neffects of currency manipulation and stop it from occurring. If our \nnegotiators cannot make progress in the WTO and IMF--we go there \nfirst--we must go outside these organizations and align with other \nlike-minded countries to confront the Chinese currency interventions \ntogether.\n\n[[Page S6168]]\n\n  I could not agree more with my colleagues who have introduced the \nbill we are debating that China's beggar-thy-neighbor's currency \npolicies do harm the United States and our workers, and from that \nstandpoint, I commend my colleagues. But massive currency interventions \nharm many other economies and their workers as well. We should join \ntogether in a pluralistic way to counter China's actions and negotiate \na long-term solution to stop the fundamental misalignment of \ncurrencies, whether by China or any other country. If we did that, it \nwould bring tremendous worldwide pressure on China, rather than acting \nin a bilateral fashion, which this bill will do. My amendment would \nallow that to occur. I would be happy to give credit to the other side \nif they would accept that amendment. They have to know it is a \nprescient, worthy amendment--something that would make a difference, \nrather than just making talking points or creating a trade war with a \ncountry that we should work toward getting along with.\n  Appreciating the Chinese currency will help address global \nmacroeconomic imbalances and serve China's long-term economic interests \nas well, while ensuring that American businesses, farmers, \nmanufacturers, service providers, and workers compete on a level \nplaying field.\n  I just introduced this amendment yesterday around noon and I am \npleased many of my colleagues have reviewed my substitute bill and they \ndo support it and support a different approach. I think, if we want to \nwork together, it is a perfect way of doing it because it gives what \nthe folks want on this side and brings the right kind of pressure, \nwithout causing a huge trade war that is going to be very much to our \ndisadvantage.\n  In addition, since the introduction of my amendment, many business \nassociations, advocacy groups, think tanks, and others have come out in \nsupport of my substitute bill. I did not file that for political \nreasons. I did not file that to just cause trouble. I filed it because \nthese ideas in that bill are far superior to the ideas in the \nunderlying bill. I think my friends on the other side ought to look at \nit and tell me where they can improve it and take it over, if they \nwill. The fact is, it is far superior to what the underlying bill is.\n  Many agree my approach is our best chance at solving this problem \nthat we all find so frustrating. To those who think this is more of the \nsame old approach, I say absolutely not. The old policies and the old \nExchange Rate Act have not worked and they need to go. On that I think \nwe all agree.\n  My proposal does not say try and work this out with China and hope \nfor the best. Instead, my approach directs our negotiators to work with \nothers and challenge China until a solution is agreed to. My approach \ndoes not prevent the United States from taking unilateral action, but \nit does demand that the administration seek out those countries that \nwill join our efforts to combat currency manipulation so our actions \nare more effective and bring worldwide pressure on China to do what is \nright and to be more fair. We do need a bold, new approach, and we need \nto empower our negotiators to work within the WTO and IMF to ensure a \nlevel playing field for American businesses and workers. But if they \ncannot do that there and these institutions cannot handle this problem, \nthen we must join with other like-minded countries to act in concert to \ncounter China's currency policies outside the WTO and IMF.\n  This bill is going to cause a tremendous dislocation if it passes, \nand it is going to cause a trade war that is much to our disadvantage. \nIt may make good populist talk, but it will be very much to our \ndisadvantage and, in the end, will not do what they want it to do. My \nbill will. It may take some effort, but my bill will.\n  If they cannot confront these existing currency misalignments and \nglobal imbalances the way we are suggesting, if they cannot do that \nthere and these institutions cannot handle this problem, then we have \nto join other like-minded countries to act in concert to counter \nChina's currency policies outside the WTO and IMF.\n  That is what leadership is all about. That is what real executive \nbranch leadership should be about. That is what a real USTR should be \nabout. But we also need a partner. We need an administration that will \nlead on this issue. If I have an objection to this administration, it \nis that they do not lead on anything. They didn't send up a budget or \nthe one they did failed 97 to zero. But they have not taken it \nseriously. They just wait for Congress to act and for Congress to do \nthese things. That is what we elected the President to do, to send up \nhis approach to this. That is what we elected him for and he ought to \ndo that. But they do not, for some reason.\n  We also need a partner. We need an administration that will lead on \nthis issue. My amendment will hold the administration accountable until \nthey achieve results and that is whether it is this administration or a \nsuccessive administration. We are debating which approach will better \nsolve the chronic currency manipulation problem with China. My approach \nhas been endorsed by Americans for Tax Reform, which said that the \nHatch amendment ``offers a sensible approach that utilizes the \nmechanisms created by the international trade community to resolve such \ndisputes.''\n  The Emergency Committee for American Trade says the Hatch amendment \n``will more effectively address concerns about currency misalignment by \nChina and other countries, without opening the door to many harmful \neffects on U.S. business and workers.''\n  The Retail Industry Leaders Association also supports my amendment, \nas does the Financial Services Roundtable. This amendment is already \ngenerating significant support. Why don't my friends on the other side \ntake it, declare victory, and go from there? They can refile it in \ntheir name. That will be fine with me. I don't care who gets the credit \nfor it, I just care that we handle it in a way that makes sense rather \nthan make a bunch of political points that frankly will irritate the \ndaylights out of our friends from China.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment and let's all agree to \nhold the administration accountable and work with the other like-minded \ncountries to challenge China's currency practices.\n  I am happy to yield the floor at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of the remarks by the senior Senator from Ohio I be \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I said to Senator Inhofe I will be \nno more than 10 minutes and I appreciate his courtesy and his being \nhere.\n  I rise in opposition to the Hatch amendment. I respect and appreciate \nmy colleague from Utah and his proposal to negotiate a solution with \nChina and other nations on currency. I have worked with him on the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, as the Presiding \nOfficer has, and I appreciate his concern on all these issues and his \nwide range of knowledge. My firm belief, however, is his amendment is \nnot going to work. I know he generally does not want to take the same \ndirection we do in standing up to the Chinese. I think, when we talk \nabout multilateral negotiation, we are pretty much saying to the \nChinese: Please stop the strategy, however unfair and in violation of \ninternational norms, that has helped your country accumulate enormous \nwealth. Please stop. We hope you will stop. Please stop, or we are \nsaying please stop what Fred Bergsten says is the ``most protectionist \npolicy any major country has taken since World War II.''\n  We have tried this. We now have the ability to do multilateral \nnegotiations. Senator Hatch is right. The administration has not \nparticularly led on that.\n  He is also right to add that the Bush administration also did not \nparticularly lead on that. Before that, the Clinton administration did \nnot particularly lead on that.\n  We have the ability, without amendment No. 680--because it would add \nnothing significant to the procedures and the steps that are already in \nplace as a matter of current law and practice--to do these \nnegotiations. We have an administration, a Treasury Department that may \nchange political parties\n\n[[Page S6169]]\n\nfrom time to time but doesn't change strategies in dealing with the \nChinese. It is always: Please stop. We hope you will do something \ndifferently. We would like it if you would change what you are doing. \nWe think it would be better if you are not cheating on currency and \ncheating on international trade policies. We would like, now that we \nlet you into the World Trade Organization, that you actually follow the \nrules of the WTO. We think it would be great if you follow the force of \nlaw and the rule of law.\n  Saying those things has gotten us nowhere. That is why, while I \nrespect Senator Hatch, amendment No. 680 doesn't get us anywhere. It \ndoesn't change the law. It just delays. We know how the Chinese like it \nwhen we delay because every day we delay is one more day where the \nChinese cheat, where the Chinese have an advantage, where the Chinese, \nthe People's Republic of China, the Communist Party, can again take \nadvantage of American workers and American companies.\n  The Treasury Department already has specific reporting obligations. \nThey already have ample authority to consult and engage bilaterally, \nmultilaterally, and plurilaterally under the Exchange Rates and \nEconomic Policy Coordination Act of 1988, which amendment No. 680 would \nrepeal.\n  I appreciate what Senator Hatch wants to do, but the fact is, we have \nto make the Chinese understand, other than occasional pleading, \noccasional begging, the occasional polite requests--we have to make \nthem understand, if they do not stop manipulating their currency, if \nthey don't stop intervening to keep a weaker renminbi, the United \nStates will defend itself. The United States cannot turn the other \ncheek on this one.\n  The Presiding Officer said the other day the Chinese steal our lunch, \nand if we take any of it back, they get all upset at us, although the \nPresiding Officer said it better than I just said it. But the fact is, \nthe Chinese have not played fairly. I used the example on the Senate \nfloor of what currency manipulation means in very simple terms. If \nthere is a gas station on Summit Street in Akron and there is a gas \nstation across the street--there are two Marathon stations--one of the \nMarathon stations gets its oil from Findlay, OH, at a 30-percent \ndiscount and the other station doesn't, the Marathon station that gets \na discount is going to put the other one out of business, pure and \nsimple.\n  As Senator Merkley said the other day, there is a tariff on goods we \nsell to China, and there is a subsidy on goods China sells to us. How \ndo we compete with that? Amendment No. 680 will not help us compete \nwith that, it will just delay and delay. That does not make sense. That \nis why this legislation, S. 1619, without the Hatch amendment, makes \nmuch more sense. It allows us to move finally and quickly. It allows us \nto move with certainty. It allows us to move straightforwardly. It \nstrips away all the delay and the head fakes and the feinting and all \nthe other things the Chinese Party Government is so good at doing.\n  I ask for defeat of the amendment and passage of S. 1619, and I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent at the conclusion \nof my remarks that Senator Harkin be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, recently both the majority leader and the \nminority leader came down to the floor to talk about the President's \njobs bill. There was an effort to bring up this bill by the minority \nleader, and it was objected to by the majority leader. And I understand \nthat, but all we have heard from the President from the very first time \nhe introduced this was ``pass the bill, pass the bill, pass the bill.'' \nI know there is some reason he keeps using that phrase over and over. \nIt has probably been tested and is one that I think he believes will \nmove a lot of people. Frankly, I don't think it will because too many \npeople remember what happened the last time he had a stimulus bill. \nThat is something which has not been really discussed on the floor in \nconsideration of what he refers to as the jobs bill. So I can see why \nhe keeps talking about passing the bill, because he doesn't really want \nto talk about it.\n  His new proposal reminds me so much of that $825 billion stimulus \npackage he rammed through Congress shortly after entering office. It is \nalmost the same thing. The Recovery Act is the $825 billion act. It \nincluded only $27.5 billion in highway spending, which was the stimulus \nportion of that bill. We are talking about 3 percent of the $825 \nbillion.\n  I am particularly sensitive to this since I have in the past been the \nchairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, and I am now \nthe ranking member. We have a Transportation reauthorization bill we \nare trying to get up and get up on a bipartisan basis.\n  Back during the consideration of the Recovery Act, the $825 billion, \nI tried to pass an amendment on this floor to increase that to about 30 \npercent instead of 3 percent of the bill. If that had happened, we \nwould not be in the situation we are today. We would have a lot of jobs \nout there that would be under construction and good things would be \nhappening.\n  In the case of this $447 billion bill, which is kind of the Recovery \nAct lite, there is only $27 billion in highway spending, and it is not \nconceivable that he didn't learn his lesson from the first go-around \nthat that is the main reason people are upset with it right now. That \nis the reason he keeps saying: Pass the bill, pass the bill.\n  The proposal includes a few different things, but much of it will be \nsent to the President to spend however he wants. Now, you may be \nwondering, will Congress tell the President where to spend the money? \nTo a very limited extent, that is right. When Congress does not tell \nthe President exactly what he is to do with each dime he gets, the \nPresident gets to decide what to fund.\n  This administration has a history of making incredibly poor spending \ndecisions with the money appropriated to it. The biggest example I can \nthink of is the $825 billion stimulus package. When the President \nsigned this bill in February of 2009, he said--and I want you to hold \nthis thought--he said:\n\n       What I'm signing, then, is a balanced plan with a mix of \n     tax cuts and investments. It's a plan that's been put \n     together without earmarks or the usual pork barrel spending. \n     It's a plan that will be implemented with an unprecedented \n     level of transparency and accountability.\n\n  That is what he said. That is a direct quote. For those of you who \nare watching, I have news for you: Despite the President's remarks, the \nspending was not balanced, and it had a tremendous amount of porkbarrel \nearmark spending even though there were no congressional earmarks. This \nis a distinction not many people make. I tried to get this point across \nback when the Republicans very foolishly talked about having a \nmoratorium on earmarks. I said: Those are congressional earmarks. That \nis not where the problem is. The problem is in bureaucratic earmarks.\n  The clearest and most recent example of a huge earmark is the loan \nguarantee that was given to Solyndra. We have been reading about this \nand hearing about it recently. It is now a bankrupt solar panel \nmanufacturing company. We have heard about that. Solyndra was a \npolitically connected firm from California that was able to lobby the \nWhite House to obtain a loan guarantee of $535 million to fund its \ngreen jobs pipedream. This happened despite the fact that some in the \nadministration were warning the White House to give them more time to \nevaluate the company's finances. It seems they were concerned about the \ncompany's long-term viability. But these warnings were ignored by the \nWhite House. They wanted to fund the project anyway. Why? I think it \nwas for two reasons: First, the White House has a fascination with \ngreen energy; second, political gamesmanship. Some of Solyndra's \nbiggest investors are big fundraisers and have been big fundraisers for \nPresident Obama. We now know they made repeated visits to the White \nHouse. That is not just a coincidence.\n  Another question is this: How did the White House have the authority \nto give the loan guarantee to Solyndra in the first place? The short \nanswer is Obama's stimulus package. That was the $825 billion stimulus \npackage. It significantly expanded the Department of Energy's Loan \nGuarantee Program, and with this expansion the White\n\n[[Page S6170]]\n\nHouse was able to select Solyndra for a loan guarantee.\n  While the stimulus package did not include any porkbarrel spending in \nthe way that most people think about it--congressional earmarks--this \nprovides clarity to the fact that when Congress does not explicitly \nstate where taxpayer funds should go, the money is handed over to the \nadministration to spend however they want. They get to earmark every \nlast dime.\n  In the case of Solyndra, the President handed it over to his \npolitical buddies who were in favor of the green energy projects. If \nthat isn't a porkbarrel project, I don't know what is. Now the damage \nhas been done, and the taxpayers are going to be on the hook for as \nmuch as $535 million in losses.\n  Sadly, Solyndra is just one of many examples of porkbarrel spending \nin the stimulus bill. We are talking about the first stimulus bill, the \n$825 billion bill. Not too long ago, Sean Hannity had on his program--I \nthink it took him two programs to get it through--the 102 most \negregious earmarks that are recorded. It is really kind of interesting. \nIn fact, I have the whole list here, and I am going to ask that it be \nmade a part of the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. INHOFE. I would love to be able to name all of these. These are \njust ridiculous. There is $219,000 to study the hookup behavior of \nfemale college co-eds in New York; $1.1 million to pay for the \nbeautification of Los Angeles, Sunset Boulevard; $10,000 to study \nwhether mice become disoriented when they consume alcohol in Florida. \nIt goes on and on. Again, there are 102 of these. These are the most \negregious.\n  What is interesting is that the day after Sean Hannity exposed these \nearmarks--102 of them--I came to the floor and I read all 102 of them. \nI said: What do these 102 earmarks have in common? The answer: Not one \nis a congressional earmark. They are all bureaucratic earmarks. They \nall came from the $825 billion.\n  Remember I said a minute ago that he said there will be no earmarks \nin this package? It is the same thing he is saying about this second \ngo-around for the jobs bill he is talking about today. The \nadministration took $825 billion that Congress gave it and chose to \nspend it on stupid things such as the ones I just listed, but there are \n102 of them. I hope he will take the time, since it will be in the \nRecord, to read all 102 of them.\n  What does this have to do with the jobs bill? To me, the jobs bill is \nsimply the President coming back to Congress to ask for more money to \nspend however he wants on porkbarrel projects such as these. No one has \ntalked about this on the floor. They have talked about the problems \nthey have with this spending bill and why it is really not a jobs bill, \nbut no one is talking about the fact that this is exactly what he did \nbefore. I don't know why we are not talking about this and featuring \nthis because if he said before that there were going to be no earmarks \nand then he had 102 egregious earmarks, why would he not do the same \nthing now? The answer is, he would do it. He would like to hand this \nout to his cronies in ways that would best benefit him.\n\n  You may remember the President's State of the Union Address from \nearlier this year. In it, he promised, and I quote, ``If a bill comes \nto my desk with earmarks inside, I will veto it.'' Well, you have a \npromise from the President that unless Congress gives him all of the \nauthority to determine how money is spent through the bureaucratic \nearmark process, he will veto the bill. In other words, he will veto a \nbill unless he has total authority on how to spend it, and he can spend \nit on his own earmarks in spite of the fact that he said there will be \nno earmarks. So for any jobs bill to be considered, Congress is going \nto have to let the President decide how all the money is being spent. \nIt is a hard concept to get ahold of.\n  ``Earmarks'' has become a dirty word, and people assume that when you \nsay ``earmarks,'' you are talking about congressional earmarks. That is \nnot the problem. I have legislation I am going to be talking about that \nwill correct this and better inform the public as to what is really \ngoing on. So we are finding ourselves in the same situation again.\n  What is worse is the fact that the problem of bureaucratic earmarks \nis not limited to special stimulus packages. It is a normal course of \nbusiness. On any given day, the administration is making thousands of \ndecisions on how to spend money it has appropriated. Congress first \npasses laws authorizing the executive branch to do certain things, and \nthen we appropriate the money and go and do it. But unless Congress \ngives specific instructions as to where to spend the money--a process \nmany people decry as congressional earmarks--the administration gets to \ndecide where to spend the money. In other words, the bureaucracy does \nthe earmark or President Obama does it.\n  I serve on the Armed Services Committee. We are staffed with experts \nin defending America. We have experts in missile defense, experts in \nlift capability, all of that. The way it has always happened before is \nthe President--whether it was President Bush or Clinton or any other \nPresident--designs a budget, and that budget, the parameters, goes to \nCongress. Then we in the authorization committees decide if we agree \nwith the President and how he wants to defend America.\n  A good example of that is that right before the prohibition on \nearmarks came in, the President sent his budget down--I think that was \nhis first budget--and in that budget was $330 million for a launching \nsystem. It was called a Bucket of Rockets. It was a good system. It was \nsomething I would like to have for defending America. But when we \nanalyzed it, we looked and we thought, with what is happening right \nnow, our greatest need is to expand our F-18 program and buy six new F-\n18s. So we took the $330 million he would have spent on the rocket-\nlaunching system and spent it on six new F-18s, and it was a wise thing \nto do. You can't do that now because the President has to make all of \nthe decisions because that would be called a congressional earmark.\n  Earmarks don't increase spending at all. All they do is say: All \nright, Mr. President, you go ahead and spend it the way you want to. A \nrecent example of this comes from the Bureau of Land Management within \nthe Department of the Interior.\n  While I could talk for hours about whether the management of Federal \nlands is appropriate for government to do, that is not what I want to \nbring your attention to. That is another discussion for another time. \nWhat I am concerned about is how carefully the Bureau of Land \nManagement works to keep its actions aligned with the authorization and \npower it has been given by Congress. We write laws for a reason. We say \nthe bureaucracy can do certain things and not do certain things. When \nwe do that, we are limiting the bureaucracy and the bureaucracy's \nauthority. We are not saying they can interpret the law in any way they \nchoose, but generally that doesn't stop them from trying.\n  One thing the Bureau of Land Management is authorized to do by a \nstatute is to enter into contracts and cooperative agreements to \nmanage, protect, develop, and sell public lands. In managing public \nlands, title 43 authorizes the BLM to, among others things, preserve \nthe land's historic value.\n  A few days ago, as I was searching through the government's grants \ndatabase--by the way, this database is something we put in when \nRepublicans were a majority in our committee. The Environment and \nPublic Works Committee has a database which will show people, if they \ncare to wander through, just what the bureaucracy is spending money on.\n  I was looking through the grants database, and I came across one that \nshocked me. On September 9 of this year, just a few days ago, the BLM \nannounced its intent to award a grant of $214,000 to the Public Land \nFoundation to fund a research project to describe in detail why the \nHomestead Act of 1862 had a significant impact on the history of \nAmerica. When I asked them to justify that, they started talking about \nhow important history is.\n  Today, my question is this: What part of this grant has anything to \ndo with today's actual public lands? This is not a grant to dust off \nthe historic landmarks at national parks. This is a research project to \nstudy history, which may be a noble task, but nonetheless that is what \nit is for.\n\n[[Page S6171]]\n\n  What the American people need to understand is that this sort of \nthing happens all the time. The bureaucracy is completely numb to the \nfact that we have a $1.5 trillion deficit just in this year alone, and \nwhile this should inform the way it spends money and help to prioritize \naccordingly, it doesn't. The bureaucracy takes the money given to it by \nCongress and spends it on porkbarrel projects that are important to the \nPresident. Right now, there is no way around this. There is no \naccountability or transparency built into it in any way. The \nbureaucracy earmarks its funds.\n  I believe this needs to be changed, and I am currently drafting \nlegislation that will change the way the bureaucracy makes funding \ndecisions. My legislation will bring true transparency and \naccountability to the process, and it will require the administration \nto state explicitly which laws authorize its grant awards. It will also \nprovide a way for Congress to weigh in and challenge the \nadministration's thinking. This is not just for the current \nadministration; it is for any administration.\n  With trillions of dollars in deficits, we cannot afford to give the \nPresident another $447 billion to spend on whatever he wants because \nthat is what it would be. We need to reduce spending, but we also need \nto ensure that the spending we are doing is justified by the laws \nCongress passes. Because of this, we need to bring more light and \naccountability to the bureaucratic earmarking process.\n  Further, I warn my colleagues to not be fooled into the idea that \nwhenever we pass money off to the administration, it is in safe hands. \nThe opposite is true, and I urge my colleagues to oppose more blank \ncheck stimulus spending because of it.\n  Again, after President Obama stated on February 17, 2009, there will \nbe no earmarks in his $825 billion stimulus bill, it contained more \nthan 100 very egregious, offensive earmarks. I could--again, I am not \ngoing to read off the list, but it will be a part of the Record \nfollowing these remarks I am making now.\n  He will do it again. If we pass another $450 billion stimulus bill, \nwe can be sure it will be full of earmarks as bad as the ones he put in \nthe initial stimulus bill.\n  This is our second blank check for the President. He fooled us once. \nDo not let it happen again.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               Bureaucratic Earmarks in the Stimulus Bill\n\n       102.

The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the so-called supercommittee created by \nthe Budget Control Act has begun their work. It is mandated to produce \na plan by November 23 that will reduce future deficits by at least $1.5 \ntrillion. As chair of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee, I have been invited to submit recommendations to the \nsupercommittee, and I will do so in the days ahead.\n  Certainly, I wish this group well. However, it is critically \nimportant we define success in terms that matter to working Americans. \nFrankly, I am deeply disturbed by the Washington groupthink that \ndefines success narrowly in terms of maximizing deficit reduction. I \nhave come to the floor to urge members of the supercommittee to embrace \na broader and more powerful definition of success. Success must include \nboosting the economy and creating jobs.\n  After all, the most effective way to reduce the deficit is to help 25 \nmillion unemployed and underemployed Americans find jobs and become \ntaxpayers once again. There can be no sustained deficit reduction \nwithout a recovery of the economy and a return to normal levels of \nemployment. Indeed, just yesterday, the Congressional Budget Office \nreleased an analysis showing that if our economy were not in \nrecession--if our economy were not in recession--if it were employing \nlabor and capital at normal levels, the deficit would be reduced next \nyear by an estimated $343 billion--a reduction of one-third of the \ndeficit in 1 year if we just had normal employment.\n  So I have a simple but urgent message to the supercommittee: Go big \non jobs. That message would be strongly seconded by people such as \nConnie Smith of Tama, IA. In January, she was laid off after working 27 \nyears for the same telecom company. Since being laid off, she has been \nworking as a contractor doing the same type of work for less pay and no \nbenefits.\n  Jean Whitt would also agree. She was laid off in 2008 and is now a \nstudent at Iowa Western Community College, striving for a new career in \nnursing. She is hoping good jobs will be available when she graduates.\n  As I said, inside the Washington bubble, our leaders have persuaded \nthemselves that the No. 1 issue confronting America is the budget \ndeficit. I assure everyone that ordinary Americans are focused on a far \nmore urgent deficit: the jobs deficit.\n  But I am also concerned about a third deficit: the deficit of \nimagination and vision in Washington today. I am dismayed by our \nfailure to confront the current economic crisis with the boldness \nearlier generations of Americans summoned in times of national \nchallenge.\n  Let's be clear about the staggering scale of today's challenge. Our \nNation remains mired in the most severe period of joblessness since the \nGreat Depression. As I said, some 25 million Americans are desperate to \nfind full-time employment. According to new data from the Census \nBureau, the poverty rate has risen to 15 percent--the highest level in \n18 years. Twenty percent of American children are being raised in \npoverty--one out of every five kids in America.\n  Last week, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Mr. Ben Bernanke, \nsaid unemployment is a ``national crisis.'' Very true, Mr. Bernanke. It \nis a national crisis. It is far and away the No. 1 concern of the \nAmerican people. That is why an exclusive, single-minded obsession--\nobsession--with slashing spending and reducing the deficit is not just \nmisguided, it is counterproductive. If the supercommittee cuts the \ndeficit by $1.5 trillion and does nothing to create jobs, this would \namount to a massive dose of antistimulus. It will further drain demand \nfrom the economy and destroy even more jobs. That, in turn, will make \nthe deficit worse, not better. It is the equivalent of applying leeches \nto a patient who needs a transfusion.\n  We must stop this mindless march to austerity. Smart countries, when \nthey have these kinds of challenges, do not just turn a chainsaw on \nthemselves. Instead of the current slash-and-burn approach, which is \nbeing sold through fear and fatalism, we need an approach that reflects \nthe hopes and aspirations of the American people.\n  To be sure, we must agree on necessary spending cuts and tax \nincreases. But we must continue to invest in what will spur economic \ngrowth, create jobs, and strengthen the middle class, knowing this is \nthe only sustainable way to bring deficits under control.\n  Again, I say to the supercommittee: If you are serious about reducing \nthe deficit, you must put job creation front and center in your \ndeliberations and agenda, not just slashing and cutting government \nspending to reduce the deficit.\n  I do not want to be misunderstood. My preference, of course, is \nalways to reduce the deficit. I know that. As a senior member of the \nAppropriations Committee, I appreciate that we must seize every \nopportunity to prudently--prudently--reduce Federal spending. There are \nopportunities, including in the Pentagon, to reduce Federal spending \nwhile minimizing further damage to the economy and jobs.\n  However, I believe we must be equally willing to say no--no--to \nfoolish, destructive budget cuts. Most important, as I have said, the \nsupercommittee must broaden its focus to include a sharp emphasis on \ncreating jobs and boosting the economy.\n  That is why I was very pleased by the plan presented by President \nObama: the American Jobs Act. As the President said in his speech to \nCongress, the American Jobs Act boils down to two things: putting \npeople back to work and more money in the pockets of working Americans.\n  Most importantly, in my book, the American Jobs Act would \ndramatically ramp up investments in infrastructure\n\n[[Page S6173]]\n\nin order to boost U.S. competitiveness and directly create millions of \nnew jobs.\n  Specifically, the American Jobs Act includes $30 billion to renovate \nsome 35,000 schools and community colleges nationwide. This would \ncreate hundreds of thousands of new jobs, especially in the hard-hit \nconstruction industry.\n  The legislation--the President's bill--provides $30 billion to help \nlocal school districts hire and retain teachers. This new fund would \nsave or create nearly 400,000 education jobs.\n  In addition, the American Jobs Act includes $50 billion for immediate \ninvestment in our transportation infrastructure. Again, this will \ndramatically boost employment, while modernizing the arteries and veins \nof our commerce.\n  Now people say: How are we going to pay for all this and these other \ninvestments, keeping our teachers in the classroom, renovating the \ninfrastructure? How are we going to pay for all this to get our economy \nback on track?\n\n  For the answer, we again need to listen to the American people. I \nreceived a heartfelt message from Dan Carver, a fifth-grade teacher in \nCarlisle, IA. He says he is struggling similar to other middle-class \nAmericans to pay his bills and his taxes and he does not understand why \ncorporations and the very wealthy are not also paying their fair share.\n  In poll after poll after poll, by 2-to-1 margins--2-to-1 margins--\nAmericans want an approach that includes tax increases on those who can \nmost afford it, those whose incomes have skyrocketed in recent years, \neven as middle-class incomes have fallen, those who have benefited the \nmost from tax breaks initiated during the Bush administration. By a 2-\nto-1 margin--this should be a no-brainer for people elected to \nCongress. Read the polls. That is what people want done.\n  We see all those people up on Wall Street. It is now spreading to \nWashington. There is even an event planned for Mason City, IA, this \nweekend by a lot of young people, saying: Look, we have to raise \nrevenue. We can't just slash and cut back and retreat. We need to raise \nrevenue and charge forward.\n  We would be foolish to ignore the voices of working Americans from \nall walks of life. For more than a decade now, these good citizens have \nbeen told that tax breaks for the wealthy will result in millions of \nnew jobs and a booming economy. That is what they have been told. They \nwere told wealthy Americans are so-called job creators, and if we just \nshove enough tax breaks their way, jobs will magically bloom.\n  Frankly, this is the same old theory of trickle-down economics, and \nit manifestly has never worked. For ordinary Americans, the only things \nthat have trickled down are wage cuts, mass unemployment, upside-down \nmortgages, personal bankruptcies, and disappearing pensions.\n  Instead of this failed trickle-down economics for the rich, it is \ntime for percolate-up economics for middle-class Americans. We have a \nsaying for this out in the Midwest, and I have heard it many times: You \ndo not fertilize a tree from the top down. You have to put it in at the \nroots.\n  It is time to invest directly in jobs by renovating our crumbling \ninfrastructure, rebuilding our schools, putting laid-off teachers back \nto work. By all means, it is time to ask those who have benefited the \nmost from our economy to pay more--yes, to pay more--to help finance \nthese urgent investments. Because these are the kinds of things \nindividuals cannot do on their own. An individual cannot rebuild a \nhighway or a school. An individual cannot retrofit a building. An \nindividual cannot build new energy efficiency systems. But we can do \nthis acting together. That is why it is time to ask those who have \nbenefited the most from our economy to pay some more.\n  I close by reiterating that we need to pursue a path that, first and \nforemost, right now, focuses on job creation; in the longer term, \nfocuses on deficit reduction. After we get the economy going and get \npeople back to work and being taxpayers again, then we can reduce the \ndeficit. As the report showed this week, if we were to just have normal \nemployment levels, we would reduce the deficit by $343 billion.\n  So I say again to the supercommittee: Do not just focus on slashing, \ncutting, and retreating.\n  Focus on raising revenue and charging ahead, investing in education, \ninnovation, infrastructure. It means a level playing field with fair \ntaxation--fair taxation--and a strong ladder of opportunity to give \nevery American access to the middle class. It is time to put America \nback to work. It is time to change the tenor of the debate. It is time \nto get away from this groupthink in Washington; that if only, if only \nwe would just cut more government spending, somehow magically people \nwill go back to work. It is not going to happen. Only in your dreams.\n  It will only happen if we are bold enough, as our forefathers and \npeople before us were bold enough, to raise the necessary revenue to \nput this country back to work. That should be the first charge of this \nsupercommittee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I very much thank Senator Harkin, \nthe chairman of the HELP Committee, for his advocacy always for the \nmiddle class, advocacy always for those who aspire to the middle class, \nand especially the jobs bill. I particularly appreciate his comments \nabout school construction. That is a major component of the jobs bill.\n  My State has gone through a pretty good period under Governor Taft, \nwho is not in the same political party as I am but he is a friend of \nmine who launched a program 10 years or so ago in Ohio to begin to \nreplace--to give incentives to local governments, local school \ndistricts, to vote bond issues where there was a lot of State matching \nfunds that built a lot of new schools but nothing close to what we need \nyet with all of the progress we made.\n  We tell our children that education is the most important thing in \ntheir lives and our lives and our country, and then we send them to \nlousy, decaying, falling-apart school buildings. I do not think that \nquite clicks in kids' minds. So the school construction part of this \nbill, first of all, puts construction workers to work in their high-\nunemployment rates, as Senator Harkin said. Second, it puts \nsteelworkers and cement workers and concrete workers and people who are \nmaking the products--the glass makers, the glass companies, and all \nmanufacturers--to work for the materials. Third, it sets the foundation \nby building community colleges and rebuilding school buildings and all \nof that, putting people to work for long-term economic growth and \nprosperity.\n  We know for a fact the United States, in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, \ncreated an infrastructure the likes of which the world had never seen. \nThat is the foundation for our prosperity. Unfortunately, in the last \n20 years we have let that infrastructure crumble. We let that \ninfrastructure decay. When I look at these young pages here, 15, 16, \n17, 18 years old, I do not want them to inherit a huge budget deficit, \nbut I also do not want them to inherit a huge education deficit, an \ninfrastructure deficit. We owe that to that generation to do much \nbetter than we have.\n  I thank Senator Harkin and yield to him.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Well, I thank the Senator very much. I thank the Senator \nfrom Ohio, a great friend and a great supporter of working Americans. I \nwould just say that the bill that Senator Brown has been championing is \nnow leading the charge on the China currency bill, and I think it is \none of the important steps forward in making sure we start creating \njobs for Americans.\n  How can we create jobs for Americans when we have a Chinese currency \nthat is underpinning their exports to America, undercutting our jobs in \nthis country? So this is a big step forward. I hope we can get cloture. \nI hope we can move forward on the bill. So I thank the Senator from \nOhio for his steadfastness on making sure we got the bill to the floor, \nand I hope we get the votes to pass it.\n  Again, we can focus on the jobs in this country, but if we are just \ngoing to continue to allow China to undercut us in just every possible \nway through manipulating their currency so they can undercut us by 20 \nor 25 percent on a lot of goods that come into this country, how are we \ngoing to manufacture those things?\n\n[[Page S6174]]\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. We are joined in the Chamber by two of the \nsponsors of this bill: the Presiding Officer, Senator Whitehouse, and \nSenator Casey from Pennsylvania.\n  The Senator said something earlier about the supercommittee and \ndeficit reduction, and what he said is exactly right. Many in this \ninstitution and down the hall in the House of Representatives do not \nseem to understand that we cannot only cut our way to prosperity, we \nhave to grow our way to a more balanced budget and prosperity.\n  One of the things this China currency bill will do is, it is \nestimated by the Economic Policy Institute that over 10 years it will \ncut the deficit $600 billion to $800 billion. Why is that? Because of \njob growth, because this bill provides--according to the Economic \nPolicy Institute study, it creates more than 2 million jobs. That is 2 \nmillion people, instead of receiving unemployment benefits, instead of \nbeing eligible for food stamps, instead of other kinds of things we do \nfor people who are out of work, it will mean those 2 million people \nwill actually be working, many of them in manufacturing. Those are \n$12-, $15-, $20-an-hour jobs. They will be paying taxes. They will be \npaying into Social Security, into Medicare, into local retirement \nsystems--all of that--paying property taxes for the schools, doing all \nof the things that employed, hard-working taxpayers do.\n  So it is a win in that situation too. So while we need to focus on \nthe President's jobs bill, this is one that makes so much sense, and \nthat is why we need to move forward.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator from Ohio clearly understands percolate-up \neconomics. I appreciate that very much. I thank the Senator from Ohio \nfor his leadership.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise just for a few moments to make a few \ncomments regarding the pending legislation that deals with the currency \npolicies that China has had in place which have proven to be adverse to \nAmerican workers. I was saying on the floor yesterday, and I will say \nit again, that this is not a complicated issue. When China does not \nplay by the rules, when they cheat on the international stage on their \ncurrency policies, Americans lose jobs.\n  We have lost far too many of them for us to just sit back and do \nnothing or sit back and just discuss and urge and plead instead of \ntaking action. But what I failed to do yesterday was put a couple of \nbasic numbers on the table. I mentioned in some of my comments \nyesterday that we had a hearing in the Joint Economic Committee, which \nfor those who are not as familiar with the workings of that committee, \nit is a House-Senate joint committee where we have Senators and House \nMembers, obviously, from both parties meeting and participating in \nhearings on a whole range of topics, most of them dealing with the \neconomy and jobs.\n  Yesterday, we had the Federal Reserve Chairman, Ben Bernanke, who \ntestified broadly about a lot of issues. But I asked him about \ncurrency, and one of the things he said--I thought this was a pretty \nsignificant statement. I am just reading something Chairman Bernanke \nsaid in pertinent part. This is not, obviously, a full statement. But \nwhen I asked him about currency, China currency and their policy, he \nsaid:\n\n       I think right now, a concern is that the Chinese currency \n     policy is blocking what might be a more normal recovery \n     process in the global economy. The Chinese currency policy is \n     blocking that process.\n\n  I should add here, ``process'' meaning the recovery. Then he goes on \nto say:\n\n       So it is to some extent hurting the recovery process.\n\n  That is the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, someone whose job it is \nnot to comment on public policy on a regular basis necessarily or to \ntake positions on one side or the other on public policy; but the fact \nthat he made that statement, which made it abundantly clear that this \nis not simply a problem for our workers when we lose jobs, when we \nhemorrhage the jobs we have lost, but this currency policy that China \nhas in place is an impediment to the recovery, the economic recovery of \nthe world.\n  So I thought it was a critically important statement that he made as \nfurther evidence that this bill we are working on is the right way to \ngo. I do not want to imply that he endorsed the bill; he did not. But I \nthought it was interesting that he focused on the economic recovery \nworldwide and not only on the adverse consequences for our workers, our \ncompanies, our jobs.\n  Two other notes, and then I will sit down. One is the impact in a \nState such as Pennsylvania. I have the privilege to represent the \npeople of Pennsylvania. So I want to make sure the record is clear in \nterms of what China's policies, both on currency, and more broadly on \ntrade, have meant in the context of Pennsylvania workers.\n  A report released just recently by the Economic Policy Institute--and \nwe hear the so-called EPI quoted a lot--estimates that from the year \n2001 through 2010 our trade deficit with China has led to the loss of \n106,970 jobs in Pennsylvania, almost 2 percent of total employment in \nPennsylvania.\n  Across the Nation, the same trade deficit has led to a loss of 2.8 \nmillion jobs since 2001. Basically, you are talking about less than a \ndecade. Because of the trade deficit with China, we lost 2.8 million \njobs nationally, and a little shy of 107,000 jobs in one State--the \nState of Pennsylvania.\n  Some would say, well, you should be careful how you say that because \nwe are not saying that the currency policy they have in place--which I \nassert is cheating--that the job loss could be attributed to that \nsolely. I am not saying that. But there is no question--and I think the \nrecord is replete with evidence and examples--that much of that job \nloss can be attributed to their currency policies, as well as other \npolicies they have in place. I will not even get into the infringement \non copyright and intellectual property, and the whole range of other \nissues where we have disagreements with other policies emanating from \nChina.\n  Two more points, finally, about EPI. The Economic Policy Institute \ndid an analysis, and they released the report on June 17, 2011. They \nwanted to make a determination that if China were to revalue its \ncurrency and play by the rules, to the extent of a 28-percent level--\nand some people think the manipulation they are doing amounts to more \nthan 28 percent--but if they are able to revalue their currency up to \nthat level, what would happen? Here is what EPI found:\n\n       If only China revalued to 28.5 percent, the growth in U.S. \n     gross domestic product would support 1.631 million U.S. jobs. \n     If other Asian countries also revalued [at that level, 28.5 \n     percent] then 2.250 million U.S. jobs would be created.\n\n  I mentioned the study yesterday. I said: What if their estimates are \noff? What if, for some reason, you had to scale down that estimate? \nWell, if 1.6 million jobs--if they are off by even a lot, that is still \na big job number. If you add the other Asian countries that are \nimpacted by the policies in China, you are over 2.2 million jobs. Even \nif that is off, it is still a lot of jobs.\n  This is a jobs bill. We talk about creating new consequences for \nChina cheating on currency. This is a job creator if we do it--if we \ncan pass the bill and implement the policy. We can create a lot of jobs \nover the next several years at the same time. This has an impact on job \ncreation and, ultimately, on GDP.\n  I know that when I go back to Pennsylvania, people will say to me: \nLet me get this straight: You have a bill that deals with getting \ntougher on China, relating to their currency policy; you have \nbipartisan support in the Senate, and it is a job-creating bill. Why \nwon't this pass, and why don't you have this enacted into law?\n  I believe we have a lot of momentum for passage. I hope the \nbipartisan support we have on the Republican side of the aisle, with a \nnumber of Democrats, will result in passage of this legislation, \nespecially when you put it in the context of two points I made--one, \nthe job impact or the job loss that has resulted from China cheating on \nits currency policy over all these years; secondly, when you put it \ninto the context\n\n[[Page S6175]]\n\nof not just our economy but the world economy--when we have the \nChairman of the Federal Reserve saying their policy on currency is \nimpeding--well, I will read what he said:\n\n       . . . the Chinese currency policy is blocking what might be \n     a more normal recovery process in the global economy. . . .\n\n  Blocking recovery in the global economy. That is compelling testimony \nfor anyone who cares about and is concerned about creating jobs here, \nstrengthening our recovery and, obviously, helping the recovery \nworldwide. I think the evidence is overwhelming. The support for this \nlegislation is as broad based as any I have seen for any bill I have \never considered in the almost 5 years I have been in the Senate.\n  We need to finish this debate this week and get a vote. I hope we \nwill continue to have an overwhelming vote that reflects the \noverwhelming support across the United States.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I rise to speak about two amendments I \nfiled today to help protect American intellectual property from theft \nabroad. If we are serious about leveling the playing field with \ncountries like China, then protecting U.S. intellectual property from \ntheft has to be a part of it.\n  This summer I went up and down our State meeting with business \nleaders and asking them about what we need to do in Washington to help \nthem create jobs. Though currency manipulation came up from time to \ntime, it paled in comparison to the fear our innovative business owners \nhad about intellectual property theft.\n  When foreign companies and governments steal our ideas, they are \nstealing more than just formulas and schematics--they are stealing \njobs. These two amendments are about giving America the tools to fight \nback.\n  I introduced my first amendment with my colleague on the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Kohl. It provides a Federal private right of action \nfor victims of trade secret theft. Trade secrets are a critical form of \nintellectual property, particularly among manufacturers, and when they \nare stolen, it can result in catastrophic damage to American companies \nand their employees.\n  After the Korean company, Kolon, was found to have stolen the trade \nsecrets behind DuPont's next generation Kevlar fiber, a jury last month \nfound that DuPont had suffered a staggering $919 million in damages.\n  Trade secrets are a critical part of the American economy. Yet they \nare the only form of intellectual property without a Federal cause of \naction. Our amendment would fix that and provide U.S. victims of trade-\nsecret theft access to the same service of process, same ability to \nkeep sensitive documents secret, and the same uniformity of substantive \nlaw available to other intellectual property victims.\n  My second amendment, which I introduced with my colleague Senator \nGrassley, the distinguished ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, \nfixes a simple problem, but one that vexes an array of companies that I \nhear from regularly.\n  Under current law, when Customs and Border Patrol agents intercept a \nshipment that they suspect contains counterfeit or trademark-infringing \ngoods, there are prevented from properly investigating the shipment \nbecause they cannot share product samples or UPC codes with the \nintellectual property holder.\n  That is ridiculous. Why are we tying the hands of our agents and \npreventing American businesses from sticking up for themselves? Worse, \nit means that shipments of counterfeit goods are being let into this \ncountry even when Customs agents have reason to believe they might be \ncounterfeit. And it is not just toys, clothes and electronics that we \nare talking about; it is prescription drugs and medical technologies.\n  We are abetting the trade imbalance that is stifling the American \neconomy by allowing this gaping hole to continue to exist. In come \ncheap counterfeit goods, and out go American jobs.\n  Our amendment would close this gaping hole in our economic security \nby allowing Customs and Border Patrol agents to share the information \nthat they need to identify counterfeit goods, stop these illicit \nshipments, and protect American jobs.\n  The time has come to get serious about the threats posed to our \nhealth and workforce by foreign intellectual property thieves.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask that the order for the quorum call be \nrescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                 Syria\n\n  Mr. CASEY. We have been dealing with an issue that relates to China's \ncurrency policies. I know that has been the pending business, but I \nhave been wanting to address another issue for a number of days now and \nI am grateful for this opportunity. It is an issue that a number of \npeople here in both parties are very concerned about. It relates to \nSyria.\n  I rise to talk about the situation in Syria, which is a place of ever \nincreasing violence, and this violence has taken the lives of more than \n2,600 Syrians.\n  I spoke a number of months ago at a hearing about a Pennsylvanian. \nHis name is Hazem Hallek, a doctor who lives outside of Philadelphia in \na suburban community. His brother Sakher lived in Syria and visited the \nUnited States for a medical conference earlier this year. Upon his \nreturn to Syria, demonstrations against the Assad regime were beginning \nto intensify. Sakher was not engaged in politics, nor did he want to be \nengaged in politics. But despite this, he went missing and was soon \nfound dead in a ditch in a village south of the town of Aleppo. Sakher \nwas subjected to unspeakable torture before he was killed. His visit to \nthe United States was enough for the Assad regime to target him for \ndeath. So his brother, a constituent of mine, Hazem, has asked me to do \neverything I can to support democratic change in Syria and to protect \ncivilians who continue to be hunted down by this brutal regime.\n  I believe--and I know this is a broad-based point of view in this \nChamber--Democrats and Republicans alike believe that now, more than \never, it is critical that the international community, led by the \nUnited States--and the United States has done a lot already but needs \nto do more--show support for the Syrian people who continue to live \nunder this dictatorship. The Syrian people, especially the democracy \nand human rights activists, feel defenseless against the tanks, guns, \nand the bullets of the Assad regime.\n  The United Nations Human Rights Council passed an important \nresolution which called for the deployment of three human rights \nmonitors to bear witness to the terrible crimes in Syria. I was very \ndisappointed, and I know others were as well, but unfortunately we \nweren't surprised to see that Russia and China vetoed a U.N. Security \nCouncil Resolution just last night. This resolution had been watered \ndown so much that observers had taken to calling it the so-called \nmonsoon resolution. Yet the Russians and the Chinese still refused to \nrecognize the terrible actions of the Assad regime and show support for \nthe embattled people of Syria.\n  I am an original cosponsor of Senate Resolution 180, which was \nintroduced in May. This resolution expresses support for the peaceful \ndemonstrations and universal freedoms in Syria and condemns the human \nrights violations perpetrated by the Assad regime. This bipartisan \nresolution has 25 cosponsors, but it has been held up by one Senator \nwho will not let us pass through by unanimous consent--the language we \nuse around here for letting legislation pass without a rollcall vote, \nso-called unanimous consent--one Senator, holding up a resolution to \nshow our solidarity with and support for the Syrian people who have \nbeen living through the most horrific of nightmares, torture, killing, \nand abuse, for all these months.\n  There is a lot we can do and that we should do. There is also a lot \nwe should be debating here in the Senate. But I can't understand, on an \nissue of such importance, how we cannot come to consensus on something \nthis basic, to\n\n[[Page S6176]]\n\nshow fundamental solidarity with the people of Syria, especially at \nthis hour. We cannot let another day pass without the Senate expressing \nits outrage over the behavior of the Assad regime. It is not enough \njust to condemn it in words. It is very important the Senate go on \nrecord to pass this resolution.\n  I have spoken in the past very highly of Ambassador Ford and his team \nin Damascus; he is our Ambassador from the United States to Syria, and \nI was proud to support his nomination. Instead of conferring legitimacy \non Mr. Assad and his regime, Ambassador Ford is the most high-profile \nopponent of the Assad regime, sending out regular condemnations through \npress releases and Facebook postings. But what has been even more \nimpressive is the personal courage demonstrated on an almost daily \nbasis that Ambassador Ford and his staff have demonstrated in traveling \nthroughout the country and engaging directly with the democratic \nopposition in Syria.\n  Last week, Ambassador Ford met with the leader of the opposition \nnational democratic gathering in Damascus. Ambassador Ford's vehicles \nwere attacked, and he was forced to stay inside the building until \nsecurity forces arrived 3 hours later to escort him from the premises.\n  He has attended the funerals of human rights activists, observed the \naftermath of government massacres, and engaged directly with the people \nof Syria. He will say that he is just doing his job, like good soldiers \nsay often when we commend them for their valor and bravery and service. \nBut I am glad the Senate finally did its job last night in confirming \nAmbassador Ford. Long overdue, by the way, but it was finally done.\n  Ambassador Ford serves as a shining example of the best our Foreign \nService has to offer to the world. Countries that have representatives \nremaining in Damascus should join Ambassador Ford on his visits with \nopposition figures and human rights activists around the country. He \nshould not be the only one who bears witness to this horror. Other \ndiplomats should join him on his travels throughout Syria.\n  We have seen some positive developments among other countries in the \ninternational community. I want to acknowledge the increasingly \npositive role played by Turkey, which is reportedly considering \nsanctions against Syria. Turkey is Syria's largest trading partner, and \nsanctions could have a serious impact in Damascus. Turkey has also \nprovided safe haven in border camps for more than 7,000 refugees who \nhave fled from Syria to Turkey. Turkey's concrete support for the \nSyrian people, combined with ongoing diplomatic pressure, is a critical \nelement in isolating the Syrian regime.\n  We know some of the history here, and it is a history of a lot of \nhorror and death. Twenty-nine years ago, Bashir al-Assad's father \nunleashed the government's security forces on the community of Hama to \nrepress unrest in that city. The killing that took place in February of \n1982 was both indiscriminate and massive in its scale. Some estimate \nthat more than 10,000 Syrians were killed as security forces literally \nrazed the city. Thomas Friedman, the New York Times columnist, \ndedicated a chapter entitled ``Hama Rules'' in his book, ``From Beirut \nto Jerusalem,'' to the horror seen in this town in 1982. Assad's Hama \nrules were meant to send a chilling effect to all who would dare to \nquestion the authority of that Assad regime.\n  Bashar al-Assad has proven today, and certainly over the last several \nmonths, if not years, that he is incapable of reform.\n  When faced with the democratic movement inspired by the wave of \nchange sweeping across the region, the younger Assad responded with his \nown 2011 version of Hama rules. As the world watched, as I said before, \nover 2,600 Syrians have been killed in a number of communities. Whether \nit is in Hama, or Homs, Rastan, Talbiseh, and several other towns \nacross the country, Assad's rules seem to be focused on the use of \nmilitias that have been deployed most recently in Rastan to conduct the \nmost repressive operations that we can think of. These gangs receive \ninformal support from the Syrian security services and have been \nimplicated in Syria's crimes and atrocities. The Syrian people have \nasked for international monitors to be deployed in the country in order \nto bear witness and perhaps to provide a deterrent against the wrath of \nthese militias.\n  In the intervening 29 years since the massacre at Hama, Syria has \nchanged indeed. The Syrian people have shown that they will not be \ncowed by violence. The opposition has made remarkable progress. Hama \nrules no longer work in Syria. The opposition has stood up and voted \nwith its feet, every Friday turning out to demonstrate and face the \nwrath, the terrible, deadly wrath of this regime. Moreover, scores of \nsecurity forces have abandoned the regime and have come to the side of \nthe opposition, something that did not happen in 1982 when the elder \nAssad brutally applied his Hama rules.\n  In recent weeks we have seen emerge elements among the opposition who \nhave resorted to violence. One cannot blame the Syrian people for \ndefending themselves in the face of unspeakable violence. But I do \nhope, though, that the aspirations of the Syrian people can be met \nthrough a commitment to nonviolence, as difficult as that is, and an \nunderstanding that democratic change comes not from the barrel of a \ngun, as we have often said on this floor, but the desire of all \ncitizens to chart a new course, the course of peace.\n  In summary, the international community can do more to support the \nSyrian people during this darkest of hours starting right here in this \nChamber, in the Senate. This week we sent a strong message in \nconfirming Ambassador Ford. Today we can pass a resolution denouncing \nthe behavior of the Syrian regime. More importantly, the international \ncommunity can and should do more. Here are some of the measures I \nbelieve should take place in the coming days and weeks.\n  No. 1, the United Nations has proven to not be the best international \ninstitution to address the strife in Syria, but key regional \norganizations could have a positive and substantial impact moving \nforward. The Arab League should suspend Syria's membership and call for \nPresident Assad to step down. The Gulf Cooperation Council should \nexplicitly say that President Assad is no longer the legitimate leader \nof the country.\n  No. 2, concerned countries in the West should work together with the \nArab League and the Gulf Cooperation Council countries to establish an \ninternational Friends of the Syrian People as a contact group for the \nregion which can serve as the main point of contact for the democratic \nopposition and the Syrian people. Participation in such a group would \nnot necessarily limit the options of individual members and would not \npreclude bilateral efforts to take separate action in support of the \nSyrian people. It would, however, send a clear message of international \nsolidarity in support of nonviolent change in Syria.\n  No. 3, the Syrian people have asked that international humanitarian \nobservers be deployed in the country to monitor the situation and \nperhaps to serve as a deterrent against violence in the country. \nSimilar to the OSCE human rights monitors deployed to Kosovo in 1998 to \nbear witness to the violence wrought by the Milosevic regime, this \ninternational team of monitors, primarily composed of individuals from \nthe Arab League and the Gulf Cooperation Council, could address a \ncentral concern of the Syrian people and would be a welcome alternative \nto military intervention from the outside.\n  No. 4, finally, key countries in the international community need to \ncut off commercial ties with the Assad regime. The United States has \ndone its part, as has the European Union. Turkey may announce new \nsanctions. But many countries continue to conduct business as usual \nwith the Assad regime. For example, there are reports that India is \nconsidering the purchase of crude oil from Syria. The timing of such a \npurchase is ill-advised and we hope India can look to identify other \nsources of energy in the region, especially at this time.\n  The stakes have been raised in Syria as never before. The opposition \nis understandably tired and to some extent beaten down, and there is \nsome despair that is starting to set in among the abused population of \nthe country. At this critical time, the newly constituted Syrian \nNational Council needs\n\n[[Page S6177]]\n\nto show the Syrian people that it can deliver results in the \ninternational community. The establishment of a Friends of the Syrian \nPeople group, a contact group as I said before, and the deployment of \ninternational humanitarian monitors, would demonstrate that the Syrian \nNational Council is effective, and it would send a critical message to \nthe Syrian people. Our options to leverage change in Syria are limited \nbut they do exist. We should be making every effort to build increased \ninternational pressure on and isolation of the Assad regime.\n  Mr. Hallek and his family and thousands of other families across \nSyria have suffered enough. They have suffered so much and they deserve \nnothing less than our support, our solidarity, and our help in this \ndark hour.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/05/senate-section/article/S6177-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6177]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the extraordinary \nwork of Daniel Nichols who served the U.S. Capitol Police with great \ndistinction for 28 years.\n  Chief Nichols entered duty with the U.S. Capitol Police in 1983. \nAfter training, his first duty assignment was providing security and \nlaw enforcement at the U.S. Capitol, and in 1984, he was transferred to \nstreet patrol duties within the Capitol Complex and the adjoining \nneighbourhoods.\n  In 1986, Chief Nichols was appointed as the first dedicated public \ninformation officer for the department. As spokesperson, he managed all \nmedia interaction during events and incidents occurring within the \nCapitol Complex. Most notably, he represented the U.S. Capitol Police \nwith great poise and unwavering calmness during key events that \nattracted intense, widespread media attention including the 1998 \nshooting at the Capitol that claimed the lives of two police officers; \nthe terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and the 2001 anthrax \nattack against Congress.\n  In 2002, after being promoted to lieutenant, Chief Nichols was given \ncommand of the canine section. His accomplishments include expanding \nthe training program, increasing the number of explosive detection \nteams to 43, reintroducing the street police service dog program, and \ncreating a K-9 search and rescue team to locate victims of building \ncollapses. In addition, he overhauled the concept of operations for the \nOff-Site Delivery Center. He also created the department's first horse \nmounted unit.\n  In August of 2004, he was promoted to captain and named chairman of \nthe 2005 U.S. Capitol Police Inaugural Task Force. As such, then \nCaptain Nichols managed the overall planning, coordination, logistics, \nand execution of the U.S. Capitol Police responsibility for the 2005 \nswearing-in ceremony. This task was particularly challenging due to the \nfact that this was the first inauguration to take place in a post 9/11 \nthreat environment. He worked closely with the Joint Congressional \nCommittee on Inaugural Ceremonies, the Capitol Police Board, and \nmultiple law enforcement and public safety agencies to ensure the \nsafety and security of the Nation's leaders and the public. While \nserving as chairman, Chief Nichols was promoted to the rank of \ninspector.\n  In February 2005, Chief Nichols assumed command of the House division \nand led a team of over 400 police officers who provided law enforcement \nand security operations at the House office buildings, the Capitol \nPowerplant and the House Page Dorm. In 2006, he was transferred to the \nCapitol division where he managed over 450 police personnel who perform \nvarious security, law enforcement, and emergency response duties to \nprotect the Capitol, the Capitol Visitors Center, and the House and \nSenate Chambers and leadership offices.\n  In January 2007, Chief Nichols became the assistant chief of police \nand served as the chief of operations, providing great leadership to \nthe department. Chief Nichols provided operational support to the \ndepartment, responsible for the Uniformed, Operations, Protective, and \nSecurity Services Bureaus; overseeing the Office of Plans, Operations, \nand Homeland Security and serving as acting chief when the chief of \npolice was unavailable.\n  Chief Nichols is recognized as an accomplished leader who builds \neffective teams, has strong communication skills, and uses innovative \napproaches to improve the protection of the Capitol, the congressional \ncommunity, and visitors. He also works to develop the skills and \ncapabilities of the department's personnel and was a key proponent of \nsending managers and officers to the Police Executive Leadership \nProgram. A native of Fort Washington, MD, Chief Nichols holds a \nbachelor's and master's degree in management from the Johns Hopkins \nUniversity.\n  Chief Nichols is a notable member of the law enforcement community \nand a fine citizen. On behalf of the U.S. Senate, I congratulate him on \nhis retirement and salute his distinguished career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/05/senate-section/article/S6177-3", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6177-S6178]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECOGNIZING THE ARSHT FAMILY\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Chris Coons, \nCongressman John Carney, and myself, we remember today the lives and \nlasting gifts of late Delawareans, the Honorable Roxana Cannon Arsht \nand her husband S. Samuel Arsht, and we recognize as well the \nextraordinary philanthropy of their daughter, Ms. Adrienne Arsht. As \nrole models of integrity and giving, the Arsht family has served and \nenriched the lives of Delawareans for decades.\n  Like many American families, Roxana Cannon's and Samuel Arsht's \nparents immigrated to the United States from Russia a century ago, \nseeking survival and a better life. In this land of opportunity, they \nworked hard, they valued education, and set high standards for \nthemselves--standards which they met and ultimately exceeded.\n  Samuel Arsht was a 1931 graduate of the University of Pennsylvania \nWharton School and a 1934 graduate of the University's law school. Upon \ngraduation, Sam joined the firm that later became Morris, Nichols, \nArsht & Tunnell in Wilmington, DE. Over time he became well known in \ncorporate law circles as one of the architects of the modern Delaware \ngeneral corporation law and was described as the master of Delaware's \ninfluential corporate statutes. In 1953, he led efforts to update the \nentire body of statutory law, making Delaware the Nation's most \nfavorable place for businesses to incorporate. His work helped to \ntransform the State's economy by later opening the door to national \nbanks and to credit card operations, along with other financial \nservices.\n  His wife, a Delaware native, Judge Roxana Cannon Arsht, graduated \nfrom the University of Pennsylvania's law school as well, where she met \nher future husband Sam. In 1931, Roxana became the fifth woman to pass \nthe Delaware bar. She made history again when she was appointed by \nthen-Governor Russell W. Peterson as a judge of the family court in \n1971, becoming the first female judge in the State of Delaware.\n  She retired from the bench in 1983, and began a second career in \nphilanthropy. She was a founding member of the Cancer Care Connection \nand supported numerous community interests, including Planned \nParenthood, the Visiting Nurse Association, the First Stage at Tower \nHill School, the Winterthur Museum exhibition hall, and the Christiana \nCare Health System. Roxana was inducted into the Hall of Fame of \nDelaware Women in 1986.\n  Roxana and Sam Arsht shared their love of lifelong learning by \nproviding the first and last gifts to the construction of Arsht Hall \nfor the Academy of Lifelong Learning at the Wilmington campus of the \nUniversity of Delaware. In 2003, Roxana created the Arsht-Cannon Fund \nat the Delaware Community Foundation to carry out her and Sam's\n\n[[Page S6178]]\n\ncommitment to the greater Wilmington community: to preserve, support, \nprotect, and defend the best interests of a civil society. To date, \nthis fund has provided over $4.5 million in grants to Delawareans, and \nis now directed by her daughter Adrienne.\n  Adrienne Arsht was born in 1942 in Wilmington, DE, and upon \ngraduation from Villanova Law School, Adrienne was the 11th woman \nadmitted to the Delaware bar. Again, her mom had been the fifth. In \n1966, she launched a successful law career at the Delaware firm of \nMorris, Nichols, Arsht & Tunnell. Later, Adrienne's interests shifted \nto banking, culminating in a move to Miami in 1966 to join the \nleadership of a bank called TotalBank, where she served as chair of the \nboard until 2007. Under her leadership, TotalBank grew from 4 locations \nto 14, with over $1.4 billion in assets. In 2007, TotalBank was sold to \nBanco Popular Espanol; and in 2008, Adrienne was named the chairman \nemerita of TotalBank.\n  In addition to her leadership in the legal profession and in the \nbusiness world, Adrienne has also taken a leading role in promoting \nartistic, business, and civic growth in the three cities she now calls \nhome: Washington, DC, New York, and Miami. Following her parents' \nexamples, she has also continued to maintain a strong philanthropic \npresence in her home State of Delaware, for which we are grateful.\n  In one of her many contributions to the First State, Adrienne carries \non her parents' commitment to the mission of the Arsht-Cannon Fund at \nthe Delaware Community Foundation. With her family background and \nexperiences working with the Hispanic community as a businesswoman in \nMiami and the release of research findings from the 2008 Delaware \nHispanic Community Needs Assessment, Adrienne set the funding focus of \nthe Arsht-Cannon Fund to support many nonprofits with a focus on \naddressing the unmet needs of Hispanic Delawareans. This fund has \nhelped thousands of Hispanic Delawareans learn to speak, read, and \nwrite in English, continue their education, find employment, access \nhealth services, and learn conflict resolution skills. It has made, and \ncontinues to make, an essential difference in the lives of Delawareans \nand will do so for decades to come.\n  Furthermore, under Adrienne's direction, the Arsht-Cannon Fund \nestablished the Cancer Care Connection and Best Buddies in Delaware, \nbrought the Nemours' BrightStart! Dyslexia Initiative to Delaware, and \nsupported the new Delaware Community Foundation's Strategic Fund.\n  I am honored today to rise to honor and commend a very good friend, \nAdrienne Arsht, and her late parents, whom I was privileged to know, \nRoxana and Sam Arsht, for their extraordinary service and continuing \ncontributions to the State of Delaware and to its people. On behalf of \nSenator Coons, Congressman Carney, and myself, we recognize their work \nto help the many individuals and families who have been touched by \ntheir generosity.\n  We add our congratulations to Adrienne and the Arsht family as they \nreceive the Delaware Community Foundation's First Family Philanthropy \nAward. Adrienne is truly an extraordinary woman who continues to carry \non her parents' legacy of working to improve the lives of others. I \nconsider it a privilege to have known Sam and Roxana, to know their \ndaughter Adrienne, and to be able to stand here today to speak on their \nbehalf in the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/05/senate-section/article/S6178-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6178-S6179]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         BUDGETARY ADJUSTMENTS\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I previously filed committee allocations \nand budgetary aggregates pursuant to section 106 of the Budget Control \nAct of 2011. Today, I am adjusting some of those levels, specifically \nthe allocation to the Committee on Appropriations for fiscal year 2012 \nand the budgetary aggregates for fiscal year 2012.\n  Section 101 of the Budget Control Act allows for various adjustments \nto the statutory limits on discretionary spending, while section 106(d) \nallows the chairman of the Budget Committee to make revisions to \nallocations, aggregates, and levels consistent with those adjustments. \nThe Committee on Appropriations recently reported three bills that are \neligible for adjustments under the Budget Control Act. Consequently, I \nam making adjustments to the 2012 allocation to the Committee on \nAppropriations and to the 2012 aggregates for spending by a total of \n$11.896 billion in budget authority and $5.108 billion in outlays. \nThose adjustments reflect the sum of $2.3 billion in budget authority \nand $513 million in outlays for funding designated for disaster relief, \n$8.703 billion in budget authority and $3.821 billion in outlays for \nfunding designated as being for overseas contingency operations, and \n$893 million in budget authority and $774 million in outlays for \nprogram integrity initiatives. The two program integrity initiatives \nfor which adjustments are in order under the Budget Control Act are \ncontinuing disability reviews and redeterminations and health care \nfraud and abuse control.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following tables detailing the \nchanges to the allocation to the Committee on Appropriations and the \nbudgetary aggregates be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  BUDGETARY AGGREGATES.--PURSUANT TO SECTION 106(b)(1)(C) OF THE BUDGET\n CONTROL ACT OF 2011 AND

Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       HONEST BUDGET ACT OF 2011\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to join Senator Sessions in \nintroducing the Honest Budget Act of 2011. At this critical juncture in \nour Nation's fiscal history, we must no longer allow Washington to rely \non an astonishing array of dishonest budget gimmicks to enable and \nconceal countless billions in Federal deficit spending.\n  We can no longer accept budgets that compromise our economic growth, \nliving standards, or opportunities that have been a hallmark of \nAmerica's greatness, which is why Senator Sessions and I have \nintroduced this important legislation. The Honest Budget Act of 2011 \nwill attack Washington's frivolous spending by stripping away many of \nthe most egregious budget gimmicks in Washington, by making it harder \nfor the Federal Government to spend money it does not have, and by \nconfronting the culture of fiscal manipulation that is bleeding future \ngenerations of prosperity.\n  Our budgetary process is intrinsically broken. Congress is required \nby law to adopt a budget resolution by April 15, yet in the past 36 \nyears Congress has met that deadline just six times. Throughout the \nlast 10 years, Congress has approved a budget resolution on only six \noccasions. Congress failed to complete action on a budget resolution \nfor 5 fiscal years: fiscal year 1999 in 1998, fiscal year 2003 in 2002, \nfiscal year 2005 in 2004, fiscal year 2007 in 2006, and fiscal year \n2011 in 2010. Not surprisingly, those fiscal years ended with large, \nspendthrift, omnibus appropriation measures or continuing resolutions.\n  Last year, no budget and no appropriations bills passed for the first \ntime since the current budget rules were put into place in 1974, \nresulting in an almost shutdown of the Federal Government in April \n2011. We have had 87 continuing resolutions in the past 14 fiscal years \nand we even failed to pass all 12 individual appropriations bills last \nyear. Not a single appropriations bill passed for fiscal year 2011!\n  Moreover, the majority in the Senate has failed to pass a budget for \n889 days now. No business or household in America can function without \na budget, yet, there are no consequences for congressional inaction. \nThe Honest Budget Act will change this.\n  This tacit acceptance of emergent dysfunction in our budget and \nappropriations processes has only exacerbated the trend-line of \nunbridled federal spending, and it is symptomatic of the miniscule \nvalue Congress has assigned to averting economically corrosive deficits \nand debt. Congress violates the budgetary process and existing rules \nwith impunity and no consequences year after year while our national \ndebt is rising, living standard for millions of Americans is faltering, \nand America is losing a competitive advantage that was once the \nhallmark of this great nation.\n  It is time we put an end to this habitual dysfunction! The Honest \nBudget Act of 2011 will address the many shortcomings of the budget \nprocess and it will force Congress to be accountable to the American \npeople. Specifically, this legislation lays out nine specific fixes to \nensure that the loopholes and gimmicks often utilized to circumvent the \nrules are eliminated for all time.\n  Currently, the Congressional Budget Act empowers any Senator to raise \na point of order preventing the consideration of appropriation bills \nwithout a concurrent budget resolution in place, but the Senate can \nwaive it with a simple majority vote. As a result, the point of order \nis rarely raised and Congress can spend money without a plan or budget \nrestraints.\n  The Honest Budget Act will strengthen the point of order to require a \nvote of three-fifths of Senators to waive, enhancing the ability of \nMembers to demand the Senate agree to a concurrent budget resolution \nbefore moving appropriation bills. Simply put, our legislation ensures \nthat if Congress fails to pass a budget, then no appropriations bills \nwill be considered.\n  Another loophole that has often been exploited to spend excessively \nis designating certain federal spending as an ``emergency.'' Spending \nthat Congress designates as an ``emergency'' is exempt from the \ncontrols designed to enforce budget restraint. By definition, an \nemergency should be necessary, urgent, unforeseen, and temporary.\n  I understand that the Federal response to emergencies such as natural \ndisasters and acts of war must be deployed rapidly and without \nunnecessary budgetary constraints. Unfortunately, attaching the \n``emergency'' designation to a measure is easy it is simply written \ninto the bill text. A Senator can raise a point of order against the \ndesignation during floor consideration, but it can be waived with 60 \nvotes.\n  Examples of the emergency designation abuse abound. For instance, the \n2008 supplemental appropriation bill included $210 million in \n``emergency'' spending for the 2010 Census even though, since its \nratification in 1788, the Constitution has required a census every 10 \nyears. Moreover, the fiscal year 2011 appropriation omnibus bill \nincluded $159 billion in emergency spending for the Afghan and Iraq \noperations wars the U.S. has been fighting for 10 years!\n  The Honest Budget Act fixes this broken process by prohibiting any \nbill, joint resolution, or conference report from carrying an emergency \nrequirement unless it is added via an amendment. A supermajority would \nthen be required to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair. A new \npoint of order could be created against an emergency requirement in an \namendment that requires 60 votes to waive.\n  These simple fixes are just a few of the commonsense budget process \nenhancements the Honest Budget Act makes. These are the types of \nfocused improvements that must be implemented to work alongside a \nbalanced budget amendment to ensure that Congress begins to operate in \na more honest and open fashion.\n  Since 2002 the Nation has run a deficit each and every year and our \ngross debt has increased from $6.2 trillion to almost $15 trillion. \nOver the past 5 years alone, government has managed to increase \nspending by a remarkable 40 percent, contributing to the largest budget \ndeficits in our history over the last 3 consecutive years. The Federal \nGovernment is now borrowing roughly 40 cents of every dollar it spends. \nI do not believe that any of my colleagues in the Senate would argue \nthat the budget process is working properly or as intended. The reality \ncould not be starker.\n  Our Nation can no longer afford the gimmicks and loopholes too \nfrequently\n\n[[Page S6180]]\n\nused in the past to dodge existing budgetary restraints. Targeted \nbudget process reforms will compel Congress to return to the regiment \nand discipline of the budget and appropriations processes, and thereby \nforce the government to establish priorities and abide by those \npriorities.\n  In an August of 1987 televised Oval Office address, President Reagan \nsaid, ``The Congressional budget process is neither reliable nor \ncredible; in short, it needs to be fixed.'' It has now been nearly a \nquarter-century since President Reagan sought to fix the budget \nprocess. It is time we heed his advice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/05/senate-section/article/S6180-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6180]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          WORLD TEACHERS' DAY\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Mr. President, I would like to bring to the attention of \nmy colleagues this article from the Mountain Times in Killington, VT. \nThe article highlights the outstanding work of the nearly 200 members \nof Maine National Guard's 133rd Engineer Battalion, headquartered in \nGardiner, ME, which deployed to Vermont to help our neighbors deal with \nthe destruction from Tropical Storm Irene. Senator Leahy has told me \nseveral times how grateful the people of Vermont are for the assistance \nand how impressed they are with the professionalism of the Maine \nNational Guard members. All of us in Maine are extremely proud of their \noutstanding work helping those who needed it most. Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent that the following article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        Angels With Dirty Faces\n\n                           (By Greg Crawford)\n\n       Well, maybe their faces are clean, but the men and women of \n     the Maine National Guard's 133rd Engineer Battalion, \n     headquartered in Gardiner, Maine, and commanded by Lt. \n     Colonel Normand Michaud, sure got their boots muddy! And \n     despite modest denials, they are, indeed, angels, at least to \n     the grateful citizens of Stockbridge.\n       Following the historic flooding caused by the torrential \n     rains of tropical storm Irene, the call went out to National \n     Guard units in areas not quite so devastated by the storm, \n     and they answered that call with incredible speed. Given the \n     complexity of the logistics involved, and that the behemoth \n     trucks essential to their work do not exactly zip over the \n     road, especially when they have to negotiate flood-ravaged \n     terrain, the fact that they managed to get here just a few \n     days after the flooding occurred is nothing short of amazing. \n     The 38-vehicle caravan took 16 hours to make the trip from \n     Belfast, Maine, about 40 miles east of Augusta, where much of \n     the equipment was stored.\n       Something like a quarter of a mile of Vermont Route 107 \n     between Bethel and Stockbridge was washed downstream. In some \n     places, the road hugged the near-vertical mountainsides with \n     the river right next to it. Following Sunday's deluge, the \n     river was rushing by at the foot of the mountain as if the \n     road had never been there at all.\n\n\n    A National Guard truck unloads pallets of bottled water at the \n                     Stockbridge Elementary School\n\n       But then the 133rd showed up, and things changes in a \n     hurry. Their first task upon arrival was to erect the tents \n     that would house the fifty-plus Guard members assigned to the \n     Route 107 site and others around Stockbridge. It was \n     fortunate that there was level ground beside Lambert's Power \n     Tools, directly adjacent to the damaged highway. Before they \n     could position the excavators, they had to build a dike to \n     keep the muddy waters of the not-so-White River out of the \n     area where their equipment would have to be situated. There's \n     very fine, muddy silt everywhere, and though they had a \n     couple of fair weather, the recent rains turned that silt \n     into a thick soup that would have brought mere mortals to a \n     standstill. But this is the 133rd Engineer Battalion. By \n     Wednesday morning, they had already managed to restore a \n     single, very rough lane where there had only been submerged \n     rubble. This was wet, dirty and dangerous work, but according \n     to Frank Lambert's daughter, one of the Guardswomen attached \n     to this unit commented that she'd rather be here in Vermont's \n     mud and rain than in Afghanistan. Small wonder. The 133rd has \n     lost members to IEDs in previous deployments to that war-torn \n     country.\n       That single lane of 107 is still barely navigable, even by \n     4-wheel drive vehicles, so it is not open to traffic as yet. \n     But it is there. For that alone, 2nd Lieutenant Rand and the \n     men and women of the 133rd Engineer Battalion have earned the \n     undying gratitude of the residents of Stockbridge and the \n     neighboring towns that depend on that highway.\n\n\n  A ``bucket brigade'' speeds the transfer of packaged bottled water \n                                indoors\n\n       By the way, if anyone, Stockbridge resident or not, should \n     encounter a Guard member from the 133rd, or any other \n     National Guard unit here to help, tell them, thank you. SPC \n     Allison Pelletier of the 133rd's Public Affairs Office tells \n     me that a much-appreciated expression of gratitude would be \n     coffee and food. The MREs they're living on are better than \n     they used to be . . . but they're still MREs. Some Dunkin' \n     Donuts would go over pretty big, too, I'll bet. Hint, hint.\n       There are plenty of angels right here in Stockbridge, too. \n     So many, in fact, that you can't swing a cat without smacking \n     a Good Samaritan. My cat hates it when I do that.\n       Willis and Harry Whitaker, Mark Pelletier, Dave Brown, \n     Peter Steibris, and God-only-knows how many others put in \n     unbelievable hours making roads passable for emergency \n     vehicles. They also reinforced the damaged abutment of \n     Gaysville's 1929-vintage iron bridge.\n       Sid Hotchkiss and the McCullough brothers from Bethel have \n     been working on the monster hole in River Road with \n     bulldozers and an excavator.\n       Barbara Vellturo, Stephen Farrington, Cheryl Rivers, and \n     others have slaved away over hot computers ferreting out \n     information about the status of roads and bridges in \n     surrounding towns and getting that information to Stockbridge \n     residents by e-mail and postings to a Google Group called \n     Stockbridge Open Forum. Paul Buckley has scouted all those \n     roads daily to confirm the accuracy of the information.\n       Mark Doughty has coordinated meetings all over town to keep \n     people up to date and convey residents' concerns to town \n     officials.\n       Janet Whitaker has maintained a steady flow of information \n     from a multitude of sources to keep the group forum's \n     information current.\n       Jenny Harris has made innumerable runs to area pharmacies \n     for prescriptions so residents in need don't run out of \n     essential medications, and Mary Ellen Dorman, who knows \n     everyone in town, has seen to it that they were all delivered \n     to the right people.\n       Josh and Michelle Merrill, two former Gaysville residents \n     now living in Rutland, are the people who, with the help of \n     the Chittenden Fire Department and the Stockbridge Fire \n     Department, got the ball rolling for the food shelves at the \n     Stockbridge Elementary School and on the Stockbridge Common. \n     Fifteen volunteers give of their time to organize and \n     dispense all the items that fill the school's multi-purpose \n     room.\n       Every day, there are people going out of their way to help \n     someone. They neither expect, nor ask for, recognition; they \n     just do what they know is right and move on. Makes it hard to \n     catch 'em in the act.\n       Several people whose homes were damaged or destroyed, and \n     those who simply can't get to their homes, have been taken in \n     by generous and thoughtful neighbors. Furniture and \n     appliances have been donated, or at least promised, to people \n     in the process of rebuilding. Special efforts have been made \n     to care for elderly, ill, or disabled residents, including \n     helicopter and ambulance evacuations.\n       Were it possible to recount them all, the incidents of \n     selfless generosity and assistance given to those less \n     fortunate would fill this paper and two or three issues to \n     come. Only a few have been mentioned here by name, but many \n     more deserve recognition. However, I feel quite certain they \n     are all content with the knowledge that they did some good.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/05/senate-section/article/S6180-3", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6180-S6181]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               HONORING SPECIALIST DOUGLAS EDWARD DAHILL\n\n Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, this morning, at 10:45, in \nour Nation's\n\n[[Page S6181]]\n\nmost prestigious military cemetery, Douglas Edward Dahill, a Vietnam \nwar veteran from Lima, OH, was laid to rest. Forty years after being \npresumed dead, his family will gather at Arlington National Cemetery to \nhonor his life in the hallowed place our Nation honors its heroes.\n  Douglas Dahill's story--and that of his family--is simultaneously \nexceptional and familiar. Dahill voluntarily enlisted in the U.S. Army \nafter graduating from Lima Senior High School, following in the \nfootsteps of his grandfather, father, and uncle, who had all served in \nthe U.S. military during times of war.\n  Dahill was part of Detachment B52 Delta's Reconnaissance Team 6, \nwhich was dropped behind enemy lines on April 14, 1969 in South \nVietnam's Quang Nam Province. Three days later, on April 17, 1969, \nDahill and his team came under intense enemy fire in Thua Thien. They \nradioed a request for air strikes and support. But their call was never \nheard. Thunderstorms prevented air support from assisting Dahill and \nhis team. The following day, a search team went looking for Team 6, but \nfound no trace of their whereabouts. More than 8,000 miles away, in \nLima, OH, an Ohio military family would begin their long, painful wait \nfor news of their beloved son and brother.\n  For nearly four decades, the status of Delta's Reconnaissance Team 6 \nwent unresolved. Like so many American families during the Vietnam war, \nthe Dahill's were forced to cope with Douglas' unknown fate. When the \nVietnam war ended, and after American Prisoners of War, POWs, were \nreturned home, approximately 2,646 Americans were still unaccounted \nfor. Initially, the U.S. partnered with the Republic of Vietnam to \nconduct joint searches for Americans missing in South Vietnam. This \njoint effort resulted in the recovery and identification of 63 American \nservicemembers, but Dahill was not among them.\n  When the Communist regime took over Vietnam in 1975, joint efforts to \nrecover those missing in action were halted, and American families \ncould only hope that Vietnam would unilaterally recover and return the \nremains of their missing loved ones. In 1991, Vietnam returned uniform \nparts and a small quantity of human remains that were allegedly \nassociated with Delta's Reconnaissance Team 6. But the technology at \nthe time was not able to conclusively identify the remains. It wasn't \nuntil approximately 1 year ago that a portion of these remains were \npositively attributed to Specialist Douglas Edward Dahill.\n  Since U.S. Government efforts began, the remains of more than 900 \nAmericans killed in Vietnam have been returned and identified. However, \n1,682 servicemembers--77 of whom are from Ohio--remain unaccounted for. \nThe Department of Defense, and Congress, must continue to support \nrecovery and identification efforts so that more missing Americans can \nbe laid to rest and more American families may know peace and closure.\n  Douglas Edward Dahill is survived by his sister Carol Long and \nbrother John Dahill. On behalf of a grateful State and Nation, I thank \nSpecialist Dahill and his service and sacrifice for our Nation. May he \nrest in peace in Arlington National Cemetery and in our Nation's \nheart.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/05/senate-section/article/S6181-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6181-S6183]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          2011 SOLAR DECATHLON\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate the \nUniversity of Maryland, UMD, for winning the U.S. Department of \nEnergy's 2011 Solar Decathlon competition. The competition is organized \nby the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, America's premier \nlaboratory for research and development regarding renewable energy and \nenergy efficiency. This biennial event challenges collegiate teams from \naround the world to design, build, and operate solar-powered houses \nthat are affordable to build and operate, energy-efficient, and \naesthetically attractive. Nineteen teams representing the United \nStates, China, New Zealand, Belgium, and Canada competed in this year's \nevent, which was held at the National Mall's West Potomac Park.\n  I am so proud of the collaborative efforts of more than 200 UMD \nstudents, faculty, and mentors from diverse disciplines across the \ncampus who participated in making their entry, WaterShed, such a \nresounding success. Students, faculty, and mentors came from the \nCollege of Agriculture & Natural Resources; the School of Architecture, \nPlanning & Preservation; the College of Computer, Mathematical & \nNatural Sciences; the A. James Clark School of Engineering; the \nUniversity of Maryland Libraries; the National Center for Smart Growth \nResearch & Education; and the Center for the Use of Sustainable \nPractices. Over ten academic courses were offered as part of \nWaterShed's development since the spring 2010 academic semester.\n  WaterShed was inspired by concern for the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem, \nso the project wasn't just a successful model for energy efficiency; it \nalso implemented practical solutions to preserve our precious water \nresources and manage stormwater runoff, a particularly damaging form of \npollution to the bay.\n  The Chesapeake Bay is Maryland's greatest natural resource. For \nMarylanders, this national treasure is the cornerstone of our economy \nand part of the fabric of our communities. Its restoration and \nprotection have been the focal point of my work on environmental issues \nin the Senate. The University of Maryland's work in publicizing and \npromoting sustainable housing options like WaterShed for the residents \nof the Chesapeake Bay region will go a long way toward preserving this \ntreasured resource. I cannot think of a more appropriate effort for the \nUniversity of Maryland to be engaged in, and I applaud everyone's hard \nwork during the past two years towards this common cause and successful \noutcome.\n  The success of WaterShed is the pinnacle of a long history of \nachievement for the University of Maryland in the Solar Decathlon \ncompetition. The University of Maryland's initial design for the \ninaugural Solar Decathlon competition in 2002 became the foundation for \nsubsequent entries. In 2002, Maryland's entry placed fourth. In 2005, \nMaryland's solar house won the People's Choice and Solar Innovation \nAwards while placing eighth overall. In 2007, Maryland's LEAFHouse won \nthe People's Choice Award and received a host of other awards from \nindustry and professional associations. The acronym LEAF stands for \n``Leading Everyone towards an Abundant Future.'' LEAFHouse placed \nsecond in the overall scoring.\n  The UMD team gained valuable knowledge from the 2005 design and \nLEAFHouse, both of which are still in use for educational purposes. \nThis year, the team took its vision to an even higher level with \nWaterShed. The forms of the house highlight the path of a water drop. \nThe split butterfly roofline collects storm water into the core of the \nhouse for use. WaterShed also features a holistic approach to water \nconservation, recycling, and storm water management. These features \ninclude a modular constructed wetland that helps filter and recycle \ngreywater from the shower, washing machine, and dishwasher; a green \nroof that slows rainwater runoff to the landscape while improving the \nhouse's energy efficiency; and a garden, composting system, and edible \nwall system to illustrate a complete carbon cycle program.\n  So many people are involved in the Solar Decathlon.

I guess he didn't visit West Potomac \nPark to see what is going on. The many creative entries in the 2011 \nSolar Decathlon demonstrate to the wider public the cost effectiveness \nof houses that combine energy efficient construction and appliances \nwith renewable energy systems that are available today. And even better \nhomes and appliances and systems are just around the corner. Investing \nin green technologies creates jobs. Diversifying our energy sources \ncreates competition, which will help to stabilize and lower energy \nprices. Thinking beyond fossil fuels buried in unstable or unreliable \ncountries strengthens our national security.\n  I think the Solar Decathlon represents all that, and much more. At \nthis critical juncture in our nation's history, we face significant \neconomic, energy, and environmental challenges. It is easy to be \ndiscouraged or cynical. But for each person who says, ``it can't be \ndone,'' there are scores of people--especially young people--out in our \nuniversities and communities, in workplaces and laboratories across \nAmerica, who reject defeatism and cynicism, who demonstrate the ``can-\ndo'' spirit that made America great and will restore our fortunes. \nCompetitions such as the Solar Decathlon and entries such as the \nUniversity of Maryland's Watershed provide sparkling evidence of the \ninnovative and practical solutions to the intertwined problems we face. \nMore importantly, they provide hope and inspiration.\n  If we are going to solve our problems, we need to roll up our sleeves \nand collaborate with each other--just like the UMD team did. Scores of \nstudents worked on WaterShed. I am so pleased their hard work paid off \nand so proud of them. I would like to take this opportunity to \nacknowledge and salute them on this watershed accomplishment.

Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I \nhonor the Hockessin Fire Company and ladies auxiliary on 75 years of \nexceptional service to the great State of Delaware. October 15 marks an \nimportant day in the fire company's history, signifying the first \nofficial meeting of its founding members. For over seven decades, \nmembers of the Hockessin Fire Company and ladies auxiliary have given \nunselfishly of their time and services in order to make their community \na safer place. Today I give thanks for their unyielding determination, \nself-sacrifice and volunteerism.\n  In 1936 in the small village of Hockessin, DE, five members of the \ncommunity recognized a vital protective service was missing, and they \ndecided to do something about it. Meeting in a small library room on \nOctober 15, the Hockessin Fire Company was born. With one engine, they \nwent to work protecting and serving their community. From the very \nbeginning, the ladies auxiliary was integral to their operations. When \nthe fire company decided to purchase a second engine in 1938, funds \nraised by the ladies helped purchase a diesel model that was the first \nof its kind in the State. Then and now, both organizations have \ncontinued that wonderful tradition of partnership, hard work, support \nand service to all.\n  Like many volunteer fire companies across the United States the \nHockessin Fire Company's value is certainly not limited to its local \ncommunity, but should inspire each and every American, reminding us of \nthe importance of volunteering and serving others. I commend the hard \nwork of all our fire service men and women across the United States, \nand especially those at the Hockessin Fire Company on this special \nanniversary. They are examples of the generous spirit of the American \npeople, who we should be fighting for every day.\n  I congratulate the Hockessin Fire Company and ladies auxiliary on 75 \nyears of extraordinary service and support to their community and the \nState of Delaware. On behalf of all Delawareans, I extend my thanks to \neach and every member for the many sacrifices they have made during the \npast 75 years. Their continued efforts and countless contributions are \ngreatly appreciated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/05/senate-section/article/S6183-2", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6183-S6184]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 REMEMBERING JOSEPH D. ``JOE'' HUBBARD\n\n Mr. SESSIONS.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Jim and \nJean Mulder of Eureka, SD, as my nominees for the 2011 Angels in \nAdoption Award. Since 1999, the Angels in Adoption program through the \nCongressional Coalition on Adoption Institute have honored more than \n1,700 individuals, couples, and organizations nationwide for their work \nin providing children with loving, stable homes.\n  Fifty-nine foster children have come to know what it means to have \nloving parents through the compassion of Jim and Jean Mulder. While \nsome parents struggle to find a new identity after their youngest child \nenrolls in elementary school full time, Jim and Jean decided they just \nenjoyed being parents too much. So, for the past 20 years, this \ngenerous couple has opened their home in north central South Dakota to \nkids who have only known stability and hot meals to be luxuries. The \nsimple things, such as tossing the baseball around or going fishing, \nhave come to mean the world to the Mulder's because they can see the \njoy in their foster children's faces and know the impact their love has \nhad. Jim and Jean included their foster children in all family \nactivities with their biological children, and gave their 59 foster \nchildren a sense of what it means to be in a loving, stable family.\n  With children coming in and out of their home, staying anywhere from \nmonths to nearly a decade, one can only imagine the range of emotions \nJim and Jean have experienced. From laughter to heartbreak, they both \ncount their God-given role as foster parents as nothing shy of a \nblessing. With that blessing, they have bestowed a gift onto others in \nan immeasurable way.\n  With National Adoption Day just around the corner on November 19, \n2011, it is important that we recognize the compassionate families who \nfulfill the roles of foster and adoptive parents. It brings me great \npride to be able to honor South Dakotans Jim and Jean Mulder, my \nnominees for the 2011 Angels in Adoption Award.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/05/senate-section/article/S6184-2", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6184]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/05/senate-section/article/S6184-3", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6184]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/05/senate-section/article/S6184-4", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6184]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                         Enrolled Bills Signed\n\n  At 7:37 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker has \nsigned the following enrolled bills:\n\n       H.R. 771.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. CORKER (for himself and Mr. Bennet):\n  S. 1655. A bill to amend title XI of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for the annual mailing of statements of Medicare beneficiary \npart A contributions and benefits in coordination with the annual \nmailing of Social Security account statements; to the Committee on \nfinance.\n  Mr. CORKER. I am here today to say that Senator Bennet from Colorado \nand myself are introducing a bill that mirrors what has been introduced \nin the House by Representative Cooper from Tennessee and Paul Ryan from \nWisconsin.\n  I have tremendous faith in the American people. I believe when the \nAmerican people are given facts and transparency, they make good \ndecisions. They help us here in Washington make good decisions when I \nthink they have the information they need.\n  A lot of Americans are very aware of some of the dilemmas we face \nhere in Washington regarding Medicare. But I do not think many \nAmericans are fully aware of the dilemma we face. I think they are \naware that the trustees for Medicare have said that in the year 2024 \nMedicare is going to become insolvent. But I do not think they are \naware of the math. Actually I was not aware of the math until we began \nto look at how we solve the problem.\n  According to a recent study, the average American couple each earning \n$43,500 a year will pay $119,000 into the Medicare Program over their \nlifetime. This contribution includes the portion that their employer \npays on their behalf. In other words, the family pays in half, the \nemployer pays in half. In 2011 dollars, that means if you paid in 30 \nyears ago, and that money was inflated to today's dollars, that family \nwould have paid in $119,000 over their lifetime.\n  What most Americans do not know is that over their lifetime, the \naverage family takes $357,000 out of Medicare. So obviously the math \ndoes not work. I think most Americans did not fully realize this until \nwe got into the situation we're in--I am not sure most people in the \nSenate understood how off the math is, if you will.\n  Over the next decade, 20 million more Americans are going to be on \nMedicare. The situation where the average family and their employer are \npaying in $119,000 into the program and taking out $357,000 is going to \nbe further exacerbated by the fact that over the next 10 years, 20 \nmillion more Americans are going to be on Medicare.\n  Then, on top of that, we are going to have fewer people working per \nretiree than ever in the history of this country. For that reason, \ntoday, Senator Bennet and I are offering a bill that says when \nAmericans receive their Social Security letter, which lays out how much \nthey have paid in, they would also receive the information regarding \nMedicare, so that they will know how much they are paying into the \nprogram and, over time, how much they will have taken out.\n  I think this type of transparency allows Americans to fully \nunderstand how these programs work. To me, what that will do is help \nall of us in the Senate, and over in the House of Representatives, make \nbetter decisions. I think when Americans are informed they help us make \nbetter decisions.\n  A lot of Americans don't fully appreciate this, I think, sometimes. \nBut Congress really does reflect more fully than they think the will of \nthe American people. Again, I think transparency helps us represent the \nAmerican people in even a more full way.\n  Today we introduce this bill, and I thank Senator Bennet from \nColorado for joining me in this effort. I also thank Representatives \nCooper and Ryan for their leadership in the House.\n  It is my hope that soon, either through unanimous consent or early \naction, that this bill will become law. I think as long as Americans \nunderstand where things stand, they help us in Congress make good and \nsound decisions. That is why I am introducing this bill today with the \nhelp of Senator Bennet from Colorado.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I congratulate the junior Senator from \nTennessee for his usual good judgment and insight in working on a \ndifficult problem. No Member of this body has done more in the last \nyear to try to highlight the problem of the Federal debt. Through his \ncap plan, which has been a part of almost every discussion we have had \nseriously about it, through his effort--more recently to support \nefforts to try to achieve $4 trillion in debt reduction as a part of \nthe select committee, and his suggestion today that allowing Americans \nto understand something that most of us hadn't focused on--that during \nour lifetimes we are paying in $110,000, $120,000 into Medicare and \ntaking out, during our lifetimes, $350,000 or so, and that is a problem \nthat has to be solved.\n  I have been doing research lately on our debt situation. \nFundamentally speaking, our problem lies with health care costs. It \nlies with families, businesses, and with the U.S. Government. Our \ndiscretionary spending--the kind we appropriate every year--on \neverything from national parks and national defense to roads and \nbridges, that is about 39 percent of the budget. If we stick to our \nguns on the agreement we made in early August, that will only grow at a \nlittle less than the rate of inflation. But it would go over to the \nmandatory spending, which is about 55 percent of our spending. It is \ngoing to go up three times the rate of inflation, and the fastest \ngrowing part of that mandatory spending is Medicare and Medicaid.\n  So we need to save our Medicare and Medicaid system so Americans can \nrely on them. I think Senator Corker shows respect for the voters of \nTennessee and for Americans by assuming that if they understand the \nproblem, they will support a serious effort to deal with a solution. I \ncompliment him for that leadership.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, while we are issuing compliments, I want \nto say that all of us want to see to it that Medicare is here for \nfuture generations. That will take sound judgment. We have a select \ncommittee that is working on, hopefully, the first step to make that \nhappen.\n  I congratulate the senior Senator from Tennessee for this. More than \nanybody else recently, I think he has\n\n[[Page S6188]]\n\npointed out that in this country, as we leave mandatory spending on \nautopilot, and as we move to a place where these programs are insolvent \nand not there for future generations, what we are doing is eating our \nseed corn.\n  The fact is, our senior Senator from Tennessee knows full well what \nit takes to make a strong country. He sits on an appropriations \ncommittee and understands that many of the basic sciences and other \ntypes of efforts that are underway with the Federal Government are the \nvery things that will make our country stronger.\n  Yet what we are doing in this country by leaving mandatory spending \non autopilot at the rate at which it is growing is causing us to eat \ninto those things that make our country strong. I thank him for his \nleadership in that regard. As the Governor of Tennessee, he led our \nState in making it stronger by making the kinds of priority investments \nthat made us stronger. He alluded to that earlier--what he did in \nmaking sure investments in our State created higher wages.\n  I think more than anybody else in this body, the Senator understands \nif we allow things to continue as they are, we are going to continue to \ninvest less and less in those kinds of things that make our country \nstrong--things such as infrastructure, which we all know needs to \nhappen. Yet because we haven't had the courage and the will to take on \nthose mandatory programs, reform them so that future generations will \nhave them, but also so that we can continue to make these investments \nin our country that are so important, our country's greatness will \ndissipate.\n  I thank him for his leadership in many ways. I hope he will continue \nto move ahead with informing people as to what is happening in this \ncountry, how that is hurting us, how it causes our greatness to \ndissipate as long as we don't take on these mandatory spending programs \nwhich, in my words, are causing us to eat our seed corn.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n  S. 1660.

SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This subtitle may be cited as the \n     ``Building and Upgrading Infrastructure for Long-Term \n     Development Act''.\n\n     SEC. 243. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) infrastructure has always been a vital element of the \n     economic strength of the United States and a key indicator of \n     the international leadership of the United States;\n       (2) the Erie Canal, the Hoover Dam, the railroads, and the \n     interstate highway system are all testaments to American \n     ingenuity and have helped propel and maintain the United \n     States as the world's largest economy;\n       (3) according to the World Economic Forum's Global \n     Competitiveness Report, the United States fell to second \n     place in 2009, and dropped to fourth place overall in 2010, \n     however, in the ``Quality of overall infrastructure'' \n     category of the same report, the United States ranked twenty-\n     third in the world;\n       (4) according to the World Bank's 2010 Logistic Performance \n     Index, the capacity of countries to efficiently move goods \n     and connect manufacturers and consumers with international \n     markets is improving around the world, and the United States \n     now ranks seventh in the world in logistics-related \n     infrastructure behind countries from both Europe and Asia;\n       (5) according to a January 2009 report from the University \n     of Massachusetts/Alliance for American Manufacturing entitled \n     ``Employment, Productivity and Growth,'' infrastructure \n     investment is a ``highly effective engine of job creation'';\n       (6) according to the American Society of Civil Engineers, \n     the current condition of the infrastructure in the United \n     States earns a grade point average of D, and an estimated \n     $2,200,000,000,000 investment is needed over the next 5 years \n     to bring American infrastructure up to adequate condition;\n       (7) according to the National Surface Transportation Policy \n     and Revenue Study Commission, $225,000,000,000 is needed \n     annually from all sources for the next 50 years to upgrade \n     the United States surface transportation system to a state of \n     good repair and create a more advanced system;\n       (8) the current infrastructure financing mechanisms of the \n     United States, both on the Federal and State level, will fail \n     to meet current and foreseeable demands and will create large \n     funding gaps;\n       (9) published reports state that there may not be enough \n     demand for municipal bonds to maintain the same level of \n     borrowing at the same rates, resulting in significantly \n     decreased infrastructure investment at the State and local \n     level;\n       (10) current funding mechanisms are not readily scalable \n     and do not--\n       (A) serve large in-State or cross jurisdiction \n     infrastructure projects, projects of regional or national \n     significance, or projects that cross sector silos;\n       (B) sufficiently catalyze private sector investment; or\n       (C) ensure the optimal return on public resources;\n       (11) although grant programs of the United States \n     Government must continue to play a central role in financing \n     the transportation, environment, and energy infrastructure \n     needs of the United States, current and foreseeable demands \n     on existing Federal, State, and local funding for \n     infrastructure expansion clearly exceed the resources to \n     support these programs by margins wide enough to prompt \n     serious concerns about the United States ability to sustain \n     long-term economic development, productivity, and \n     international competitiveness;\n       (12) the capital markets, including pension funds, private \n     equity funds, mutual funds, sovereign wealth funds, and other \n     investors, have a growing interest in infrastructure \n     investment and represent hundreds of billions of dollars of \n     potential investment; and\n       (13) the establishment of a United States Government-owned, \n     independent, professionally managed institution that could \n     provide credit support to qualified infrastructure projects \n     of regional and national significance, making transparent \n     merit-based investment decisions based on the commercial \n     viability of infrastructure projects, would catalyze the \n     participation of significant private investment capital.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to facilitate \n     investment in, and long-term financing of, economically \n     viable infrastructure projects of regional or national \n     significance in a manner that both complements existing \n     Federal, State, local, and private funding sources for these \n     projects and introduces a merit-based system for financing \n     such projects, in order to mobilize significant private \n     sector investment, create jobs, and ensure United States \n     competitiveness through an institution that limits the need \n     for ongoing Federal funding.\n\n     SEC. 244.

Res. 286\n\n       Whereas Hereditary Angioedema (HAE) is a rare and \n     potentially life-threatening genetic disease, affecting \n     between 1 in 10,000 and 1 in 50,000 people, leading to \n     patients being undiagnosed or misdiagnosed for many years;\n       Whereas HAE is characterized by symptoms including episodes \n     of edema or swelling in various body parts including the \n     hands, feet, gastrointestinal tract, face, and airway;\n\n[[Page S6226]]\n\n       Whereas patients often experience swelling in the \n     intestinal wall, causing bouts of excruciating abdominal \n     pain, nausea, and vomiting, and swelling of the airway, which \n     can lead to death by asphyxiation;\n       Whereas a defect in the gene that controls the C1-inhibitor \n     blood protein causes production of either inadequate or non-\n     functioning C1-inhibitor protein, leading to an inability to \n     regulate complex biochemical interactions of blood-based \n     systems involved in disease fighting, inflammatory response, \n     and coagulation;\n       Whereas HAE is an autosomal dominant disease, and 50 \n     percent of patients with the disease inherited the defective \n     gene from a parent, while the other 50 percent developed a \n     spontaneous mutation of the C1-inhibitor gene at conception;\n       Whereas HAE patients often experience their first HAE \n     attack during childhood or adolescence, and continue to \n     suffer from subsequent attacks for the duration of their \n     lives;\n       Whereas HAE attacks can be triggered by infections, minor \n     injuries or dental procedures, emotional or mental stress, \n     and certain hormonal or blood medications;\n       Whereas the onset or duration of an HAE attack can \n     negatively affect a person's physical, emotional, economic, \n     educational, and social well-being due to activity \n     limitations;\n       Whereas the annual cost for treatment per patient can \n     exceed $500,000, causing a substantial economic burden;\n       Whereas there is a significant need for increased and \n     normalized medical professional education regarding HAE; and\n       Whereas there is also a significant need for further \n     research on HAE to improve diagnosis and treatment options \n     for patients; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the Senate--\n       (A) recognizes and celebrates May 16, 2012, as Hereditary \n     Angioedema Awareness Day; and\n       (B) supports increased awareness of Hereditary Angioedema \n     (HAE) by physicians and the public; and\n       (2) it is the sense of the Senate that increased Federal \n     research on HAE is needed, including that--\n       (A) the Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) \n     should take a leadership role in the search for new treatment \n     options and a cure for HAE by--\n       (i) encouraging the National Institute of Allergy and \n     Infectious Diseases (NIAID) to implement the research \n     recommendations of the international HAE research community;\n       (ii) exploring collaborative research opportunities between \n     the NIAID, the Office of Rare Diseases Research, and other \n     NIH Institutes and Centers; and\n       (iii) encouraging NIAID to provide the necessary funding \n     for continued expansion and advancement of the HAE research \n     portfolio through intramural and extramural research; and\n       (B) the Commissioner of Food and Drugs should take a \n     leadership role in ensuring new HAE treatments are developed \n     and appropriately monitored by--\n       (i) issuing further guidance to industry on the development \n     criteria and adverse event standards for HAE treatments; and\n       (ii) encouraging the participation of patient groups and \n     considering the views of patients when discussing standards \n     and protocols for the development and monitoring of HAE \n     treatments.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \nrecognizing May 16, 2012, as Hereditary Angioedema, HAE, Awareness Day. \nHAE is a rare and potentially life threatening genetic disease which \nimpacts between 1 in 10,000 and 1 in 50,000 Americans. HAE is \ncharacterized by severe swelling throughout the body, including the \ndigestive tract and airways. The swelling caused by episodes of HAE is \nboth very painful and can cause sufferers to asphyxiate when the \nswelling impacts the airways. To date there is only one Food and Drug \nAdministration approved treatment for HAE, but this treatment is only \neffective in about a third of patients afflicted with this devastating \ndisease. It is clearly evident that more research is needed to combat \nthis terrible disease.\n  On May 16, 2012, an international conference on HAE will be convened \nin Copenhagen, Denmark to discuss issues relating to HAE research, \ntreatments, and awareness. The American component of this conference \nwill be spearheaded by the U.S. Hereditary Angioedema Association, \nUSHAEA, based in my home state of Hawaii. USHAEA is an organization \nthat provides education, support, funding for research, and a voice to \nHAE patients, their families, healthcare providers and the general \npublic at large. I urge my colleagues to support this important \nresolution and help find a cure for HAE.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/05/senate-section/article/S6226-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6226]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 287--DESIGNATING OCTOBER 2011 AS ``FILIPINO AMERICAN \n                            HISTORY MONTH''\n\n  Mr. REID of Nevada (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. \nAkaka, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Schumer, Mrs. \nMurray, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Heller) submitted the following resolution; \nwhich was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Since 2007, \n     however, preauthorized end-users in China have been \n     authorized to participate in the Validated End-User program, \n     which allows certain items to be exported without a license. \n     While on-site audits of validated end-users in China by the \n     Department of Commerce are permissible, the effectiveness of \n     the Validated End-User program remains uncertain.\n       (7) The Government of China has a poor track record of \n     enforcement of export controls. Moreover, the Government of \n     China remains largely indifferent to the implementation of \n     international sanctions on both Iran and North Korea for \n     activities relating to the proliferation of weapons of mass \n     destruction.\n       (8) China's expanding trade relationships with both Iran \n     and North Korea raise concern that sensitive dual-use items \n     exported from the United States may end up in the hands of \n     rogue regimes and dangerous proliferators of weapons of mass \n     destruction.\n       (b) Denial of Licenses for Exportation of Dual-use Items to \n     China.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, on and after the date of the enactment of this Act, the \n     Secretary of Commerce shall--\n       (A) require a license for the exportation of any item on \n     the Commerce Control List to China; and\n       (B) unless the Secretary submits to Congress the \n     certification described in paragraph (2), deny any request \n     for such a license.\n       (2) Certification described.--A certification described in \n     this paragraph is a certification by the Secretary of \n     Commerce, in consultation with the Director of National \n     Intelligence, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of \n     Defense, and the heads of other relevant Federal agencies, \n     that no items on the Commerce Control List that are exported \n     from the United States are transshipped through China to \n     Iran, North Korea, Syria, or any other country of concern \n     with respect to the proliferation of weapons of mass \n     destruction.\n       (c) Report on Preventing Transshipment of Dual-use Items.--\n     Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the \n     Director of National Intelligence, the Secretary of State, \n     the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Defense, and \n     the heads of other relevant Federal agencies, shall submit to \n     Congress a report setting forth a comprehensive strategy to \n     prevent the transshipment of items on the Commerce Control \n     List to countries of concern with respect to the \n     proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\n       (d) Commerce Control List Defined.--In this section, the \n     term ``Commerce Control List'' means the list maintained \n     pursuant to part 774 of title 15, Code of Federal Regulations \n     (or any corresponding similar regulation or ruling).\n\n[[Page S6228]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 725.

SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This subtitle may be cited as the \n     ``Building and Upgrading Infrastructure for Long-Term \n     Development Act''.\n\n     SEC. 243. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) infrastructure has always been a vital element of the \n     economic strength of the United States and a key indicator of \n     the international leadership of the United States;\n       (2) the Erie Canal, the Hoover Dam, the railroads, and the \n     interstate highway system are all testaments to American \n     ingenuity and have helped propel and maintain the United \n     States as the world's largest economy;\n       (3) according to the World Economic Forum's Global \n     Competitiveness Report, the United States fell to second \n     place in 2009, and dropped to fourth place overall in 2010, \n     however, in the ``Quality of overall infrastructure'' \n     category of the same report, the United States ranked twenty-\n     third in the world;\n\n[[Page S6242]]\n\n       (4) according to the World Bank's 2010 Logistic Performance \n     Index, the capacity of countries to efficiently move goods \n     and connect manufacturers and consumers with international \n     markets is improving around the world, and the United States \n     now ranks seventh in the world in logistics-related \n     infrastructure behind countries from both Europe and Asia;\n       (5) according to a January 2009 report from the University \n     of Massachusetts/Alliance for American Manufacturing entitled \n     ``Employment, Productivity and Growth,'' infrastructure \n     investment is a ``highly effective engine of job creation'';\n       (6) according to the American Society of Civil Engineers, \n     the current condition of the infrastructure in the United \n     States earns a grade point average of D, and an estimated \n     $2,200,000,000,000 investment is needed over the next 5 years \n     to bring American infrastructure up to adequate condition;\n       (7) according to the National Surface Transportation Policy \n     and Revenue Study Commission, $225,000,000,000 is needed \n     annually from all sources for the next 50 years to upgrade \n     the United States surface transportation system to a state of \n     good repair and create a more advanced system;\n       (8) the current infrastructure financing mechanisms of the \n     United States, both on the Federal and State level, will fail \n     to meet current and foreseeable demands and will create large \n     funding gaps;\n       (9) published reports state that there may not be enough \n     demand for municipal bonds to maintain the same level of \n     borrowing at the same rates, resulting in significantly \n     decreased infrastructure investment at the State and local \n     level;\n       (10) current funding mechanisms are not readily scalable \n     and do not--\n       (A) serve large in-State or cross jurisdiction \n     infrastructure projects, projects of regional or national \n     significance, or projects that cross sector silos;\n       (B) sufficiently catalyze private sector investment; or\n       (C) ensure the optimal return on public resources;\n       (11) although grant programs of the United States \n     Government must continue to play a central role in financing \n     the transportation, environment, and energy infrastructure \n     needs of the United States, current and foreseeable demands \n     on existing Federal, State, and local funding for \n     infrastructure expansion clearly exceed the resources to \n     support these programs by margins wide enough to prompt \n     serious concerns about the United States ability to sustain \n     long-term economic development, productivity, and \n     international competitiveness;\n       (12) the capital markets, including pension funds, private \n     equity funds, mutual funds, sovereign wealth funds, and other \n     investors, have a growing interest in infrastructure \n     investment and represent hundreds of billions of dollars of \n     potential investment; and\n       (13) the establishment of a United States Government-owned, \n     independent, professionally managed institution that could \n     provide credit support to qualified infrastructure projects \n     of regional and national significance, making transparent \n     merit-based investment decisions based on the commercial \n     viability of infrastructure projects, would catalyze the \n     participation of significant private investment capital.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to facilitate \n     investment in, and long-term financing of, economically \n     viable infrastructure projects of regional or national \n     significance in a manner that both complements existing \n     Federal, State, local, and private funding sources for these \n     projects and introduces a merit-based system for financing \n     such projects, in order to mobilize significant private \n     sector investment, create jobs, and ensure United States \n     competitiveness through an institution that limits the need \n     for ongoing Federal funding.\n\n     SEC. 244.

Res. 287\n\n       Whereas October 18, 1587, when the first ``Luzones Indios'' \n     set foot in Morro Bay, California, on board the Manila-built \n     galleon ship Nuestra Senora de Esperanza, marks the earliest \n     documented Filipino presence in the continental United \n     States;\n       Whereas the Filipino American National Historical Society \n     recognizes the year of 1763 as the date of the first \n     permanent Filipino settlement in the United States in St. \n     Malo, Louisiana;\n       Whereas the recognition of the first permanent Filipino \n     settlement in the United States adds new perspective to \n     United States history by bringing attention to the economic, \n     cultural, social, and other notable contributions that \n     Filipino Americans have made in countless ways toward the \n     development of the United States;\n       Whereas the Filipino-American community is the third \n     largest Asian-American group in the United States, with a \n     population of approximately 3,417,000 individuals;\n       Whereas Filipino-American servicemen and servicewomen have \n     a longstanding history of serving in the Armed Forces, from \n     the Civil War to the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts, \n     including the 250,000 Filipinos who fought under the United \n     States flag during World War II to protect and defend the \n     United States;\n       Whereas 9 Filipino Americans have received the \n     Congressional Medal of Honor, the highest award for valor in \n     action against an enemy force that can be bestowed upon an \n     individual serving in the Armed Forces;\n       Whereas Filipino Americans play an integral role in the \n     United States health care system as nurses, doctors, and \n     other medical professionals;\n       Whereas Filipino Americans have contributed greatly to \n     music, dance, literature, education, business, literature, \n     journalism, sports, fashion, politics, government, science, \n     technology, the fine arts, and other fields in the United \n     States that enrich the landscape of the country;\n       Whereas efforts should continue to promote the study of \n     Filipino-American history and culture, as mandated in the \n     mission statement of the Filipino American National \n     Historical Society, because the roles of Filipino Americans \n     and other people of color largely have been overlooked in the \n     writing, teaching, and learning of United States history;\n       Whereas it is imperative for Filipino-American youth to \n     have positive role models to instill in them the significance \n     of education, complemented with the richness of\n\n[[Page S6276]]\n\n     their ethnicity and the value of their legacy; and\n       Whereas Filipino American History Month is celebrated \n     during the month of October 2011: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates October 2011 as ``Filipino American History \n     Month'';\n       (2) recognizes the celebration of Filipino American History \n     Month as--\n       (A) a study of the advancement of Filipino Americans;\n       (B) a time of reflection and remembrance of the many \n     notable contributions Filipino Americans have made to the \n     United States; and\n       (C) a time to renew efforts toward the research and \n     examination of history and culture in order to provide an \n     opportunity for all people in the United States to learn and \n     appreciate more about Filipino Americans and their historic \n     contributions to the United States; and\n       (3) urges the people of the United States to observe \n     Filipino American History Month with appropriate programs and \n     activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/05/senate-section/article/S6276-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--S. 1660\n\n  Mr. REID.
