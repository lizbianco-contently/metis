Mr. President, I really hope we can work out an agreement \non the postal reform bill. I spoke to Senator Lieberman, the chairman \nof the committee, late last night, and he is hopeful, as I am, that we \ncan move forward on this legislation. It is a shame if we cannot. As we \nspeak, there are more than half a million men and women working for the \nPostal Service, and 25 percent of them are returning veterans. We have \n30,000 post offices around the country. We have about 8 million people \nwho depend on the post office for their jobs. So to think that we can't \nmove forward on this would be really untoward. It is something we \nreally need to get done. I am hopeful we can get that done. People can \noffer amendments, and we should do that as quickly as possible and move \nforward on this legislation. If there is no agreement, we will have to \nvote on the substitute amendment tomorrow morning. I repeat, it would \nbe too bad if we cannot get it done.\n  Enshrined in the Constitution by the Founding Fathers, the U.S. \nPostal Service has delivered this Nation's letters and other mail since \nthe day of the quill pen and the inkwell. That is why we have inkwells \nhere. That is what these are. I have paper clips in mine now, but \noriginally that was the only way people who sat at these desks and did \ntheir work could write. Most of the time it was for mail.\n  Mail has been delivered through the years when stamps cost a nickel. \nMail has been delivered through the years when mail traveled up and \ndown America's waterways by steamship, and it has been delivered \nthrough two world wars when soldiers sent letters home to their \nsweethearts and families. Through it all, the U.S. Postal Service has \nbeen there to deliver the mail, rain or shine. But today America's \npostal system is in crisis.\n  We kind of use that as a throwaway, ``through rain or shine.'' When I \nwas a little boy, we had really bad snowstorms all over the West. In \nSearchlight, NV, we had a little snow a few times a year. But we had 3 \nfeet of snow on the level. It was very, very bad.\n  I can remember a man named Con Hudgens. The mail came to Searchlight. \nThere was a railroad that went through Nipton, CA, which was 22 miles \nfrom Searchlight. As that train sped through Nipton, they had an \napparatus that would snatch the mail that was on the train. That mail \nwas for Searchlight. They sorted it that way. This old man, Con \nHudgens, walked through snow 22 miles to bring the mail. That is what \nwe talk about when we say that mail has been delivered through rain or \nshine. That is the mantra of the post office.\n  But today America's postal system is in crisis. Today a personal note \nfrom a\n\n[[Page S2456]]\n\nfriend or payment to the electric company can be delivered online with \na few quick keystrokes on your computer. This changing technology has \nmeant serious new challenges for an organization that has serviced \ncitizens of this Nation from its very beginning. It has served this \nNation whether they live on city streets or rural routes.\n  Although the world the post office deals with has changed, the postal \nsystem's message and mission have not changed; that is, to deliver \nletters, packages, medicines--much of which is vital--online purchases, \nbirthday cards, phone bills to hundreds of millions of Americans no \nmatter how rural or how urban the places they call home. Neither has \nthe current crisis changed the importance of that mission. Nearly half \nof rural households don't have broadband Internet access, making it \ndifficult or impossible to pay bills or ship packages online. Rural \nfamilies in Tuscarora, NV, or Baker, NV, in Elko County, NV, rely on \nthe Postal Service. That is their way of communicating.\n\n  Small businesses benefit from cost-saving options offered at the post \noffice, such as bulk mail. American businesses rely on the U.S. Postal \nService. As I indicated earlier, 8 million people's jobs are dependent \non the Postal Service.\n  For seniors who cannot leave their homes, mail carriers deliver \nlivesaving medications--an important link to the outside world. Elderly \nAmericans rely on the U.S. Postal Service.\n  I will go home tonight to my home here in Washington, and there will \nbe some mail there. A lot of it is what some people refer to as junk \nmail, but for the people who are sending that mail, it is very \nimportant.\n  And talking about seniors, seniors love to get junk mail. It is \nsometimes their only way of communicating or feeling they are part of \nthe real world. Elderly Americans, more than any other group of people \nin America, rely on the U.S. Postal Service.\n  Unless we act quickly, thousands of post offices--I indicated there \nare more than 30,000 in America--many of them rural, will close. I said \nthis earlier today, and I will repeat it. These rural post offices are \nthe only way people in those small communities have to communicate with \nthe outside world. There may be some medicine they are getting, it may \nbe to keep in touch with their family or friends, but it is their way \nof keeping in touch with the world. Hundreds of mail-processing \nfacilities will close, and the jobs of hundreds of thousands of \ndedicated postal employees are at risk.\n  Timely, dependable mail delivery is not the only thing at stake in \nthis debate. Today the Postal Service employs, as I have indicated, \nmore than half a million middle-class workers, and the postal system \ngives more than 130,000 men and women who volunteered for this country \nin the armed services a chance to serve again. A quarter of all postal \nemployees are veterans of the U.S. Armed Forces. So there is really a \nlot at stake in this debate.\n  The Postal Service has been playing an important role in the history \nof this country and the lives of its citizens for more than 200 years, \nbut it has also seen a 21-percent drop in mail volume over the last 5 \nyears and is on the verge of insolvency. Yesterday the Postal Service \nlost about $20 million--1 day.\n  Changing times demand a leaner, more modern post office. To make that \npossible, we must pass legislation. The Senate must act. We must change \nthe Postal Service business model. They cannot do it on their own. They \nneed legislation. They need it to keep pace with technology and to keep \nup with the times.\n  The bipartisan bill before this body enacts reforms that are major \nbut measured. The people who have worked on this so hard--I have \nalready talked about Senator Lieberman. His counterpart, Republican \nSenator Collins, has worked extremely hard. I have worked with her to \nmaintain the 6-day delivery. This is something she believes in \nstrongly. I really admire her for the fight she has put up to get the \nthings that she feels are important in this legislation.\n  If we act, it would reduce the number of employees and facilities the \nPostal Service maintains in a responsible way, and that would protect \nemployees and millions of Americans relying on the mail. It would \nresponsibly restructure the postal system, while preserving overnight \n6-day-a-week delivery. It would help the Postal Service innovate and \ngrow by offering new products that will attract new customers and, most \nimportantly, would save the Postal Service from insolvency. It will \nhelp an institution enshrined in the Constitution modernize to meet the \nchallenges of a changing world.\n  What Senators Lieberman and Collins have come up with is not perfect, \nand we all recognize that. It is not a perfect compromise. It will not \nmake every Senator happy. It will not make every American happy. It \nwill not save every post office. But it is a very good compromise and \none that is bipartisan. It will save an institution that has been a \npart of the fabric of this Nation for more than 200 years. So let's \nwork together to save the American Postal Service, which, by the way, \nis the best in the world.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/18/senate-section/article/S2456-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, with gas prices hovering around $4 a \ngallon, I think it is important for the American people to realize \nthere are really two camps on this issue here in Washington: there are \nthose who want to do something about the problem, and there are those \nwho want people to think they are doing something about the problem. \nAnd let's be clear--President Obama is firmly planted in the ``say \nanything but do nothing'' camp. If there were any doubt about that, he \ndispelled it when he blocked the Keystone Pipeline and then again this \nweek by embracing the age-old Democratic dodge of blaming gas prices on \nspeculators.\n  Look, what bothers Americans is not that the President has unpopular \nviews on this issue. Everyone knows he does not really support an all-\nof-the-above approach to energy. What bothers people is the fact that \nhe pretends as though he does.\n\n  What bothers people is the President is blocking one-half of a \npipeline one day and showing up at a ribbon cutting for the other half \non another day. It is blocking domestic energy and then taking credit \nfor increases that came about as a result of his predecessor's \ndecision. It is pretending that speculators have a big impact on the \nprice of gas when his own staff can't even point to any.\n  The President said he was different, and a lot of people believed \nhim. But to a growing number of Americans that is just what he has \nbecome: just one more politician saying the same things they always \nsay.\n  This week has been a real clarifier for people when it comes to this \nPresident. Whether it is the Buffett tax that would not lower the \ndeficit or a commission on speculators that even the White House says \nwould not lower the price of gas, what people have seen this week is a \nPresident who seems a lot more interested in looking like he is solving \nproblems than actually solving them.\n  For years Washington Democrats have had the same totally rigid \nopposition to expanding domestic energy exploration. The only people \nthey seem to listen to are extremists. But instead of just stating \ntheir position and letting the political chips fall where they may, \nthey pull out the same poll-tested talking points they always do, on \nthe assumption that reporters will just reprint them like it is the \nfirst time they have used them and that everybody else will just \nsomehow forget.\n  But with gas prices at about $4 a gallon, it is time somebody called \nthem out on it. Ten years ago today Democrats voted down a bill to open \na tiny\n\n[[Page S2457]]\n\narea of Alaska known as ANWR to drilling. They relied on the \nnonargument that it would take too long to get the oil to market. That \nwas 10 years ago today. Every Democrat who was asked about it said the \nsame thing, that it would take too long to get the oil to market. I \nhave two pages of quotes from Democrats saying it would take at least 7 \nto 10 years to get the oil to market.\n  Well, here we are 10 years later. In some places gas prices are now \nthree times what they were in April 2002. The United States still \nimports one-half of its oil. ANWR is still off-limits. If we ask \nDemocrats why they oppose more domestic exploration, they will say the \nsame thing they said 10 years ago.\n  This is precisely the kind of thing this President campaigned against \n4 years ago. He was the one who was going to stop kicking the can down \nthe road. He was the one who was going to tackle the problems everybody \nelse was afraid to face. He was the one who was going to rise above \npetty squabbles and the tired talking points of the past and offer \nsomething different. He was going to be a different kind of politician \nwho would usher in a new era of authenticity.\n  What did the American people get? They got the same gimmicks as \nbefore. They got someone whose idea of solving a problem is to give a \nspeech about it or to blame whatever person, place, or thing doesn't \nhappen to poll well that day. What the American people got was a \nPresident who absolutely refuses to lead.\n  It is the same thing they got from the Democrat-controlled Senate, \nthe same tired talking points, the same evasion, the same refusal to \naddress our problems at all.\n  Yesterday, the chairman of the Budget Committee made it official. For \nthe third year in a row, Senate Democrats will refuse to do the basic \nwork of governance by refusing to offer a budget blueprint for \ngovernment spending--by the way, as required by the law.\n  After pledging both to me and his Republican counterpart on the \ncommittee that he would, in fact, mark up a budget this year, the \nchairman of the Budget Committee bowed, once again, to the political \npressure and said he would not put his Democratic colleagues at any \npolitical risk by asking them to vote on a plan their constituents \nmight not like; that is, not until after the election. The Democratic \nchairman did suggest, however, that if Europe implodes, he might change \nhis mind.\n  Well, with all due respect, the statute doesn't say the majority must \npresent a budget if the European economy implodes. It says it must \npresent a budget, period, so that the American people can see how much \nthey are going to be taxed and how their tax dollars are going to be \nspent.\n  I am having a hard time thinking of a word to describe the level of \nleadership we are getting from Democrats in Washington these days--\nwhether it is the President or the Democratic Senate. Frankly, it is a \ndisgrace. There isn't a single issue I can think of that they are \nwilling to do anything about.\n  Under this President's watch, Washington has been spending more than \n$1 trillion a year more than it takes in. Senate Democrats don't even \nhave the courage to put it all in black and white. They don't have any \nproblem spending it; they just don't want to be on record voting for \nit. That is what passes for leadership in Washington these days.\n  Well, something has to give. Our challenges are too urgent. The \nstatus quo just would not cut it anymore.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/18/senate-section/article/S2457-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I want to talk about the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission. This is the Federal agency that ensures the \nsafety of our Nation's nuclear powerplants.\n  Specifically, I want to bring attention to the reappointment of \nKristine Svinicki--or, rather, the curious lack of action surrounding \nher reappointment.\n  Commissioner Svinicki is one of the most respected Commissioners ever \nto serve at the NRC. She is an experienced and fair-minded regulator \nwhose leadership has earned her the admiration of Members of Congress \non both sides of the aisle. She was confirmed for her first term \nwithout a single dissenting vote.\n  Prior to her 4 years on the Commission, Commissioner Svinicki spent \nmore than two decades in public service working on nuclear safety \nissues in the Senate, at the Department of Energy, and with the \nWisconsin Public Utilities Commission. A nuclear engineer, she is one \nof the world's foremost authorities on nuclear safety and nuclear \npower, and a great asset to the Commission.\n  Last year Commissioner Svinicki had the courage to stand up and blow \nthe whistle on a sitting NRC Chairman, Gregory Jaczko, for bullying \nsubordinates.\n  According to an Associated Press story from December:\n\n       The commissioners told Congress [that] women at the NRC \n     felt particularly intimidated by Jaczko. Commissioner William \n     Magwood--\n\n  Who is a Democrat, by the way--\n\n     told the oversight panel that Jaczko had bullied and \n     belittled at least three female staff members, one of whom \n     told Magwood she was ``humiliated'' by what Magwood called a \n     raging verbal assault.\n\n  This is the Democratic Commissioner on NRC, and here is an excerpt \nfrom the inspector general's report:\n\n       ``Several current and former Commission staff members,'' it \n     says, ``said the Chairman's behavior caused an intimidating \n     work environment. A former Chairman told OIG that the \n     Chairman often yelled at people and [that] his tactics had a \n     negative effect on people. He described the behavior as \n     ruling by intimidation.''\n\n  Commissioner Svinicki stood up to this guy, who somehow managed to \navoid being fired in the wake of all of these revelations, in an effort \nto preserve the integrity of the agency and to protect the career \nstaffers who were the subject of the Chairman's tactics. Now, for some \nmysterious reason, she is being held up for renomination.\n  The FBI completed its background check on Commissioner Svinicki 15 \nmonths ago. Her ethics agreement was approved around the same time. She \nhas been ready to go for more than a year. There is no legitimate \nreason for Commissioner Svinicki not to have been renominated and \nreconfirmed by now. Any further delay is unacceptable.\n  If Commissioner Svinicki isn't renominated by June 30, NRC will lose \none of its finest members, the Commission's work will be impaired, and \nwe will be forced to conclude that the reason is related to her \nhonorable actions as a whistleblower--that she is being held up in \nretaliation for speaking up against a rogue Chairman who bullies his \nsubordinates.\n  There is a reason Congress charged five Commissioners with the \nresponsibility to protect public health and safety. Ensuring the safety \nof our Nation's nuclear powerplants is serious business. So this \nmorning I am calling on the White House to renominate Commissioner \nSvinicki today to ensure that this well-qualified and widely respected \nwoman remains in place for another term.\n  The public is best served by a commission that is fully functional. \nThere should be no question in anyone's mind that it will be fully \nfunctional. We cannot wait any longer for this nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/18/senate-section/article/S2457-2", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Attackers go after our intellectual \nproperty, our national security, and our critical infrastructure. The \nMcAfee Night Dragon Report, for example, concluded that foreign \nintruders had access to major oil, energy, and petrochemical companies' \ncomputer networks for at least 2 years and likely as many as 4 years. \nGovernment reports are equally sobering, though usually classified.\n  One that is not classified is the Department of Homeland Security \nreport recently that attacks on computer systems that control critical \ninfrastructure, factories, and databases increased almost eightfold in \njust the last 12 months. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta has warned \nthat ``the next Pearl Harbor we confront could very well be a cyber \nattack.''\n  Majority Leader Reid has recognized the severity of this national and \neconomic security threat and intends to bring cybersecurity legislation \nto the Senate floor soon. We recognize too the hard work of Chairman \nLieberman and Ranking Member Collins of the Homeland Security \nCommittee, as well as Chairman Feinstein of the Intelligence Committee, \nand Senator Rockefeller of the Commerce Committee. The Cybersecurity \nAct of 2012, which they introduced--and I am proud to cosponsor--is a \ngood start toward addressing the many cybersecurity threats that face \nthis Nation.\n  The SECURE IT Act, introduced by Senator McCain and seven colleagues, \nseeks to improve the sharing of cybersecurity threat information; the \nFederal Information Security Management Act, or FISMA, which governs \ncybersecurity at Federal agencies; and our cyber research and \ndevelopment. There is considerable overlap between these bills, which \nsignals that the Senate could legislate on cybersecurity in a \nbipartisan and serious manner.\n  Support for cybersecurity legislation is also bicameral. The \nCybersecurity Task Force constituted by House Republicans produced \nrecommendations that share key points with our Cybersecurity Act of \n2012. Numerous bills are working their way through the House on a \nbipartisan basis. Central to that work in the House are the \ncontributions of Rhode Island Congressman Jim Langevin. His leadership \nis a major reason the House has come to recognize the dangerous \nvulnerabilities within our critical infrastructure and that we now \nstand on the verge of a breakthrough in improving the security of those \nnetworks.\n\n  When a test at the Idaho National Labs showed hackers could blow up a \npower generator from thousands of miles away, Congressman Langevin \nbrought the owners and operators of our electric grid before Congress \nand investigated their promise the issue was being addressed. When he \nfound out that wasn't true, he called them out. His subsequent work as \na cochair of the Center for Strategic and International Study \nCommission on Cybersecurity, along with other experts from within and \noutside of government, resulted in many of the recommendations \nreflected in our legislation. Then, in 2010, Congressman Langevin \npassed a landmark cybersecurity amendment in the House that provided a \nlegislative template for setting standards for critical infrastructure. \nI thank Jim Langevin, my colleague from Rhode Island, for his \nrelentless commitment to keeping America safe in cyberspace.\n  I am here this morning to stress four points I believe we must keep \nin mind as we take up cybersecurity legislation. The first is that \ncybersecurity legislation should improve the public's limited awareness \nof current cybersecurity threats and the harm those threats present to \nour national security economy and privacy. The public, for years, has \nbeen kept in the dark, and that is wrong.\n  The corporate sector systematically underreports cyber attacks for \nfear of scaring customers, for fear of encouraging competitors or for \nfear of triggering regulatory review. I was pleased the Securities and \nExchange Commission, after prompting by Senator Rockefeller and myself \nand others, issued guidance for when registered companies must disclose \nbreach information.\n  The government itself systematically underreports cyber attacks \nbecause it overclassifies information about cyber attacks on government \nsystems. Jim Lewis of the Center for Strategic and International \nStudies, for example, recently explained that cybersecurity has a \nunique problem in that some of the most reliable data is classified. It \nwas a rare exception when a November 2011 report by the Office of the \nNational Counterintelligence Executive identified China and Russia as \nresponsible for the systematic theft of American intellectual property \nthrough cyber espionage. The legislation that we pass must shed light \non the scale and severity of the cyber threat to the American public.\n  In that vein, I am pleased the Cybersecurity Act of 2012 includes \nprovisions from the Cybersecurity Public Awareness Act, S. 813, which I \nintroduced with Senator Kyl. These provisions will at least begin to \nimprove the public's awareness of the current cyber threat environment \nwe face.\n  Second, we must recognize that inadequate awareness and inadequate \nprotection against cyber risks is endemic among our largest \ncorporations. Part of the problem is a gulf in cybersecurity awareness \nbetween corporate chief information officers and corporate CEOs. \nCarnegie Mellon's CyLab recently reported:\n\n       Boards and senior management still are not exercising \n     appropriate governance over the privacy and security of their \n     digital assets . . . These findings are consistent with the \n     complaints by CISO/CSOs that they cannot get the attention of \n     their senior management and boards and their budgets are \n     inadequate . . . There is still an apparent disconnect.\n\n  Nor is this an area in which the market can be trusted to work. As \nformer Bush Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff has \nexplained:\n\n       The marketplace is likely to fail in allocating the correct \n     amount of investment to manage risk across the breadth of the \n     networks on which our society relies.\n\n  This is not an area where corporations manage adequately on their \nown. FBI Director Robert Mueller recently explained:\n\n       There are only two types of companies: those that have been \n     hacked and those that will be.\n\n  Even more trenchant, the McAfee report on the ``Shady RAT'' attacks \nsimilarly stated it is possible to divide ``the entire set of Fortune \nGlobal 2,000 firms into two categories: those that know they've been \ncompromised and those that don't yet know.''\n  Kevin Mandia of the leading security firm Mandiant has explained:\n\n       [I]n over 90 percent of the cases we have responded to, \n     government notification was required to alert the company \n     that a security breach was underway. In our last 50 \n     incidents, 48 of the victim companies learned they were \n     breached from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the \n     Department of Defense or some other third party.\n\n  The National Cybersecurity Investigation Joint Task Force, led by the \nFBI, told me the same thing: more than 90 percent of the time the \ncorporate victim had no idea.\n  What we can conclude from this is that improved sharing of \ncybersecurity threat information is necessary but is not sufficient to \nprotect our Nation's cybersecurity. Even a perfect information-sharing \nprocess will not prevent cyber attacks if the information being shared \nis incomplete. The blindness of most corporations to this threat limits \nthe effectiveness of corporate-to-corporate information sharing. The \nNSA's Defense Industrial Base pilot--the so-called ``DIB'' pilot--\nproved the government can share classified information\n\n[[Page S2459]]\n\nwith trusted corporations, but it revealed significant risks and \nlimitations, particularly if the government were to share its most \nsensitive intelligence information with a broad set of private \ncompanies.\n  The third point I want to make this morning, and perhaps the most \nimportant, is that this legislation on cybersecurity will have failed \nif it does not ensure that our American critical infrastructure has \nadequate cybersecurity. There must be a process for identifying \ncritical infrastructure, establishing appropriate security standards, \nand ensuring that critical infrastructure companies meet the standard.\n  If an attack comes, we must be sure that America's most capable \ndefenses and countermeasures are pre-positioned to defend critical \nAmerican infrastructure. We simply cannot wait until an attack is \nunderway on basic needs and services on which we depend, such as our \nelectric grid, our communications networks, and the servers that \nprocess our financial transactions. So there are two measures here: One \nis that we must have a way to define critical infrastructure so we know \nwhat it is and, just as important from a civil liberties perspective, \nwe know what it isn't. When we identify critical infrastructure on \nwhich our safety and economic and national security depend, we are also \ndefining what does not qualify and where privacy concerns can be much \nmore important than national security concerns. Nobody wants government \nin our chat rooms, e-mails, or social media; everyone gets why \ngovernment should protect the electric grids that bring power to our \nhomes.\n\n  The second is that once we identify our critical infrastructure, we \nneed to find a way for our national security assets to protect that \ncritical infrastructure. Our government has unique capabilities to \nprotect those basics, such as our electric grid.\n  As Kevin Mandia has explained:\n\n     [t]he majority of threat intelligence is currently in the \n     hands of the government.\n\n  Some of this information can be disclosed, but some cannot be, in \norder to protect sensitive sources and methods. This requires us to \nfind other ways for our most sophisticated government capabilities to \nprotect our critical infrastructure. For example, we should think \nseriously about the concept of secure domains and how they can be \ndeployed effectively while protecting civil liberties. I am glad \nsection 804 of the Cybersecurity Act of 2012 takes on that task by \nrequiring expert study of the advantages and disadvantages of \nestablishing secure domains for critical infrastructure.\n  If the business community can identify a workable alternative \napproach, such as a voluntary or opt-in regulatory system, I am willing \nto get to work, but we must not balk at taking on the hard question of \nhow to secure our critical American infrastructure.\n  The last point I want to make today is that Congress, in this bill, \nshould consider the appropriate structure and resources for the \ncybersecurity and cyber crime mission of the Department of Justice, the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation, and law enforcement components of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. We do not do enough to investigate, \nprosecute, and take other appropriate legal action against cyber crime, \ncyber espionage and other cyber threats. Last year's takedown by the \nDepartment of Justice of the Coreflood botnet should be a regular \noccurrence, not a special occurrence. But it will not be--it cannot \nbe--with our current cyber crime resources. The technical, \ninternational, and legal aspects of these investigations are too \ncomplex.\n  I spent 4 years as a United States attorney, I spent 4 years as our \nState's attorney general. These are astonishingly complicated and \ndifficult cases. They are massively resource intensive. So it is time \nfor a fundamental rethinking of cyber law enforcement resources: both \nthe level of resources and the manner in which they are structured. We \nshould be discussing whether cyber crime should have a dedicated \ninvestigatory agency akin to the DEA or ATF or whether existing task \nforce models should be used. These are important questions the \nlegislation has not addressed. Accordingly, I plan to offer a floor \namendment that will require an expert study of our current cyber law \nenforcement resources that can recommend a proper level of funding and \nstructure of forces going forward.\n  Once again, I thank my colleagues for their hard work to date on \ncybersecurity issues. I urge that all of us join together to pass \ncybersecurity legislation into law as soon as possible. Two years ago, \nI said that because of cyber we in the United States are on the losing \nend of the largest transfer of wealth through theft and piracy in the \nhistory of the world. GEN Keith Alexander, who leads the National \nSecurity Agency and U.S. Cyber Command, has reached the same conclusion \nwhen saying recently that cyber theft is ``the greatest transfer of \nwealth in history.'' McAfee likewise has recently evaluated the theft \nof national secrets, source code, designs, and other documents, and \nconcluded that what ``we have witnessed over the past 5 to 6 years has \nbeen nothing short of a historically unprecedented transfer of \nwealth.''\n  We are the losers in that transfer of wealth. We cannot afford to \nwait to address this enormous and ever-growing threat.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                         Postal Service Reform\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, shortly we will be turning to the \nlegislation to reform the Postal Service, and I wanted to take a few \nminutes to talk about a particularly important part of that discussion.\n  In recent years there has been a revolution in how our citizens \nexercise their right to vote. Instead of every American showing up in \nperson, more and more Americans are choosing to vote by mail, using \nabsentee ballots, no-excuse absentee voting or, in the case of my home \nState of Oregon, the entire election is conducted by mail. This \namendment I will be offering and that I am discussing this morning--and \nin which I join Senator Feinstein and other colleagues--is designed to \nprotect the millions of Americans who choose to use the post office to \nexercise their right to vote. This amendment protects those millions of \nAmericans from any kind of postal delay that could disrupt their \nability to ensure their vote is counted.\n  My home State of Oregon has a system in which all ballots are cast by \nmail.\n  In Oregon, if the ballots are not delivered by mail to the county \nelection offices by the deadline on election night, they are not \ncounted. So it is essential to the conduct of fair elections in my home \nState that delivery of ballots cast by mail not be delayed.\n  To prevent the potential threat to our elections from delayed mail \ndelivery, the Wyden-Feinstein amendment would place a moratorium on the \nclosure of postal facilities until November 13, 2012, in States that \nvote by mail or allow any voter to vote no-excuse absentee. It would \nalso require the Postal Service to notify election officials of \nclosings and consolidations and require the Postal Service to study the \neffect of closing or consolidating a mail processing facility on the \nability of the affected community to vote by mail.\n  My home State consistently has high voter turnout. Vote by mail has \nbeen successful and it is popular. In my State, more than 85 percent of \nregistered voters participated in the 2008 elections, but this kind of \napproach to voting is popular not just in my home State of Oregon. In \nthe 2008 election, 89 percent of ballots in Washington State were cast \nby mail, as well as 64 percent of those in Colorado, over 50 percent in \nArizona, and it was nearly that high a percentage in California.\n  In my home State, the Postal Service is a place where people send and \nreceive packages and mail order prescriptions, and it is also a place \nthat community residents come together. It seems to me that if we are \ngoing to close and consolidate postal facilities, not only will it harm \nthe delivery of ballots and campaign-related mail to voters and return \nof the ballots to election officials, but it also will zap much of what \nis vital to rural America; that is, the opportunity to come and gather \nin one place.\n  Jordan Valley, located in beautiful eastern Oregon on the Nevada \nborder, is 457 miles from Portland. With the proposed consolidations, \nthe nearest regional processing center would literally be almost 500 \nmiles away. If the U.S. Postal Service goes ahead with their proposed \nclosures and consolidations, then a ballot cast in Jordan Valley could \ntravel approximately 1,000\n\n[[Page S2460]]\n\nmiles before it reaches the hands of election officials. This is \nunacceptable for constituents who vote in the far corners--the rural \ncorners--of my State.\n  Cuts to the Postal Service mean that ballots mailed in the final days \nbefore an election may not get to election officials in time to be \ncounted. Ballots sent the weekend before a Tuesday vote may not get \ninto the hands of election officials by the present-day deadline of \nelection day. Closing and consolidating postal facilities \ndisproportionately harms the ability of rural residents to have their \nvotes counted.\n  These issues raise important questions: Is closing postal facilities \nin States that primarily vote by mail a responsible approach? For me \nand many of my constituents and the millions of Americans who have \nchosen to vote in this fashion, the resounding answer is, no, this is \nnot a responsible approach. Closing processing facilities and \npotentially impacting the delivery of ballots in a general election is \na risk not worth it. Closing postal facilities will have unintended and \nunforeseen consequences on the impact of elections.\n  That is why this amendment would place a moratorium until November \n13, 2012, in States that conduct all their elections by mail or permit \nno-excuse absentee voting to ensure that elections are fair. No-excuse \nvoting, of course, allows any voter to vote absentee without having to \noffer additional reasons for their making that choice. Twenty-seven \nStates allow no-excuse absentee voting. So not only will the \nconstituents that I and Senator Merkley and Senator Feinstein and \nSenator Boxer represent in Oregon and California be affected by this \namendment, but States such as Nevada, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, \nKansas, Maine, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, \nOklahoma, Utah, Wisconsin, and Wyoming are part of the many states in \nthis country that this amendment would protect.\n  In September of 2011, election officials in California were doing \ntheir jobs and preparing and mailing sample ballots for a September \nelection in an isolated community in northern California. Unaware that \nthe small post office that serves the area was closing on October 1, \nthe sample ballots were not immediately returned so they had no reason \nto believe the voters had not received them. But as ballots slowly \ntrickled in, election officials grew a bit suspicious, and they learned \nmany voters had just received their sample ballot more than 3 weeks \nafter it was mailed, and many had not received their official ballot \nyet. Election officials received no more than two or three a day \nliterally for the first week.\n  Voters explained to officials there was so much confusion over the \nclosure of the post office that they were much more concerned about \nreceiving their other first-class mail--bills and prescriptions--than \ntheir ballots and hadn't been looking for them. They were told the \ncontents of their post office box were being directed to the Arcata \nPost Office. But when they went to Arcata to retrieve it, there was no \nmail for them in Arcata. For 18 days, they didn't receive any mail at \nall.\n  Only 15 days before the election, the staff attempted several times \nto contact the Arcata Post Office but could only leave a message for \nthe postmaster who was not returning their calls. Folks then contacted \nfriends at a local central processing center in yet another town, \nEureka, CA, who were able to give a direct line to the Arcata \npostmaster.\n  At first, the postmaster indicated nothing was wrong, but the \nresidents, in his terms, were ``confused about the closure of their \npost office.'' After checking the number of ballots that had been \nreturned from the precincts, election officials decided to resend all \nthose ballots. The postmaster finally provided election officials with \nthe change of address list for all residents, and they were able to \ncorrect the database, cancel the ballots that had not yet been \nreceived, and remail ballots to all voters who had not yet returned \ntheir ballots.\n  Obviously, the bottom line is clear. The closure of small post \noffices requires more preparation and sharing of information with the \nresidents of an impacted area as well as agencies and businesses that \nrely on the post office to communicate with their customers. Had \nelection officials not had a contact in that area, they may not have \nbecome aware of the problem until it was too late to resend the \nballots.\n\n  Under the amendment I will be offering later with Senator Feinstein, \nthe Postal Service would be required to notify election officials of \nclosings and consolidations to prevent the kind of calamitous repeat of \nwhat I have described happened in a recent local election in \nCalifornia. Additionally, the amendment would require the Postal \nService to study the effect of closing or consolidating a mail \nprocessing facility on the ability of the affected community to vote by \nmail and the ability of the Postal Service to deliver ballots on time \nin accordance with applicable State law.\n  Disenfranchising voters or discouraging the millions of Americans who \nnow have chosen this new approach to voting is not a wise or prudent \nstep for the Senate to take at this time. Placing a moratorium until \nafter the elections will ensure that what is done in the Senate does \nnot negatively impact voting in Oregon, California or the scores of \nother States that make extensive use of mail ballots in their \nelections.\n  I hope it will be possible for us to win bipartisan support for the \nproposition that ensuring the highest level of voting participation in \nour country is fundamental to our democracy. I hope my colleagues will \nsupport the amendment I intend to offer later with my colleague and \nfriend from California, Senator Feinstein, to protect the millions of \nAmericans who choose to vote by mail.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                          Ten Years Ago Today\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I am here to point out that 10 years \nago this very day, this Senate decided not to drill for more oil in the \nUnited States, where we know oil exists. At that time, the argument \nthat was used was why drill because it was going to take many years to \nget it online. The Senate bought the argument we shouldn't drill \nbecause it was going to take too long.\n  Today, we think about more opportunities to drill for oil in the \nUnited States.\n  I wish to point out that the very same arguments that were used 10 \nyears ago are being used today: If we drill today, we might not get \nsome of that oil online for several years down the road. We want to be \nthinking about the future, as we should have thought about the future \nin 2002, 10 years ago, when we decided not to drill.\n  Around the country, American consumers are paying near-record prices \nfor gasoline at the pump. The current average price for gasoline is \nnear $3.90. Since January 2009, the average price of a gallon of \nregular gasoline has more than doubled. In 2011, consumers spent a \ngreater percentage of their household income on gasoline than any year \nsince 1981, when we thought 90 cents for a gallon of gas was a lot of \nmoney.\n  Affordable energy is a major economic issue. Paying nearly $4 for gas \nacts as a hidden tax and results in people having less money to spend \non other things. Rising energy prices also increase the cost of doing \nbusiness for job creators, taking away dollars that otherwise could go \nto hiring workers. We should be doing everything possible to prevent \nthese high energy prices today or tomorrow.\n  The Senate had an opportunity 10 years ago today to take action to \nincrease our domestic oil supply. Unfortunately, the Senate missed that \nopportunity. It missed an opportunity for lower prices today and \nimporting something less than the $830 million we spend every day to \nimport oil. We need to keep that money in this country.\n  Ten years ago today, the Senate considered an amendment offered by \nthen-Senator Frank Murkowski--father to present Senator Lisa \nMurkowski--to open a tiny portion of the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge to oil and gas development. A vote on the cloture motion was \nrejected by the Democratic majority in the Senate on April 18, 2002.\n  During that debate, opponents argued that opening ANWR to development \nwould never supply more than 2\n\n[[Page S2461]]\n\npercent of our Nation's oil demands. They opposed it based on the \nbelief that opening ANWR wouldn't address the real problems; namely, \nour dependence upon fossil fuels. They said we needed to work toward a \ncomprehensive approach.\n  Opening ANWR was also portrayed as a distraction from the real \nsolutions, such as conservation, alternative and renewable energy, and \nless environmentally sensitive fossil energy development. Some even \nargued that fully inflated or low friction tires should be a larger \npart of our national energy policy.\n  I recognize the need for a comprehensive, balanced national energy \npolicy. I truly believe in an all-of-the-above approach that includes \nconservation, alternative and renewable energy, nuclear power, and oil \nand gas development.\n  But the fact remains we were talking about these policies as \nsolutions to our energy problems in 2002. Yet gas prices are still near \n$4 a gallon.\n  I listened to dozens of speakers in the Senate that day who argued \nagainst opening ANWR because it wouldn't address our near-term energy \nneeds. They said it would take nearly 10 years to get that oil to the \nconsumers. Ten years ago we were told to forget about opening ANWR \nbecause development was too far down the road to impact our energy \nsupply and energy security.\n  Here are a few quotes from my Democratic colleagues during the debate \nin April 2002. I am not going to use their names. But this Democratic \nSenator said:\n\n       I oppose the proposal to drill in the Arctic National \n     Wildlife Refuge. Drilling in ANWR will not increase energy \n     independence, even if we started drilling tomorrow, the first \n     barrel of crude oil would not make it to our market for at \n     least ten years. So it would not affect our current energy \n     needs.\n\n  Another Democratic Senator said--and these Senators are still here \ntoday:\n\n       The oil exploration in ANWR will not actually start \n     producing oil for as many as 10 years. Exploring and drilling \n     for oil is not forward thinking.\n\n  Another Democratic Senator said this:\n\n       That oil would not be available for 10 years. This means \n     drilling in ANWR would not provide any immediate energy \n     relief for American families.\n\n  Another Democratic Senator said:\n\n       Developing ANWR is simply not a necessary component of a \n     progressive energy policy for this country. For a period \n     starting about 2012--\n\n  That is this year, understand; he was looking ahead 10 years--\n\n       For a period starting at about 2012, we would see an \n     increase of domestic production under ANWR, if ANWR was open \n     to development. So development would not address the near-\n     term prices or shortages with which people are faced.\n\n  Ten years down the road, here we are, but if we drilled back then we \nwould have this oil on line and we would not be spending $830 million \nevery day to import oil.\n  Another Senator said this:\n\n       When my colleagues come to the floor of the Senate and \n     suggest to us that the crisis in the Middle East is a reason \n     to drill in ANWR, that is a misleading argument because no \n     oil will flow from ANWR until from 7 to 10 years from now.\n       That means if you open the refuge today, you are not going \n     to see oil until about 2012, maybe a couple of years earlier.\n\n  You see, a decision made in 2002--people were looking ahead 10 years \nand saying it was not going to make much difference, but 2012 is here \nand we could have been using that oil.\n  Another Senator said:\n\n       Oil extracted from the wildlife refuge would not reach \n     refineries for 7 to 10 years.\n\n  That is the end of my quotes of several Democratic Senators who are \nnow serving. If they are using the same argument now, are they going to \nbe smart enough to look ahead to 2022 when maybe we could start using \nthe oil we would start drilling for today? The defeat of the Murkowski \namendment back in 2002 was then enormously shortsighted. If we had \nvoted to open ANWR 10 years ago, that oil would be driving down the \nprice at the pump for consumers today. You know the rule of economics; \nif you increase supply, you reduce price. And we would at least be \nkeeping the money in the United States instead of spending $830 million \nevery day to import oil. Time after time, opponents of domestic oil \nproduction have argued that because it will not lower prices at the \npump today it is not worth doing. You know from the debate of 2002 that \nis a bunch of hogwash. Does anybody wonder if the American people wish \nthat the Senate had opened ANWR 10 years ago?\n  It is past time to take action to ramp up domestic production of \ntraditional energy, energy we can harvest in this country instead of \nimporting it and paying $830 million to import it. Greater domestic \nenergy production would increase supply and help to lower prices. It \nwould create American jobs.\n  President Obama continues to push policies that contribute to higher \ngas prices, including restricting access to Federal lands and \npermitting delays, regulatory threats to refiners, and his decision to \ndeny Keystone XL. He says he is for ``all of the above,'' but when you \nlook at that list, he is for ``none of the above.'' By limiting \ndomestic energy production we have less supply and higher prices.\n  The Obama administration has made things worse by restricting access \nto domestic energy sources. The President's record contradicts his \nremarks that he is for an ``all of the above'' strategy. His policies \nhave prevented more oil production in the United States and resulted in \nhigher prices, lost opportunities for jobs creation, less energy \nsecurity, and shipping out of the country 830 million of our dollars \nthat could be used in this country and kept in this country, money we \nare spending to import oil.\n  President Obama's denying of the Keystone XL Pipeline inhibits \nenergy-related development that could create 20,000 jobs. Greater \ndomestic energy production would increase supply and help to lower \nprices, and it would create American jobs.\n  It is time to take action. Denying ANWR development 10 years ago was \na mistake, a mistake I hope we learn a lesson from. The Senate missed \nan opportunity 10 years ago that would have brought gas price relief \nand more supply, keeping more money in this country, creating jobs in \nthis country right now. We should not make the same mistake again. You \ncannot repeat that statement too often. We should not make the same \nmistake again. We should be looking ahead 10 years, as they were doing \nin 2002, but they were using it as an excuse to do nothing. So don't \never tell me don't drill today because it will not come on line until \n10 years from now. That is not a very wise thing to say to me, after \nyou said that 10 years ago. We should have learned the lesson.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                             Gulf Oilspill\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I come to the floor to recognize a \nsolemn occasion. In two days, on Friday, April 20, it will be the 2-\nyear anniversary of the Deepwater Horizon explosion. I want to pause at \nthis moment of anniversary, 2 years, and offer a few thoughts about \nwhat was clearly a very significant episode and challenge for our whole \ncountry, but particularly for my State of Louisiana and for the gulf \ncoast.\n  First of all, I want to start where I think we should always start in \ndiscussing and considering this event, and that is the loss of 11 \nlives. Eleven men were killed in that explosion. Again, we need to \npause, reflect, pray, and offer prayerful support to them and their \nfamilies. Those 11 victims were Donald Clark, Stephen Curtis, Aaron \nDale Burkeen, Adam Wiese, Roy Kemp, Jason Anderson, Gordon Jones, Blair \nManuel, Dewey Revette, Karl Dale Kleppinger, Jr., and Shane Roshto.\n  I ask unanimous consent that here on the Senate floor we pause for a \nfew seconds in silent, prayerful thought and consideration of those 11 \nmen and their families.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (Moment of silence.)\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Thank you, Madam President. The tragedy, of course, \nstarted there with those 11 lives lost and we must never forget that, \nincluding as we redouble our efforts to ensure safety in those sorts of \ndrilling environments in the future.\n\n  Of course, the second big impact was on the environment, particularly \nthe gulf environment where I live, in Louisiana--4.9 million barrels of \noil were discharged during the spill. That was\n\n[[Page S2462]]\n\nabout 50,000 barrels a day, every day for 3 months; 320 miles of \nLouisiana coastline were oiled. That was a little over half of the \ntotal coastline on the gulf that was oiled--600 miles. Over 86,000 \nsquare miles of waters were closed to fishing; about 36 percent of \nFederal waters in the gulf were closed.\n  We did that on a very aggressive, proactive basis to make sure we \navoided any contaminated seafood ever reaching a store shelf, ever \nreaching a restaurant. The good news is we accomplished that. Through \nthat proactive closing, not a single piece of contaminated seafood ever \nreached a store shelf or ever reached a restaurant customer. That was \nquite an accomplishment.\n  Lots of dead animals were collected--6,800; 6,100 birds and also \nother sea turtles and dolphins. It was the biggest ever in American \nhistory, a huge environmental disaster.\n  Two years later, as we pause and look at the environmental effect of \nthat, frankly, there is good news and bad news--or at least good news \nand continuing challenges. The good news is I don't think anyone would \nhave predicted that the gulf would rebound to where it is today. Mother \nNature has proved again to be amazingly resilient. That is good news. \nAt the time there were all sorts of pretty dire predictions of huge \ndead zones covering half the gulf. That has certainly not materialized. \nSo Mother Nature has proved amazingly resilient. But I don't want to \ntrivialize continuing challenges, continuing work. There is continuing \nenvironmental work, I understand core projects that are ongoing that \nare very important. First is the NRDA process, under Federal law, the \nNatural Resource Damage Assessment. That is the process under Federal \nlaw by which all stakeholders help assess the damage to the environment \nso that the folks guilty of this horrendous incident pay for those \ndamages, pay the State, pay the Federal Government, pay others who will \nwork to restore the environment.\n  That NRDA process is ongoing. It is a multiyear process. But there is \nsome positive result from that process already. Step one of the process \nwas a settlement with BP for an upfront payment of about $1 billion.\n  Just today, two specific projects in Louisiana were announced as a \ndirect result of that first--not last but first--upfront payment of $1 \nbillion. There is the Lake Hermitage Marsh Creation Project in \nPlaquemines Parish. That will create approximately 104 acres of \nbrackish marsh from beneficial use of dredge material. That is being \nannounced today. And the Louisiana Oyster Culture Project--that is the \nplacement of oyster cultch onto about 850 acres of public oyster seed \ngrounds throughout coastal Louisiana. So those projects are the start \nof that NRDA project coming to fruition.\n  Then the second important work that is ongoing that involves all of \nus here in the Senate directly is the need to pass the RESTORE Act \nthrough the highway reauthorization bill, the transportation \nreauthorization bill.\n  The RESTORE Act language would dedicate 80 percent of the Clean Water \nAct fines related to this disaster to gulf coast restoration. I thank \nall of my colleagues again for an enormously positive, overwhelmingly \npositive, bipartisan vote to attach that RESTORE Act language to the \nSenate highway bill. I urge my House colleagues, including House \nconservatives, to pass a House version of the highway bill today. That \nis important for our country, for highway infrastructure, and it is \nimportant because it is a vehicle for this RESTORE Act.\n  A third and final category I want to touch on that is not as \npositive, frankly, as the environmental rebound is the impact of all of \nthis and the related moratorium on drilling to our economy on the gulf \ncoast and energy production. Immediately after the disaster, very soon \nthereafter, President Obama announced a complete moratorium on activity \nin the gulf on new drilling. That moratorium lasted several months. I \nthink that was a bad mistake, an overreaction to the disaster. I think \nthat has been borne out in several ways, including the panel of experts \nthat the President got together. Their report, we now know, was \nactually doctored and edited at the White House to make it seem like \nthose true experts supported a full moratorium, when we know directly \nfrom them that they did not.\n  This moratorium went in place anyway and it created a lot of \nadditional economic harm and hurt to a lot of gulf coast residents and \nworkers that was unnecessary. Of course we needed to pause and get new \nprocedures and some new safety regulations in place, of course we \nneeded to learn the lessons of the disaster and incorporate those into \npractices, but we did not need an all-out moratorium for months. And we \ndo not need a continuing slowdown that continues to this day. An \nanalogy I have often used is when we have a horrible disaster such as \nan airplane crash, we do not ground every plane for months after such \nan incident. We allow the industry and that important travel and \ncommercial activity to continue as we immediately learn the lessons of \nthe disaster and incorporate it into safety proceedings.\n\n  Well, unfortunately, my point of view did not hold sway at the White \nHouse. We had this complete, formal moratorium which lasted into \nOctober 2010. But when that formal, complete moratorium was lifted, it \ndidn't just end there. For months and months after that, we had a de \nfacto moratorium, permits which were not happening. There was only a \ntrickle of permits. Now, even though permitting has increased somewhat, \nwe have a dramatic permit slowdown and a slowdown of activity in the \ngulf. Now more than ever, our country and our citizens cannot afford \nthat. The price at the gas pump is about $4 a gallon. It has more than \ndoubled during President Obama's tenure. We cannot afford this \navoidable slowdown and decrease in important domestic energy activity.\n  Again, a lot of folks around the country don't realize it, but \npermitting in the gulf is still way below pre-BP levels. It is 40 \npercent below pre-BP levels. Now, again, we need to learn and we have \nlearned the lessons of the BP disaster. We need to incorporate those \ninto our regulatory policy, and we have. But we cannot afford a permit \nslowdown of more than 40 percent since before the BP disaster. Because \nof that and because of other factors, energy production is down on \nFederal property and all oil production was down about 14 percent in \nthe last year. Federal offshore production is down about 17 percent. So \nthat is some of the most lasting negative economic impact from the \ndisaster. The Obama administration's wrongheaded reaction to it and the \nlingering policy on energy production is something we cannot afford as \nthe gulf region, we cannot afford as a country, and we can afford less \nthan ever now with the price at the pump.\n  Again, I hope we do learn the lessons of this disaster. I hope we \ncontinue to ensure that those safety and other lessons are built into \nour regulatory framework and best practices in the industry. I think \nthat has largely been done, and that work continues. I also hope we \nhonor the lifework of those 11 men who lost their lives, who worked \nhard every day in that industry producing good American energy by not \nonly allowing that work to happen safely but allowing that work to \nhappen and allowing American citizens to benefit from that work.\n  The United States is the single most energy-rich country in the \nworld, bar none. For instance, we are far richer than any Middle \nEastern country, such as Saudi Arabia. The problem is that we are the \nonly country in the world that puts well over 90 percent of those \ndomestic resources off limits and says: No, no, no. No you can't do \nthis, and no you can't touch that.\n  We need to build a commonsense American energy policy that says: Yes. \nYes, we can. Yes, we can do it safely, and, yes, we can provide \nAmerican energy for American families and the American economy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/18/senate-section/article/S2462-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2462-S2476]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  GSA\n\n  Mr. HELLER. Madam President, I come to the floor today to highlight \nan issue I fight for every day; that is, jobs in Nevada. In Nevada, \nhaving a strong tourism industry means more jobs in the State. Las \nVegas, Henderson, Lake Tahoe, and Reno have long been favorite \ndestinations for millions of visitors both domestically and, more \nincreasingly, internationally. The entire\n\n[[Page S2463]]\n\nsouthern Nevada economy is heavily dependent on the hotel, gaming, and \nconvention industry, which employs over one-quarter of the region's \nlabor force. Plain and simple, tourism is the lifeblood for business \nand job creation in Nevada.\n  Like many taxpayers, I was shocked and disappointed to read the GSA \ninspector general's report that found inappropriate spending at the \n2010 Western Regions Conference that was held in Nevada. This \nconference was excessive, wasteful, and it completely ignored Federal \nprocurement laws and internal GSA policy on conference spending.\n  I believe it is appropriate for Congress to exercise its oversight \nauthority on GSA to look into the agency's practices and provide \ncorrective oversight to ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent wisely \nby this administration. However, I want to be clear: This is not an \nissue about location, this is the result of poor decisionmaking and \nleadership by the GSA. Las Vegas is one of the greatest locations in \nthe world for a conference, a meeting, or a vacation. With over 148,000 \nhotel rooms and 10.5 million square feet of meeting and exhibit space \ncitywide, it is ideally suited to host companies and organizations both \nlarge and small. In fact, this past January Las Vegas hosted the \nConsumer Electronics Show, which had more people attend than the Iowa \ncaucuses. I fully agree that it was inappropriate for the GSA to waste \ntaxpayer dollars, but it is not inappropriate to come to Las Vegas for \nconventions and meetings.\n  The actions of GSA should not reflect negatively on Las Vegas, and I \nam asking all of my colleagues to be mindful of that as they conduct \ntheir investigations. The viability of the economy in Nevada is \ndependent upon the volume of visitors to our State. Last year nearly 39 \nmillion visitors came to Las Vegas alone. These visitors came because \nLas Vegas continues its reign as the No. 1 trade show and convention \ndestination in North America. Las Vegas hosts thousands of meetings and \nconventions annually and generates billions in revenue.\n  It is no secret that Washington politicians and this administration \nhave had a negative impact on the Las Vegas economy due to their \ncomments issued publicly. For example, in 2009 attendance at \nconventions and meetings in Las Vegas fell by 13.6 percent. The \nfollowing year attendance fell by another 7.2 percent. In total from \n2009 to 2010, Las Vegas lost 1.4 million convention attendees. While I \nrecognize that it is unfair to blame total decline on a few ill-advised \nlines in a speech, there is no doubt that spoken words by politicians \nclearly have an impact on the Las Vegas economy. Las Vegas and the \ngreat State of Nevada should not be political targets because of GSA's \nmisconduct. Las Vegas is an excellent destination for conferences, and \nI am proud of my State's ability to entertain and accommodate \nbusinesses, organizations, and individuals from all over the world.\n  Again, while several congressional committees investigate this issue, \nI would respectfully advise my colleagues that it is not the location \nthat can be blamed for the misuse of taxpayer funds. The convention \nservices my State offers are the best in the world. And no town in \nNevada should be singled out due to poor judgment by the GSA. It is my \nhope that all of my colleagues will focus on the misconduct of the GSA \nand push for a new initiative that spurs growth in the tourist industry \ninstead of blaming Nevada for the mistakes of incompetent government \nbureaucrats.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                             Postal Reform\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I rise today to address an issue that \ngoes to the very heart of our rural communities--our post offices.\n  First, let's set the context. Our Postal Service is facing a \nchallenging and difficult situation, no doubt. Americans' habits with \nfirst-class mail have changed, and there is greater competition for \npackages with groups such as FedEx and UPS. But perhaps the biggest \nwound to the post office's bottom line is one that Congress imposed: a \n$5.5 billion yearly financing of health care costs 75 years into the \nfuture. That is health care costs not just for folks who aren't yet \nemployed with the post office but for future employees who have not yet \nbeen born. So, yes, the post office system must restructure, and it \nshould start with Congress reversing the $5.5 billion yearly \nrequirement for advanced yearly health care payments.\n  Let's go to the other end of the spectrum, which absolutely does not \nmake sense, and that is to close our rural post offices. In a rural \ntown, the post office is the only place where nearby residents can send \nand receive mail. But it is more than that: It is a shipping center for \nthe small businesses of the communities. It is the pharmacy for seniors \nand others who need medicines through the mail. It is the community \ncenter where folks gather and exchange information. In short, it is the \nvery heart of our rural communities.\n  Let's start by examining the critical role of rural post offices on \nsmall businesses. Virtually every small town is home to a host of small \nbusinesses that take orders through the mail and ship their products \nthrough the mail. What would happen to the efficiency of a small \nbusiness if it had to drive an additional 50 miles per day in order to \npick up orders and mail products? Well, quite obviously, it would \ndestroy their efficiency, and they would think about shutting down or \nthey would think about moving.\n  What would happen to the profit margin of a small business if they \nhad to spend three or four times more on gas--very expensive gas, as we \nall know? Obviously, it would do a lot of damage to their bottom line \nand, again, they would think about shutting down or moving.\n  What would the impact be to that small community of the small \nbusinesses shutting down and moving? Well, it would do enormous damage. \nI think no one would dispute that. So we need to be clear that when we \nare talking about shutting down rural post offices that are many miles \nfrom the next possible opportunity to receive orders and ship products, \nwe are talking about destroying the economic heart of our small towns. \nIt is economic havoc, and it is unacceptable.\n  Here is the irony. Folks come to the floor of the Senate and talk \nabout economic development. They talk about creating jobs. They talk \nabout how small businesses are the job factory. And they are right on \nevery single point. So if there were no post office in a small \ncommunity, the very first thing we would do for economic development is \nto create one so the small businesses can pick up their orders and ship \ntheir products. So how is it possible we are considering a bill that is \ngoing to shut down these rural post offices that are so essential to \nsmall businesses across rural America?\n  Another powerful role of rural post offices is to deliver critical \nmedicine to America's seniors. What happens if seniors cannot receive \ntheir medicines through the mail? One of my colleagues glibly said: \nWell, of course, they get it from FedEx.\n  Well, I beg to differ because FedEx uses the postal system to deliver \nmedicines the last mile and to deliver packages the last mile. So, no; \nthey simply can't get their medicines through FedEx. Now they are \ndriving roundtrip 50 miles, sometimes on impassable roads, in order to \nget critical medicines? Well, they will start thinking about moving.\n  Then there is the fact that these post offices are the places where \ncitizens gather, where they exchange information, where they find out \nwhat is going on. Indeed, sometimes even the last small store has \nclosed in these communities of 200 or 300 families, so then it is the \npost office that is the heart of communication. So if we take away the \nsmall business, we take away the seniors, we take away the \ncommunication hub, and we do enormous damage. Why is that bill being \nconsidered with this clause on the floor of the Senate? We must change \nthat.\n  That is why a number of us are putting forward an amendment to say, \nno;\n\n[[Page S2464]]\n\nthis is absolutely wrong--wrong on economic development, wrong on \nservice to our senior citizens, and wrong in understanding the cultural \nheart of our rural communities.\n  I am going to focus on some comments from two communities in Oregon--\ntwo that are on the list of 41 post offices the Postmaster General said \nwere slated for possible consideration for closing. This is a picture \nof the Tiller Post Office. It is 16 miles from the next nearest post \noffice. Now, imagine being 5 miles from Tiller or 10 miles from Tiller \nand another 16 miles from the next post office. Now we are talking \nabout 40 to 50 miles roundtrip every single day to pick up orders, ship \nproducts, and get medicines. It doesn't make sense.\n  Here is a letter from Diana Farris, a former postmaster in Tiller. \nShe writes:\n\n       Tiller is one such community, where in many ways, time \n     stands still and new technology is beyond their grasp. In \n     Tiller, cellular phone service is unavailable. DSL and cable \n     internet service are unavailable, satellite service is \n     overpriced with the majority of residents unable to afford it \n     and there is no Wi-Fi access in the area.\n\n  Diana continues:\n\n       Dial up Internet is available (when the poorly maintained \n     telephone service is operational) at top speeds of \n     approximately 24 to 26k, so slow that many websites, \n     including USPS--\n\n  That is the U.S. Postal Service--\n\n       time out before you can access needed info.\n\n  She continues:\n\n       The unemployment rate has risen to 13 percent in Douglas \n     County--\n\n  That happens to be the county where I was born in rural southern \nOregon--\n\n       and the lowest gas price in Tiller in the last few months \n     has been $3.95 per gallon. For communities like this, the \n     local Post Office remains the only option.\n\n  That is the end of her letter.\n  In Tiller, the nearest post office, if Tiller were to close, is 16 \nmiles away. It would mean, a roundtrip, a full hour's drive through \nwinding mountain roads, and that is assuming the best weather and road \nconditions.\n  Because of that difficult drive, closing the Tiller Post Office would \nhave a devastating impact on small businesses that rely on the Postal \nService to ship their goods.\n  Here is a letter from Alexandra Petrowski who owns a small business \nwith her husband in Tiller called Singing Falls Mohair. She writes:\n\n       We utilize the services of the U.S. Post Office \n     extensively. I would estimate that between 3 and 5 packages \n     go out from our home to destinations all over the world on a \n     daily basis.\n       We sell our products on Ebay and the business is \n     flourishing! Our growing market is worldwide using the U.S. \n     mail system every day of the week excluding Sundays. In the \n     Ebay marketplace, timely mailing is an integral part of good \n     customer service.\n       As it is, the Tiller Post Office is seven miles from our \n     rural mountain ranch. A closure of the Tiller Post Office \n     would require a 45-mile round trip journey that would \n     severely impact our modest profit margin.\n\n  Alexandra concludes:\n\n       We have been engaged in this business for 30+ years. We are \n     seniors and rely extensively on our cottage industry to \n     sustain our ranch operation. Would closing Tiller's Post \n     Office mean effectively an end to our business? The answer at \n     this point in time is that it would seriously jeopardize our \n     business.\n\n  Now let's turn to Malheur County and the town of Juntura. This is a \npicture of Juntura Post Office, approximately 19 miles, or 20 miles if \nwe round it off, to the nearest additional post office. I have a report \nfrom a citizen of Juntura named Laura Williams. She details the \nnegative impacts that closing Juntura Post Office would have on the \ncommunity. Her report is 42 pages long, an incredibly researched and \ndetailed study of the impact that closing this modest modular post \noffice would have on the rural community of Juntura.\n  Let me read a little bit from her report. She writes:\n\n       Juntura residents will either have to drive to Drewsey, to \n     the west, to mail packages, buy money orders and complete a \n     variety of other transactions, or they'll have to drive east \n     to Harper, 34 miles away, a route that winds through a river \n     canyon dangerously choked with deer during the winter months. \n     In essence, Juntura is between a rock and a hard place.\n\n  She notes in her letter that 25 percent of Juntura's post office \nusers are seniors who would be particularly impacted by these changes \nas they rely heavily on the Postal Service to receive medication and \nmay have difficulty driving the long distances required in the \nparticularly hazardous winter months. There is just one word in bold on \nthe front page of her report, and it sums up the closure of the Juntura \nPost Office. The word is ``disastrous.'' That is how she sums up her \n42-page report. The impact would be disastrous on this town of Juntura, \nthis modest structure open a couple of hours a day, serving the \ncitizens, providing the money orders, providing the stamps, providing \nthe ability to receive orders and to send packages. Every part and role \nit plays she has detailed.\n  These are just a few stories from rural post offices across America, \nbut these comments are far from being isolated. I think we would find \nvery similar comments from every single small town where these towns of \nmodest size depend on these post offices for critical services.\n  I have heard these comments all across Oregon. Two weeks ago I \nvisited Fort Klamath, which is also on the closure list. Residents \nconverged once word went out that I was at the post office. People \nstarted arriving, cars started arriving, people started sharing their \nstories, and I would like to share a couple of them.\n  I want to start with Jeanette and Bob Evans. Bob is a veteran who \nreceives medication through the mail that often needs to be scanned and \nsigned for. They would need to take a 30-mile trip to pick up \nmedications if Fort Klamath Post Office closes. Jeanette and Bob \npointed out that they have a rental business that must follow State law \nrequiring many documents be sent via first-class mail verifying the \ndate of notification. Again, closure would force them to take 30-mile \ntrips to Chiloquin to process this mail correctly.\n  Fort Klamath is a seasonal community, and the post office is the only \nplace during the winter months where the people gather and meet each \nother. Without the post office, friends and neighbors will be traveling \nsnowy, icy roads to get mail 15 miles away.\n  Heidi McLean comes to the Fort Klamath Post Office. She shared these \ncomments. She is a proprietor of the Aspen Inn in Fort Klamath that \noperates seasonally. She uses the post office daily as they send out \npackages to everyone interested in staying with them during the season. \nThey could get by with fewer days or partial days, but they feel very \nstrongly they need access to a local post office. A 30-mile roundtrip \nto Chiloquin would be a serious problem for their small business.\n  That is why, in partnership with a number of my colleagues, I am \noffering an amendment to this bill that would create a 2-year \nmoratorium on the closure of rural post offices and would ensure that \nfuture closures meet certain conditions.\n  Under those conditions, no rural post office could be closed unless \nseniors and persons with disabilities will receive the same or \nsubstantially similar service, including access to prescription \nmedicine through the mail; businesses in the community will not suffer \neconomic loss, and the economic loss to the community resulting from \nthe closure will not exceed the savings the Postal Service obtains by \nclosing the rural post office--and that, by the way, goes to a key \npoint which is, it is much more efficient in terms of the economy to \nhave a common mail service in the heart of a small town than to ask \nhundreds of families to drive 50 or more miles daily to obtain their \nmail. That makes no sense. It is an enormous waste of citizens' time, \nan enormous cost in gasoline, in both cases devastating and \neconomically idiotic.\n  Let any Member come to the floor and defend shutting down a rural \npost office, requiring hundreds of families to drive 50 miles every day \nto get their mail, when for a couple hours a day you could have a post \noffice open, and they can access it and support their small businesses, \nsupport their access to medicines.\n  Let's be clear: This is not a Democratic or Republican issue. This is \nabout critical infrastructure for our small towns. I thank Senator Lee, \nwho has worked on this issue in brainstorming with me, Senator \nMcCaskill, Senator Tester, Senator Baucus, and others, who are all \nworking on this issue.\n  I agree that we do need to reform the Postal Service for the 21st \ncentury.\n\n[[Page S2465]]\n\nConditions have changed, and we need to start by reversing the $5.5 \nbillion advance payment for folks yet unborn for health care payments. \nBut we must not carve the heart out of our rural communities.\n  So for the citizens of Tiller, for the citizens of Juntura, for the \ncitizens of Fort Klamath, and for the citizens of small towns across \nour Nation who depend on these rural post offices, I urge my colleagues \nto support the amendment I and others are offering.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Acting President pro tempore.\n  Madam President, I thank my friend from Oregon for his excellent \nstatement, really. Senator Collins and I want to work with the Senator \nand the other cosponsors of the amendment.\n  I want to say a couple things. The first is, the particular examples \nSenator Merkley gave of the importance of post offices in small towns \nand in rural America make a larger point to those who have said--those \nwithin the Senate and those outside--that in the age of the Internet, \nthe Post Office is a relic we cannot afford, and we have to cut, cut, \ncut, cut.\n  Well, there is no question that because the Postal Service is running \nbig deficits--up to about $13 billion over the last 2 years--there has \nto be economizing and we have to look at a different business model. \nBut to draw an easy conclusion that in the age of the Internet the post \noffice and the Postal Service do not have a role to play and are not \nplaying a role anymore is wrong. I think the Senator's examples, in \nvery personal ways, show that.\n  I said yesterday about three times--and I am going to say it again \ntoday--notwithstanding the drop in mail volume because of the Internet \ntoday, every day the U.S. Postal Service delivers 563 million pieces of \nmail, and a lot of the things the Postal Service is delivering are \ncritically important to people. An awful lot of the prescription drugs \npeople are getting today, in an increasing number, are coming through \nthe mail. It is an example the Senator cited. The same is true for \nsmall businesses with a particular urgency or dependency in small-town \nand rural America.\n  So the Senator makes a good point. That does not mean everything that \nexists has to exist forever. It means we cannot reach an easy \nconclusion that because the Internet exists we do not need the post \noffice or the Postal Service anymore. The fact is, a lot of people \ndepend on the Postal Service every day, and we want to respect that \nreality, which is important to the quality of life people live and to \nthe health of our economy overall.\n  I look forward to working with the Senator on his amendment. The \nexisting bill tried to recognize this problem and contains within it, \nS. 1789, a number of steps that are aimed at ensuring the post offices \nin rural areas and towns are protected and appropriate weight and \nconsideration is given to the importance of such post offices in their \ncommunities.\n  This was done in large part in our committee thanks to a bipartisan \namendment offered by Senators Tester and Moran. That was strengthened, \nwe think, in the substitute amendment we are now considering. It \nincludes retail service standards, standards for possible post office \nclosings, and what the standards would be on appeal to the PRC. But I \ndo not believe this is a perfect document and I accept, therefore, the \nSenator's amendment as a thoughtful attempt to do even better on what \nwe are trying to do. I say to Senator Merkley, I look forward to \nworking with you to see if we can reach common ground on this issue.\n  I will say something else, to put this in a different sort of hard \nnumbers context. The Postmaster General set as a goal at the outset to \ntry to cut about $20 billion from the annual operating expenses of the \nPostal Service. That is a tough number. That is over the next 3 or 4 \nyears. We think this bill--and the Postal Service seems to agree--does \nnot quite do that, but it gets pretty close to it. It certainly is \nsomewhere in the $15 billion to $20 billion range.\n  Some of the elements in the bill that save a lot are the money we \nprovide for incentivizing postal workers to retire early. That is an $8 \nbillion annual savings. There are significant savings in terms of the \nmail processing facilities--in the billions.\n  The reality is, interestingly enough, as I think my friend from \nOregon knows, the amount of money saved if the Postmaster General \nactually closed the 3,700 post offices that he put on the list of \npossible closings is relatively small. It is not nothing, but we are \ntalking about $150 million to $200 million if we closed all of them.\n  So as compared to the billions in the other items we are doing, and \nin relating that number to what the Senator described in the examples \nhe has given and what we heard in our committee, I think this is an \narea in which I personally believe we have to tread cautiously.\n  I thank Senator Merkley for his thoughtful statement. I look forward \nto working with him. I know Senator Collins does too, and the other \nsponsors of the amendment, to see if we can reach an agreement so we \ncan find a way to accept the Senator's amendment.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Connecticut. \nI appreciate him addressing this issue and I look forward to working \nwith him.\n\n  I understand efforts were made to identify issues the Postal Service \nmust consider before closing a post office. But the key is not simply \nto have them consider an issue but to have a standard by which it can \nbe evaluated whether that standard has been met. That is the critical \ndistinction, which then allows the review commission, which the \nSenators have appropriately included in the bill, to have a standard; \nsimply: Did the Postal Service consider this? They will say, yes, they \ndid consider it. But did it have a substantial impact in damaging the \nlocal economy? Now there is a standard for the review commission.\n  I look forward to working with the Senator and thank him so much. And \nI thank Senator Collins and Senator Carper, who have been working to \nhelp address this issue as well.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise to speak on the postal reform \nbill and to offer constructive suggestions. I know Senator Collins was \nscheduled to speak. I am going to take this time. She is in a meeting, \nand it is agreeable to her we follow this sequencing.\n  There is no doubt that the Postal Service is in need of reform, and I \nsupport the concept of reform. I salute the architects of the bill, \nSenators Lieberman and Collins, on the framework they have proposed. I \nthink it was thoughtful and robust and even ambitious. I wish to \ncompliment them on the process that is the hallmark of this committee.\n  If I could have the attention of the Senator from Connecticut for a \nmoment, I say to Senator Lieberman, I want to comment that we know you \nare about to retire, and we are going to miss you because here we are \nhaving a civilized, rational, thoughtful, data-driven type of \nconversation, and I think it is a hallmark of the way you and Senator \nCollins have functioned to bring this bill to our attention. The Senate \nought to do more of it.\n  I thank the Senator for his leadership, though I disagree with some \nof the parts in this bill. But that is the way the Senate should be.\n  Let me talk about postal reform, and first about the post office. The \npost office is not a business. It is a public utility, and we need to \nthink of it as a public utility; that which provides universal service \nto keep the juice and electricity of our economy going. If we think of \nit as a public utility mandated by a national interest to provide \nuniversal service, then that is the way we should think about it. Will \nit require subsidy? Yes. Does it require an open checkbook? No. Does it \nrequire reform? Yes.\n  But the Postal Service has reformed itself from the days of the Pony \nExpress to the present. They had to face the challenge when they \ninvented Western Union. They faced the challenge when we got \ntelephones. Why do we need the Postal Service? Time and time again, the \nPostal Service has needed to reform. It is time to reform again. But if \nwe are going to reform, we need to make sure we provide safeguards to \nprotect rural communities,\n\n[[Page S2466]]\n\nto protect small businesses, and to protect vulnerable populations that \ndo not have access to the Internet.\n  We have a digital divide in the United States of America. We do not \nhave a universal superinformation highway in the United States of \nAmerica. We do have a digital divide, and the divide is because of both \ngeography and income. Not everybody walks around with these cool 500 \ndevices. So people rely on the post office for correspondence, for \npaychecks, for the delivery of products that have been ordered over the \nInternet--those e-Bay entrepreneurs we know about. Small business \nrelies on it for time-sensitive business documents and the time-\nsensitive delivery of products.\n  This is even more important for rural areas. Rural areas have a \nunique geography, and that can complicate mail delivery or create \ndelays. I represent the mountain counties of western Maryland. At times \nthat weather is so rugged up there you need a snowmobile to get \nthrough. Then there is the Eastern Shore--the beautiful, dynamic, \ncharming Eastern Shore. But it is nine counties stretching over 150 to \nclose to 200 miles. Sometimes in places they do not even have cell \nphone coverage. Reductions to delivery standards, closing a post \noffice, and, most of all, closing a processing center would have a \nDraconian impact. So in my State we are very concerned about this.\n  We are willing to do reform. We were willing to close a processing \ncenter in western Maryland and work with Pennsylvania and West \nVirginia--bordering States--to do this. But now they want to close the \nEaston Mail Processing Center. It is the only processing center on the \nEastern Shore. It is the only mail processing center serving nine \ncounties. To use the processing center in Baltimore, it is miles away \nand across the Bay Bridge.\n  Then there is this whole issue of merging it with Delaware. Delaware \nis nine counties away from Somerset County--over 150, close to 200 \nmiles. The operation of this Eastern Shore postal processing facility \nis absolutely crucial.\n  Everybody says: Oh, we love the Eastern Shore. Well, I love it too. \nBut I want it to have business. I want my senior citizens to be able to \nget their prescription drugs by mail, and get them on a timely basis. \nIt is a community of small business. That is what the Eastern Shore is. \nEven our big business of poultry and seafood is made up of small \nentrepreneurs involved in this. They need the Postal Service, and they \nneed to have it accessed on the Eastern Shore.\n  So last February, the Postal Service, in its unique way, announced \nthe closing. Senator Cardin and myself asked for hearings. The Postal \nService responded in a very dismissive way. They dismissed not only \nCardin and Mikulski, but they dismissed a half a million residents who \nlive on the Eastern Shore and who rely on this.\n  When I asked them if they would even hold a hearing so farmers and \nsmall businesses and seniors could voice their opinions, they said they \nheard all they needed. They had no intention of holding a hearing. My \nconstituents have a right to be heard. They have a right to standards \nof delivery service and they have a right for me to fight for them and \nI am going to fight for them. But I am also going to fight for postal \nreform. The way Senator Merkley wants to improve the bill, so do I.\n  I have four amendments pending to get the post office to make sure \nthey not only look at what they are doing--right now they look at what \nis the impact of what they are doing on the post office. Senator Barb \nlooks at the impact they are having on the customer and on the \ncommunity. Remember, think of it as a public utility, and we are \nturning the lights off on the Eastern Shore.\n  My first amendment says: No processing center can be closed unless a \nGovernor from the State certifies that a closure will not harm the \ncommunity or disrupt commerce.\n  My second amendment says: No processing center can be closed unless \nan independent third party, such as the Commission, talks about the \nimpact on jobs, the unemployment rate and small business and to make \nthe study public.\n  My third maintains the standard of delivery for overnight. On the \nEastern Shore, my veterans need their medical care, my seniors need to \nbe able to get their Social Security checks, and also business--even \nlive birds come through this processing center. Are they going to sit \naround and go back and forth to Baltimore? Man does that ruffle my \nfeathers. I can tell you that right now.\n  Fourth, it is strictly ZIP Code politics. I will offer an amendment \nto prevent the closing of the Easton Post Office. If my other three \namendments prevail, I think we have it. It is not just my criteria; it \nis what Senator Merkley and all of us are talking about. The post \noffice is a public utility. We look at the impact of closing, not only \nthe impact of what the post office saves but what the community loses \nand if is it worth the cost. I do not want to turn the lights out on \nthe Eastern Shore, but I do want to keep the lights of the post office \ngoing.\n  In the spirit of compromise and conversation and civility that marks \nthe leadership of this committee, I want to work with the leadership \nand see if I can be accommodated. I wish to again congratulate Senators \nCollins and Lieberman on their leadership and on their whole civilized \nway and also to Senator Sanders for doing this.\n  I think I have made my point. Next time, the post office should \nlisten more to the people or they will hear more from Senator Barb.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, before my friend and colleague from \nMaryland leaves the floor, I wish to thank her for her passionate \nadvocacy on behalf of her constituents. I have a similar problem in my \nhome State of Maine, where a processing center has been targeted for \nclosure that would have an extraordinarily detrimental impact on mail \ndelivery for two-thirds of the State of Maine. It makes no sense \nwhatsoever. It would do away with overnight delivery, as the Senator \nhas indicated.\n  I would encourage her to continue to work with us and also to look at \nthe specific provisions we have put into the substitute that reflect \nthe input we have had from her and many other concerned Senators. One \nof those standards deals with the overnight delivery and the need to \nmaintain that standard of service.\n  This is an advantage the Postal Service has, and it helps it keep \ncustomers. In my view, to do away with overnight delivery would be \nfoolhardy, and it would actually cause more mailers to leave the Postal \nService, which would produce a further decline in volume and, thus, \nrevenues would plummet still further.\n  I understand a lot of the concerns the Senator from Maryland has \nraised. I do think we have taken care of some of her concerns in the \nnew substitute we have proposed on a bipartisan basis. But we look \nforward to continuing to work with her to address her concerns.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. If I may respond to the Senator, first of all, I do \nthank the Senator for the substitute. I think it does make substantial \nimprovements in the bill. It demonstrates that the Senator is listening \nto colleagues and also to people who are affected.\n  I am familiar, when we worked on home health care, and the Senator \nand I teamed up, that in parts of Maine and parts of western Maryland, \nwe had visiting nurses on snowmobiles and they were not going to be \nreimbursed. So we have an understanding of these rural, rugged \ncommunities. I do want to work with Senator Collins. In the spirit and \ntone represented by Senator Collins and Senator Lieberman, perhaps we \ncould have an additional conversation.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, if I may just briefly, thanks to \nSenator Mikulski for her kind words but also for her directness about \nher concern about the processing facility she talked about and overall \nand to thank her for her willingness to work with us to see if we can \nwork out something acceptable.\n  As Senator Collins said, we have made some changes in this substitute \nthat will still require overnight delivery--less broadly than before \nbecause we are trying to deal with how to responsibly react to the \nprecipitous drop in mail volume because of the Internet, yet not reduce \nthe quality of service so much that people leave the mail system even \nmore.\n  I used an analogy yesterday which is probably not exact, but way back \nwhen\n\n[[Page S2467]]\n\nI was in the State senate in Connecticut, we had a crisis in the \nfinancing of our public bus system. One of the things that was done \nthat seemed quite logical at the time was to raise the price of the bus \nfare. What does the Senator think happened in response to that?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. They left.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Fewer people were riding the buses and the fiscal \nproblem got worse. There is a reality here. The mail volume has dropped \nso much that we have to close some of the mail processing facilities \nor--and Senator Collins and I feel very strongly about this--we have to \nthin out the number of personnel working at the facilities.\n  We put this in as a condition which we thought originally was what \nthe Postmaster was going to be interested in. Do not just precipitously \nclose a lot of mail processing facilities. First--and we require this \nnow--they have to consider a plan to reduce the capacity of a \nparticular facility and presumably the number of people working there \nbefore they absolutely close it.\n\n  Anyway, bottom line, thanks to Senator Mikulski. We look forward to \nworking with her to reach a mutually agreeable result.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I wish to discuss in more detail a key \nprovision of the postal reform bill that is before us; that is, the \nprovision that would refund to the Postal Service an $11 billion \noverpayment that the Postal Service has made to the Federal Employee \nRetirement System.\n  This is the key provision of our bill because part of the money from \nthat refund would be used to finance the buyouts and retirement \nincentives the Postmaster General has estimated would allow him to \ndecrease the size of the workforce, in a compassionate way, by about \n100,000 workers.\n  The Postal Service has about 600,000 workers, just to give an idea of \nhow many we are talking about. So it is about 18 percent. That would \nhelp the Postal Service right size. It is patterned on the practices \nmany private corporations use when they find they need to downsize. \nThey provide a little incentive for people to retire early or to \nretire. If they are eligible for retirement, it gives them a little \nincentive to take advantage of that.\n  I am convinced this will work because more than 33 percent of postal \nemployees are eligible for retirement right now. We use the standards \nthat are in current laws. The retirement incentive cannot exceed \n$25,000. That is in current law for Federal agencies to use, and we \nwould extend that so it is capped to postal employees.\n  We also would allow the Postal Service to give 1 year of retirement \ncredit for someone who is 1 year short of the necessary number of years \nunder the old Civil Service Retirement System, 2 years under the newer \nFERS system.\n  But yesterday I heard one of our colleagues describe this refund of \n$11 billion as being an overpayment that will come from taxpayer \npockets. That is not an accurate statement. I realize this bill is very \ncomplex. So I wish to provide to my colleagues some additional \ninformation. They do not have to just take my word for it; they can \ntake the word of the inspector general of the U.S. Postal Service.\n  The FERS system does have tax dollars in it from Federal agencies \nthat are paying in for their employees and, of course, the employees \nalso contribute to the system. But when it comes to the Postal Service, \nthe money is not coming from taxpayers. The contributions are not \ncoming from taxpayers. They are coming from postal employees \nthemselves, and they are coming from the Postal Service, which is using \nits revenue from postage and other services and, thus, it is the \nratepayers' money.\n  The inspector general makes this very clear in his letter. I ask \nunanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      Office of Inspector General,\n\n\n                                 United States Postal Service,\n\n                                                 February 2, 2012.\n     Senator Joseph Lieberman,\n     Senator Susan Collins,\n     Senator Tom Carper,\n     Senator Scott Brown,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Lieberman, Collins, Carper, and Brown: In \n     response to your request, I am providing the following \n     information. The postal surplus for the Federal Employees' \n     Retirement System (FERS) has been projected to be $11.4 \n     billion for fiscal year (FY) 2011. The Office of Personnel \n     Management (OPM) made this projection as of September 30, \n     2011. In addition, OPM has projected the postal surplus of \n     the Civil Service Retirement System to be $1.7 billion for FY \n     2011.\n       The source of the FERS funding comes from two streams of \n     revenue: (1) the U.S. Postal Service contributes 11.9 percent \n     of employee salaries to the fund and (2) the employees \n     contribute 0.8 percent. The Postal Service contribution comes \n     from revenue paid for postage, and this money comes from the \n     ratepayers. The employee contribution, as with all federal \n     employees, is made in exchange for a defined benefit.\n       If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to \n     contact me or Mohammad Adra or Wally Olihovik in my office.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                David C. Williams,\n                                                Inspector General.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, first of all, the inspector general \nverifies the amount of the overpayments. His letter to Senator \nLieberman, Senator Carper, Senator Scott Brown, and myself, dated \nFebruary 2, 2012, says:\n\n       The postal surplus for the Federal Employees Retirement \n     System (FERS) has been projected to be $11.4 billion for \n     fiscal year 2011. The Office of Personnel Management made \n     this projection as of September 30 of 2011.\n       In addition, OPM has projected the postal surplus of the \n     Civil Service Retirement System to be $1.7 billion for fiscal \n     year 2011.\n\n  We are not trying to deal with that; we are only dealing with the \nFERS surplus. Here is the key paragraph.\n\n       The source of the FERS funding comes from two streams of \n     revenue: (1) the U.S. Postal Service contributes 11.9 percent \n     of employee salaries to the fund and (2) the employees \n     contribute 0.8 percent. The Postal Service contribution comes \n     from revenue paid for postage, and this money comes from the \n     ratepayers. The employee contribution, as with all Federal \n     employees, is made in exchange for a defined benefit.\n\n  This could not be more clear. This is not taxpayers' money. No matter \nhow many times some of our colleagues may say this is a taxpayer \nbailout or this is taxpayers' money, it is not true. It is not an \naccurate understanding of how the system works. I am going to circulate \nthis letter widely, and I hope my colleagues will take the time to read \nit.\n  I can understand the confusion, because if it were a Federal agency, \na regular Federal agency, it would be taxpayer money. But it is the \nPostal Service and it is not taxpayer money, and that is important.\n  The other important point I wish to make is that this is a real \noverpayment. It has been verified by an independent board of actuaries. \nThis is not something the Postal Service came up with or that our \ncommittee came up with. This has been verified by the OPM Board of \nActuaries, an independent body comprised of private sector actuaries \nthat advises the Office of Actuaries within OPM and reviews annual \nreports.\n  So it is not even OPM's actuaries. It is an independent board of \nprivate sector actuaries that has verified that this is, in fact, an \noverpayment and it is $11.4 billion.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nthe Office of Personnel Management which explains the independent \nboards.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           United States Office of\n\n\n                                         Personnel Management,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 3, 2012.\n     Hon. Susan M. Collins,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Homeland Security and \n         Governmental Affairs, U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: On February 2 and 3, 2012, you \n     contacted my office requesting information regarding the \n     amount of surplus contributions made by the U.S. Postal \n     Service to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability (CSRD) \n     Fund for its employees who participate in the Federal \n     Employees Retirement System (FERS).\n       My staff has contacted the U.S. Office of Personnel \n     Management (OPM) Office of the Actuaries (OA). In an email \n     exchange and follow-up discussions on February 3, 2012, the \n     OA indicated to us that its most recent determination of the \n     Postal Service's projected FERS surplus is $10.9 billion as \n     of September 30, 2010.\n       We have also confirmed that this figure appears on page 20 \n     of the ``Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund Annual \n     Report: Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2011'', which is \n     attached. This report is issued annually by the OA and OPM's \n     Office of the\n\n[[Page S2468]]\n\n     Chief Financial Officer. The OPM Board of Actuaries, an \n     independent body comprised of private sector actuaries that \n     advises the OA, reviews the annual reports.\n       If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate \n     to contact David Cope, the Assistant Inspector General for \n     Legal Affairs, or Susan Ruge, Attorney-Advisor.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Patrick E. McFarland,\n                                                Inspector General.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, the Government Accountability Office \nhas also looked at this issue and found that OPM's Actuary did assess \nthat there was an overpayment--what GAO calls a surplus.\n  There is one paragraph in the GAO letter that I particularly want to \nbring to my colleagues' attention because it is a call for action. The \nComptroller General says:\n\n       We have also reported that Congress and USPS urgently need \n     to reach agreement on a comprehensive reform package to \n     address the Postal Service's financial problems. Congress \n     could consider a one-time return of some, or all, of the FERS \n     surplus as part of a broader package tied to specific actions \n     on the part of USPS to help it address its financial \n     problems. These actions could include prefunding its retiree \n     health benefit obligation, reducing its $13 billion debt, or \n     developing incentives to reduce its workforce.\n\n  Madam President, that is what our bill does. We are following the \nadvice of the GAO to do this one-time refund of the overpayment and \ndedicate it specifically to the incentives to reduce its workforce and \nto reducing the debt the Postal Service owes to the Treasury. We also \ndeal with the prefunding of the retiree health benefit issue in our \nbill as well.\n  My point is that there is agreement that this is not taxpayers' \nmoney. There is agreement that this is a true overpayment. And we have \nGAO suggesting that we do exactly what this bill does, which is the \none-time refund of the overpayment, tied to reform to address the \nUSPS's financial crisis and specifically mandating that the money be \nused to develop incentives to reduce the size of the workforce and pay \ndown its debt.\n  I wanted to take this time today to explain this issue because I am \nvery concerned that there are Members who are operating on the basis of \na complete misconception that somehow this is a taxpayer bailout or \nthat it is taxpayer funds that are being used to repay this \noverpayment. That is not accurate.\n  This bill is very complicated, and I hope we can stick to the facts \nas we debate it. People may have different views on the way forward or \nthe path forward, but I hope we can keep this free from \nmischaracterizations about the bill. I understand how it is going to \nhappen because it is a complex matter. That is why we have spent, on \nour committee, so many months carefully studying this issue and getting \nhelp and expertise from GAO, OPM, and outside parties to make sure--and \nfrom the IG--we fully understand the provisions of the bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I note the presence of my friend from \nTennessee on the floor. Before he speaks, I would like to spend a \nmoment responding to Senator Collins, and then I will quickly yield to \nhim.\n  I thank Senator Collins. She made a quite complicated subject very \nunderstandable. It is a misunderstanding--really a misstatement--to say \nthe money the Postal Service will be refunded is taxpayer money. It is \nnot. It is the return of money collected, as the Senator said, by the \npost office from ratepayers and from their own employees which was \nmistakenly put into this retirement fund. This is no more a bailout \nwith taxpayer money than in the case--which happens--where an \nindividual or a business overpays taxes to the Federal Government. When \nthat miscalculation or error is discovered, they can ask for a refund. \nThat is exactly what has happened here with the Postal Service.\n  It is critically important to this bill and to the future of the \nPostal Service because we are requiring in the bill and authorizing \nthat the money refunded not be used for more spending but be used to, \none, pay down the debt and, two, make investments by incentivizing the \nretirement of employees, which will have an enormously important effect \non the annual Postal Service budget.\n  The Postmaster believes that with the money he receives back--really \nnot a majority of it--he can incentivize the retirement of \napproximately 100,000 current employees of the Postal Service, which is \nthe goal we set for them in this bill. That will result in a savings of \nover $8 billion a year for the Postal Service. So this is not only a \nrefund of the Postal Service's own money--not taxpayer money--but it is \ngoing to be used to save $8 billion a year, which is the largest \nsavings component of the proposal we have made.\n  Again, I thank my friend from Maine.\n  I yield to my friend from Tennessee.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator from Tennessee yield briefly?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak \nfollowing the Senator from Tennessee.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, first, I thank the Senator from Maine \nand the Senator from Connecticut for letting me take a few minutes, and \nI congratulate them on their hard work on this bill. This is a \nbipartisan bill that has some bipartisan amendments and suggestions \nabout a big problem. It is the kind of thing we ought to be working on.\n  I hope that--while we ran into a little obstacle yesterday, in terms \nof our ability to move forward with relevant amendments to the Postal \nService bill, I hope we can move back in that direction so we can have \na good debate.\n  I thank the Senator from Maine for her full explanation of the \nrefund, which is an essential part of the bill.\n\n\n          Tribute to Franklin Namon Watson and Lowell Russell\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, my late friend Alex Haley, the author \nof ``Roots,'' lived his life by these six words: ``Find the good and \npraise it.''\n  Occasionally, I come to the floor and cite an example of a Tennessean \nor some circumstances in my State that fit those six words.\n  A few weeks ago, I came here to talk about 91-year-old Tennessean \nBill Hoffman, a resident of Memphis, who turned down a Purple Heart in \n1944 when he was wounded in Germany because there were so many other \npeople who were hurt worse than he was. His son thought, since his \nfather is now 91, that maybe it is time that he does get it, and he \ncontacted our office, and we got in touch with the Army. Lo and behold, \nhe not only deserves the Purple Heart, he turns out to be one of the \nlast three surviving rangers who scaled the cliffs at Pointe du Hoc on \nD-day, which was one of the most daring and courageous acts of World \nWar II. President Reagan talked about it in his 40th anniversary \nspeech, ``The Boys of Pointe du Hoc.''\n  Last week in Memphis, the Army presented Bill Hoffman not only with \nhis Purple Heart but with the Bronze Star and a ``V'' for valor, and \nthey gave him a special ranger cap to go along with it. That was a good \nday.\n  I am here today to talk about another story, two extraordinary \nTennesseans who are united by both their friendship and their courage--\nLCpl Franklin Namon Watson, who sacrificed his life for our freedom, \nand his devoted friend and mentor, Tennessee Highway Patrol Sergeant \nLowell Russell, who is recovering from critical injuries he sustained \nwhile on duty.\n  LCpl Franklin Namon Watson, or ``Frankie'' to everyone who knew him \nin East Tennessee, enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve in 2010. \nLast year, in September, at the age of 21, Frankie was killed while \nserving our country in Afghanistan, sweeping for improvised explosive \ndevices in the Helmand Province.\n  Frankie, the son of Stacy Couch and Troy Watson, didn't shy away from \ndifficult or dangerous work when he was back in Tennessee. He was a law \nenforcement officer in the police department of Madisonville in East \nTennessee, just a few miles down the road from my hometown. The chief \ndeputy of the Monroe County Sheriff's Department, Brian Graves, \ndescribed Frankie as ``very upbeat and focused on what he wanted to \ndo.'' What he wanted to do was be a peacekeeper and a law enforcer. \nFamily members say his dream was to join the Secret Service and protect \nthe President.\n  Madam President, I will read from a letter to the editor of the \nKnoxville\n\n[[Page S2469]]\n\nNews Sentinel written by a prominent Knoxville attorney, Billy Stokes. \nHe wrote about the escort of Frankie's body, delivered by a small \nairplane to the National Guard base and transported by a six-person \nmilitary detail to a hearse, which then traveled from the airport to \nMadisonville in East Tennessee. Billy was one of the several hundred \nmotorcyclists who road behind the police cars. This is what he said:\n\n       All along the route were thousands of well-wishers, many \n     holding American flags. Lots of them were veterans, proudly \n     holding crisp salutes as the processional passed. A \n     significant number of those folks were crying. As we got \n     closer to Madisonville, many young men and women were \n     obviously grief stricken. I suppose they were school friends \n     of Watson's.\n       I saw thousands of East Tennesseans trying to honor and \n     respect a young man who has given his all for this country. \n     Watson was a wonderful young man by all accounts from those \n     who knew him best.\n       I am an Army veteran but did not experience the horrors of \n     combat. I do know that we have an all-volunteer force \n     protecting our liberty and freedoms every day. I am so glad \n     that we don't seem to take them for granted. I've never been \n     prouder to be an American and an East Tennessean than I was \n     that day.\n\n  Another law enforcement officer, Tennessee Highway Patrol Sergeant \nLowell Russell, helped raise Frankie and was a devoted friend and \nmentor. Not long ago, Lowell talked with a member of my staff in \nKnoxville, Jane Chedester, and told her about Frankie. He said that \nFrankie's love of serving the Madisonville Police Department was great. \nHe told her about Frankie's dedication to honoring his State and his \ncountry.\n  Then, in March, Sergeant Russell was critically injured in a \ncollision on Interstate 40 in West Knoxville when a tractor trailer hit \nhis squad car as he sat on the shoulder finishing up some paperwork \nafter a traffic stop. Earlier this month Lowell was discharged from the \nUniversity of Tennessee Medical Center to continue his recovery in a \nrehabilitation facility.\n  Lowell is beloved by his community. A Facebook page dedicated to \n``Prayers for Sergeant Lowell Russell'' is filled with loving prayers \nfor Lowell. They call him ``a wonderful man.'' They talk about his \n``huge heart.'' One says that ``Lowell has done so much for everyone \nelse.''\n  Numerous efforts are being made to raise money to help Russell and \nhis family with expenses.\n  Tennessee's General Assembly passed a resolution to honor Lowell, \nnoting his ``immeasurable contributions to his community as a Tennessee \nHighway Patrolman . . . who exhibits superior standards of professional \nconduct and ethics.'' It also says that ``Sergeant Russell is wholly \ncommitted to noble precepts of public service that have earned \nTennessee recognition as the 'Volunteer State,' and he should be \nspecially recognized for his courage and gallantry as an esteemed \nmember of the local law enforcement.''\n  I add my great appreciation for Lowell to that expressed by our \nGovernor and our general assembly. Honey and I pray for his strength in \nrecovery and for strength for his family and friends during this very \ndifficult time.\n  So Frankie Watson and Lowell Russell, we are proud of you. Find the \ngood and praise it.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I want to address the pending legislation before I go \ninto a morning business speech--the Postal Reform Act that is before \nus. It is my understanding that we have an opportunity----\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate is currently considering \nthe motion to proceed to the Violence Against Women Reauthorization \nAct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Well, I renew my request to speak as in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                             Postal Reform\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, coming before us soon on the Senate \nfloor will be the Postal Reform Act. This is a matter which is timely \nbecause we understand our Postal Service is in a situation where it is \ncurrently losing millions of dollars every single day. Because many \nthings have changed in America--the use of the Internet, e-mail, bill \npayer--fewer people are using the Postal Service. Less revenue is \ncoming into the Postal Service. So they are trying to reconcile today's \ndemands with the actual costs they face.\n  Several years ago we said to the Postal Service: We think the day \nwill come soon when you will have more retirees than actual workers, so \nstart banking money for retirement and health care for those who will \nneed it in years to come. We set a number--about $5 billion a year--and \nthey kept up with it for several years but then found they couldn't \nmeet that requirement. So the Postmaster General came through with a \nsweeping plan in terms of cutting costs to the Postal Service. I \nunderstand the imperative to do that, although I question the premise \nof his statement because this is one of the first things he said: We \nare going to change the Postal Service, and the first thing we will do \nis slow down delivery.\n  If there is ever a marketing technique designed to fail, it is the \nannouncement you are going to slow down the delivery of your product. \nYet that is what he said, and I am sorry he did.\n  So now we are in the predicament or situation where we are trying to \nfind alternatives to the Postmaster General's proposals. We have been \ngiven until May 15. At a meeting in my office, which the Presiding \nOfficer and the Senator from Vermont and others attended, the \nPostmaster General said: Yes, I will give Congress its chance to pass a \nbill to save money that might be different than my own suggestions.\n  Well, now is our chance. Unfortunately, we are tied up on the floor \nof the Senate. That is not a headline because it happens to be the \nnormal state of affairs in this body. But imagine, if you will, that \nSenator Reid, the majority leader, comes to the floor and says: We have \nthis important Postal Service reform bill before us, and I think we \nshould move forward on it and we should consider amendments that are \nrelevant to that subject. In other words, if you have an amendment that \nis about the Postal Service and how to make it better, save money, make \nit operate in the black, come forward with that amendment.\n  There was an objection from the junior Senator from Kentucky. He \nsaid, no; he thought the Postal Service reform bill should be used to \ndebate foreign aid to Egypt--foreign aid to Egypt. Not that foreign aid \nto Egypt is not an important issue; it is. But here is an issue that is \ntimely and important and affects every single American, where the \nSenate has a responsibility to step up and do its job, with a deadline \nlooming of May 15, and one Senator has said: No, not unless I can bring \nto the floor whatever I want to bring.\n  It is his right to make that request, and he has bottled things up \npretty handily at this point. I hope he will reconsider.\n  I wish we could take up this bill right now and have a debate on the \nfloor of the Senate about an amendment. How about that--have people \ndisagree and actually have a vote. It would be like the good old days \nin the Senate. But, no, we are lurching from quorum call to quorum call \nand cloture vote to cloture vote, and those newcomers to the Senate may \nwonder if there was ever a day we debated issues.\n  We need to get this postal reform right. It is one of the most \nimportant institutions in America. It is protected and embodied in the \nConstitution. There are hundreds of thousands of men and women who are \nserving us in the Postal Service, one-fourth of them veterans who have \nserved our country and have gone to work for the government.\n  When we ask people across America which function of government do you \nrespect the most, the Postal Service comes out on top because we know \nour local letter carriers. In my neighborhood it is David Lasley. David \nhas been my buddy for 20 years. I have known him for that long or \nlonger, and he is a friend of my family. He is not just the person who \nbrings the mail. Others before him, the same way. It is a personal \nrelationship with government that very few people have. But the letter \ncarriers, the postal folks, the folks who do the processing and \ndistributing are doing an important job.\n\n[[Page S2470]]\n\n  The Postal Service has an amazing history. Just as a reminder, on May \n7, 1833, there was a 24-year-old young man who was named postmaster \ngeneral of a small town in central Illinois. It wasn't his last \ngovernment job. The town was New Salem, IL, and the young man was \nAbraham Lincoln, who got his start in the Postal Service, which has a \ntradition that goes back even before then.\n  We need to work together on a bipartisan basis. I am glad Senator \nCollins and Senator Lieberman are on the Senate floor. They have worked \nso closely together on a bipartisan basis to move us forward. Let's \nbuild a Postal Service that will serve us in the 21st century. Let's \ntry to make certain we find new ways to cut costs that are reasonable, \nto enhance revenue that makes sense, and make certain in the process \nthat we don't damage the brand. The U.S. Postal Service is the best in \nthe world, the most affordable in the world, and we can make sure it \ncontinues to serve our Nation and our economy.\n  It is critically important to those of us who represent States with \nsmall towns. I know every small rural post office cannot survive--many \nof them have failed in the past--but we have to understand what a \ncritical element that rural post office is to the culture of these \ncommunities, to the identity of these communities and, in some cases, \nto their very existence. So let's find flexible ways to reduce costs \nand still recognize that reality.\n\n\n                             The DREAM Act\n\n  Madam President, 11 years ago I introduced the DREAM Act. At the \ntime, Senator Hatch of Utah was my cosponsor. It was a bipartisan \nmeasure called to the floor of the Senate and, at one time, we had 12 \nRepublican votes. The last time it was called we had 3. Unfortunately, \nover the years, it has not passed the Senate. I think it has received a \nmajority every time we have called it but not the 60 votes which are \nnow the norm in the Senate.\n  As a result, for 11 years I have been striving to change the law when \nit comes to immigration for a specifically small group of people. We \nare talking about people who came to the United States as children. \nThey have been U.S. residents for a long period of time. They have good \nmoral character. They have graduated from high school, and they are \nprepared to either serve in our military or to complete at least 2 \nyears of college. This is a special group of people who, unfortunately, \nfall through the cracks in our current immigration laws.\n  I have met hundreds, maybe thousands of them now in the 10 years I \nhave been working on this issue. I know they dream of the day when they \nwill have a country. Currently, they do not; they are undocumented. The \nonly country they have ever known is the United States, but they just \ncan't go forward. When it comes to college or a university, they get no \nhelp from the government unless the State they live in has a special \narrangement but certainly no help from the Federal Government.\n  When they finish school many of them can't be the teachers, nurses, \nengineers, or doctors they want to be because it requires citizenship, \nwhich they do not have. We are trying to give them that chance.\n  I have come to the floor time and time again to introduce some of \nthese young people to America so they can put a face with a name to the \nDREAM Act. The person I want to speak about today is named Yaniv \nSteltzer.\n  Yaniv was brought to the United States by his parents from Israel \nwhen he was just 3 years old. This is a photograph of Yaniv. Today he \nis 25. He grew up in America. Like every other American child, he \nbelieves this is home. In 2010, he graduated from Richard Stockton \nCollege in New Jersey with a bachelor of science degree in hospitality \nand tourism management. In college, he was chair of the Jewish Student \nUnion/Hillel Club and was an active volunteer with several other \nstudent groups.\n  Yaniv's dream is to open a restaurant. He wrote a letter to me, and \nhere is what he said:\n\n       I fell in love with cooking in high school when I took a \n     home-economics class and I knew this is what I wanted to do \n     for the rest of my life. I would love to give back to America \n     by opening my own restaurant, creating jobs, contributing to \n     the economy, and becoming a citizen in the country I love.\n\n  Now, let me tell you Yaniv's challenge. He can't become a citizen. \nHis father was born in the United States, but Yaniv was born in Israel, \nso he is not an American citizen. Yaniv's father applied for Yaniv to \nbecome a citizen, but because the process took so long he became \nineligible. Under our immigration laws, once Yaniv turned 21 his father \ncould not petition for him to become a citizen any longer.\n  So Yaniv has lived in this country since he was 3 years old, his \nfather is an American citizen, and he is undocumented. The only \nsolution for him is the DREAM Act.\n  Here is what Yaniv told me about his situation:\n\n       America is the only country I know. I grew up here, all my \n     family and friends are here and everything I know is in \n     America. The DREAM Act is important to me and many others \n     like me who are in the same situation. We have the resources \n     to help this country greatly, but don't have that piece of \n     paper that allows us to do this. I have high hope and \n     optimism that Congress will do the right and humane thing, \n     put all political issues aside and pass the DREAM Act.\n\n  Yaniv is right. I ask my colleagues, would America be a better place \nif we deported Yaniv Steltzer? Of course not. This young man grew up in \nour country. He has overcome the odds to achieve great success. He \ndoesn't have a criminal background or any problems that we should be \nconcerned about. He is no threat to us. He would make America a better \ncountry, a stronger country if we just gave him a chance.\n  Yaniv is not an isolated example. There are thousands of others like \nhim around this country. Over the Easter break, I went out to Los \nAngeles and got a cab from the hotel to the airport. I looked at the \ncab driver's name and saw that his last name was Ark. I asked him: \nWhere are you from?\n  He said: Take a guess.\n  So I said: France.\n  He said: No; I am from Belarus. My father was in the Soviet Army, and \n15 years ago I came to the United States with my wife. She is a \nregistered nurse, speaks English. I didn't speak a word of English when \nI got here, but I was able to come as a refugee from Belarus, which, of \ncourse, is where the last dictator in Europe presides--Lukashenko. He \nsaid: I came here and I started learning English. I just spoke Russian.\n  I asked: How in the world did you ever get a license to drive a cab?\n  He said: I had to work at it. I not only had to learn enough English \nto be able to have a successful business as a cab driver in Los \nAngeles, but I had to learn these streets and freeways and everything \nthat came with it. He said: I did it, and now the son we brought as a \ncitizen--my two kids--are now Americans, and 15 years later I own three \ncabs.\n  What a story. But it is not unique. It is the story of America, of \npeople who said: I am sick and tired of where I am, and I have no \nchance here, but I know there is a place that will give me a chance. \nThat was the story of my family. My mother was an immigrant to this \ncountry. I think it is the story of America.\n  So why do we, in this day and age, in the 21st century, have such a \nnegative feeling about what immigration has brought, the diversity and \nstrength it has brought to this country, and why can't we see the most \nfundamental question of justice when it comes to these children, these \nkids brought here as infants who only want a chance to do what this \nrefugee from Belarus was able to do: make America a better place, build \na life for himself, create a family that would be part of the American \nfamily.\n  I will continue this battle because I know all over the country there \nare people such as Yaniv Steltzer and many others who are waiting to \nsee if the Senate can rise to this occasion, put politics aside, and do \nwhat is important for this country: show fairness, show justice, and \ngive these young people a chance.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Durbin for a moving \nstatement and for his persistence in introducing the DREAM Act, which \nit has been my honor to cosponsor with him, among many others, and to \nsupport its passage. It is about basic fairness.\n  I think it also describes the reality, and the Senator reminded me of \nmy own situation. We lived in my grandmother's house most of my \nchildhood--\n\n[[Page S2471]]\n\nmy mom, dad, sisters, and I--and she was always one of the most \npatriotic Americans I ever met because she had something to compare \nAmerica to. She was an immigrant from Central Europe. Particularly \nimportant to her was freedom of religion, and the respect she got from \nher neighbors for her religious observance, and, of course, the dream \nthat her children and grandchildren would do better in this country, \nwhich was realized.\n  But I was moved by the Senator's report of his conversation with the \ncab driver. Maybe all of us need to do that. But when I get the \nimmigrant cab drivers and they are a little older, I always ask: What \nare your kids doing? And it is quite amazing because they have the kind \nof excitement and sense of gratitude about the opportunity that America \nprovides that sometimes people who have been here for a while, \nunfortunately, may lose. Their kids are all working hard, achieving, \nand contributing to this country.\n  We are at a time in our history where a lot of people are down about \ntheir future and down about America, which was never the case when the \nSenator and I were growing up--and I started growing up a little before \nthe Senator from Illinois.\n  But when we think about these stories, it makes one feel good about \nhow unique this country is. I know, because illegal immigration--people \nmay take what I am about to say the wrong way. But I always say one of \nthe great market measurements of the greatness of America today is that \nthere is not another country in the world that more people are trying \nto get into--legally, I am talking about--and fewer people are trying \nto get out of than the United States of America. I think the DREAM Act \nrecognizes that reality and is totally consistent with the values of \nour country.\n  I thank the Senator for his persistence. One day, I hope not too far \nfrom now, we are going to get that adopted into law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                       Violence Against Women Act\n\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I rise to join a strong and growing \ngroup of my colleagues in support of the Violence Against Women Act, a \ncommonsense bill that since it was first signed into law has always \nbeen an issue we could build a consensus around, both Democrats and \nRepublicans alike. The reason for this is quite simple.\n  There is no room for tolerance of violence against women in the home \nanywhere in our society, and when we are talking about the safety of \nour families, there is simply no space for partisanship. That is why I \nam calling on my colleagues to not seek to block or delay this \nimportant piece of legislation any further. To do so is a disservice to \nthe families so deeply affected by domestic violence every single day.\n  Anyone who is guilty of domestic abuse should be held accountable to \nthe fullest extent of the law. Any victim of abuse should be empowered \nto speak out and to have access to help and support. Keeping women and \nfamilies safe is a basic commonsense principle and one we have easily \nfound agreement on since the bill was first passed, and we should be \nable to again agree on it today.\n  Every day an average of three women are murdered by a husband, a \nboyfriend, a partner. Every single day 600 women are raped or sexually \nassaulted. Millions of women and families rely on the help and support \nthat the Violence Against Women Act provides to keep them safe. It is \noutrageous to turn the Violence Against Women Act into a political \ncircus. When we allow ourselves to get bogged down in politics as \nusual, we are telling women and families across the country that their \nsafety can wait for the next election.\n  Let's do better. Let's be better. Let's agree that women deserve \naccess to basic justice and basic safety, and let's show the American \npeople that we, as a body, can do what is right.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Postal Service Reform\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me begin by once again thanking \nSenator Lieberman and Senator Carper and Senators Collins and Brown for \ntheir long and hard work on this issue, which is of enormous \nconsequence to the American people.\n  Sometimes what people inside the beltway perceive as opposed to what \npeople outside the beltway perceive are two different worlds. I can \ntell you that back in Vermont--and I suspect in rural areas and States \nall over this country--people want to save the post office. They know \nhow important it is for small businesses, for our economy, and for \ntheir own needs. So the issue we are dealing with is a very significant \nissue, and I hope that as a Senate we can show America that we can come \ntogether regardless of political ideology. This is not a progressive \nissue, a conservative issue, Republican, Democratic or Independent. \nThis is an issue that impacts tens of millions of Americans, and I hope \nwe can move together as we should.\n  I wish to say a few words on the Postal Service and finances today. \nEverybody knows the Postal Service is, in fact, facing significant \nfinancial difficulties. Revenue at the Postal Service has gone down \nfrom about $75 billion in 2008 to $66 billion last year. In the midst \nof the digital revolution, first-class mail has gone down \nsignificantly--no debate about that--and it has been replaced and will \ncontinue to be replaced by e-mail usage and the Internet. There is no \nquestion but that this is a real issue that has to be addressed.\n  But let me be very clear that in terms of the revenue problems facing \nthe Postal Service, the major problems we have are not just the decline \nin first-class mail. It is an issue that happens not to be the major \nissue. The major issue, in fact, is that the Postal Service has seen a \nsignificant loss in mail volume and revenue due to the most severe \nrecession our country has faced since the 1930s. As the Postal Service \nindicated on May 30, 2010, ``The effects of the recession account for \ntwo-thirds of the mail volume decline.''\n  The first point we want to understand is, yes, decline of first-class \nmail is a real issue. But second of all, similar to businesses all over \nthis country, revenue is being impacted by the recession. How we can \nget our country out of the recession, create more jobs, put more money \ninto the hands of working people is, of course, a major issue we must \naddress.\n  In that regard, I do wish to say that in the middle of this terrible \nrecession, when real unemployment--real unemployment; it is not 8.2 \npercent but, in fact, is closer to 15 percent, counting those people \nwho have given up looking for work, those people working part time--it \nwould seem to me this body wants to do everything we can not to see \n200,000 jobs slashed at the U.S. Postal Service, many of them decent-\npaying jobs, many of them union jobs.\n  We may not be able to save every one of those jobs; we want the \nPostal Service to be efficient. But on the other hand, I would hope we \nsee as a significant priority that in the midst of a recession, we do \nnot want to downsize a major American institution by 200,000 jobs--many \nof them, by the way, jobs belonging to veterans.\n  A couple months ago there was a whole lot of debate about how do we \ncreate jobs for veterans. I can tell you one thing we don't do is \ndownsize the Postal Service by 200,000 workers, many of them being \nveterans.\n  We talked about the decline in first-class mail being important. We \ntalked about the recession being important. But I wish to raise another \nissue that I think many people are not familiar with and that has \nnothing to do with first-class mail, nothing to do with the recession \nor, in fact, e-mail or the Internet; that is, to a very significant \ndegree, the major reason the Postal Service has been running a deficit \nsince 2007 is due to accounting issues.\n\n  For example, everybody has to understand this issue if we are going \nto have an open and honest debate about the future of the Postal \nService: Due to a law passed in 2006, the U.S. Postal Service--uniquely \nin America, uniquely within government, Federal, State, local, uniquely \nin terms of the private sector--has been forced to prefund 75\n\n[[Page S2472]]\n\nyears' worth of future retiree health benefits in just 10 years--\nseventy-five years' worth of future retiree health benefits in just 10 \nyears. There is no other agency of government that comes close to that \nonerous requirement, nor are there any companies in the private sector \nthat have been asked to do that. This mandate costs the U.S. Postal \nService between $5.4 billion and $5.8 billion per year.\n  So what I beg of my colleagues is when they look at the financial \nproblems facing the Postal Service--which are real--do not forget that, \nbecause of this 2006 legislation, the Postal Service needs to come up \nwith approximately $5.5 billion every single year to prefund retiree \nhealth care. This is an important point, and I hope my fellow \ncolleagues in the Senate are listening. One hundred percent of the \nPostal Service's $20 billion debt from 2007 to 2010 is the result of \nthis prefunding mandate. Let me repeat it. One hundred percent of the \nPostal Service's $20 billion debt from 2007 to 2010 is the result of \nthis $5.5 billion per year prefunding mandate. Without this mandate, \nthe Postal Service would have made a $700 million profit from 2007 to \n2010.\n  Let me repeat that, because these are facts that have not often been \nintroduced into this debate. We have folks coming up here who are \nsaying the Postal Service is collapsing financially and so forth and so \non. But it is important to understand the facts, and the facts are that \ndespite the worst recession--which we are currently in--since the \n1930s, despite the competition from e-mail and the Internet, the Postal \nService would have made a $700 million profit from 2007 to 2010 if it \nwas not forced to prefund future retiree health benefits.\n  In addition--and I hope people listen to this as well--during the \nfirst quarter of 2012, a few months ago, the U.S. Postal Service would \nhave generated a $200 million profit had it not been required to \nprefund its future retiree health benefits.\n  I think as we debate these issues about the future of the post \noffice, it is absolutely imperative that we understand the role of the \n$5.5 billion every single year that the Postal Service has to come up \nwith to prefund retiree health benefits.\n  A few months ago I asked the Inspector General of the Postal Service, \nwhose name is David Williams, David C. Williams--he is the Inspector \nGeneral of the Postal Service--I asked him to talk a little bit about \nwhat this prefunding of health benefits meant. I ask unanimous consent \nto have printed in the Record a copy of his letter, which is dated \nFebruary 6, 2012.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      Office of Inspector General,\n\n\n                                 United States Postal Service,\n\n                                                 February 6, 2012,\n     Senator Bernie Sanders\n     Dirksen Building, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sanders: For several days last week, I met \n     with you and your staff to discuss solutions to the current \n     financial crisis within the Postal Service. At the conclusion \n     of those discussions, you requested that our office focus on \n     one of the solutions that we presented which examined an \n     option to address the current benefit fund financing. This \n     proposal would eliminate the requirement for the Postal \n     Service to make annual $5.5 billion payments into its retiree \n     health benefit fund, and allow the $44 billion currently in \n     the fund to grow with interest. No payments would be made \n     from the fund until it is deemed to be fully funded, and the \n     Postal Service would continue to directly pay the healthcare \n     premiums for retirees. An additional element of the proposal \n     would allow current overpayments of $13.1 billion in the \n     Postal Service pension funds to be refunded to the Postal \n     Service. Any future overpayments would also be refunded in \n     the year of occurrence.\n       Our analysis of this proposal shows that if it were \n     adopted, the amounts in retiree healthcare fund would grow \n     from $44 billion to the $90 billion estimated current \n     liability, in 21 years. This $90 billion projected liability \n     is not a static or precise figure, as there are forces that \n     will increase and decrease the liability. Historically, the \n     figure has risen, but we note that the $90 billion has not \n     changed significantly over the last 3 years ($87 billion in \n     2009, $91 billion in 2010, and $90 billion in 2011).\n       This solution is one option to provide needed short-term \n     flexibility for the Postal Service to address its current \n     financial crisis. It would alleviate payments due of nearly \n     $30 billion over the next 4 years, and provide an additional \n     $13 billion to address current needs. Though this would \n     provide substantial relief, additional actions would be \n     necessary to address remaining financial gaps between \n     projected revenues and expenses during the next four year \n     period.\n       To put the pension and retiree health funding issue into \n     perspective, my office has conducted benchmarking to evaluate \n     the Postal Service's prefunding levels as compared to both \n     the public and private sector. The Postal Service has 2 \n     significantly exceeded pension and retiree healthcare \n     benchmarked funding levels of both public and private sector \n     organizations. Using ratepayer funds, it has built a war \n     chest of over $326 billion to address its future liabilities, \n     prefunding combined pension and retiree healthcare \n     obligations at 91 percent. This is an astonishingly high \n     figure for a company with such a large employee base.\n       For example, the Postal Service is currently over 100 \n     percent funded in its pension funds. The federal government \n     is funded at a much lower 42 percent level, and the military \n     is funded at 27 percent. The average Fortune 1000 pension \n     plan is funded at 80 percent, and only 6 percent of the \n     Fortune 1000 companies have pension plans that are 100 \n     percent funded.\n       Prefunding retiree healthcare is rare in the public and \n     private sectors. We have been unable to locate any \n     organization, either public or private, that has anything \n     similar to the Postal Service's required level of prefunding \n     of retiree healthcare benefits. The Postal Service is \n     currently funded at 49 percent of its estimated current \n     liability. The federal government does not prefund its \n     retiree healthcare liabilities at all, and the military is \n     funded at a 35 percent level. Only 38 percent of Fortune 1000 \n     companies who offer retiree health care benefits prefund the \n     expense at all, and the median funding level for those \n     organizations is 37 percent.\n       I appreciate the opportunity to analyze this proposal, and \n     describe it further. If you have any questions, please do not \n     hesitate to call me or Wally Olihovik.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                David C. Williams,\n                                                Inspector General.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. If I might, because I think this is an important letter, \nI wish to report a significant part of it. I hope people appreciate \nwhat the Inspector General of the U.S. Postal Service is saying. This \nis a guy who knows something about the Postal Service. This is a letter \nto me.\n\n       Dear Senator Sanders:\n       For several days last week I met with you and your staff to \n     discuss solutions to the current financial crisis within the \n     Postal Service. At the conclusion of those discussions you \n     requested our office focus on one of the solutions that we \n     presented, which examined an option to address the current \n     benefit fund financing. This proposal would eliminate the \n     requirement for the Postal Service to make annual $5.5 \n     billion payments into its retiree health benefit fund, and \n     allow the $44 billion currently in the fund--\n\n  Let me talk about that. There is right now, as a result of these \nfunding payments, $44 billion currently in the fund--``to grow with \ninterest.''\n  What he is saying here, what happens if you have $44 billion and it \naccrues, as it does, interest between 3 and 4 percent a year. Then he \ncontinues. If you did that:\n\n       No payments would be made from the fund until it is deemed \n     to be fully funded, and the Postal Service would continue to \n     directly pay for the health care premiums for retirees. An \n     additional element of the proposal would allow current \n     overpayments of $13.1 billion in the Postal Service pension \n     funds to be funded to the Postal Service.\n\n  This is also a point that has not been discussed at all. In fact, we \ndo address it in the current legislation. That is, not only is the \nPostal Service being asked to come up with an onerous $5.5 billion a \nyear to prefund future retiree health benefits, it is generally \nacknowledged--I think by everybody who has studied the issue--that the \nPostal Service has made overpayments of $13.1 billion into the Federal \nEmployees Retirement System and the Civil Service Retirement System, \nadding those two together. This is what he said, the Inspector General \nof the U.S. Postal Service:\n\n       Our analysis of this proposal shows that if it were \n     adopted,the amounts in retiree healthcare fund would grow \n     from $44 billion to the $90 billion estimated current \n     liability in 21 years. This $90 billion protected liability \n     is not a static or precise figure--\n\n  It varies a little bit is what he is saying--but essentially he says \nthat if you don't add another nickel into the $44 billion, it will grow \nto $90 billion in 21 years and essentially take care of the payments it \nhas to take care of.\n  The point I want to make clear is that in terms of future retiree \nhealth benefits, we already have $44 billion in the account. In my view \nand in the view of people who know more about\n\n[[Page S2473]]\n\nthis issue than I do, it is not necessary to put more money into that \naccount. That is an issue that this legislation attempts to address.\n  Let me conclude by saying the issue we are dealing with is of \nenormous consequence to our country. It is imperative, in my view, that \nwe not shut down 3,700 rural post offices. I commend the Postmaster \nGeneral. We have been working with him and he has moved away from that \nposition. In my view, we have to do everything we can to make sure that \nwe maintain very high standards for mail delivery in this country. So \nwhen a business puts a package in the mail, they know it will be \ndelivered in a reasonable time. That is one of the strengths of the \nPostal Service. In my view, we do not want to shut down, as in the \nPostmaster General's original proposal, half the processing plants in \nthis country which would slow down mail delivery service. In my view, \nwe do not want to end Saturday mail. I think it is an important part of \nmaintaining mail delivery standards.\n  But the main point I want to make today is, yes, the Postal Service \nfaces financial problems. But not to understand the significant role--\nthe causation of those problems that are a result of the $5.5 billion \nin prehealth funding for retirees--is to miss a very significant part \nof this debate. I think it is fair to say in this bill we are beginning \nto address that issue and also address the issue of the overpayment \nfrom the Postal Service to the Federal Employees Retirement System.\n  Let me conclude by thanking Senators Lieberman, Collins, Carper, and \nBrown for the work they have done. I hope we can have an intelligent \nand constructive and kind of nonpartisan discussion as we go forward, \nwith good amendments that are relevant, from both sides of the aisle.\n  The bottom line is that saving the Postal Service is enormously \nimportant for our economy and certainly for the tens of thousands of \nworkers who are out there every day doing a great job for us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont for \nhis statement but more broadly for his real steadfastness and the hard \nwork he has done to improve the bill. It has been a pleasure to work \nwith him.\n  Before Senator Collins came to the floor, and not counting the \noccupant of the chair, I was reveling in the fact that the only \nSenators on the floor were Independents.\n  Anyway, I thank Senator Sanders. We have tried to deal with this \nproblem. In the postal reform of 2006, Senator Sanders is quite right, \nfor various reasons which we need not go into the Postal Service was \nrequired to make payments into the retiree health benefit fund that \nwere beyond what most any business or other governmental entity is \ndoing, more than was necessary to sustain the payments and in a much \nshorter period of time, as the Senator from Vermont said.\n  I would say, to state it as bluntly as I can, maybe too bluntly, the \npeople advocating this were, frankly, concerned that the Postal Service \nmight get to a point where it defaulted, it was no longer able to \noperate, and then the fear was that the government, the U.S. Treasury, \nthe taxpayers would at some point in the future be forced to pick up \nthe cost of the retiree health benefits. So this uniquely demanding \nresponsibility for payment now was put on the Postal Service.\n  I think everybody agrees, particularly in light of all the real \nproblems the Postal Service has now, that is not sensible or fair. I do \nwant to point out that in the underlying bill, S. 1789, we have \nattempted to ease the Postal Service's prefunding requirements for \nretiree health benefits by immediately beginning a stretched-out 40-\nyear amortization schedule for these payments and we require the Office \nof Personnel Management, when determining how much the Postal Service \nhas to put into the retiree health benefit fund every year, to use the \nsame discount rate that is used to calculate the Federal Government's \npension obligations to the Federal Employees Retirement System and the \nCivil Service Retirement System. The Postal Service thinks this \naccounting change will reduce their unfunded liability for the retiree \nhealth benefits plan by literally billions of dollars.\n\n  The other change made here is that right now the health benefits of \nretired employees come out of the operating expenses of the Postal \nService. That was going to be the case until a day later in this \ndecade. But there is enough money in the fund that it can pick up money \nthat the Postal Service has put in, that it can pick up the cost of \nhealth benefits for postal retirees now. So we require that. I want to \nstate for the record we are trying to deal with that reality in the \nbill as it is and of course I state my intention to continue to work \nwith Senator Sanders to make this bill as good as we can, both in \naccomplishing the purposes we all have, which is to keep the Postal \nService alive and well because so many people depend on it, and to do \nso in a much more fiscally responsible way, in every way in which that \nterm might be understood, including the fairness of payments under the \nretiree health benefits plan, than has been the case before.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I, too, want to comment on this issue of \nthe prefunding for the health care benefits of future retirees. I think \nit is important to note that when the 2006 law was written, the Postal \nService supported this provision because it recognized that it had a \nhuge unfunded liability for future health benefits and it knew it was \nimportant to start putting money aside to ensure that at the time those \nretirees needed to claim those benefits, the money would be there and \nthe promises would be kept.\n  It was also important because we wanted to avoid the possibility of a \nsystem going into default and taxpayers having to step in to keep the \npromises the Postal Service has made.\n  The fact is the current liability is about $46 billion for those \nretiree health benefits, the future retiree health benefits. That \nliability is a very real one. It is not going away. Nevertheless, we \nhave taken steps in our bill, as Senator Lieberman has described, to \nease the funding by setting up a 40-year amortization schedule and by \nchanging the discount rate. So those two provisions should save the \nPostal Service approximately $2 billion--the exact number would be \ndetermined--each year, and that is obviously very welcome.\n  But I do want to address what I believe is another misconception, and \nthat is that the funding for future retirees' health benefits is \nsomehow the cause of the Postal Service's financial crisis. It is not. \nThe fact is that the Postal Service has not made its payment of $5.5 \nbillion that was due to this fund in either of the last 2 fiscal years. \nYet the Postal Service lost billions in both of those years, despite \nnot paying the $5.5 billion that was due to this fund. In total, the \nPostal Service has made only $6.9 billion of the $16.4 billion that was \nrequired in prefunding payments for the past 3 years, but has posted \nlosses, total losses for those 3 years of $26.9 billion. So it is \ncertainly true that we can and should ease the funding requirement in \nlight of the problems of the Postal Service. It is also true that we \ndon't need to fund to 100 percent, which the 2006 law requires. If my \nmemory serves me correctly, I believe we have lowered the funding level \nto 80 percent. Those provisions all have a substantial impact on \nlowering the annual payment.\n\n  I have two final points I want to reiterate. The prefunding \nrequirement is not the cause of the Postal Service's financial crisis; \nand second, that $46 billion liability is very real and it is not going \naway. Indeed, stretching out the amortization schedule, which I believe \nwe should do, is going to actually cause that liability to increase \nbecause we will be paying it over a longer period of time.\n  Nevertheless, I think the changes that have been made in the funding \nfor future retirees' health benefits make sense. I think they are \nfinancially responsible and they will provide some needed relief to the \nPostal Service without exposing taxpayers to the possibility of having \nto pick up the tab and without breaking the promise that has been made \nto postal employees.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S2474]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator from \nWyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 10 minutes \nas in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            A Second Opinion\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, this being tax week, people all around \nthe country are sending in their tax returns. The deadline just passed \nyesterday--April 17--so people are focused a lot on what happens in \nWashington. They think about the IRS. They think about the money being \nsent and how that money is being spent. As people pay their annual tax \nbills, I wish to remind Americans about how the Obama administration is \nactually spending tax dollars on the President's unpopular health care \nlaw. That is why I come to the floor, as I have every week since the \nhealth care law passed, with a doctor's second opinion about the health \ncare law.\n  I said at the time it was passed that there would be some new \nrevelation, some unintended consequence, something new that people \nwould learn week after week. As someone who has practiced medicine for \nalmost a quarter of a century taking care of families in Wyoming, I \nwanted to offer a doctor's second opinion, because I felt from the \nbeginning that in spite of the many promises the President made, the \nbill that was actually passed and signed into law is one that is bad \nfor patients, bad for providers--the nurses and the doctors who take \ncare of those patients--and terrible for taxpayers.\n  So I come to the floor because it seems to me that instead of using \nmuch of the money to improve medical care in America, this \nadministration is devoting hundreds of millions of dollars to what--the \nInternal Revenue Service. In fact, The Hill newspaper reported on April \n9 of this year that the Obama administration is quietly sending an \nadditional $500 million to the IRS--the Internal Revenue Service. The \nheadline is: ``Obama administration diverts $500M to IRS to implement \nhealthcare reform law.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From The Hill, Apr. 9, 2012]\n\n   Obama Administration Diverts $500M to IRS To Implement Healthcare \n                               Reform Law\n\n                             (By Sam Baker)\n\n       The Obama administration is quietly diverting roughly $500 \n     million to the IRS to help implement the president's \n     healthcare law.\n       The money is only part of the IRS's total implementation \n     spending, and it is being provided outside the normal \n     appropriations process. The tax agency is responsible for \n     several key provisions of the new law, including the \n     unpopular individual mandate.\n       Republican lawmakers have tried to cut off funding to \n     implement the healthcare law, at least until after the \n     Supreme Court decides whether to strike it down. That ruling \n     is expected by June, and oral arguments last week indicated \n     the justices might well overturn at least the individual \n     mandate, if not the whole law.\n       ``While President Obama and his Senate allies continue to \n     spend more tax dollars implementing an unpopular and \n     unworkable law that may very well be struck down as \n     unconstitutional in a matter of months, I'll continue to \n     stand with the American people who want to repeal this law \n     and replace it with something that will actually address the \n     cost of healthcare,'' said Rep. Denny Rehberg (R Mont.), who \n     chairs the House Appropriations subcommittee for healthcare \n     and is in a closely contested Senate race this year.\n       The Obama administration has plowed ahead despite the legal \n     and political challenges.\n       It has moved aggressively to get important policies in \n     place. And, according to a review of budget documents and \n     figures provided by congressional staff, the administration \n     is also burning through implementation funding provided in \n     the healthcare law.\n       The law contains dozens of targeted appropriations to \n     implement specific provisions. It also gave the Department of \n     Health and Human Services (HHS) a $1 billion implementation \n     fund, to use as it sees fit. Republicans have called it a \n     ``slush fund.''\n       HHS plans to drain the entire fund by September--before the \n     presidential election, and more than a year before most of \n     the healthcare law takes effect. Roughly half of that money \n     will ultimately go to the IRS.\n       HHS has transferred almost $200 million to the IRS over the \n     past two years and plans to transfer more than $300 million \n     this year, according to figures provided by a congressional \n     aide.\n       The Government Accountability Office has said the transfers \n     are perfectly legal and consistent with how agencies have \n     used general implementation funds in the past. The $1 billion \n     fund was set aside for ``federal'' implementation activities, \n     the GAO said, and can therefore be used by any agency--not \n     just HHS, where the money is housed.\n       Still, significant transfers to the IRS and other agencies \n     leave less money for HHS, and the department needs to draw on \n     the $1 billion fund for some of its biggest tasks.\n       The healthcare law directs HHS to set up a federal \n     insurance exchange--a new marketplace for individuals and \n     small businesses to buy coverage--in any state that doesn't \n     establish its own. But it didn't provide any money for the \n     federal exchange, forcing HHS to cobble together funding by \n     using some of the $1 billion fund and steering money away \n     from other accounts.\n       The transfers also allow the IRS to make the healthcare law \n     a smaller part of its public budget figures. For example, the \n     tax agency requested $8 million next year to implement the \n     individual mandate, and said the money would not pay for any \n     new employees.\n       An IRS spokeswoman would not say how much money has been \n     spent so far implementing the individual mandate.\n       Republicans charged during the legislative debate over \n     healthcare that the IRS would be hiring hundreds of new \n     agents to enforce the mandate and throwing people in jail \n     because they don't have insurance.\n       However, the mandate is just one part of the IRS's \n     responsibilities.\n       The healthcare law includes a slew of new taxes and fees, \n     some of which are already in effect. The tax agency wants to \n     hire more than 300 new employees next year to cover those tax \n     changes, such as the new fees on drug companies and insurance \n     policies.\n       The IRS will also administer the most expensive piece of \n     the new law--subsidies to help low-income people pay for \n     insurance, which are structured as tax credits. The agency \n     asked Congress to fund another 537 new employees dedicated to \n     administering the new subsidies.\n       The Republican-led House last year passed an amendment, 246 \n     182, sponsored by Rep. Jo Ann Emerson (R Mo.) that would have \n     prevented the IRS from hiring new personnel or initiating any \n     other measures to mandate that people purchase health \n     insurance. The measure, strongly opposed by the Obama \n     administration, was subsequently dropped from a larger bill \n     that averted a government shutdown.\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. This money is transferred outside the normal \nappropriations process. That is a concern. The money is transferred \noutside the normal appropriations process. It goes to the very tax \nagency that is responsible for implementing many of the key provisions \nof the health care law. One would think that maybe we would have \ndoctors and nurses implementing many of the provisions of the health \ncare law. No, we have the IRS. This includes the controversial and \nunprecedented mandate that all Americans must buy a government-approved \nproduct--health insurance.\n  We remember the Supreme Court just held hearings on this \nunprecedented mandate. Seventy percent of Americans believe it is \nunconstitutional. They believe that either part or all of the health \ncare law ought to be ruled unconstitutional. Yet the article says that \nthe Obama administration's Health and Human Services Department has, to \ndate, transferred almost $200 million to the IRS over the past 2 years \nand plans to send another $300 million this year. These secretive \ntransfers hide the true cost of the health care law. They also make it \ndifficult for Congress to perform the agency oversight that is part of \nour obligation.\n  So I look at this and I say this law is bad. It is bad, I believe, \nfor our patients and providers and taxpayers. I look at the way it has \nbeen structured and the way this money is being transferred and I think \nit highlights the problems with the law. What does the IRS intend to \ndo? They want to hire more than 300 new employees next year to \nimplement the Tax Code changes, such as the taxes imposed on drug \ncompanies, device manufacturers, and health insurers. This bill is a \nlaundry list of taxes and fees. The IRS also has to implement and \nmonitor the laws of the priciest component--the exchange subsidies. For \nthis, the IRS is asking Congress to fund another 537 new employees \ndedicated to administering just the subsidies.\n  Last week Ways and Means Committee Chairman Camp sent a letter to\n\n[[Page S2475]]\n\nthe IRS Commissioner asking that the Commissioner provide specific \ndetails about these reports.\n  Chairman Camp specifically asked the IRS Commissioner to tell the \ncommittee how many employees are being hired and which tax increases \nthe agents will be working on. The American people deserve to know how \ntheir dollars are being spent, where these tax dollars are being used, \nwhat the IRS is doing with the money. They deserve to know because the \nhealth care law actually increases the IRS's power to insert itself \ninto the American people's lives.\n  How is it the health care law increases the IRS's power to insert \nitself into Americans' lives? By, one, having the IRS verify that \nAmericans have acceptable government-approved insurance; also by having \nthe IRS penalize Americans if they do not have acceptable government-\napproved insurance; also by having the IRS confiscate Americans' tax \nrefund dollars if they do not have government-approved insurance; and, \nfinally, by having the IRS have additional power in terms of auditing \nour American citizens' lives.\n  This is all included in the health care law. This is not health care \nreform. The IRS should never be allowed to intrude into the private \nhealth care decisions of the American people. The American people \ndeserve to know how this alleged $500 million transfer is being spent \nand how many additional IRS agents will be hired to investigate their \nprivate health care decisions.\n  When Americans send their hard-earned dollars to Washington, they \nwant to make sure their money is being spent wisely. The American \npeople want to know they are getting value for their tax dollars. They \ndo not want their dollars to create more bureaucracy and further invade \ntheir privacy.\n  So I come to the floor, as I have over the last couple years since \nthe health care law has been passed, with a doctor's second opinion. \nThis health care law did not provide the American people with what they \nwanted, which was the care they need, from a doctor they want, at a \nprice they can afford. Instead, what they are seeing is the President's \npromises have been broken.\n  The President promised if someone likes their care, they can keep it. \nWe now know that is not going to be true for many Americans. The \nPresident promised health care costs would actually go down instead of \ngoing up and he told Congress and he told others the health care \ninsurance costs would drop $2,500 per family. Instead, what families \nacross the country have seen is that their health care premiums have \ngone up by about $2,100 a year since the health care law has gone into \neffect, rather than going down. So we hear the President's promises and \nwe see the reality on the ground.\n  When I travel Wyoming and talk to folks and ask: How many of you \nbelieve under the health care law your own costs--your own costs--are \ngoing to go up, despite the President's promises they are going to go \ndown, every hand goes up. When I ask the question: How many of you \nbelieve the quality of your own care--which is what people are \nconcerned about: their own care, their own family--how many of you \nbelieve the quality of your own care will go down, again, every hand \ngoes up. That is not what Americans want: paying more and getting less. \nThat is why it is time to repeal and replace this terrible health care \nlaw.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Postal Service Reform\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise to discuss this postal reform bill. \nThe Postal Service keeps rural America connected. It helps Montana \nseniors receive everyday necessities such as medicines, it allows our \nsmall businesses to conduct business, and it even makes sure our \nelection ballots get counted on time. That is why this reform bill is \nso critically important all across rural America.\n  First, I wish to thank my colleagues on the committee for their hard \nwork on the substitute amendment to the postal reform bill. I want them \nto know how much I appreciate their efforts to work across the aisle \nwith my colleagues and me to address several of our concerns with this \nbill. This bill has come a long way from the version I opposed in \ncommittee. But there is still a lot of work that needs to be done to \nmake sure it works for rural America.\n  I have been working for several months on some changes, such as \npreserving the requirement for overnight delivery and providing better \nprotection for rural communities that could lose their post offices. \nBut we need to go further to find more ways to keep rural post offices \nopen and functioning. That is why Senator Franken and Senator Levin and \nI have submitted an amendment to prevent the Postal Service from \nclosing a post office if it leaves rural communities without sufficient \naccess to Postal Services, from buying stamps to regular mail service.\n  Our amendment gives the Postal Regulatory Commission more teeth in \nbeing able to reject the Postal Service's efforts to close post offices \nand mail processing facilities if the Postal Service does not follow \nthe criteria laid out in the bill.\n  The Postmaster General is seeking to close around 3,700 post offices \nand over 200 mail processing facilities in this country.\n  This bill will result in the reduction of another 100,000 postal \nemployees. It will rewrite the rules of workers' compensation across \nthe entire Federal Government. In short, it will change the lives of \nmany people--to say nothing of the millions of Americans who will be \nimpacted by a change in mail service.\n  With this in mind, I think it is critically important that the upper \nmanagement at the Postal Service and the Board of Governors lead by \nexample. That is why I am offering an amendment to reduce the number of \nGovernors on the Postal Board of Governors from nine to seven. The \nBoard is currently not at capacity, and it should be encouraged to work \nwith the six Governors who presently sit on the Board.\n  Governors receive compensation for expenses and a stipend of about \n$30,000 a year, with total compensation up to about $42,600. It seems \nlike a small savings. However, reducing up to $80,000 a year by cutting \ntwo positions could save three post offices in my State: For example, \nin Dupuyer or Wyola or Coffee Creek.\n  We need to make sure everyone is tightening their belts, not just the \nfolks who depend on mail service or the employees who will be forced \ninto retirement or laid off over the next few years.\n  My final amendment limits the six most senior postal executives--\nincluding the Postmaster General--to a base salary of not more than \n$200,000, which is what a Cabinet Secretary makes.\n  I know there are some folks who think the Postal Service should be a \nprivate enterprise and that the pay of the postal executives should \nreflect that. But the reality is, the Postal Service is a public \nservice. It is right there in the Constitution that the Congress has \nthe power to establish post offices. You cannot get much more public \nthan that.\n  Again, the savings from this amendment may seem like a drop in the \nbucket, but saving just $200,000 a year in reduced executive \ncompensation is the same savings we would get from the closure of the \nmail processing centers in Helena, Montana's State capital, and Havre, \nan important town in north-central Montana.\n  To me, the choice is simple. If the Postal Service is out of money \nand painful cuts have to be made, they need to be felt up at the top as \nmuch as at the bottom.\n  I hope we get a chance to consider these amendments. They are \nrelevant to the bill. This is a debate that is long overdue. It is time \nto have a serious debate in the Senate about what we want the Postal \nService to look like. That is why I voted to begin the debate on a bill \nI cannot support yet. I want to get to the point where we have a bill \nthat is going to save the Postal Service and not lead to its \ndismantling.\n  So let's have the debate, let's look at amendments, and let's start \nvoting.\n  I'd like to add one additional point that is of critical importance \nto rural America.\n\n[[Page S2476]]\n\n  I have expressed my concern that the Postal Service is rushing to \nclose rural post offices, and I have asked the Postmaster General to \nfind alternatives to this effort.\n  Many people aren't aware that, in rural America, nearly 90 percent of \npostal facilities are owned by private parties and leased to the Postal \nService, rather than the Postal Service owning those facilities itself. \nAcross the nation as a whole the Postal Service leases more than one-\nthird of its facilities.\n  Without the Postal leasing program, the Postal Service would not be \nable to meet its mandate of universal service. It would not be able to \nprovide mail service to huge swaths of our nation in rural America. By \npartnering with the private sector, the Postal Service has facilities \nand provides service without the enormous expense of constructing, \nowning and maintaining its own buildings.\n  More than 40 of the postal facilities in Montana are leased by the \nPostal Service. In all, more than 3,000 private property owners lease \nfacilities to the USPS across America. Without the Postal leasing \nprogram, the infrastructure to serve many parts of America either would \nsimply not exist or would require massive expenditures on building \nfacilities that the Postal Service cannot afford.\n  As the Postal Service explores options about the future of rural post \noffices across America, I urge it to look carefully at the leasing \nprogram and to realize the role it plays in saving money and providing \nuniversal mail service. Both of those roles are critically important. \nSo as we make the tough choices about the how we can preserve rural \npost offices, I hope that the Postal Service will continue to consider \nthe leasing program as part of its future.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/18/senate-section/article/S2476-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2476-S2489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              RESTORE ACT\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr President, this week marks the somber anniversary 2 \nyears ago, on Friday, April 20, 2010, of an explosion on the Deepwater \nHorizon oilrig in the Gulf of Mexico which took 11 lives and triggered \nthe worst oilspill in American history. We still remember the families \nof those who were lost and those who were injured on that fateful day. \nWe are forever grateful to the thousands of volunteers and relief \nworkers from all over the world who responded in the wake of this \ndisaster.\n  In Mississippi, like other Gulf States, the BP oilspill caused \nimmeasurable damage not only on the shoreline but also to all sectors \nof our economy. Misperceptions of tainted seafood and oil-covered \nbeaches devastated our seafood and tourism industries. Local businesses \nalready challenged by a difficult economy were crippled by the \ndisruption in market demand.\n  The moratorium that the Obama administration put on drilling cost our \neconomy critical jobs related to domestic energy production and its \nassociated support industries. The administration's delays on drilling \npermits are still stalling job creation along the gulf coast.\n  Many of my colleagues and I have come to the floor in recent weeks to \ntalk about a better energy policy, specifically to offer solutions to \nlower gas prices. The administration's slowdown of domestic energy \nproduction keeps us dependent on foreign energy providers, ultimately \nhurting Americans at the pump.\n  There is no doubt that the residents of Mississippi and other Gulf \nStates are resilient and have persevered through unprecedented \ncircumstances. But there is work left to do. I urge all of my \ncolleagues to remain committed to the coast's full recovery. I applaud \nthe Senate's recent bipartisan passage of the RESTORE Act as part of \nthe Transportation bill. It is imperative that coastal communities have \nthe resources they need to rebuild and revitalize.\n  Under the provisions of the RESTORE Act, local officials will have \nthe ability to prioritize the economic and ecological projects that are \nmost critical to their own recovery. Local communities are in the best \nposition to make these decisions, and needless government redtape \nshould not stand in the way. Directly distributing Clean Water Act \nfines would ensure that the affected parties are compensated \naccordingly.\n  The RESTORE Act is an encouraging step forward for all Gulf Coast \nStates.\n  I urge the House of Representatives to show the same support for the \ngulf coast in passing this important piece of legislation. Both parties \ncan agree that the revitalization of our Gulf States is a priority and \nthat providing local perspectives is vital to our recovery efforts. The \ndisaster that occurred 2 years ago was an extraordinary tragedy with \nlong-term consequences, and we cannot forget about the needs that \npersist.\n  The gulf coast provides one-third of the seafood harvested in the \ncontinental United States. The gulf coast is home to 6 of our country's \n10 largest commercial ports. Mississippi and all Gulf States make up a \nvibrant part of this country, and the residents and businesses there \nare key contributors to the national economy.\n  There is no doubt that keeping our gulf strong is vital to our \nnational interest, and part of that would be the passage of the RESTORE \nAct.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I concur with my friend from Mississippi \non the importance of passing the RESTORE Act. It is in our \ntransportation reauthorization bill, and it is an important part. It \nnot only helps the Gulf States but all the States that border oceans in \nthis country. It is an important part of the bill that we worked out in \na consensus manner in the Senate.\n  I take this time and ask unanimous consent that I may speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Surface Transportation Act\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, we need to pass a long-term transportation \nreauthorization bill. The Senate has done this. The Senate passed its \nbill 2 months ago by a very strong margin of 74 to 22. I call it a \nconsensus bill and not a bipartisan bill, because we went beyond \nbipartisan. This bill came out of the two committees of jurisdiction, \nthe Banking Committee and the Environment and Public Works Committee, \nby a unanimous vote. The Finance Committee dealt with the financing \nprovisions.\n  This bill gives us predictability in transportation funding. Here is \nthe problem: The other body, the House, is currently working on a bill \nthat would basically be a short-term extension of our transportation \nprogram. We need a long-term commitment as to the Federal partnership \nin transportation. We need that for many reasons. We need it for \npredictable funding so our local governments can commit to do the types \nof transportation programs that are necessary for our safety, necessary \nfor economic expansion, and necessary for our communities.\n  We are missing the construction season by the failure to enact a \nlong-term transportation reauthorization plan. Major projects cannot be \nplanned--whether it is to replace a bridge, major maintenance programs, \nnew highways, or expansion of our transit systems.\n  This translates into jobs. We are in a recovery. We all want to do \neverything we can to maintain and expand job opportunities in this \ncountry so our economy can recover at a quicker pace. The \ntransportation reauthorization bill that passed the Senate is \nresponsible for 3 million jobs.\n  In my State of Maryland, 28,700 jobs are connected to the passage of \nthe transportation reauthorization program--21,000 in highways and over \n7,000 in transit.\n  The Senate bill, as I pointed out, was a consensus bill. It was done \nin the finest manner of legislating. I compliment Senators Boxer and \nInhofe on the Environment and Public Works Committee, on which I serve, \nfor marshaling this bill through. There were\n\n[[Page S2477]]\n\nnumerous challenges in the Senate, and a number of committees had to \nconsider it and, of course, there was floor consideration. During that \nentire process, we maintained the consensus and the balance that is \nimportant.\n  Let me point out that here you have a bill that invests in transit \nand roads and bridges. We were able to reach a compromise to make sure \nthat both priorities were preserved in the transportation \nreauthorization bill.\n  I authored an amendment, with Senator Cochran, that dealt with local \ninput into the transportation decisions. We had the right balance \nbetween the Federal Government's partnership working with our States \nbut allowing the locals to have input particularly on transportation \nenhancement programs. We have reform in our bill that consolidates a \nlot of specific programs into broader programs, providing greater \nflexibility, but still maintaining accountability on the Federal \npartnership.\n  During this most recent work period, when we were off for Easter and \nPassover, I visited various parts of Maryland. I was down in western \nMaryland, Appalachia country. I heard firsthand how important \nreauthorization of this transportation bill is to the economy of \nwestern Maryland. This is a rural part of our State. They need to build \na north-south highway that will connect Pennsylvania, West Virginia, \nand Maryland. The bill we passed--the transportation reauthorization \nbill--contains some very important provisions to allow that highway to \nbe constructed. It provides toll credits so Pennsylvania can complete \nan important segment of this north-south highway. It also contains a \nstronger match so that it makes it more feasible that we can move this \nhighway to completion. The completion of the north-south highway means \njobs and hope to the people of that region of America. It is very \nimportant to get that done. It will mean jobs. They told me--the \ncompanies that are directly dependent upon that highway being \nconstructed--if we don't pass a multiyear reauthorization bill, that \nproject gets delayed. Once it is delayed, we lose job opportunities.\n  I also spent part of the work period visiting other parts of \nMaryland. I was a few miles from here at the Metro Command, at the \nCarmen Turner facility in New Carollton, where they operate the bus and \nrail command center for the Nation's transit system, which is both bus \nand rail in this area. It is the Nation's system. The Federal \nGovernment depends upon this, upon the Washington transit system. Many \npeople who work in the Capitol come to us through the transit program. \nIt is true in all of the Federal facilities.\n\n  That is an aging system. The rail system needs to be repaired. It is \nthe second busiest rail transit system in the Nation. It is in \ndesperate need of repair. Without predictable funding, major projects \nwill be delayed. I will give you a list of some of the projects we need \nto do for the Washington metro transit system:\n  Overhauling the Landover and Southern Avenue bus maintenance shop in \nPrince George's County, MD; improving perimeter security at the \nBladensburg bus garage, also in PG County; complete the design and \nconstruction of 10,000 feet of test track at Greenbelt that is needed \nto test the new, safer 7,000 series railcars due to arrive in 2014.\n  I remind my colleagues that we had a tragedy on the transit system \nhere not too long ago. There was a study done as to improvements that \nneed to be made, including replacement of railcars to safer cars. These \nchanges need to be done to improve safety of people who depend upon the \ntransit system in this region. Also we need to continue to implement \nsystemwide switch testing and replacement needed to comply with the \nNational Transportation Safety Board's safety recommendations following \nthe June 2009 red-line crash. All of that will be delayed. Yes, safety \nwill be put at risk if we do not pass a reauthorization of the \ntransportation program.\n  It is interesting that one part of my State is very rural, which I \nvisited, and the other part of the State is urban, and it is important \nto that region. It is important to the entire country. We need to get \nthis done. Every State is impacted by bridge replacement, highways, and \ntransit.\n  The Maryland Department of Transportation tells me that due to the \nuncertainty, they are planning on a 20-percent reduction in the \nprojects that would otherwise be done in this year. That will have a \nhuge impact on our workforce--a huge impact on our economy.\n  As I am speaking, the House is taking action. It is going to pass a \nshort-term extension. That is not good enough. That doesn't solve the \nproblem. That doesn't give us the predictability or allow us to \ncomplete the north-south highway in western Maryland, or make the \nimprovements we need to in the WMATA system, or in any State, to be \nable to move forward with transportation projects. That is not good \nenough. We need to do more.\n  However, I am pleased to see the House taking some action. I urge \nthat as soon as they complete action, let's get into conference and \nresolve the differences between the House and Senate and get a bill \nback on the floor as quickly as possible. We did our work. We passed a \nbipartisan consensus bill. They are passing a partisan bill in the \nother body. They are delaying things again. That is not good.\n  Let's get together and complete a conference as quickly as possible. \nLet's get Americans back to work building roads and transit systems \nthat are vital to the continued economic recovery of this Nation.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. RUBIO. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I think this is topical to the item we are \ndebating, which is to proceed to the Violence Against Women Act, and I \nwish to take a moment to highlight a couple of egregious examples \naround the world where young girls and women are being threatened by \nviolence in what remains a scourge throughout the planet, and then I \nwill focus on here at home as well.\n  On April 17--and this is a pretty shocking incident--about 150 Afghan \nschool girls were poisoned after drinking contaminated water. It \nappears by all signals that it was a deliberate contamination of the \nwater. They are blaming this on conservative radicals who are opposed \nto female education. So there is evidence to suggest that 150 girls \nfrom Afghanistan were poisoned because they went to school. This is \nhappening in the 21st century.\n  A new report from the Human Rights Commission on Pakistan says there \nwere 943 Pakistani women killed in 2011 and they were killed for \n``honor.'' Of the 953 victims, 93 were minors. Around 595 of the women \nkilled in 2011 were accused of having ``illicit relations,'' and 219 of \nthem were accused of marrying without permission. Again, this is the \n21st century we are talking about where these things are happening. In \nfact, this same report, in 2010, says there were 791 honor killings of \nwomen in Pakistan.\n  Here is one that is really disturbing and very sick. In South Africa, \na group of young males in Soweta were filmed raping a 17-year-old who \nwas believed to be mentally ill. In fact, the term ``rapevideo'' was \ntrending on Twitter in South Africa on Wednesday. It is estimated by \nsome organizations that a woman is raped every 26 seconds in South \nAfrica. There is a report with regard to this specific Soweta rape that \nthe men promised the girl 25 cents if she kept silent.\n  Let's turn to our hemisphere for a moment, where, tragically, of the \n25 countries around the world with the highest homicide rates for \nwomen, 14 are in Latin America and the Caribbean, according to a recent \nsurvey by a Geneva-based research organization called Small Arms \nSurvey. The three most dangerous countries for women were El Salvador, \nJamaica, and Guatemala, respectively.\n  As a region, a U.N. study found in 2011 that the Americas, including \nthe United States and Canada, were ranked\n\n[[Page S2478]]\n\nsecond only to Africa for female homicide rates. While females \nrepresent only 10 percent of the murder victims in the Americas, the \nsheer level of violence in the region, particularly in Latin America, \nputs women at risk.\n  Here at home, I was honored a few weeks ago to sign a letter, along \nwith Senators Kirk, Blumenthal, and Cornyn, which we wrote to about 40 \norganizations back on April 12 to inform them that the parent company \nof the Village Voice publications they advertise on owns backpage.com, \nan online classified advertising Web site linked to dozens of child-\ntrafficking cases in this country. We asked these companies, charitable \norganizations, and public, educational, and cultural institutions to \nwork together to use their economic influence to stop this from \nhappening, to stop this online child sex trafficking that is being \nfacilitated by sites such as these.\n  I want to report to my colleagues today that there has been some \nprogress. This letter is already having an impact. We have had \nrepresentatives from two of the recipients of the letter respond that \ntheir companies will quickly act to end their advertising on the \nVillage Voice publications.\n  The fact is what I just outlined now is happening here in the United \nStates of America. I highlighted things happening around the world, and \nI highlighted a case of something we can be doing right now here in the \nUnited States.\n  The reason I come to the floor on occasion to speak about human \nrights violations that are happening around the world and in our own \ncountry is to remind us that atrocities are not just things that \nhappened in history, they are happening today. If we just open a \nnewspaper and open our eyes, we will find modern-day atrocities that \nrival things we have read about in history. Things we might believe are \nunimaginable or impossible are occurring in this century. Here in our \ncountry, we have instances such as this, where it is estimated that up \nto 300,000 children could potentially be at risk--300,000 people, young \nwomen, children, et cetera, in our hemisphere--to become victims of \nhuman trafficking. Part of that happens here in our own country. So we \nhave an obligation to focus on these issues.\n  I will continue to use this forum and any opportunity I get to \nhighlight human rights abuses that are happening across the world and \nin our own country because awareness is always the first step toward \nconfronting these issues. The notion that one can somehow get away with \nthis without condemnation encourages people to do more of it, \nencourages people to think they can get away with it, encourages people \nto think it may even be culturally acceptable. It is not culturally \nacceptable for any civilized people to stand by and watch human beings \nbeing enslaved, trafficked, abused, or targeted. We cannot stand by \nsilently--and I am not claiming anyone in this Chamber does this--and \nargue that it is culturally acceptable to carry out an honor killing of \na woman because she got married without permission. That is outrageous \nand it is absurd. It has no place in our world.\n  If this Nation is to remain a leader on human rights, then those of \nus who serve it have an obligation to use forums such as this to call \nattention to egregious examples, such as those I cited today, and to \ncondemn them in the loudest voice possible. So in the weeks and months \nto come, I hope to continue to come to the floor and provide not just \nexamples of abuses happening around the world but also examples, such \nas the one I finished with today. That is an example of how we can, \nworking across the party aisle in this Chamber, work collaboratively to \ndo something about it. This letter to the advertisers on backpage.com \nin the Village Voice is just one example of the things we can be doing \nto ensure we condemn and put a stop to some of these most heinous \npractices.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, before I proceed to the Senator from \nMissouri, I want to thank my friend from Florida for his principled and \npassionate statement. He speaks from his own experience--his family's \nown experience in leaving a dictatorship in Cuba and coming to the \nfreedom of this country, but he speaks more broadly from the depths of \nAmerican history and American experience. We are a very different \nnation. We are different from our beginning because we defined \nourselves not by our geographical borders but by our values and the \nvalues expressed in the Declaration of Independence about those human \nrights, that life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness are the \nendowment of our Creator. Those rights, obviously, were not just the \nendowment God gave the people of the United States but all human beings \nanywhere on this planet. It is what makes us a great nation. I think \nthe extent to which we hold to that principle that was the motivation \nfor our founding is one by which we can measure ourselves day by day.\n  I really appreciate that the Senator from Florida has committed \nhimself both to the upholding and the application of the principle of \nhuman rights, the sanctity of human rights, and America's role in \nprotecting them, and to persistently continue to come to the floor to \nspeak of particular cases where that principle is being violated. I \nhappened to be on the floor for the postal reform bill, but I wanted to \ntake this opportunity to thank him for his very compelling statement.\n  I yield the floor to my friend from Missouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n\n                             Postal Reform\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I spent a lot of my childhood in a \nvery small town in Missouri. From the time I was about 3 years old \nuntil the fourth grade, I lived in a town called Lebanon, MO. My dad \nwas a life insurance salesman and sold life insurance, in fact to many \nof the soldiers at Fort Leonard Wood, and my mother's family had the \ncorner drugstore about a block off Main Street in Lebanon, MO.\n  I have fond and vivid memories of my childhood in Lebanon, and one of \nthem was the trip I would take whenever I was hanging out down at my \nfamily's drugstore. This was my great-uncle and great-aunt who had \nraised my mother, so they were like my grandparents. He was the \npharmacist and she ran the lunch counter at the drugstore, and I would \ngo with my great-uncle on his run to the post office. We would walk up \n2 blocks and go into the post office. I even remember how it smelled. I \nremember how it looked. I remember what happened there. My memory is \nthat it was a gathering place, that I would have to tug on my great-\nuncle's coat and say, ``Let's go, Uncle Tom. Let's go'' because he \nwould invariably find people at the post office with whom he needed to \nvisit. It wasn't a big place, but it was a very important place in \nLebanon, MO.\n  I rise today to talk about an amendment that will save that sense of \ncommunity for dozens of rural towns in Missouri. I am very aware, as a \nformer auditor and someone who spends a lot of time looking at our \nbudgets and trying to figure out the numbers, of the crisis we have in \nterms of the fiscal sustainability of our Postal Service.\n  I commend the work of the committee on which I am lucky to serve with \nSenator Lieberman as the chair and Senator Collins as the ranking \nmember. It is one of the places where we have maintained strong \nbipartisanship in the Senate. In fact, I believe Senator Lieberman's \ncommittee could serve as a role model for other committees on how to \nwork in a bipartisan way. And I commend Senator Carper and many \nothers--Senator Brown of Massachusetts and also Senator Merkley--who \nhave worked on this amendment, also, trying to find a way to save these \nrural post offices.\n  I know we have a problem here, but when we look at the numbers, \nclosing rural post offices doesn't help. It is 1 percent--less than 1 \npercent--of the budget. It is less than 1 percent of the amount of \nsavings we need to save out of the postal budget. So in 167 different \ncommunities in my State, something that is essential far beyond the \nbricks and mortar to those communities would close all in the name of \nless than 1 percent. That doesn't make sense to me.\n  The strength of our Postal Service has been that it is reliable, that \nit is affordable, and that it goes to the very last mile. What will we \nlose in these communities if we shut down these\n\n[[Page S2479]]\n\npost offices? Senior citizens would lose a place where they can depend \non getting their prescription medicines. Many of these communities have \nno pharmacies--in fact, most of them don't--and they rely on the mail \nfor their drugs. Small business owners would lose a shipping location. \nThe small business owners in these rural communities depend on that \npost office to take packages to and to receive packages from. I think \nthis is a sacrifice we should not make. These post offices are worth \nfighting to save.\n  When I go home and meet with Missourians and when I get outside of \nSt. Louis and Kansas City and Springfield and Columbia, almost every \nsingle time, someone walks up to me and talks about their post office. \nThey feel strongly that it is the one symbol they have in their \ncommunity that makes them viable as a community, and I would hate to \nsee them lose it.\n  I believe we should look at the closure of these post offices as a \nvery last resort. Frankly, to me, it looks knee-jerked because it \ndoesn't appear to me to be very thoughtful. I have not been able to get \nthe post office to even give me the rhyme or reason as to why some of \nthese post offices are closing. Very few of them save a significant \namount of dollars.\n\n  This amendment would impose a 2-year moratorium on rural post office \nclosures to allow the Postal Service to enjoy some of the reforms that \nhave been put in this bill in a very thoughtful and thorough process by \nChairman Lieberman and many of his colleagues. It would also say after \n2 years that there is a specific list of transparent criterion that \nmust be considered before a post office could be closed.\n  First, it would have to ensure that seniors could retain the same \naccess to their prescriptions they receive in the mail, that seniors \nand those with disabilities would have the same access to postal \nservices they currently do, and make sure small businesses are not \nfinancially harmed by a rural post office closure.\n  This is not kicking the can down the road. This is being more \nthoughtful about preserving the part of the Postal Service that defines \nit. I am hopeful this is not a Republican or a Democratic issue. I am \nhopeful this is a rural issue.\n  We all know the last mile is the most expensive. Throughout the \nhistory of our country, government has stepped in and done a little \nmore to give services the last mile. No business model in the world \nworks when you have to take services that last mile down that one road, \nall the way down to a house at the end of the road sometimes several \nmiles. It didn't work for electricity, so we did things to help with \nrural electric co-ops. It didn't work for phones, so we did the USX \nfund to help with phones. It didn't work for broadband, so we stepped \nin and have done things to assist with broadband. Now we are going to \nsay to these rural communities: The last mile is not as important. \nThese post offices are not as important. We can make due without it.\n  I think that is a big mistake, and I hope we can save these rural \npost offices. This is very important in my State, and I want young \ngirls who are growing up in these small communities to have the same \nwarm and fond memories of the local post office that I carry with me \nevery day.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank Senator McCaskill for her \nstatement. What is interesting, this is one of those cases where maybe \nwe appreciate something more than we would every day when we think it \nmay disappear. It is true of institutions as well as people. There is \nno question that post offices, both in rural areas and small towns--and \nI will say for Connecticut, in neighborhoods and cities--that the post \noffice has played an important community-building role. But beyond \nthat, in a tough time economically, a lot of people depend on those \npost offices for their mail, for their prescription drugs, and for the \nbusiness interactions they need. But here is the other side of it, \nwhich my friend from Missouri knows very well.\n  We have 32,000 post offices in America. If we consider them to be \nretail outlets, which they are, that is more retail outlets than \nWalmart, Starbucks, and McDonald's combined. But we are talking about \nnecessities. So we are very concerned that post offices not be closed \nin a precipitous manner if some have to be closed.\n  So as my friend from Missouri knows, we put language in this bill \nthat doesn't stop the process of review but forces the Postal Service \nto consider other options, such as consolidating post offices within a \nreasonable distance, reducing the number of operating hours, for \ninstance, and permitting a contractor or a rural carrier to provide \nretail services in the communities served by the post office.\n  We also allow an appeal to the Postal Regulatory Commission, and I \nknow there are other amendments that will come in to strengthen that \npart of the bill.\n  We have to find a balance between the financial pressures on the post \noffice--which, if unresponded to, will take it down--and the continuing \ndependence that millions of American people, including in small towns \nand rural areas, have on the post office.\n  Just a final word. Some of our colleagues have come to the floor and \nspoken about the post office as if it was in its entirety a relic which \nhas no purpose anymore because of the Internet. Obviously, the Internet \nis affecting the volume of first-class mail. But the fact is today--I \nrepeat, every day 563 million pieces of mail are delivered by the \nPostal Service, as you said, consistent with the promise of universal \nservice anywhere you are, anywhere your business is.\n  Incidentally, that capacity to deliver to the last mile is one of the \ngreat, unique, irreplaceable assets of the Postal Service, so \nirreplaceable that big private sector companies such as FedEx and UPS \ndepend on it. People depend on the Postal Service increasingly for \npackages too. I maybe have a limited horizon, but I still can't \nconceive of an Internet that can transport a package from one place to \nanother, and a lot of those packages are needed by the recipients, \nincluding, particularly, prescription drugs.\n  So I thank my friend from Missouri. I say that Senator Collins and I \nwould like to work with her. I think we can find a way without doing \ndamage to the purpose of the bill to accommodate the concerns about the \npreservation of rural post offices, and I look forward to doing so.\n  I might add this for the information of Members who haven't said this \nyet today: Yesterday, both cloakrooms hotlined--in the vocabulary of \nthe Senate--a request to every Senator to indicate whether they have an \nintention to file amendments. At this point, we have a list of over 50 \namendments that have been filed. Senator Collins and I, Senator Carper, \nand Senator Brown are working to try to reduce that to a number that \ncan be the basis, I hope, of a bipartisan agreement to go ahead and \ndebate those amendments and vote on them.\n  We have a cloture vote that probably will occur tomorrow, unless \nvitiated, which will critically determine whether we have the 60 votes \nthat say we can go forward. If we get those 60 votes, I think we can \ncome to an agreement on a number of amendments, have a good, open \ndebate, both sides, and then pass this bill.\n  If we don't pass this bill or if we don't achieve the 60 votes \ntomorrow, it is not as if nothing is going to happen to the post \noffice. The fact is the deficit will continue to build, and let me be \nmore specific.\n  A while back the Postmaster General issued a notice, which he was \nrequired to do, saying that as of May 15, less than a month from now, \nhe would have a list of mail processing facilities--not post offices \nbut mail processing facilities--which are candidates for closure. I \nbelieve he will close some on or about May 15 unless there is movement \non this bill.\n  So I hope we can reason together; that we can agree on a good, \nbalanced, representative, bipartisan group of amendments and, most of \nall, that we will not block the bill from being taken up for the lack \nof 60 votes to grant cloture and stop any attempt at a filibuster.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S2480]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Pat Summitt\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, today, the University of Tennessee, \nwhere I was once President, announced that our basketball coach, Pat \nSummitt, is resigning after 38 years in that position. Women's college \nbasketball will never be the same without Pat Summitt and women's \ncollege basketball would not be the same were it not for Pat Summitt's \n38 years of leadership. There will be much said about her winning \nrecord, and it is an astonishing accomplishment: 1,098 wins in \nbasketball, more than any other coach, man or woman, in the sport; 8 \nnational championships; in the Southeastern Conference, 32 Southeastern \nConference titles, 31 straight trips to the NCAA tournament. But the \nstatistic I always valued most, especially when I was president of the \nuniversity, was every single one of Pat Summitt's athletes who have \ncompleted their eligibility with her have graduated from the University \nof Tennessee. That is over 38 years. So she has a remarkable record, \nfor which we all are very grateful.\n  It is hard for people outside Tennessee to understand how much Pat \nSummitt has become a part of the lives of so many citizens in our \nState. She actually was asked by the university to take over the \nbasketball program when she was in her early twenties. This was in \n1974. Back then, many women's basketball games were played with three \nwomen on one end and three women on the other end, offense and the \ndefense.\n  She changed all that in a big-time way. When I say women's college \nbasketball would not be the same without her, I mean that because \nalmost every women's coach in America would attest to the fact that Pat \nSummitt has played a role, either an important model or personal role \nin their development. Even before big games, she would have over to her \nhouse in Knoxville the opposing team and the opposing coach. She always \nhad time for community events in Knoxville, despite her busy schedule \nas such a winning coach. She is a terrific person individually and a \ngreat model.\n  She taught many of us in Tennessee the game of women's college \nbasketball. She was so upfront and personal about it, with her famous \nstare, which could stare anybody down, and her discussion of these \nextraordinary athletes she had and what their pluses were and what the \nthings were that they had to work on, that we all felt we not only knew \nher, but we knew the athletes as well.\n  I have enjoyed watching Pat Summitt's team for many years. I made a \npoint to watch three of her games in person this year in Knoxville. I \narranged my Senate schedule around it because I feared this might be \nher last season. She announced last year that she has Alzheimer's \ndisease and she is now devoting herself to fighting that disease. So I \nam sure she will be as accomplished in some appropriate way in the next \nstage of her life as she has been in the last 38 years.\n  I wanted to come to the Senate floor and say, on behalf of all the \npeople of our State, that women's college basketball will never be the \nsame without Pat Summitt, and women's college basketball would never be \nwhat it is today if it weren't for Pat Summitt.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to thank my friend for his \nmoving and eloquent statement, as a Senator from Connecticut, a proud \nfan and admirer of UConn women's basketball, with the great coach Geno \nAuriemma. No one appreciates someone such as Coach Summitt more than \nthose who have competed against her, including Coach Auriemma and the \ngreat players in the University of Connecticut women's basketball \nhistory.\n  She sets the standard and she has set the standard. I join my \ncolleague in his praise of her, and with some confidence, wishing her \nwell in the future.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Lieberman. I think it \nis appropriate, and most fans of women's college basketball would \nagree, that the first two Senators on the floor to commend Pat Summitt \nwould be the Senator from Tennessee and the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. It is fortuitous and I cannot believe it is \naccidental.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator for his generous remarks. I know \nPat would as well.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. If Geno Auriemma were here, he would have at least \nechoed what I had to say and added some great stories and words of \ntribute because I know the respect that Coach Auriemma has for Coach \nSummitt.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business \nfor about 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Postal Service Reform\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the importance \nof the Postal Service to Minnesota and to urge my colleagues to make \nthoughtful changes to strengthen S. 1789.\n  The Postal Service has proposed a cost-cutting plan that would close \nor consolidate nearly 3,700 mostly rural post offices. This plan will \neliminate thousands of jobs in communities across the country and will \nleave many residents and businesses without direct access to the Postal \nService. Of course, that includes Oregon, the Presiding Officer's \nState.\n  In Minnesota, 117 post offices are on the closure list. That includes \nthe post office in Calumet, MN, a town of 367 people in northeastern \nMinnesota. I have heard from the mayor of Calumet, John Tourila, about \nthe hardship that closing the post office would have on his community. \nHe told me about disabled residents who can't get a driver's license \nand how important it is that they are able to walk to the post office. \nHe also told me about an elderly couple in the town. The husband has \nAlzheimer's, and he and his wife take a walk every day, hand in hand, \nto the post office.\n  When the Postal Service held a public meeting in Calumet to discuss \nthe proposed post office closure, over 70 residents showed up. That is \na lot. That is about one-fifth of the town.\n  These are the stories I hear when I travel across Minnesota, \nespecially in rural Minnesota. Post offices are the center of so many \ncommunities. They serve as the gathering place and a source of \ninformation. Individuals and businesses rely on the Postal Service to \nreceive medications, paychecks, absentee ballots, equipment, and even \nlivestock. If the Postal Service's closure plan is implemented, it will \nhave a devastating impact on rural Minnesota.\n  The Postal Service has also proposed to close 250 processing \nfacilities. Five of Minnesota's processing facilities are on the block. \nUnder the Postal Service's plan, all of the mail processing activities \ncurrently taking place in Duluth, Bemidji, Mankato, Rochester, and \nWaite Park would be moved to the Twin Cities.\n  For anyone who hasn't driven around Minnesota, let me explain what \nthat means. When someone in Bemidji, MN, sends a birthday card to her \nneighbor or a local small business sends an invoice to a customer a few \nstreets away, that letter will be sent more than 200 miles south to the \nTwin Cities to be processed before it is sent 200 miles back north to \nBemidji.\n  That doesn't make any sense. During Minnesota winters when roads are \nimpassable, that is going to mean severe mail delay. It is going to \ndrive business away from these communities.\n  The processing centers in Rochester and Duluth are also on the list. \nThese are the third and fourth largest cities in Minnesota. Duluth is \nover 150 miles away from the Twin Cities. Closing these processing \ncenters will significantly impact local businesses and will drive \nbusiness away from the Postal Service. One important example is the \nDuluth News Tribune. This one business distributes over 2 million \npieces of mail annually through the Postal Service. Last year, they \npaid the Postal Service well over $400,000 for these\n\n[[Page S2481]]\n\nservices. If the Duluth processing center is closed, the Postal Service \nwill no longer be able to guarantee overnight delivery of local \nnewspapers. The Duluth News Tribune is going to have to find a \ndifferent way to deliver their papers--the daily paper. That will cost \nboth the businesses and the Postal Service a lot of money.\n  I have heard from hundreds of Minnesotans and met with postal \nworkers, mayors, concerned community members, and business leaders who \nrely on the Postal Service. What they all agree on is that we need a \nstrong and financially sound Postal Service. They understand that tough \nchoices need to be made and that some cuts are on the way. But not like \nthis, not by closing five of Minnesota's seven processing facilities \nand forcing the workers to move to the Twin Cities if they want any \nhope of keeping their jobs, not by closing nearly 3,700 post offices to \nsave less than 1 percent of the budget, not by slowing down mail so \nmuch that it will basically render it useless for many businesses.\n  The Post Office is in the Constitution. It is in the Constitution. It \nhas been around since the beginning of our country. There is a reason \nfor this. For centuries, universal service has been at the heart of the \nPostal Service's mission. It is the mission that is described in the \nConstitution. No matter where people live--be it in Minneapolis or \nInternational Falls, MN--people count on the Postal Service delivering \ntheir mail. The Postal Service gives us a connection to the outside \nworld. Somehow we have lost sight of that.\n  Senators Lieberman, Carper, Collins, and Scott Brown put forward a \nbill to reform the Postal Service. I wish to thank them all for their \nimportant work moving this bill forward. S. 1789 would refund \noverpayments the Postal Service has made to the Federal pension \nprogram. It will also reduce the requirement that the Postal Service \nprefund retiree health care benefits. I am very supportive of both of \nthese provisions. It could save the Postal Service over $15 billion \nover the next 2 years.\n  However, I believe the bill can be strengthened to maintain delivery \nstandards and better protect rural post offices. I have been working \nwith a group of my colleagues, including the Presiding Officer, led by \nSenator Sanders, to improve the bill. I wish to thank Senators Carper \nand Lieberman for working with us.\n  The managers' amendment addresses some of our concerns. Most \nimportantly, it would require the Postal Service to retain regional \novernight delivery standards. This will protect many processing \nfacilities. Importantly for Minnesota, it will likely keep the Duluth \nprocessing facility open.\n  But the substitute still doesn't do enough to protect rural post \noffices. I have introduced an amendment with my friends and colleagues, \nSenators Tester and Levin, that will give communities the opportunity \nto fight to prevent the closure of their local post offices and \nprocessing facilities.\n  Right now the Postal Regulatory Commission can review post office \nclosure decisions, but it can only issue advisory options. Our \namendment would give the commission authority to reverse post office \nand processing facility closure decisions. That would guarantee that \nindividuals and communities impacted by closures would have real \nrecourse. I urge my Senate colleagues to support our amendment.\n  We need to make thoughtful changes to S. 1789 and we need to act now. \nLast December, I joined with a number of my Senate colleagues in \npushing the Postmaster General for a 5-month moratorium on postal \nclosures. The moratorium is now running out and the Postal Service is \nnot waiting. It can't. On May 16, the Postal Service will close \nthousands of post offices and hundreds of processing centers. We need \nto act now.\n  Mr. President, I wish to now change the subject to speak about a \ntopic that hits close to home for many Minnesotans.\n  (The remarks of Senator Franken pertaining to the introduction of S. \n2295 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Tribute to Coach Pat Summitt\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I noted earlier the very eloquent \nexchange between the Senator from Tennessee and my colleague from \nConnecticut, Senator Lieberman, on Pat Summitt's resignation as the \ncoach for women's basketball at the University of Tennessee. I wanted \nto comment very briefly at the opening of my remarks on Pat Summitt--\nlike Senator Lieberman, a fan of UConn women's basketball team, a rival \nto the University of Tennessee, deeply entrenched rival, enthusiastic \nand stalwart rival--in recognition of her enormous contribution to \nwomen's sports.\n  As a coach, leader, and mentor Pat Summitt transformed women's \nathletics in America fundamentally and forever. Her passion for \nexcellence and her fight for fairness made her a force on and off the \ncourt. In a cause larger than herself, she achieved recognition for \nwomen's basketball, not just for her own team, and enriched the lives \nand careers of countless women.\n  Although her team was a rival of the University of Connecticut and I \nrooted against her when she played us, I wish her every good thing in \nthe years ahead and admire her continued courage and fortitude.\n\n\n                      NCAA Academic Progress Rate\n\n  Mr. President, I want to speak on another basketball topic, one that \nis serious to the University of Connecticut and to my State where we \nhave some wonderful student athletes--we do. The University of \nConnecticut has great student athletes. Connecticut residents have \nwatched with pride as the UConn Huskies, both the women's and men's \nteams, have brought home numerous basketball championships.\n  I am a strong believer that success in the classroom must accompany \nsuccess on the court. I support efforts by universities and the NCAA to \ndevelop rigorous academic standards for student athletes. I believe \nschools failing to meet these standards should be penalized. But I also \nbelieve these standards must be applied fairly, not capriciously or \narbitrarily.\n  Regrettably, the NCAA's application of its own rules appears to be \narbitrary, unjust, and unfair against the UConn men's basketball \nprogram. Last October, the NCAA adopted new standards that determined a \nschool's eligibility based on 2- or 4-year average academic progress \nrates, so called APRs. These standards set a high bar for performance, \nbut unfortunately they did not provide schools with a phase-in period \nfor the new rules.\n  Because these standards are based on several years of data, it is \npossible a school could be retroactively punished for actions that \noccurred before the rules were implemented. That is exactly what has \nhappened to the UConn men's basketball team. Those players have been \ntold they will not be eligible to compete in the 2013 postseason, \nincluding the Big East tournament and March Madness, because of the APR \nscores from the 2006 to 2010 academic years.\n  None of the players from those seasons remain on the UConn team now. \nThis severe punishment falls on players who are clear of any \nsubstandard academic performance. In fact, UConn's recent student \nathletes have demonstrated exemplary academic performance. The team's \nacademic progress rate for the 2010 to 2011 academic area was nearly \nperfect. The team's academic progress rate for the fall 2011 semester \nwas, in fact, perfect.\n  Instead of commending this improvement, the NCAA is ignoring it. The \nNCAA is basing its 2013 eligibility decision on data from the 2006 to \n2010 academic years. If they had included the scores from the 2010 to \n2011 academic years, UConn's average would be high enough to meet the \nNCAA's new standards.\n  UConn's administrators, coaches, and student athletes have placed a \nstrong\n\n[[Page S2482]]\n\nemphasis on academic performance. The school and students have worked \nhard to meet these standards and to improve academics. They have \ndemonstrated laudable success. Instead of this progress being \nacknowledged, it has been ignored by the NCAA, and these student \nathletes have been harshly punished for their predecessors' actions, \nnot for their own.\n  I have written--joined by my colleague from Connecticut, Senator \nLieberman--to the President of the NCAA, Mark Emmert, raising these \nobjections. We have been joined by other colleagues of the delegation. \nI ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Dear President Emmert: We write to express our concern with \n     the implementation of the National Collegiate Athletic \n     Association's (NCAA's) new structure for the Academic \n     Progress Rate (APR). As currently implemented, we believe \n     this structure will have unfair negative ramifications for \n     our academic institutions and their students.\n       As you are aware, last October the NCAA Board of Directors \n     adopted new standards (four year average of 900 or two year \n     average of 930) that institutions must meet in order to \n     qualify and participate in NCAA post-season championship \n     events. These standards were made effective immediately and \n     were to be applied to student-athlete academic performance \n     that had already occurred.\n       We appreciate and support the NCAA's pursuit of new \n     standards as a means to improve academic achievement. We are \n     dismayed, however, that the NCAA based eligibility for the \n     2013 NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament on data from the \n     already completed academic years of 2009 10 and 2010 11. As a \n     result, student-athletes and their institutions were given no \n     phase-in period, no opportunity to adjust to the new \n     standards, and no chance to avoid the penalty. We are deeply \n     concerned that with this action the NCAA is ignoring the \n     reality that more current data are now available to determine \n     an institution's most current APR for purposes of determining \n     eligibility for the 2013 Tournament. Using the most current, \n     available data would remedy the existing unfairness.\n       While we understand and support the goals of ensuring \n     quality educational opportunities for student-athletes and \n     the need for strong sanctions for failure to meet those \n     goals, we have misgivings about the retroactive \n     implementation of the penalty. In particular, the NCAA \n     appears to have imposed an overly harsh and unfair penalty by \n     imposing APR sanctions retroactively for conduct and \n     circumstances that had already occurred. By including \n     previous years in a rolling four year average, it should have \n     been clear at the time of adopting the new standard that some \n     universities would be unable to avoid the new penalties--even \n     if the university had achieved a stellar score in the most \n     current year. Due to this rule's retroactive application, \n     student-athletes, who are not in any manner culpable for the \n     APR performance that is the basis of these new penalties, \n     will be punished.\n       The uncompromised commitment to the academic success of \n     student-athletes remains the paramount responsibility for any \n     academic institution engaged in intercollegiate athletics. \n     With this obligation in mind, we support necessary and \n     reasonable measures that condition participation in \n     intercollegiate post-season events on a requisite level of \n     academic progress or achievement by student-athletes. \n     However, and no less critical, the process for developing, \n     adopting and implementing regulatory type measures that will \n     be applicable to all academic institutions must be grounded \n     in fundamental fairness. Only then will the regulatory \n     structure appropriately address the institutional \n     responsibility for academic success without penalizing \n     innocent individual student-athletes.\n       With the enactment of the new APR penalty structure, \n     however, we believe the NCAA has failed to meet this \n     important standard. The NCAA has the means to address this \n     matter at its upcoming meeting of the Committee on Academic \n     Progress on April 23. We therefore call on the NCAA to review \n     and modify the APR rule this session to remove its \n     retroactive application. Such an approach would be a sensible \n     and fair way to resolve this matter while ensuring tough \n     standards and penalties to ensure future compliance.\n       Thank you for your consideration of our concerns.\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. This letter expresses our outrage and frustration \nwith this process. It is a process that may be well intentioned. Its \ngoals may be laudable. Raising academic standards must be done, and I \nsupport that effort enthusiastically and passionately. But the \napplication of any rule must be fair, and applying them arbitrarily and \nunjustly undermines the credibility of the cause that is sought.\n  As we say to President Emmert of the NCAA: The present performance, \ncurrent data, and facts as they now are on the ground, on the court, in \nthe classroom are the ones that should be operative and determinative. \nTo deny this team an opportunity to demonstrate its excellence on the \ncourt as well as in the classroom and punish it for the failures of \npast teams is simply unfair and arbitrary. I hope its decision will be \nchanged.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nConnecticut for his words. I stand with him in this cause. You can say \nthis is parochial, but it is obvious that we are all--both of us and \nmost everybody in Connecticut are very proud of our UConn basketball \nprograms, both the men's and the women's. But there by the grace of the \nNCAA go every one of our colleagues and their teams.\n  Everybody understands and agrees that there has to be academic \nstandards. As Senator Blumenthal said so well, these standards are \nbeing unfairly applied to the University of Connecticut men's \nbasketball program in this case because they have been punished \nessentially already and they have corrected the shortcomings. They have \nhad what might be described as a perfect record in terms of players \nachieving academic--the threshold standard.\n  To keep them out of the NCAA tournament next year is unfair. Frankly, \nin a direct sense, it hurts the University of Connecticut in terms of \nthe revenues it needs to continue to produce not only good basketball \nbut great academic offerings. It also deprives basketball fans around \nthe country of a competition with all the best teams in it. And it has, \nfor our program at the University of Connecticut, consequences beyond \nnext year. In my opinion, this is cruel and unusual punishment.\n  I am very glad to be joining with Senator Blumenthal. He has taken \nthe lead on it, but I stand arm in arm with him and the other members \nof the Connecticut congressional delegation. We are going to push \nforward until we get this unjust decision overturned.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Levin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  (Mr. CASEY assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                      Matt Rutherford's Solo Sail\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I just had a very wonderful phone call \nfrom a young Matt Rutherford, a 31-year-old man. I have spoken about \nhim on the floor on a couple of occasions. He just made it safely home \non his boat, the St. Brendan. He just crossed the finish line, coming \nout of the Atlantic Ocean into the Chesapeake Bay.\n  For those of you who have not followed this story, about 309 days ago \nyoung Matt Rutherford, on a 27-foot sailboat--a 36-year-old sailboat to \nboot--left the Chesapeake Bay on one of the most audacious adventures \never undertaken. It has never been done before. He sailed his little \nboat out of the Chesapeake Bay. He sailed it in the Atlantic Ocean, up \naround Newfoundland, Labrador, by Greenland, and sailed that little \nboat through the Northwest Passage, from the Atlantic Ocean over to \nAlaska. He has been certified now as the first person to ever do so \nsolo in a small sailboat.\n  He sailed around Alaska. He sailed it from Alaska down to Cape Horn. \nMind you, he is by himself on a 27-foot boat. He rounded Cape Horn and \ncame up the east coast of South America, sailed up through the \nCaribbean, and is back, as of just a few hours ago, into the Chesapeake \nBay--solo, nonstop, all by himself. He never touched land in all these \ndays. He will set foot on land this Saturday at a homecoming in \nAnnapolis at the National Sailing Hall of Fame dock in Annapolis, this \nSaturday around noontime. I am sure it will be a big welcome for Matt \nRutherford.\n  To add frosting to the cake of what he did--which, again, is an \nincredible, incredible adventure--he did it to raise funds for CRAB, \nChesapeake Region Accessible Boating, which is an organization that \nhelps people with disabilities, including wounded warriors from our \narmed services who have service-connected disabilities, to get them out\n\n[[Page S2483]]\n\non boats that will teach them how to sail, to let them know they too \ncan participate in that recreational activity.\n  So to Matt Rutherford, who has done something that has never been \ndone before, welcome back. I am glad you are safe. I am glad you made \nit OK.\n  To those of you who want to catch up on this incredible, incredible \njourney--I mean, think about Robert Peary going to the North Pole. \nThink about Roald Amundsen going to the South Pole. Think about Sir \nFrancis Chichester sailing around the world in the Gypsy Moth IV, who, \nby the way, stopped once, or Joshua Slocum, who was the first person to \nsail solo around the world. Think about Sir Edmund Hillary climbing \nMount Everest. These are the kinds of people whom Matt Rutherford now \nstands alongside of in sailing solo. You can go to the Web site to \ncatch up on this. It is www.solotheamericas.org. To think about him \nsailing all the way around by the North Pole, all the way down, almost, \nto the South Pole, back up to America again--nonstop, never touched \nland, never stopped, and did it solo in a small 27-foot sailboat--it is \none of the great adventures of our time--of any time.\n  So I am happy he is back and he is safe and will be back on dry land \nthis Saturday.\n\n\n                          Rebuild America Act\n\n  Mr. President, as chair of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee, I have come to the floor on a number of occasions over the \nlast year to express my concern about the distressed state of the \nAmerican middle class. I do so again today in order to share with my \ncolleagues my ideas for how we can rebuild the middle class in America \nand make our economy work for those who work for a living.\n  Over the past year, while Washington has been gripped by a fear of \nbudget deficits, I gave speech after speech here on the Senate floor \npointing out an even more serious deficit: the deficit of vision in \nWashington, our failure to confront the current economic crisis with \nthe boldness earlier generations of Americans summoned in times of \nnational challenge.\n  By this economic crisis, I do not just mean the current economic \ndownturn. Instead, I am referring to the economic crisis that has taken \nplace over the last 30 to 40 years that has resulted in a shrinking \nmiddle class, rising inequality in our country, a weakened economy, and \na sense that the American dream is slipping away. This is the \nfundamental challenge--the fundamental challenge--facing our Nation \ntoday: rebuilding the American middle class.\n  Altogether, I now have chaired five HELP Committee hearings on the \ncrisis of the middle class. Last year my State staff visited all 99 \ncounties in Iowa to gain greater insight into the challenges facing \nworking Americans. During these events, I have heard from a diverse \narray of Americans, including economists, employers, union members, \ncommunity college students, and everyday, hard-working, middle-class \nfamilies. Not surprisingly, we found that more and more people are \nstruggling just to make ends meet. Their jobs are insecure, their \nsavings and pensions have shrunk, and they see an economic system that \nis rigged in favor of the very rich and the powerful.\n  At a hearing last June, I invited Amanda Greubel, a social worker in \nher local Iowa school district, to share her story with the HELP \nCommittee. During her testimony, she defined what it means to be in the \nmiddle class in this way:\n\n       My husband and I didn't have dreams of great wealth. We \n     never expected to have summer homes or expensive cars or \n     vacations on the Riviera. We chose careers that inspire us, \n     knowing that we would never make six-figure salaries. All we \n     have ever wanted is security and a little comfort . . . to \n     know that our bills are paid, our needs are met, that we can \n     have a getaway every now and then, that our children can \n     pursue higher education without the burden of student-loan \n     debt, and that someday we can retire and enjoy our final \n     years together in the way we choose. . . . When I think back \n     over our adult lives, it strikes me that we did everything we \n     were always told to do in order to have the American dream. . \n     . . We did everything that all the experts said we should do, \n     and yet still we're struggling. When you work as hard as we \n     have and still sometimes scrape for the necessities, it \n     really gets you down.\n\n  That was Amanda.\n  Unfortunately, those of us in Washington have not listened enough to \npeople such as Amanda. People such as Amanda do not feel this way \nbecause of factors such as ``globalization'' or ``technology change.'' \nIndeed, harnessing those developments has helped to make the U.S. \neconomy the envy of the world.\n  Instead, the crisis of the middle class can be traced largely to \nunwise policy choices made here in Washington. For starters, for the \nlast three decades, too many here in Washington have bought into the \nfailed economic doctrine that says if we give more and more to the very \nwealthy and to the largest corporations, then prosperity will somehow \ntrickle down to the rest of us. That idea has utterly failed to work \nfor the American people. It is time we get back to policies that are \npremised on how our economy really works. A strong, vibrant middle \nclass with money in their pockets to spend drives the economy forward \nbecause, very simply, businesses will not make things if they do not \nhave any customers.\n  As Mr. Nick Hanauer, a very successful private sector investor, put \nit in a recent Business Week column:\n\n       Rich business people like me don't create jobs. Middle-\n     class consumers do, and when they thrive, U.S. businesses \n     grow and profit.\n\n  So what is the best way forward? Instead of the slash-and-burn \napproaches of the past year and the failed economic doctrines of the \npast few decades, we need a way forward that rebuilds the middle class \nby reflecting the hopes and the can-do spirit of the American people, \npeople such as Amanda Greubel.\n  To meet the great challenge of our day, restoring and revitalizing \nthe middle class, after having a number of hearings last year, as I \nsaid, and countless visits with people throughout my State, I recently \nintroduced sweeping legislation called the Rebuild America Act. It now \nhas a number, S. 2252. This legislation provides comprehensive \nsolutions to rebuilding the American middle class.\n  Some will say it is too bold and too ambitious, but I disagree. The \nsweep of this legislation is commensurate with the extraordinary \nchallenge it addresses. The bill aims to rebuild the middle class in \nfour broad ways: creating jobs, investing in the future, helping \nfamilies, and bringing balance back into our tax system. Let me touch \nbriefly on those four principles.\n  One, we need to create jobs for all Americans, including for groups \nof Americans such as people with disabilities who have been especially \nhard hit by the recent recession. With the official unemployment rate \nover 8 percent, and some unofficial measures as high as 17 percent, the \nmiddle class will continue to lose ground.\n  When jobs are scarce, workers do not have the leverage to demand fair \ntreatment, paychecks stop growing, or even fall, and even people who \nare fortunate enough to have a job become fearful of losing it. People \nhave less discretionary money in their pockets or the confidence to \nspend it. In the absence of robust consumer demand, businesses choose \nnot to expand or invest.\n  Secondly, we must invest in our future. Not only will investing in \nour infrastructure help create badly needed jobs in the short term, \nthese investments will lay the groundwork for sustained economic growth \nin the long term. So my bill tackles this challenge head on by \nproviding for robust new investments in America's infrastructure, \nincluding, of course, time-tested things such as roads and bridges, \nenergy efficiency systems, also rebuilding and modernizing our public \nschools, rebuilding our manufacturing base in America.\n  In addition, there is also the investment in the human \ninfrastructure: helping prepare great teachers, providing better \npathways to good jobs for workers, job retraining so that the old jobs \nthat are now gone, we can now take those workers and retrain them for \nthe future jobs, to ensure that current and future workers will have \nthe education and skills they need to be successful and to be in the \nmiddle class.\n  Three, we need to do more to help middle-class families succeed. It \nis time for us in Washington to wake up to the harsh reality that \nmiddle-class families have been living in for the last few decades. \nUnfortunately, the programs and policies that helped create\n\n[[Page S2484]]\n\nthe middle class have been either intentionally discarded or have \nfallen victim to neglect.\n  For example, the real value of the minimum wage has declined for the \nlast four decades, dragging down all workers' paychecks. In 1968, that \nwas the height. That was when someone making the minimum wage had the \nhighest purchasing power ever since we had a minimum wage--1968. Since \nthat time, it has fallen in real terms. If, in fact, the minimum wage \nhad kept pace just with inflation from 1968 to today, the minimum wage \nwould be slightly over $10.30 an hour. Right now the Federal minimum \nwage is $7.25 an hour. So think of it this way: The same class of \npeople that was making the minimum wage in 1968 is basically the same \nclass of people making the minimum wage today: young people, \nminorities, people in businesses that are just starting, people who are \nnot highly educated, new immigrants to this country, for example. So \nthe same people who are making the minimum wage then are the same kind \nof class of people making the minimum wage today.\n  But think about it this way. That same class of people today--today--\nhas 30 percent less buying power than that same class had in 1968--30 \npercent less. Think about that. That same person making the minimum \nwage today is making 30 percent less than his or her counterpart in \n1968.\n  So what my bill does is basically over a stage raise that minimum \nwage and then peg it to inflation in the future so we do not have that \nerosion again in the future. Also families and workers have seen basic \nrights, such as the right to organize and to bargain collectively, \neroded. It is harder and harder and harder all the time for people to \norganize and join a union in this country.\n  The right to overtime pay has been eroded under the Fair Labor \nStandards Act. So a lot of these things have been eroded by misguided \nregulations, bad court decisions, and years of lax enforcement.\n  The fourth part of the bill. It is essential that we put balance back \nin the economy through a balanced tax system that will help reduce our \ndeficit, get our fiscal house in order over the longer term. To do so, \namong other provisions, my bill includes a tax on Wall Street trades, \noften called a financial transaction tax. At just 3 cents per $100 \ndollars in trade value, that would raise $350 billion over 10 years.\n  Again, you might say, well, is this something now? No. We had a \ntransaction tax, a financial transaction tax, in this country until \n1966. Then it was done away with. Well, that is again one of the \nreasons why we have seen this terrible inequality grow in our society \nwhere more and more of our wealth goes to fewer and fewer people.\n  A small transaction tax would do two things. It would raise money. It \nwould also discourage a lot of the spinning and the churning of \ntransactions on Wall Street whereby some of these traders make hundreds \nof thousands of dollars a day, megamillions of dollars a year, but not \nadding much to our economy at all. So it's a small transaction tax.\n\n  In addition, the bill requires high-income taxpayers to pay their \nfair share. Well, sort of like the Buffett rule that the present \noccupant of the chair, the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island, \nchampioned the other day that we voted on here. It got voted down on \nparty lines. I do not understand this, that we cannot even ask those \nwho have the most in our society to pay their fair share.\n  Well, just because we lost the vote on the Senate floor the other day \ndoes not mean we have to give up on it. I am sure the Senator from \nRhode Island, Mr. Whitehouse, is going to continue his efforts, as he \nalways has, to make sure that we have more fairness in our tax system. \nSo that is in our bill also.\n  Restoring balance and fairness to the Tax Code is critical to the \nsuccess of our economy and is critical to the rebuilding of the middle \nclass in America. So in sort of broad strokes, that is my Rebuild \nAmerica Act, S. 2522.\n  Over the last few years, the American people have heard from too many \nof us politicians and talking heads that our country is broke, that we \ncan no longer afford the investments that make for a strong middle \nclass. You know, that is sort of the premise of the Ryan budget in the \nHouse, cut and slash. The premise is one that has been in favor around \nthis town for far too long. Here is the premise. The premise is that we \nare broke, the United States of America is broke and we cannot afford \nto do these things.\n  This is false. The United States of America remains a wealthy Nation. \nWe are the wealthiest Nation in the history of the world. We have the \nhighest per capita income of any major country. So one might reasonably \nask: If we are so rich, how come we are so broke? Think about that. If \nwe are the richest Nation in the history of the world, if we have the \nhighest per capita income of any major country, then why can we not \nafford to invest in our infrastructure, invest in better teachers, make \nsure our kids get a good education without a mountain of debt on their \nheads? Why cannot we invest in making new energy systems that are \ncleaner and more productive for the future?\n  We can. We can do these things. The problem is not that we are broke, \nthe problem is that because of actions or inactions by this government \nover the last 30 years, America's wealth has not been spread among our \npeople in a reasonable way. The wealth has been concentrated in fewer \nand fewer and fewer hands. And the middle class in the meantime has \nbeen decimated.\n  I submit that there can be no sustainable economic recovery to \nAmerica, no sustained return to fiscal balance, without the recovery of \nthe middle class. That is exactly the aim of the Rebuild America Act. \nIt is comprehensive. Yes. Ambitious. Of course. But it rises to the \nchallenge of our time.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in advancing this legislation and \ndoing all we can to restore the American middle class. It is the \nfundamental challenge of our time.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Postal Service Reform\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, the U.S. Postal Service is a fundamental \npart of our Nation's history and what it means to be an American. In \nfact, it was actually talked about in our Constitution.\n  Nationwide, the Postal Service employs 550,000 Americans, and it \nserves as the linchpin of an industry that contributes over $1 trillion \nto our economy. I have heard from a number of businesses in New \nHampshire--one being Goss International in a neighboring community, \nwhich has been a major competitor in the area of printing presses, and \nnow they are making wind turbines, or parts of wind turbines. They are \nvery concerned, as is a company called Polaris Direct, about what is \ngoing to happen to our Postal Service and are we in Congress going to \nresolve this issue.\n  In New Hampshire, the Postal Service provides thousands of jobs, as \nwell as a critical economic connection for many of our rural \ncommunities, which are not often in some areas of New Hampshire \nconnected to the Internet, so they don't have high-speed broadband, and \nthe Postal Service is their connection with much of the outside \ncommerce and community.\n  Today, as we know, the Postal Service is facing a fiscal crisis that \nthreatens its future. We should all be concerned about Draconian \nproposals that seek to slash 220,000 good jobs, close 3,700 post \noffices, and make mail delivery slower across America. The bill before \nus today attempts to avoid the worst of these outcomes, and I commend \nall of the bipartisan managers of the legislation, including Senator \nLieberman, Senator Collins, and Senator Carper, for their tireless work \nto save the U.S. Postal Service.\n  I was proud to join a group of 28 Senators who pushed for important \nchanges to the bill in an attempt to better protect rural post offices, \ndevelop new sources of business, and maintain the reliable and timely \nservice Americans have come to expect. Some of these changes have been \nincorporated into the legislation, and I think they are an important \nstep toward improving it.\n  With that said, I think we have more work to do. I know there are a \nlot of\n\n[[Page S2485]]\n\npeople in this body who wish to see us debate a number of amendments \nrelated to the bill and try to make changes to improve the work already \ndone. Rural communities rely on the Postal Service, and I think \nCongress and this Senate should improve the legislation to make sure \nthat people have a real voice in the process when their post office is \nthreatened.\n  If we don't act, the Postal Service could go bankrupt or could be \nforced to make devastating service cuts. So while this legislation is \nnot perfect, I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture tomorrow so we \ncan consider relevant amendments and make sure this important American \ninstitution, the U.S. Post Office, is saved for all Americans who so \ndesperately need the services it provides.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                 Africa\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I rise to speak to the Senate, but in a \nbroader sense to the American people and, in particular, to the young \npeople of America. An Internet posting went viral a few weeks ago, by a \ngroup called Invisible Children about Joseph Koni in Uganda, the \nCentral African Republic, Congo, and the South Sudan.\n  As a member of the Africa Subcommittee of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee and one who travels to Africa quite frequently, I have just \nreturned from a trip to meet, in part, with our special forces and U.S. \nadvisers who have been deployed in those countries to help assist in \nthe search for Joseph Koni.\n  I wish to share with the Senate the information about what America is \ndoing, what Joseph Koni has done, and how important our commitment is \nto Central Africa and to see to it that this evil man is brought to \njustice. Joseph Koni is under indictment by the International Criminal \nCourt today, but for 26 years he has roamed Central Africa with his \nLord's Resistance Army, killing, raping, and maiming the African \npeople. By some estimates, Joseph Koni has abducted 66,000 children \ninto his army and young women as sex slaves. He has displaced over 2 \nmillion Africans into camps, and they have had to be displaced because \ntheir villages were destroyed and their families disrupted. He has \nkilled untold tens of thousands of people. He is by any stretch of the \nimagination an evil person. Invisible Children's posting, which went \nviral on the Internet, has caught the attention of America's youth, \nbecause they see the damage that has been done to the youth of Africa, \nand they want to know what America is doing.\n  I am proud to include in my remarks what America is doing, and has \nbeen doing even before the posting went viral on the Internet and most \npeople didn't know who Joseph Koni was. Our President deployed 100 \nspecial advisers to the Central African Republic, in the Sudan and \nUganda, about 2 months before this posting went viral. I met with them \nin a private, secured briefing, a lot of which I cannot talk about but \na lot of which I can.\n  Because of U.S. technology, U.S. resources, and the commitment of \nthese individuals, we are assisting to a much higher level in the \nintelligence that we are gaining on Joseph Koni. A lot of people think \nKoni is in Uganda. He isn't there and hasn't been there for 5 or 6 \nyears. He is somewhere near the Central African Republic, where it is \nextremely easy to hide. We thought Vietnam had jungles. You haven't \nseen foliage until you've seen the Central African Republic, the Sudan, \nand the Congo. There is no electricity, no roads, no paths, and no \nlistening devices. Intelligence is all human intelligence. We are \nfortunate to have great intelligence operatives over there and great \nresources there, and we are gaining more and more information.\n  I commend our forces also in what they have done in an amnesty \nprogram. They dropped leaflets in villages that are known to house some \nof Koni's workers and cronies. They drop leaflets that offer amnesty \nfor anybody who leaves Koni, comes back to their village, and gives \ninformation to our forces, the Ugandan Army, and the African Union Army \nas to where Joseph Koni might be. We are getting closer all the time. \nWe are not there yet, but thanks to the assistance of our foreign-\ndeployed individuals, the commitment of our country, the commitment of \nUganda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Central African \nRepublic, and the new country of South Sudan, we are going to close \nthat noose and stay until the job is finished, because Joseph Koni \nneeds to be brought to justice. He is an evil man who has killed and \nraped far too many people and maimed far too many people, and Africa is \ntoo good a friend of the United States for us not to offer the \nnecessary assistance.\n\n  My message to the American people and our youth is we are doing our \njob. Joseph Koni hasn't been caught, but we are in pursuit. I commend \nSenator Kerry, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee; Senator \nCoons, chairman of the Africa Subcommittee; and Senator Lugar and \nmyself have joined together to support legislation that will be \nintroduced in the Senate to include Joseph Koni, or information leading \nto the arrest and conviction of Joseph Koni, in our rewards program \nthat we offer mostly now for terrorist capture. That will be an \nincentive for more information to be brought forward so that the noose \nwill grow tighter.\n  It is time for Joseph Koni to be brought to justice, and the United \nStates is making every effort to assist in that process in Central \nAfrica.\n  My other reason for going to Central Africa is equally important. I \nwas accompanied by members of CARE. CARE is a tremendous \nnongovernmental organization that delivers humanitarian aid, \nassistance, education, knowledge, and technical assistance to countries \naround the world and, in particular, in the nation of Africa. It was \nthe second time I traveled with CARE; the first time was 10 years ago \nto Ethiopia, where I saw CARE's outreach in terms of basic education \nand improvement and enhancement of educating young Muslim women.\n  On this trip, I got to see what they are doing firsthand in the city \nof Gulu on the border with the Congo and Northern Uganda--an area that \n5 or 6 years ago, because of Joseph Koni, had been destroyed, people \nwere displaced, everybody was in hunger, and there was a lot of \nviolence. It is now a beautiful village. Granted, it is not a village \nsuch as you and I might know, Mr. President--thatched huts with \nthatched roofs, mud huts with thatched roofs, small enclaves of African \ncitizens eking out an existence in a very difficult part of the world.\n  Because of what they are doing in their project, known as the village \nsavings and loan, they are bringing about microeconomics in Africa, and \nthey are empowering women. The village savings and loan program is a \nvery simple program that teaches basic economics and capitalism to \nthese villages. Groups form together, they are given a strongbox, \nliterally like the ones that used to be on the stagecoach in the old \n``Lone Ranger'' days. In that box, each of the women will make \ncontributions of the money that they have into the strongbox, and they \nget a passbook savings account just like the occupant of the chair and \nI used to get when we were in elementary school a long time ago. Then \nthey make loans out of that money they save to other people in the \nvillage to start businesses, whether it is making beads, using the shea \ntree to make shea butter, or doing boutique cloth, or whatever it may \nbe. As those industries develop, those cottage industries develop, the \nmoney they make goes back into the savings and loan to be reinvested in \nother plans.\n  We met a young lady who was making beads, and I bought about 12 \nstrands. My wife and grandkids love them. She makes beads for a German \ndistributor in Europe. It is unbelievable what you can see being \ndeveloped because of what CARE is doing. They are empowering African \nwomen and families and are bringing about the principles of economics \nthat you and I enjoy and appreciate, and they are uplifting people who \nneed that with empowerment, so they can be sufficient on their own, so \nthey can rise up economically and educationally.\n  I also visited with the CDC folks delivering PEPFAR and health care \nand better awareness and better testing to identify those with AIDS, to \nget our retrovirals distributed to those mothers who are pregnant, so \ntheir babies\n\n[[Page S2486]]\n\ncan be born without AIDS and live a happy life. One of our great \nchallenges now in Africa--it used to be that the challenge was what we \ndid with all the children who died because they were born to a mother \nwith AIDS. Now we see what we can do to keep them through their life \nbecause they live a normal and happy life. And their mother, although \ninfected with AIDS, because of the U.S. technology and retrovirals, and \nthe CDC is providing them with a lifetime of drugs and an opportunity \nto live as normal and productive a life as possible.\n  It was great to go with CARE and to see U.S. tax dollars deployed and \nhelping uplift the nation, uplift the people, help solve the greatest \nscourge on the continent, which is AIDS and its spread, and help people \nto be able to reinvest in themselves. CARE is a great nongovernmental \nentity that happens to be housed in Georgia, which is helping all over \nthe continent of Africa, and they are empowering women and African \ncitizens, and they are making their plight in life better, and they are \nreducing the amount of Federal assistance we will provide in the years \nto come because they will be more productive, which is the payback you \nwant to see from foreign assistance dollars when they are invested.\n  As far as Joseph Koni is concerned, America knows he is a bad man, \nthat he is indicted by the International Criminal Court, and America is \nmaking the investment of intelligence and manpower to assist the \nCentral African Republic, Uganda, the Congo, and the South Sudan to \npursue him until he is captured. He needs to be brought to justice for \nthe evil and terror he has contributed to the continent of Africa.\n  I was proud to go and see America's investment of our best, our men \nand women in harm's way in Africa who are looking for him and providing \nthe assistance necessary to bring him to justice.\n  With that said, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia. I \nso appreciate Senator Isakson's comments about Africa. He is lucky \nenough to represent the CDC, which is one of the greatest organizations \nin human history, which has made such a difference in health care for \nlow-income people in this country and around the world and, frankly, \nnot just low-income people but what we call the public health of this \ncountry. Few achievements are greater than the achievements of public \nhealth, whether it is eradicating smallpox internationally--we are both \nold enough--the Presiding Officer may not be--to remember kids that we \nknew from grade school who were afflicted with polio and the fear of \nevery parent that their child might get that, and the CDC and the \npublic health system in this country removed that threat with vaccines \nand all that.\n\n\n                         The Export-Import Bank\n\n  Mr. President, I rise briefly for 4 or 5 minutes to talk about one \nway that companies in my State grow and create jobs, and that is by \nselling their products around the world. President Obama set a goal to \ndouble exports from the United States in the next 5 years. I am part of \nthe President's advisory council. There is a handful of Senators and a \nfew Members of the House of Representatives who are part of this \nadvisory committee, along with many business leaders in the country, \nCEOs of large companies, presidents and CEOs of small companies, small \nbusinesses, too, to advise the President.\n  Earlier today, I joined with Fred Hochberg, president of the Export-\nImport Bank of the United States, and Eric Burkland, president of the \nOhio Manufacturing Association in Columbus, to discuss the need to \nreauthorize the Export-Import Bank.\n  Ohio has had quicker increases in job growth than other States. We \nare coming back; our unemployment rate is now lower than the national \naverage, but it is still far too high. Too many Ohioans want to work \nand cannot find jobs. Some have jobs but are not working full time or \ntheir pay has been cut or is stagnant. Manufacturing is gaining \nnationally, adding 470,000 jobs since January 2010. To put that into \nhistorical perspective, for 12 years, from 1997 to 2010--12-plus \nyears--we saw a manufacturing job loss in this country every single \nyear from the year before, with fewer factories, fewer workers, and \nless manufacturing. But since early 2010, we have seen almost every \nsingle month, in Ohio and across the country, job growth in \nmanufacturing. It is still not enough. It is positive, but we are not \nout of the woods yet. I fear we take a step back if Congress fails to \nreauthorize the Export-Import Bank.\n  We know that Ohio manufacturers and small businesses can compete with \nanyone in the world, from Zanesville to Springfield, to Ashtabula, to \nToledo; American manufacturers can compete with anybody in the world if \nthere is a level playing field.\n  We know how to make things in Ohio. When we stamp ``made in Ohio'' on \na product, we know it was made with pride and by some of the most \nefficient, progressive companies in the world, and some of the best \nworkers in the world.\n  Exporting is tough, especially for small businesses. Fewer than 1 \npercent of the Nation's nearly 26 million small businesses export their \nproducts. Very few small businesses are able to export for a whole host \nof reasons.\n  I hear from small business owners who want to expand and who want to \nget access to foreign markets, but they can't secure private financing \ndue to the credit risks associated with some overseas investments. One \nof the most important resources to help small businesses and midsize \nmanufacturers to boost their exports is the Export-Import Bank.\n  Ex-Im's mission is simple: It facilitates exports and contributes to \njob creation in the United States. It does it through loans, through \nguarantees, through insurance. It fills in gaps through trade financing \nat no cost to taxpayers. The market sometimes doesn't deliver in these \nsituations. The Ex-Im Bank can fill in some gaps and help companies \nthat have the ability to grow and export to actually do that.\n  The Ex-Im Bank generates revenue to the U.S. Treasury. Yet despite \nthis record of success in exports, jobs are at stake because Congress \ncannot agree to the Ex-Im reauthorization. The Ex-Im Bank's lending \nauthority expires May 31. We know companies that export products create \njobs, pay higher wages, and are more likely to remain in business. \nExport-supported jobs linked to manufacturing already account for an \nestimated 7 percent. One out of fourteen of Ohio's total private sector \njobs, 1 out of 14 Ohio workers are linked to export. More than one-\nfourth of manufacturing workers in Ohio depend on exports for their \njobs--the eighth highest among the 50 States.\n  We need to do a better job in ensuring that America's small \nbusinesses have access to that global market. The Ex-Im Bank helps. It \nprovides credit that otherwise wouldn't be available to turn export \nopportunities for businesses into increased jobs, higher wages, and \nincreased sales.\n  In 2011, the bank worked with almost 100 Ohio businesses to support \nmore than $400 million in export sales. According to the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, Ex-Im supports 290,000 export-related \njobs. More than 8 percent of Ex-Im's transactions supported small \nbusinesses last year.\n  Renewing the bank's charter should be a cause all Senators support, \njust like the 25 times the Senate has overwhelmingly reauthorized the \nagency since its establishment in 1934. Think about that. Since 1934, \ntime after time after time, this body has unanimously or overwhelmingly \nreauthorized--kept going--the Export-Import Bank--but not today, for \nwhatever reason. Perhaps it is the same reason as when the Presiding \nOfficer's Buffett rule was on the floor of the Senate this week that a \nnumber of Senators said no to moving forward. I don't know if it is \nbecause the Republican leader has said he wants President Obama to fail \nor if it is just this rigid philosophy that there is no positive role \nfor government.\n  Whether it is the highway bill, the Buffett rule or the Ex-Im Bank, \nwe know at least that the Ex-Im Bank works, and it is strongly \nsupported by the chamber of commerce, the National Association of \nManufacturers, and the machinists who testified in our Banking \nCommittee this week. It is supported by all kinds of people who want to \nsee this economy grow. Unfortunately, a number of my colleagues, for \nwhatever reason, don't want to move forward.\n  This is a matter of American jobs. It is a matter of competitiveness. \nWe had\n\n[[Page S2487]]\n\na trade deficit with China of $295 billion in 2011, meaning every day \nwe buy about $800 million more in goods from China than we sell to \nChina. The first President Bush, some years ago, said that $1 billion \nin exports or imports could translate into 13,000 jobs. When we have a \n$295 billion deficit, with one country alone last year, one can see the \nkind of job loss it means. We know China's Export-Import and \ndevelopment banks provide as much as $100 billion in export credits \neach year. That is three times as many new export credits as the U.S. \nExport-Import Bank does.\n  So we know, even with reauthorization, that China still does way more \nof this than the United States. Yet we are unilaterally disarming if we \nallow this May 31 date to come and go and the Ex-Im Bank \nreauthorization expires. It makes no sense for our manufacturers, for \nour big and small companies, and it makes no sense for our workers and \nour communities that will all be hurt if we don't do that.\n  It is time to end the delay. It is time to reauthorize the Export-\nImport Bank.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                       Surface Transportation Act\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. First, I want to thank my colleague, Senator Cardin, \nand just recently Senator Brown of Ohio, for referencing the highway \nbill.\n  The state of play on that at this point is that the House has just \npassed another extension. We passed an extension back at the end of \nMarch that extended the existing highway program to the end of June. \nWhat that bill did is cause significant job loss because not knowing \nfor sure what the highway plan will be means that jobs will fall off \nthe list of the departments of transportation around the country. So a \nfurther extension to September--which just passed the House 1 hour \nago--just makes the situation even worse.\n  The solution to that problem is to make sure the House and the Senate \nappoint their conferees so we can get to conference quickly on that \nbill and get out a lasting authorization.\n  So I want to again thank Senator Cardin for spending some time on the \nfloor this afternoon on that subject. We will keep the pressure on \nuntil we actually have a highway authorization as we go through these \ndifferent procedural hurdles.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  I came to speak on the floor about an issue that many in Washington \nwould prefer to ignore; that is, climate changes that are being caused \nby our carbon pollution. Nature keeps sending us messages about what is \nhappening out there, and in Washington we continue to ignore those \nmessages. But they keep on coming.\n  Every week for the past 15 months I have distributed in our caucus, \nas the Presiding Officer knows, a quick thumbnail summary of the week's \nClimate News.\n  The stories from this week include that ``Temperature Variations''--\nwhich relate to the extra energy put into the climate by the warming \nweather--``Could Lower Life Expectancies of the Chronically Ill.'' That \nis one story.\n  Another is a new report from the NOAA that ``Coral Risks Extinction \nDue to Climate Change.'' More than 50 coral species in U.S. waters are \nlikely to go extinct by the end of the century, and the experts cited \nhuman-driven releases of carbon dioxide as a key driver of the ocean's \nwarming and acidification that is causing these extinctions.\n  A third is, ``Tree Diseases Likely to Spread as Temperatures Rise.'' \nAccording to a new report by the U.S. Forest Service, forest diseases \nare expected to spread more quickly in the western U.S. as climate \nchange warms the region's forests.\n  The fourth is a recent study published in the journal Nature, which \nfinds that rising carbon dioxide levels drove temperature increases at \nthe end of the last Ice Age. At the end of the last Ice Age, \natmospheric CO2 concentrations rose 80 parts per million. \nOver the past 100 years, CO2 concentrations have risen \nroughly 100 parts per million. So the effects are linked very closely \nto climate.\n  Other news, as reported in the Providence Journal on March 30, said: \nThe winter's warm air temperatures have helped drive up water \ntemperatures in the Gulf of Maine, in line with a continuing trend, and \nthe warm waters could result in lobsters molting their shells earlier \nthan usual and ocean algae blooming ahead of schedule.\n  Jeffrey Runge, a biological oceanographer at the University of Maine \nand a researcher at the Gulf of Maine Research Institute in Portland, \ntold the paper that the Gulf of Maine water temperatures have been \nrising gradually since at least the 1870s, but the increase has been \npronounced in the last decade or so.\n  Moving from the North to the South, we have Professor Emeritus Orrin \nH. Pilkey, a professor of geology at Duke University, who wrote in the \nCharlotte Observer on March 25 that new peer-reviewed research \ndemonstrates that sea level rise and storm-surge elevations could be \ngreater along much of the U.S. coastline than has been predicted. His \nopinion piece went on to say that North Carolina, Washington, \nCalifornia, Louisiana, Florida, and Maine have convened sea level rise \npanels that estimate a sea level rise of 3 to 5 feet by the year 2100.\n  A new study has come out from the Center for Biological Diversity \nconfirming the link between massive oyster die-offs in the Pacific \nNorthwest and ocean acidification caused by carbon dioxide emissions. \nThe release reports that each day the oceans absorb 22 million tons of \ncarbon dioxide pollution from cars and industry, setting off an \nunprecedented chemical reaction that since the Industrial Revolution \nhas made the world's oceans 30 percent more acidic.\n  Just this morning in the Senate, Senators Bingaman and Murkowski held \na bipartisan hearing on the devastating effects of sea level rise on \ncoastal communities. So it is good that some leaders on both sides of \nthe aisle are starting to talk about the terrible consequences of \nclimate change.\n  However, the special interests who control so much of what goes on \naround here and who deny that carbon pollution causes global \ntemperatures to increase and deny that melting ice caps will raise our \nseas to dangerous levels still have a stronghold. Dr. Pilkey, writing \nin the Charlotte Observer, warned that the deniers' influence is, \ntragically, starting to influence local planning decisions, despite \nwhat he calls ``new studies that predict higher than previously \npredicted sea level rise and storm-surge levels in coming decades.'' He \nconcludes:\n\n       Preservation of the status quo (including real estate \n     prices) may prevail on our coasts, but in a democratic \n     society such as ours, the state has no right to shield \n     citizens from unpleasant environmental realities.\n\n  In the face of so much evidence constantly, daily, of a changing \nclimate, we have special interests working overtime in Washington to \npropagate a myth. This myth is that the jury is still out on climate \nchange caused by carbon pollution. So with the jury still out, we don't \nneed to worry about it or even take precautions.\n  This is simply outright false. Virtually all of our most prestigious \nscientific and academic institutions have stated that climate change is \nhappening and that human activities are the driving cause of this \nchange.\n  On October 21, 2009, I think all of us in the Senate received a \nletter from virtually every leading scientific organization in the \ncountry, stating:\n\n       Observations throughout the world make it clear that \n     climate change is occurring, and rigorous scientific research \n     demonstrates that the greenhouse gases emitted by human \n     activities are the primary driver. These conclusions are \n     based on multiple independent lines of evidence, and \n     contrary assertions are inconsistent with an objective \n     assessment of the vast body of peer-reviewed science.\n       Contrary assertions are inconsistent with an objective \n     assessment of the vast body of peer-reviewed science.\n\n  So the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the \nChemical Society, Geophysical Union, Institute of Biological Sciences, \nMeteorological Society, Society of Agronomy, Society of Plant \nBiologists, Botanical Society, and on and on it goes of the scientific \ncommunity signed up for this.\n\n[[Page S2488]]\n\n  It is, of course, not just the scientific community that knows that \nthe jury is not in fact still out; that knows that in fact the verdict \nis in and that it is time to act. The insurance industry is alarmed \nabout our inaction and has started to take action, holding a press \nconference with myself and Senator Sanders not too long ago.\n  Marsh & McLennan, one of the largest insurance brokers in the world, \ncalled climate change ``one of the most significant emerging risks \nfacing the world today.'' The insurance giant AIG has established an \nOffice of Environment and Climate Change to assess the risks to \ninsurers in the years ahead.\n  It is not just the insurance industry. It is our intelligence \ncommunity, it is our military services, many of our electric utilities, \nsome of our biggest capitalists and investors all recognize that the \njury is not still out; that in fact a verdict is in, and we should act.\n  Unfortunately, Governor Romney once wrote:\n\n       I believe that climate change is occurring. I also believe \n     that human activity is a contributing factor.\n\n  Under the pressure of the Republican primary, he has changed his \nviews and now claims: ``We don't know what's causing climate change on \nthis planet.''\n  Well, that runs contrary to the evidence. More than 97 percent of the \nclimate scientists most actively involved in publishing on this issue \naccept that the verdict is actually in on carbon pollution causing \nclimate change and oceanic changes--97 percent. Think of that in terms \nof your own life if you were relying on expert opinion.\n  If you had a child who was sick and you went to a doctor and they \nsaid: She is pretty sick and she needs treatment, you thought: Well, \nlet's be prudent and let's get a second opinion. So on you went and got \na third opinion and a fourth opinion. Let's say you were just a wildly \ndetermined parent, and you went and got 99 more second opinions so that \nyou had 100 opinions of doctors, and 97 of those 100 doctors said: Yes, \nyour child is ill and you need to do something about this.\n  How foolish would you be if you did not pay attention to the 97 \npercent and you allowed the 3 percent to sway your judgment and not \ntake action to protect your child. Well, it looks as if Governor Romney \nis with the 1 percent when it comes to the economy for the middle \nclass, and he is with the 3 percent when it comes to the science of \ncarbon pollution.\n  This is not very debatable stuff. The basic principle that carbon \ndioxide traps heat in the atmosphere and traps more of it as its \nconcentration increases was determined in 1863, at the time of the \nAmerican Civil War. There is nothing new about this.\n  In the early 1900s it became clear that changes in the amount of \ncarbon dioxide in the atmosphere could account for significant \nincreases and decreases in the Earth's annual average temperatures, and \nthat carbon dioxide released from what we call anthropogenic sources, \nmanmade sources--primarily then the burning of coal--would contribute \nto these changes. This is well-established stuff, and the effects are \nmeasurable.\n  Over the last 800,000 years, until very recently, the atmosphere \nstayed within a bandwidth of 170 to 300 parts per million of carbon \ndioxide, 170 to 300 parts per million. That is the bandwidth, and that \nis a measurement. That is not a theory. We know that. We can find \nancient bubbles in ancient ice and measure, and there are different \nways that scientists do this, but it is measurement.\n  Since the Industrial Revolution, we have burned carbon-rich fuels, \nalso in a measurable way. Now we know we burn up to 7 to 8 gigatons a \nyear. That is the release. A gigaton, by the way, is a billion with a \n``b'' metric tons. When you release that enormous amount of carbon into \nthe atmosphere, it is predictable that it would have a result, and, \nindeed, it is having a result. We now measure carbon concentrations \nclimbing in the Earth's atmosphere--again, a measurement, not a theory. \nThe present concentration exceeds 390 parts per million. For 8,000 \ncenturies we were in a bandwidth of between 170 and 300, and in recent \nyears we have veered out that bandwidth. We are at 390 parts per \nmillion and climbing.\n  The increase has a trajectory--there is nothing very new about \nplotting trajectories either. Children do that in school, soldiers do \nthat in the field, corporations do that to plan their businesses, and \nscientists do that. We do that every day. If you follow the trajectory \nof our carbon pollution, it predicts 668 parts per million at the end \nof this century and 1,097 parts per million at the end of the next \ncentury. Those carbon concentrations are not just outside the bounds of \n8,000 centuries but of millions of years.\n  It is coming home to roost particularly in our oceans, which is a \nmatter of real concern to me as a Senator from the Ocean State. In \nApril of last year, a group of scientific experts came together at the \nUniversity of Oxford to discuss the current state of our oceans. Their \nworkshop report stated:\n\n       Human actions have resulted in warming and acidification of \n     the oceans and are now causing increased hypoxia.\n\n  That is when there is not enough oxygen in the water to sustain life.\n\n       Studies of the Earth's past indicate that these are the \n     three symptoms . . . associated with each of the previous 5 \n     mass extinctions on Earth.\n\n  We experienced two mass ocean extinctions, 55 and 251 million years \nago. Last year at Brown University in Providence, RI, paleobiologist \nJessica Whiteside published a study demonstrating that after the \nearlier extinction 251 million years ago, it took 8 million years for \nplant and animal diversity to return to preextinction levels. We also \nknow that in the lead-up to those extinctions, scientists have \nestimated that the Earth was emitting carbon into the atmosphere at the \nrate in the first one of 2.2 gigatons and 1 to 2 gigatons per year, \nrespectively. You recall we are currently releasing at the rate of 7 to \n8 gigatons per year.\n  We are taking some very dangerous chances with our planet. We have \nvery solid information that is the product of measurement and not \ntheory about the changes that are already underway. It is a continuing \ndisgrace that in this building and in this Chamber, we are unable to do \nanything about this issue because of the continuing power of a small \ngroup of special interests who are controlling the debate, who are \ninterfering with progress, and who are putting us all at risk.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MORAN. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to address the \nSenate as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Postal Service Reform\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I am here this evening to express concern \nabout the developments of the day in which I thought we were going to \nbe addressing the issue of postal reform with the goal of making \ncertain that this Senate, this Congress makes decisions in short order \nthat would preserve the financial viability, the future of postal \ndelivery and the Postal Service of the United States. I am concerned \nnow because apparently the process has been put in place by which \nvirtually no amendment can be offered to the 21st Century Postal \nService Act of 2011.\n  On two occasions I voted to proceed to this piece of legislation. It \nis an important one, in my view. The idea of reforming and improving \nthe opportunity for the financial viability of the Postal Service is \nimportant to the country. It matters to the Nation. We have an \nobligation under the U.S. Constitution to provide postal service. It \nmatters in the sense that there are many items that are transported in \ncommerce on an ongoing daily basis in which the Postal Service is the \nmethod by which that transportation occurs, by which we certainly \ndeliver mail and packages. Shipping occurs in the United States as a \nresult of the viability of the U.S. Postal Service. It is important, in \nmy view, especially to me as a Kansan.\n  One of the things that is pending in the absence of reform, \nimprovements, and financial stability in the Postal Service is the \npotential demise of many rural post offices across Kansas and around \nthe country. In my view,\n\n[[Page S2489]]\n\nand I have expressed this to the Postmaster General, the U.S. Postal \nService on many occasions has made a decision that I think, while it \nmay save a few dollars, reduces the service the Postal Service provides \nand ultimately hastens the day in which the Postal Service has even \nmore challenges remaining viable. One of those was the decision by the \nPostal Service to close many rural post offices across the country, \n130-plus in Kansas.\n  We have had attendance at more than 90 of the community meetings that \nrevolve around the potential closing of a post office. I have expressed \ngreat concern in the committee. I serve on the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity, in which this bill originates. During that markup and debate, \nI expressed concern then and expressed concern on several occasions to \nthe Postmaster General that there is no basis for making an intelligent \ndecision about which post office should or should not be closed. In \nfact, when citizens across Kansas and across the country attend one of \nthese community meetings, their question to the representative of the \nPostal Service is, What can our community do? What can I do to make \ncertain our post office remains open and we have the opportunity to \nreceive and have mail delivered from here at the U.S. post office in \nour community?\n\n  In working with the committee, provisions were added to the 21st \nCentury Postal Service Act that create criteria by which these \ndecisions would be made and the community has an opportunity to appeal \nshould the decision be adverse and those criteria not met.\n  In my view, the Senate should not delay any longer addressing the \nissue of what we do to make certain the Postal Service is and remains \nviable today and in the future. It matters, as I say, for a series of \nreasons but certainly to me as a Kansan who is concerned about what \nhappens to the community, its senior citizens, if there is no longer \npostal service provided.\n  I know there are some in the Senate and in the House of \nRepresentatives and across the country who want to make certain the \nPostal Service is operated as a business. I certainly support that \nconcept and believe we ought to do what is necessary to improve the \nbusiness environment by which the Postal Service conducts its business. \nThere is a long list of those. Some of them are addressed in the \nlegislation that I hope remains pending here in the Senate.\n  But there is another reason in addition to the need to provide \nservice to Americans that we need to address this issue. I want to make \ncertain the decisions we make today eliminate the need that there ever \nwould be a call upon the taxpayers of the United States to provide \ntaxpayer dollars to support the Postal Service.\n  I am here this evening to encourage my colleagues but particularly \nthe majority leader to work to find an agreement by which amendments \ncan be offered to this bill so that we do not lose the opportunity we \nhave this week and next to address this issue of making certain we make \nchanges to the Postal Service that allow it to be successful.\n  I am concerned that, as I understand it, there is no agreement yet \nthat would allow Members of the Senate to offer amendments to this \nlegislation. While the provisions of this bill are important to me and \nimportant to Kansans, I also recognize the importance to every Member \nof the Senate to be able to offer legislation, to have debate, to make \ncertain that our rights are protected. I know that particularly in a \nsense as a member of the minority, as a Republican in the Senate, but I \nknow that even more as a member of a minority called rural America. I \ndo not want to lose the opportunity in the Senate for me to be able to \nspeak on issues that are important to my constituents and to be able to \noffer amendments to legislation that is important to a minority of \nAmericans called rural America.\n  What I am troubled by and what I want to see addressed is the \nlegislation that is pending. I do not want it to disappear because \nthere is no agreement for Members of the Senate, all 100 of us, \nmajority and minority, to offer amendments. So I am asking the majority \nleader to work with Senators to make certain their amendments are \navailable for consideration in this legislation. Don't put me and other \nSenators, who care about this legislation, in the position of not being \nable to support moving forward because the rights of some Senators have \nbeen violated in their ability to offer amendments to this piece of \nlegislation.\n  Again, this matters. The Postal Service desperately needs our \nattention. The American people who are served by the Postal Service \ndesperately need our attention. We need to set the stage today in which \nthe taxpayers of the United States are protected from any future calls \nfor support for the U.S. Postal Service. We need to make certain in \nthat process, as we pursue this legislation, that the ability of those \nwho live in rural communities, where it is very difficult for the \nPostal Service to be financially viable, to have access to the Postal \nService is not trampled on by the desire to see that only those post \noffices that are financially viable individually are the ones that \nremain. In fact, I remind my colleagues that the Postal Rate Service \nCommission in their study said we could close 3,700 post offices in the \nUnited States and save less than .7 percent of the money necessary to \nput the Postal Service back on a financially sound basis.\n  This legislation is important. The concepts that are contained in it \nmatter to me as a Member of the Senate who represents a very rural \nState, Kansas. But I also know how important it is to make sure we do \nnot lose our ability to offer amendments on this legislation or \nlegislation in the future.\n  Please, Mr. Majority Leader and other Senators, please come together \nto make certain those rights are protected so this legislation can be \nfully considered by the Senate.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan).

The man of whom I speak has \nvaliantly served in the line of duty and justly served in almost every \nlevel of our Nation's court system. He is a pioneer in the legal \ndiscipline, a patriot through and through, and a dear friend: the \nHonorable Judge G. Wix Unthank of Harlan County, KY.\n  Judge Unthank has announced his retirement and will soon bang the \ngavel for the last time on June 1 of this year, ending a six-decade-\nlong legacy in the legal field. Although his official day-to-day job \nmay be coming to an end, his public service is most likely far from \nover. Judging by the colorful life he has led thus far, I trust that \nhis passion for the law and the legal system will lead him back inside \nthe familiar walls of the courthouse for many years to come.\n  The Honorable Judge Unthank is a solid testimony to the attainment of \nthe American dream. G. Wix Unthank proved that with hard work and \nambition you can accomplish truly anything. He was born in the small \nHarlan County, KY, town of Tway in 1923. His father, Green W. Unthank, \nand mother, Estelle Howard Unthank, were both teachers in the Harlan \nCounty school system. Between the two of them, they spent 68 years in \nthe classroom inspiring young men and women to achieve great things. \nThe emphasis placed on education in the Unthank household rubbed off on \nyoung Wix, and he graduated from Loyall High School in Harlan County \nwith the class of 1940. That same year he enlisted in the U.S. Army and \nproudly served in World War II.\n  Not even having been on this Earth for two decades, the young Mr.\n\n[[Page S2490]]\n\nUnthank displayed courage, bravery, and patriotism well beyond his age. \nWhile in the service, he was a member of the 509th Paratrooper \nBattalion. During their training, the unit practiced jumping out of \nairplanes that flew at heights of 250 to 300 feet. Squad sergeant Ernie \nKomula of Wix's battalion will never forget how surprised his men were \nwhen the planes wouldn't go lower than 2,000 feet once behind enemy \nlines. Despite the unfamiliar new height, Unthank and the rest of the \nmen didn't think twice about jumping out of that plane and fighting for \ntheir beloved country.\n  After completing a 5-year stint in the Army, in which he received \nboth a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart, he was honorably discharged in \n1945. He attended the University of Kentucky for his undergraduate \nschooling. Then he went on to the University of Miami, where he \nobtained a J.D. in 1950. Once he had acquired the knowledge his parents \nhad always hoped he would, Wix entered public service in what would \nturn out to be a prosperous and fulfilling professional life.\n  Judge Unthank worked as a practicing attorney in Harlan County for a \nshort time before running for the public office of county judge. \nThroughout his political career, Judge Unthank used the slogan ``You'll \nnever be Unthankful with Unthank,'' and obviously the people never were \nbecause he never lost an election.\n  In the summer of 1980, President Jimmy Carter appointed G. Wix \nUnthank to the U.S. district court to serve as the presiding judge of \nthe Eastern District of Kentucky. Eight years after his appointment, he \nassumed the honorable title of senior judge on the U.S. district court.\n  After many years of successfully running the courts in the Eastern \nDistrict, Judge Unthank was honored with a portrait unveiling ceremony \nin Lexington, KY, in 1991 and Pikeville, KY, in 1992. At the ceremonies \nthe judge was honored by his colleagues, family, and friends for the \nmany achievements he had been blessed with throughout his lifetime up \nuntil that point. His portrait was hung in the courtrooms of both \nLexington and Pikeville, which Judge Eugene E. Siler, Jr., who led the \nceremonies, said that he believed were among the best courtrooms in the \nUnited States.\n  Judge Unthank was known for running a top-notch court system. He \npromoted collegiality amongst the judges and employees of the Eastern \nDistrict. Under the leadership of Judge Unthank, they were more than \njust colleagues, they were a family. They enjoyed working together and \nseeing that the law was carried out equally and justly with each and \nevery case.\n  Despite the judge's high-ranking senior status, he never shied away \nfrom work. He had an unheard-of workload for a senior judge. Day in and \nday out, he worked through social security cases, bankruptcy appeals, \nand retirement disputes with hard work and dedication.\n  The words carved into the front of the Supreme Court Building in our \nNation's Capital read ``Equal Justice Under Law.'' That is a standard \nthat we as a country hold up highly and a motto that those in the legal \nprofession look to for guidance in every decision they make. Wix \nUnthank was no exception to this rule. He understands the importance of \nequal justice, and he demonstrated an unbelievable amount of integrity \nboth in and out of the courtroom.\n  As I have said many times before, I am not in the business of \nspeculation, so I would not testify to the character of Judge G. Wix \nUnthank if I was at all unsure of it. Therefore, with the utmost \ncertainty, it is my pleasure today to stand and honor the Honorable \nJudge G. Wix Unthank for his tremendous contribution to his profession, \nhis community, the Commonwealth of Kentucky, and the United States of \nAmerica, and I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in paying tribute to \na brave veteran, a wise jurist, and a confirmed patriot of our great \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/18/senate-section/article/S2490-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2490]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CONGRATULATING STEPHANIE THACKER\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, today I wish to congratulate Stephanie \nDawn Thacker, a native of Hamlin, WV, on her confirmation to the 4th \nCircuit Court of Appeals.\n  It is my privilege and my honor to speak on her behalf, and I am so \nproud she was confirmed. I would like to thank my colleague Senator Jay \nRockefeller for nominating such a qualified jurist.\n  Stephanie Thacker's impressive background and extensive list of \naccomplishments in both the public and private sectors make her an \nexceptional judge for the 4th Circuit. She is renowned in our State for \nher mastery of the law and of the courtroom, and I have no doubt that \nshe will make a highly successful Federal judge.\n  Ms. Thacker has dedicated much of her career to fighting some of the \nworst offenses in our society. As a trial attorney, Deputy Chief of \nLitigation, and Principal Deputy Chief, she spent several years \nprosecuting cases on Child Exploitation and Obscenity at the Department \nof Justice. Her outstanding work and leadership earned her a number of \nhonors at the Department of Justice, including four ``Meritorious'' \nAwards and two ``Special Achievement'' awards.\n  Her impressive performance in prosecuting the case of United States \nv. Dwight York earned her the Attorney General's ``Distinguished \nService'' award, one of the Department's highest honors. She was also a \nrecipient of the Assistant Attorney General's award for ``Special \nInitiative'' and ``Outstanding Victim and Witness Service.''\n  Prior to her service at the Department of Justice, Ms. Thacker worked \nwith the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of West \nVirginia, where she prosecuted a wide variety of criminal cases, \nincluding money laundering and fraud. While at the U.S. Attorney's \nOffice, Ms. Thacker participated on the trial team prosecuting United \nStates v. Bailey, the first case ever brought under the Violence \nAgainst Women Act.\n  Since 2006, Ms. Thacker has been a partner at the law firm of Guthrie \n& Thomas in Charleston, West Virginia. There, she has concentrated on \ncases involving product liability, environmental and toxic torts, \ncomplex commercial defense, and criminal defense.\n  Ms. Thacker was a model student in both her undergraduate and legal \nstudies. She earned her Bachelor's degree in Business Administration, \nmagna cum laude, from Marshall University, and her J.D., Order of the \nCoif, from West Virginia University College of Law. While at West \nVirginia University she was a recipient of the Robert L. Griffin \nMemorial Scholarship and Editor of West Virginia Law Review's Coal \nIssue. She has also recently been named ``Outstanding Female Attorney'' \nby WVU Law's Women's Caucus.\n  Ms. Thacker's wide-ranging expertise in civil and criminal matters, \nher impressive track record in the courtroom as both a prosecutor and a \ndefense attorney, and her outstanding academic accomplishments will \nmake her a first-rate addition to the 4th Circuit. I am proud to call \nher a fellow West Virginian and I am pleased that she has finally been \nconfirmed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/18/senate-section/article/S2490-2", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2490-S2491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO KIKKAN RANDALL\n\n Mr. BEGICH. Madam President, I wish to recognize Kikkan \nRandall, an Olympic athlete and World Champion Nordic skier from \nAnchorage, AK. On March 18, 2012, Kikkan was awarded the Joska crystal \nglobe as the Cross Country World Cup sprint champion, recognizing her \nas the world's top sprint ski racer. She clinched the sprint title in \nDrammen, Norway, despite breaking a binding and skiing on one ski for \npart of the race. Nevertheless, Kikkan secured the sprint title with a \nWorld Cup record that included four podium finishes. This victory makes \nKikkan the first American to win a World Cup Nordic skiing title since \nBill Koch in 1982.\n  Kikkan made her Olympic debut in the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt \nLake City. Since then, she has represented the United States in the \n2006 and 2010 Winter Olympics. In 2010 Kikkan finished eighth in the \nsprint competition, registering the best ever Olympic finish for a \nfemale American Nordic skier.\n  Kikkan has been a role model for thousands of young athletes through \nher extensive community involvement and encouragement of a healthy and \nactive lifestyle. She has worked with young athletes and trained with \nher\n\n[[Page S2491]]\n\nfellow Alaskans as a member of the Alaska Pacific University Nordic Ski \nTeam. Her hard work, training, and dedication have clearly paid off. \nShe is an inspiration to young skiers and athletes everywhere.\n  I would like to congratulate Kikkan on her championship season and \nwish her the best of luck as she trains for the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, \nRussia. All of Alaska is proud of Kikkan and her \naccomplishments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/18/senate-section/article/S2491-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING PETER DOUGLAS\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, earlier this month, California and \nthe Nation lost one of our true environmental heroes when Peter \nDouglas, the longtime executive director of the California Coastal \nCommission, passed away. Peter was truly a giant among California \nconservationists, and our State is a much better and more beautiful \nplace because of his life's work.\n  Peter Douglas was there at the creation of the California Coastal \nCommission, which for four decades has worked to protect, conserve, \nrestore, and enhance the California coast and ocean for current and \nfuture generations. As a legislative aide in the early 1970s, he helped \ndraft the 1972 Coastal Initiative and the California Coastal Act of \n1976, which made the Coastal Commission a permanent public institution. \nAfter 7 years as the Commission's Chief Deputy Director, he was named \nexecutive director in 1985 and served brilliantly in that capacity for \nmore than 25 years.\n  When Peter was diagnosed with cancer, he faced it as he did all the \nother challenges in his life with intelligence, courage, grace, and \ngood humor. Last spring, Peter began writing a cancer blog. As he noted \nin his first posting, his doctors were ``quite pessimistic and advised \nI get affairs in order and focus on my bucket list. But I am an \ninveterate and aggressive activist not about to give up on life, \nespecially not my own. My time will come, but not quite yet I hope. \nBesides, I am too busy to die.''\n  Peter kept writing, producing a remarkable record of his final battle \nwith cancer along with his political autobiography and some profound \npersonal insights. He advised his readers to ``live mindfully and fully \nevery moment. Keep hope alive. . . . When the time comes to pass over \nto the other side, try to embrace that passage with dignity and grace \nknowing you have done well.'' Peter Douglas certainly did just that.\n  On behalf of the people of California, who have benefitted so much \nfrom Peter Douglas's life work, I send my deepest gratitude and \ncondolences to his sons, grandchildren, brother, sister, and extended \nfamily and friends. Peter's memory and legacy will live on with \neveryone who loves the California coast and our priceless natural \nheritage, which he did so much to preserve and protect.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/18/senate-section/article/S2491-2", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO JAMES MICHAEL KELLY\n\n Mr. JOHANNS.

For nearly 40 years, he has served with distinction in his many \nroles at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. This spring, J. Michael \nwill be retiring from USDA's Office of General Counsel. It is a \nprivilege to take this opportunity to recognize his many contributions \nand thank him for his service.\n  Since beginning his career at USDA in 1973, J. Michael has served as \nthe department's Ethics Counselor, Acting General Counsel, Deputy \nGeneral Counsel, and Associate General Counsel. In these roles, he has \ndistinguished himself as a legal professional of the highest integrity. \nI had the honor of working closely with J. Michael during my service as \nSecretary of Agriculture. In fact, throughout his career he has worked \nwith a total of 13 Secretaries of Agriculture. J. Michael has guided \nmany at USDA in upholding all legal and ethical standards. His \ncharacter, commitment, and professionalism are to be commended.\n  Though J. Michael's nearly 40-year history with USDA is impressive, \nit does not reveal the full extent of his service to our country. In \naddition to his years at USDA, he served for two years in the U.S. Army \nand for six years at the U.S. Small Business Administration. I thank J. \nMichael for his combined 47 years of military and civilian service.\n  I can personally speak to J. Michael's dedication to USDA, which will \nlong be remembered and appreciated. I congratulate him on his \nretirement and thank him again for his service to our country. I also \nwish to express my gratitude to J. Michael's wife, Mary Jo (Josie), and \ntheir family for supporting his service. May God bless J. Michael and \nJosie as they begin a new chapter in their lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/18/senate-section/article/S2491-3", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECOGNIZING DAVIS HIGH SCHOOL MARCHING BAND\n\n Mr. LEE.

Earlier \nthis year, Hendricks was recognized as Utah's Outstanding High School \nMusic Educator by the Utah Music Educators Association.\n  It should also be noted and is of equal importance that Davis High \nSchool regularly sets a high standard of academic excellence.

A bill to permit manufacturers of generic drugs to provide \nadditional warnings with respect to such drugs in the same manner that \nthe Food and Drug Administration allows brand names to do so; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation that \nwill protect American consumers by improving the labeling on \nprescription drugs to promote consumer safety. This important bill will \nensure that all drug manufacturers can update the warning labels for \ntheir products so that the information provided to doctors and \nconsumers is as accurate and up-to-date as possible. It is a \nstraightforward measure that has the support of patient groups and \nconsumer advocates. I am pleased that Senators Franken, Coons, \nWhitehouse, Bingaman, Brown of Ohio, and Blumenthal\n\n[[Page S2498]]\n\nhave joined me as original cosponsors of the bill.\n  The Patient Safety and Generic Labeling Improvement Act will promote \nconsumer safety by ensuring that generic drug companies can improve the \nwarning information for their products in the same way that brand \nmanufacturers can under existing law. This ability is especially \nimportant given the large role that generics play in the market for \nprescription drugs. The Department of Health and Human Services reports \nthat generic drugs now make up 75 percent of the market for \npharmaceuticals. Studies show that when a generic version of a drug is \navailable, 90 percent of prescriptions are filled with the generic \nversion of the drug. The large role that generics play in the market \ngives them important insight into side effects experienced by their \ncustomers. The Patient Safety and Generic Labeling Improvement Act will \nallow generic manufacturers to act on this information, by authorizing \nthem to improve their labels to provide accurate and up-to-date \nwarnings to consumers.\n  A recent Supreme Court decision, Pliva v. Mensing, created the need \nfor this important legislation. In the Mensing case, a narrow 5 4 \nmajority on the Court held that a Minnesota woman, Gladys Mensing, \ncould not recover for debilitating injuries she received from a \nmislabeled drug that was intended to treat her diabetes symptoms. \nDespite evidence that long-term use of the drug could cause a severe \nneurological condition known as tardive dyskinesia, the manufacturer's \nlabel did not expressly warn against long-term use until years after \nMs. Mensing began taking the drug. She developed the condition, losing \ncontrol of muscles in her face, arms and legs.\n  Ms. Mensing's injuries are life-changing and irreversible. The \nSupreme Court held that she cannot be compensated for the drug \ncompany's failures because of a technicality in the law. That \ntechnicality arose because Ms. Mensing's pharmacy had filled her \nprescription with the generic version of the drug. The Supreme Court \nheld that, unlike brand name companies, generic manufacturers cannot be \nheld liable for inadequate labeling, because they cannot change the \nlabels on their products independently. Generic manufacturers should \nhave the ability to participate fully in the labeling process, but they \nare unable to do so. More important to injured consumers, there is no \nremedy for them. The generic manufacturers can use this Supreme Court \ndecision and the quirk in the labeling laws to avoid any \naccountability, even if they fail to inform the FDA that a label is \ninadequate.\n  The Mensing decision creates a troubling inconsistency in the law \ngoverning prescription drugs. If a consumer takes the brand-name \nversion of drug, she can sue the manufacturer for inadequate warnings. \nIf the pharmacy happens to give her the generic version, as happened to \nMs. Mensing, she is unable to seek compensation for her injuries. The \nresult is a two-track system that penalizes consumers of generic drugs \neven though many consumers have no control over which drug they take, \nbecause their health insurance plan or state laws require them to take \ngenerics if they are available.\n  In an editorial published last month, The New York Times criticized \nthe inconsistency of this outcome, writing: ``Same drug. Same \ndevastating health consequences. Opposite results. This injustice will \naffect more people as generics, which already dominate the market, \nexpand even more under the pressure to control health care costs.'' \nEven Justice Thomas, writing for the majority in Mensing, acknowledged \nthe inconsistent outcome, writing: ``[I]t is not the Court's task to \ndecide whether the statutory scheme established by Congress is unusual \nor even bizarre.'' Writing in dissent, Justice Sotomayor accurately \nwarned of ``absurd consequences'' that will flow from the \n``happenstance'' of whether a prescription was filled with a brand-name \nor generic drug.\n  I agree that having different rules for patients who take generic and \nbrand-name drugs makes little sense, and raises significant policy \nconcerns. It is also troubling that generic manufacturers cannot update \ntheir safety labels in the same way that brand manufacturers can. In \ntoday's world, where generic drugs make up 75 percent of the \nprescription drug market, all manufacturers should be able to improve \nthe warning information they provide to doctors and consumers. The \nPatient Safety and Generic Labeling Improvement Act will achieve this \ngoal.\n  This legislation is not intended to overburden the makers of generic \ndrugs. Instead, it authorizes generic drug manufacturers to act upon \ndrug safety information that they already gather pursuant to existing \nregulation. The FDA requires generic manufacturers to monitor, \ninvestigate and report adverse side effects experienced by users of \ntheir drug. Generics already must submit an annual report to the FDA \nsummarizing new information that ``might affect the safety, \neffectiveness or labeling of a drug product'', including a \n``description of actions they have taken or intend to take as a result \nof this new information''. When brand-name manufacturers exit the \nmarket--as is often the case after generics are introduced--generics \nmay be the only manufacturers who gather this information.\n  The Patient Safety and Generic Labeling Improvement Act authorizes \ngenerics to act on the information they gather to improve the labeling \non their product in the same way that brand-owners may do under \nexisting law. It creates an exception to the general requirement that \nthe labeling of a generic drug must be the same as the labeling of its \nbrand-name or listed equivalent, and instead allows generic \nmanufacturers to initiate a labeling change where that process is \navailable to brand-name manufacturers. Under the law, a generic \nmanufacturer would be able to use the ``Changes Being Effected'' \nprocess that permits manufacturers to implement a labeling change while \nthe change is simultaneously reviewed by the FDA. When a labeling \nchange is made under this provision, the FDA would be authorized to \norder conforming changes across equivalent drugs to ensure consistent \nlabeling among products.\n  This legislation has the support of public interest groups and \nadvocates, including the AARP, Public Citizen, the Alliance for \nJustice, and numerous consumer groups.\n  I have long worked to ensure that safe, affordable generic drugs are \navailable to American consumers. Earlier this Congress, I introduced \nlegislation to facilitate the importation of low-cost generic drugs \nfrom Canada, a measure that will increase competition and help drive \ndown the prices of prescription drugs. We all benefit from the \navailability of safe, affordable medication to help reduce the \noverwhelming costs of healthcare.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will promote accountability \nand ensure that all drug makers can take appropriate steps to enhance \nwarnings given to doctors and consumers. I hope that other Senators \nwill join me and my cosponsors in supporting this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nletters of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2295\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Patrick J. Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: AARP is pleased to endorse your \n     legislation, the Patient Safety\n\n[[Page S2499]]\n\n     and Generic Labeling Improvement Act, to address the issue of \n     whether generic drug manufacturers have a duty to include new \n     warnings about potentially serious side effects on their \n     labels as they become known. Your bill would accomplish this \n     by giving generic drug makers the same ability to update \n     their labeling as currently exists for manufacturers of brand \n     name drugs.\n       AARP believes generic drugs are one of the safest and most \n     effective ways for consumers to lower their prescription drug \n     costs, and we encourage our members to use generic drugs \n     whenever possible. However, AARP is concerned that, unlike \n     brand name drug manufacturers, generic drug manufacturers \n     cannot be held liable for inadequate drug warning labels due \n     to their inability to directly update their labels under \n     current law.\n       As noted in an AARP Foundation amicus brief submitted in \n     Pliva v. Mensing, AARP believes that holding generic drug \n     makers to a lower standard will effectively punish consumers \n     for choosing generic drugs and send the message that generics \n     are less trustworthy than name brand drugs--directly counter \n     to the intent of the Hatch-Waxman Act. We are encouraged by \n     your bill and hope it will serve to not only ensure patients \n     have adequate legal protections, but also prompt improvements \n     to the FDA process for updating warning labels when new \n     information about potentially harmful side effects comes to \n     light.\n       We thank you for your leadership in this area, and we look \n     forward to working with you and your colleagues on both sides \n     of the aisle to advance the Patient Safety and Generic \n     Labeling Improvement Act. If you have any further questions, \n     please feel free to call me or have your staff contact KJ \n     Hertz of our Government Affairs staff at 202 434 3770.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Joyce A. Rogers,\n     Senior Vice President, Government Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   April 17, 2012.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy: We write to express our strong support \n     for the Patient Safety and Generic Labeling Improvement Act, \n     which would promote consumer safety by ensuring that generic \n     drug companies can improve the warning information for their \n     products in the same way that brand manufacturers can under \n     existing law.\n       By authorizing generic manufacturers to improve their \n     labels using the same ``Changes Being Effected'' process that \n     is currently available to brand-name manufacturers, this \n     legislation will help protect millions of Americans. The \n     Department of Health and Human Services reports that generic \n     drugs now make up 75 percent of the market for \n     pharmaceuticals, and studies show that when a generic version \n     of a drug is available 90 percent of prescriptions are filled \n     with the generic.\n       This much-needed legislation responds to the Supreme \n     Court's 2011 decision in PLIVA v. Mensing, in which the Court \n     held 5 4 that a Minnesota woman, Gladys Mensing, could not \n     recover damages for debilitating injuries she received from a \n     drug with an inadequate warning label simply because her \n     prescription was filled with the generic version of the drug, \n     rather than with the brand-name drug. The Court previously \n     held in Wyeth v. Levine (2009) that federal law does not \n     preempt failure-to-warn claims against brand-name drug \n     manufacturers. The Mensing decision thus created an arbitrary \n     distinction whereby a court's ruling on whether or not a \n     consumer can obtain relief turns solely on the happenstance \n     of whether his or her prescription was filled with a brand-\n     name or generic drug.\n       This troubling and unfair inconsistency in the law is \n     exacerbated by the fact that many consumers have little \n     control over which version of a drug they are given. Many \n     brand-name manufacturers exit the market after generics are \n     introduced. Moreover, many state laws and health insurance \n     plans require consumers to be given generics if they are \n     available.\n       Given the inherent unfairness of the current law and the \n     ongoing harm to millions of Americans, the Senate should pass \n     this legislation without delay.\n           Sincerely,\n         Alliance for Justice, Consumer Action, Consumer \n           Federation of America, Consumers Union, Consumer \n           Watchdog, National Association of Consumer Advocates, \n           and US PIRG.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                               Public Citizen,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 18, 2012.\n     Re Letter in support of Patient Safety and Generic Labeling \n         Improvement Act\n\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy, Chairman,\n     U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy: Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer \n     advocacy organization with 250,000 members and supporters \n     nationwide, writes to applaud your introduction of \n     legislation that would give generic drug manufacturers the \n     authority to revise labeling for their products when they \n     become aware of risks that are not adequately disclosed. This \n     bill would fill a gaping hole in drug regulation that poses a \n     threat to patients' health and safety.\n       Your legislation reflects the concerns voiced by Public \n     Citizen in a citizen petition that we submitted to the Food \n     and Drug Administration in August 2011. As we explained in \n     the petition, the generic drug market has grown exponentially \n     in the past 25 years, and generic drugs now constitute a \n     majority of the prescription drugs sold in the United States. \n     The growth of generic drug sales reflects the fact that \n     generics offer equally effective but more affordable \n     alternatives to their brand-name counterparts. The regulatory \n     system, however, has not adjusted to the marketplace.\n       Under current law, a generic drug manufacturer is not \n     authorized to revise product labeling when it becomes aware \n     of inadequacies in the labeling. Specifically, FDA \n     regulations provide that, unlike brand-name manufacturers, \n     generic drug manufacturers are not permitted to initiate \n     labeling revisions to strengthen warnings, contraindications, \n     or precautions. As a result, the millions of patients who use \n     generic drugs may not have access to up-to-date information \n     on safety and proper use. And generic drug manufacturers lack \n     incentive to monitor and ensure the safety of their products, \n     even when the generic versions represent a majority of the \n     market for a particular drug. Your legislation would correct \n     this problem.\n       Your bill would also correct an illogical inconsistency in \n     the accountability that generic and brand-name drug \n     manufacturers have to patients. In a 2011 decision, PLIVA v. \n     Mensing, the Supreme Court relied on FDA regulations to hold \n     that a consumer injured by a generic drug with inadequate \n     warnings cannot seek compensation under state law for failure \n     to warn. By contrast, in a 2008 decision, Wyeth v. Levine, \n     the Court had held that manufacturers of prescription drugs \n     could be held accountable to patients for harm their drugs \n     caused. The Justices in Mensing itself noted that this \n     inconsistency ``makes little sense,'' with four Justices \n     calling it ``absurd.''\n       As the Supreme Court has noted, ``the FDA has limited \n     resources to monitor the 11,000 drugs on the market, and \n     manufacturers have superior access to information about their \n     drugs, especially in the postmarketing phase as new risks \n     emerge.'' Under your bill, generic drug manufacturers, who \n     already have access to relevant safety information, would be \n     able to revise their labeling as new information comes to \n     light, thereby making their products safer for patients.\n       For these reasons, Public Citizen strongly supports your \n     intent to fill the regulatory gap in generic drug safety. We \n     look forward to working with you to pass this important \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Allison M.

This outrageous \n     denial of a patient's right to recover fair damages makes it \n     imperative that Congress or the Food and Drug Administration \n     fashion a remedy.\n       This situation is particularly bizarre because patients \n     using the brand-name drug can sue when those using the \n     generic form of the drug cannot, as explained by Katie Thomas \n     in The Times on Wednesday. In 2008, the Supreme Court ruled \n     that a Vermont woman who had her hand and forearm amputated \n     because of gangrene after being injected with a brand name \n     antinausea drug could sue the manufacturer for inadequate \n     warning of the risks; she won $6.8 million from Wyeth.\n       In 2011, the court ruled that similar failure-to-warn suits \n     could not be brought against makers of generic drugs. As a \n     result, an Indiana woman who was also forced to have her hand \n     amputated because of gangrene after being injected with a \n     generic version of the same antinausea drug had her case \n     dismissed.\n       Same drug. Same devastating health consequences. Opposite \n     results. This injustice will affect more people as generics, \n     which already dominate the market, expand even more under the \n     pressure to control health care costs.\n       The Supreme Court's disparate rulings hinge on the ability \n     of the drug makers to change a warning label if they detect \n     new evidence of dangers. In 2008, the court found that brand-\n     name manufacturers had the unilateral power to change \n     warnings through various mechanisms even before asking the \n     Food and Drug Administration for a formal change.\n       Then, in 2011, the court found that, under the F.D.A.'s \n     interpretation of a 1984 law, known as the Hatch-Waxman \n     amendments to the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the generic \n     versions must carry warning labels identical to those of the \n     brand-name drug. The goal was to minimize confusion and \n     dispel any doubt that a generic was therapeutically \n     equivalent to the brand-name drug. Generic makers can't \n     change the warnings but can propose a change to the F.D.A., \n     which can then bring about a revision of the brand-name label \n     to trigger a corresponding change in the generic label. The \n     court ruled that because the generic makers do not control \n     the\n\n[[Page S2500]]\n\n     labeling, they cannot be sued under state law for inadequate \n     warnings.\n       Justice Clarence Thomas, writing for the majority in 2011, \n     acknowledged that the distinction ``makes little sense'' in \n     the eyes of consumers, and Justice Sonia Sotomayor, writing \n     the dissent, predicted ``absurd consequences'' depending on \n     the ``happenstance'' of whether a prescription was filled \n     with a brand-name or generic drug.\n       Congress should fix the disparity by amending the law to \n     make it clear--as Representative Henry Waxman, a co-author of \n     the statute contends--that the act did not intend to preempt \n     all failure-to-warn claims. Alternatively, the F.D.A. should \n     fix the liability problem by amending its regulations to \n     allow generic manufacturers to change the warning labels.\n       Generic drugs have rapidly expanded their reach, and, by \n     one estimate, from one-third to one-half of all generic drugs \n     no longer have a brand-name competitor. The regulatory system \n     needs to hold generic companies, many of them large \n     multinationals, accountable for labels on the products they \n     sell.\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, Gladys Mensing lives in Owatonna, MN. She \nloves being around people. That is a good thing when one has a family \nas big as Gladys does. She is the loving mother of 8 children, with 15 \ngrandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren.\n  Gladys, as I said, is from Owatonna. It is in southeastern Minnesota. \nA few weeks ago, I received some old family videos that showed her \nplaying with her grandkids. Gladys used to work as a waitress and as an \napartment manager, but what she truly enjoys is a good game of bingo.\n  In 2001, Gladys's doctor gave her a prescription for a medication \nknown as MCP to treat a digestive tract condition. Gladys did what I \nwould have done--she took her prescription to the pharmacy, got it \nfilled, and started taking her medicine per her doctor's orders.\n  Meanwhile, however, evidence was mounting linking MCP to neurological \ndisorders. Within a few years, Gladys began experiencing problems. She \nlost control of her face, tongue, and legs. It is very hard to \nunderstand Gladys when she speaks now. Her son says people sometimes \ngive Gladys strange looks when she goes out in public. Gladys used to \nbe very strong and independent. Now her family has to help her bathe \nand walk.\n  Gladys wanted to hold the drug manufacturer accountable for what \nhappened to her. She believed the warning label that came with her \nprescription was inadequate; that it did not sufficiently disclose the \nrisks of taking MCP. So Gladys, a bingo-playing grandma from rural \nMinnesota, decided to stand up for her rights.\n  Gladys took her fight all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, but that \nis where things took a bizarre turn. In Minnesota, as in many other \nStates, the law requires drug manufacturers to warn patients of the \nknown--the known--dangers associated with their products. Manufacturers \nthat do not follow the law are held accountable to the patients who are \nharmed as a result--people such as Gladys.\n  But the Supreme Court--in a 5-to-4 decision--said those laws do not \napply to generic drugs such as the medicine Gladys was taking. Rather, \nthe Court said Federal regulations actually prohibit generic drug \nmanufacturers from updating their labels--prohibit generic drug \nmanufacturers from updating their labels--and it said the Federal \nregulations prohibiting label changes trump Minnesota's patient \nprotection laws, which require full disclosure of potential risks. So \nunder that ruling, even if a generic drug company wanted to provide \nbetter warnings of risks to consumers, it cannot.\n  Generic drugs are, for all intents and purposes, the same as brand-\nname drugs. They have the same active ingredients. They are used for \nthe same purposes and, yes, in most cases, they should have the same \nlabels. That is why current FDA regulations require generic drug labels \nto match brand-name drug labels. But it does not make sense to prohibit \ngeneric drug makers from updating their labels to accurately reflect \nnew side effects or risks that have come to light. Yet that is the \ncurrent state of the law.\n  So the Court dismissed Gladys's case just because she was taking a \ngeneric drug. Let me say that again. Because Gladys was taking the \ngeneric version of her medicine, she was unable to vindicate her rights \nunder Minnesota law. If Gladys had suffered the same injuries from the \nbrand-name version of the same pill containing the same warning, she \nwould have had her day in court.\n  Since the Supreme Court dismissed Gladys's case last June, lower \ncourts have dismissed dozens of similar cases because, as a recent \narticle in the New York Times aptly said, ``What once seemed like a \ntrivial detail--whether to take a generic or brand-name drug--has \nbecome the deciding factor in whether a patient can seek legal recourse \nfrom a drug company.''\n  That does not make any sense. Justice Thomas, who wrote the Supreme \nCourt's decision in Gladys's case, admitted as much. He wrote this:\n\n       We recognize that from the perspective of Mensing . . . \n     [this decision] makes little sense.\n\n  I agree with him on this point. I would like to think he would agree \nwith me on this: Prescription drugs should be safe and their labels \nshould be adequate.\n  So Senators Leahy, Bingaman, Brown, Whitehouse, Coons, Blumenthal, \nand I are introducing a bill that would guarantee just that. Our bill, \nthe Patient Safety and Generic Labeling Improvement Act, would allow \ngeneric drug makers to update their warnings--allow them to update \ntheir warnings--to accurately reflect the known risks associated with \ntheir drugs. That is it. It would not require them to do so. It just \nlets them do what other drug manufacturers already are allowed to do.\n  Our bill says that millions of Americans who are taking generic drugs \nare entitled to the same protections as people who take brand-name \ndrugs, and it says people such as Gladys Mensing are entitled to their \nday in court when manufacturers fail to disclose risks.\n  I thank Senator Leahy for his leadership on this issue and urge my \ncolleagues to join with us in supporting this commonsense fix.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. MURRAY (for herself, Mr. Begich, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. \n        Rockefeller, and Mr. Akaka):\n  S. 2299. A bill to amend the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act and \ntitle 38, United States Code, to improve the provision of civil relief \nto members of the uniformed services and to improve the enforcement of \nemployment and reemployment rights of such members, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today, as Chairman of the Senate \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs, I am pleased to introduce the \nServicemembers Rights Enforcement Improvement Act of 2012.\n  I remain deeply committed to protecting our servicemembers and \nveterans. I was concerned, last year, when banks improperly overcharged \nand foreclosed upon deployed servicemembers in violation of the \nServicemembers Civil Relief Act. Failure to comply with the protections \nprovided to our servicemembers is unacceptable.\n  Our men and women in uniform deserve better than this, and I \nappreciate the President's and the Attorney General's leadership and \ncommitment to enforcing these important protections. This bill, which \nincludes a significant number of proposals provided to the Congress by \nthe Department of Justice, would further strengthen the Department's \nability to enforce these laws on behalf of servicemembers and veterans.\n  The bill I am introducing today would improve the Department of \nJustice's ability to enforce the protections of the Servicemembers \nCivil Relief Act by giving the Attorney General limited authority to \nissue civil investigative demands, which would allow the Attorney \nGeneral to take a more proactive approach to investigating allegations \nof Servicemembers Civil Relief Act violations. This bill would \nstrengthen the protections that prevent judgements against a \nservicemember when they cannot appear in court because of military \nservice. Finally, it would clarify that servicemembers may bring a \nprivate right of action to enforce their rights under the \nServicemembers Civil Relief Act.\n  I also remain deeply concerned about veteran employment. The number \nof unemployed veterans remains unacceptably high. Last year, \nsignificant provisions of a bill I introduced, the Hiring Heroes Act, \nwere signed into law as the VOW to Hire Heroes Act. This legislation \nwas a good first step in combatting the high rate of unemployment among \nour nation's veterans. But we must do more. We must also ensure\n\n[[Page S2501]]\n\nthat the laws designed to protect the employment rights of our \nservicemembers during periods of service are equally strong.\n  The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act, \ncommonly referred to as USSERA, protects servicemembers' employment \nrights during a period of military service. It also prohibits employer \ndiscrimination based on military service or obligation. This \nlegislation would strengthen the ability of the Department of Justice \nand the Office of Special Counsel to enforce these valuable \nprotections.\n  Specifically, this bill would grant the Attorney General the \nauthority to investigate and file suit to challenge a pattern or \npractice in violation of USERRA and would grant the Attorney General \nlimited authority to issue civil investigative demands. It will also \nprovide the Office of Special Counsel with subpoena authority in USERRA \ninvestigations. These enhancements will ensure that when our National \nGuard and Reserve members deploy, they do so knowing their jobs are \nsecure.\n  It is vital that the Federal departments and agencies charged with \nprotecting our servicemembers have the tools necessary to enforce the \nprotections provided to them. The legislation I am introducing today \nwould do just that.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record as follows:\n\n                                S. 2299\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 424\n\n       Whereas, in March 2011, large-scale peaceful demonstrations \n     began to take place in Syria against the authoritarian rule \n     of Bashar al-Assad;\n       Whereas the Bashar al-Assad regime responded to protests by \n     launching a campaign of escalating and indiscriminate \n     violence, including gross human rights violations, use of \n     force against civilians, torture, extrajudicial killings, \n     arbitrary executions, sexual violence, and interference with \n     access to medical treatment;\n       Whereas demonstrators initially demanded political reform, \n     but under sustained violent attack by the Government of \n     Syria, now demand a change in the Syrian regime;\n       Whereas forces loyal to Bashar al-Assad are increasingly \n     and indiscriminately employing heavy weapons, including tanks \n     and artillery, to attack civilian population centers;\n       Whereas, on November 23, 2011, the United Nations-appointed \n     Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian \n     Arab Republic reported that ``crimes against humanity of \n     murder, torture, rape or other forms of sexual violence of \n     comparable gravity, imprisonment or other severe deprivation \n     of liberty, enforced disappearances of persons and other \n     inhumane acts of a similar character have occurred in \n     different locations in Syria since March 2011'' and that \n     ``the Syrian Arab Republic bears responsibility for these \n     crimes and violations'';\n       Whereas, on February 22, 2012, the Independent \n     International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab \n     Republic found in a subsequent report that ``commanding \n     officers and officials at the highest level of government \n     bear responsibility for crimes against humanity and other \n     gross human rights violations'';\n       Whereas, on March 15, 2012, United Nations Secretary-\n     General Ban Ki-Moon warned that ``well over 8,000 people'' \n     have been killed because of the ``brutal oppression'' by \n     authorities in Syria and called the status quo in Syria \n     ``indefensible'';\n       Whereas, on March 27, 2012, the United Nations reported \n     that the death toll in Syria had climbed to ``more than \n     9,000'';\n       Whereas at least 3,000 people have been killed in Syria in \n     2012 alone;\n       Whereas, on October 2, 2011, a broad-based coalition of \n     Syrian opposition leaders announced the establishment of the \n     Syrian National Council (SNC), calling for the end of the \n     Bashar al-Assad regime and the formation of a civil, \n     pluralistic, and democratic state in Syria;\n       Whereas, on February 24, 2012, Secretary of State Hillary \n     Clinton called the Syrian National Council (SNC) ``a leading \n     legitimate representative of Syrians seeking peaceful \n     democratic change'' and an ``effective representative for the \n     Syrian people with governments and international \n     organizations'';\n       Whereas growing numbers of people in Syria, under continued \n     and escalating assault by the Assad regime, have taken up \n     arms to defend themselves and organized armed resistance \n     under the banner of the Free Syrian Army (FSA);\n       Whereas the leaders of the Free Syrian Army have rejected \n     sectarianism;\n       Whereas, on December 6, 2011, the Syrian National Council \n     issued a statement affirming that the Free Syrian Army \n     ``deserve[s] the backing of all supporters of human rights in \n     Syria'' and applauding the decision of FSA officers to ``risk \n     their lives and those of their families because they believe \n     in Syria and have lost faith in the Assad doctrine'';\n       Whereas, on March 12, 2012, the Syrian National Council, \n     through its spokesperson, called for ``military intervention \n     by Arab and Western countries to protect civilians'' in \n     Syria, and endorsed the arming of the Free Syrian Army;\n       Whereas, on March 16, 2012, opposition activists inside \n     Syria staged protests calling for ``immediate military \n     intervention by the Arabs and Muslims, followed by the rest \n     of the world'';\n       Whereas, on February 24, 2012, the Foreign Minister of \n     Saudi Arabia, Saud bin Feisal, called providing weapons to \n     the Syrian opposition ``an excellent idea...because they have \n     to protect themselves'';\n       Whereas, on February 27, 2012, the Prime Minister of Qatar, \n     Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim al Thani, said of the Syrian \n     opposition, ``I think we should do whatever is necessary to \n     help them, including giving them weapons to defend \n     themselves.'';\n       Whereas, on March 1, 2012, the parliament of Kuwait voted \n     overwhelmingly on a resolution calling on the Government of \n     Kuwait to support the Syrian opposition, including by \n     providing weapons;\n       Whereas, on March 16, 2012, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip \n     Erdogan of Turkey said that the Government of Turkey was \n     considering setting up a ``security'' or ``buffer zone'' \n     along its border with Syria;\n       Whereas, on December 22, 2010, the Senate passed Senate \n     Concurrent Resolution 71 (112th Congress), a bipartisan \n     resolution recognizing that it is in the national interest of \n     the United States to prevent and mitigate acts of genocide \n     and other mass atrocities against civilians;\n       Whereas, on August 4, 2011, President Barack Obama issued \n     Presidential Study Directive 10 (PSD 10), stating, \n     ``Preventing mass atrocities and genocide is a core national \n     security interest and a core moral responsibility of the \n     United States.'';\n       Whereas, on May 18, 2011, President Obama signed Executive \n     Order 13573, targeting senior officials of the Government of \n     Syria due to the Government's continuing escalation of \n     violence against the people of Syria;\n       Whereas, on April 29, 2011, President Obama signed \n     Executive Order 13572, imposing sanctions on certain \n     individuals and entities in the annex to the order and \n     providing the authority to designate persons responsible for \n     human rights abuses in Syria, including those related to \n     repressing the people of Syria;\n       Whereas, on February 4, 2012, President Obama stated that \n     Bashar al-Assad ``has no right to lead Syria and has lost all \n     legitimacy with his people and the international community'';\n       Whereas, on February 17, 2012, the Senate passed Senate \n     Resolution 379 (112th Congress), stating that the ``gross \n     human rights violations perpetuated by the Government of \n     Syria against the people of Syria represent a grave risk to \n     regional peace and stability'';\n       Whereas, on February 28, 2012, Secretary of State Clinton, \n     in testimony before the Subcommittee on the Department of \n     State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs of the \n     Committee on Appropriations of the Senate concerning Bashar \n     al- Assad, testified that, ``based on the definitions of war \n     criminal and crimes against humanity, there would be an \n     argument to be made that he would fit into that category'';\n       Whereas, on March 1, 2012, Admiral James Stavridis, \n     commander of United States European Command and Supreme \n     Allied Commander of NATO, during testimony before the \n     Committee on Armed Services of the Senate, agreed with the \n     statement that ``the provision of arms, communication \n     equipment, and tactical intelligence'' would ``help the \n     Syrian opposition to better organize itself and push Assad \n     from power'';\n       Whereas, on March 6, 2012, General James Mattis, commander \n     of United States Central Command, testified before the \n     Committee on Armed Services of the Senate that Bashar al-\n     Assad will ``continue to employ heavier and heavier weapons \n     on his people'';\n       Whereas, on March 6, 2012, General Mattis testified before \n     the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate that there is \n     ``a full throated effort by Iran to keep Assad there and \n     oppressing his own people'' in Syria, including ``providing \n     the kinds of weapons that are being used right now to \n     suppress the opposition,'' as well as ``listening capability, \n     eavesdropping capability...and experts who I could only say \n     are experts at oppressing'';\n       Whereas, on March 6, 2012, General Mattis testified before \n     the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate that the fall \n     of the Bashar al-Assad regime would represent ``the biggest \n     strategic setback for Iran in 25 years''; and\n       Whereas the continuing gross human rights violations \n     against the people of Syria represent a grave risk to \n     regional peace and stability: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns the mass atrocities and severe human rights \n     abuses being perpetrated against the people of Syria by \n     Bashar al-Assad and his followers;\n       (2) recognizes that the people of Syria have an inherent \n     right to defend themselves against the campaign of violence \n     being conducted by the Assad regime;\n       (3) supports calls by Arab leaders to provide the people of \n     Syria with the means to defend themselves against Bashar al-\n     Assad and his forces, including through the provision of \n     weapons and other material support, and calls on the \n     President to work closely\n\n[[Page S2503]]\n\n     with regional partners to implement these efforts \n     effectively;\n       (4) urges the President to take all necessary precautions \n     to ensure that any support for the Syrian opposition does not \n     benefit individuals in Syria who are aligned with al Qaeda or \n     associated movements, or who have committed human rights \n     abuses;\n       (5) affirms that the establishment of safe havens for \n     people from Syria, as contemplated by governments in the \n     Middle East, would be an important step to save Syrian lives \n     and to help bring an end to Mr. Assad's killing of civilians \n     in Syria, and calls on the President to consult urgently and \n     thoroughly with regional allies on whether, how, and where to \n     create such safe havens;\n       (6) urges the President, as part of an international effort \n     to hold senior officials in Syria accountable for mass \n     atrocities--\n       (A) to gather information about such mass atrocities, \n     including gross human rights violations, use of force against \n     civilians, torture, extrajudicial killings, arbitrary \n     executions, sexual violence, and interference with access to \n     medical treatment; and\n       (B) to continue to take actions to ensure that senior \n     officials in the Government of Syria and other individuals \n     responsible for mass atrocities in Syria are held \n     accountable, including by using the authority provided under \n     Executive Order 13572 and Executive Order 13573 to designate \n     additional individuals;\n       (7) urges the Atrocities Prevention Board, once it is \n     formally constituted by the President as called for in \n     Presidential Study Directive 10, to provide recommendations \n     concerning measures to prevent continued mass atrocities in \n     Syria; and\n       (8) commends the establishment of the ``Friends of the \n     Syrian People'' Contact Group and other international \n     diplomatic efforts to end the violence and support a peaceful \n     transition to democracy in Syria, and reaffirms the necessity \n     of the departure from power of Bashar al-Assad.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/18/senate-section/article/S2503-1",
