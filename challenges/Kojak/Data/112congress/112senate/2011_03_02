Madam President, we have worked for weeks now in moving \nforward on this funding measure for the country. What Democrats have \nsaid for weeks now is that we are committed to working with all sides \nto find a middle ground that helps us move forward and move toward a \nfiscally responsible budget for the rest of the year.\n  Yesterday the House acted and soon the Senate will act as well. Our \npriorities are twofold: One, keeping the country running so essential \nservices do not get interrupted--and certainly they should not be \ninterrupted--at a time we can least afford it.\n  We have 2 more weeks to do this. We have heard today in the news that \nJohn McCain's economic adviser said if the Republicans continue going \non the route they have talked about, it will eliminate 700,000 jobs in \nthis struggling economy. Goldman Sachs issued a study yesterday \nindicating it would hurt the gross national product by up to 2 percent, \nand that is devastating.\n  So our priorities are twofold: One, keeping the country running so \nessential services do not get interrupted at a time we can least afford \nit; and, two, equally as important, we need to lay the groundwork with \na budget that invests in what works and cuts what doesn't. We have to \nbegin to bring down the deficit without forfeiting our future.\n  This has not been an easy process. But we need to set aside partisan \nmotivations and remember we work for the American people, not our \npolitical parties. I am pleased the Republicans have agreed with the \nPresident's suggested cuts and dropped all those riders--provisions \nmeant only to send messages, only to create unnecessary hurdles, and \nkill progress.\n  We are going to keep working toward a solution. This time around, it \nmay not include everything Democrats want or everything Republicans \nwant. But we need to have a compromise which will be part of an ongoing \nconversation. Just like our overarching priority when we budget--that \nwe must live within our means--this next step recognizes that we must \ndo the best with what we have.\n  Today we will also work toward finishing the patent reform bill. It \nis called the America Invests Act, a jobs bill. It is a priority. We \nhave to finish\n\n[[Page S1078]]\n\nthis matter. This matter, this patent legislation, is important in \nreturning America's economy to a position of strength.\n  As we speak, there are 750,000 patent applications that are stuck in \nthe Patent Office because they do not have enough people to do the \nwork. It is true to Democrats' agenda from day one: creating jobs and \nensuring America can compete in the 21st century's global economy.\n  Now, Madam President, I see my friend from Oklahoma on the Senate \nfloor. A couple of things he has done in recent days have been \nextremely important: first of all, the money that is collected in the \nPatent Office should be used in the Patent Office. I also think it is \nimportant people recognize we have an entity around here called the \nGeneral Accounting Office, which is the watchdog of Congress. It is an \nimportant entity. It is available to both Democrats and Republicans.\n  My friend from Oklahoma wrote a letter, as he has a right to do, \nabout a couple different areas finding where there was duplication of \nservices. They studied this and came back with what I think are some \nmatters to which we need to direct our attention.\n  Duplication in different entities around here has become untoward. So \nI commend and applaud my friend from Oklahoma in helping us go down \nthis path that I think is going to be extremely important for us to \nwork our way out of the problems we have.\n  I know we have a lot of work to do, and it is important we do that \nwork. We are going to get this spending matter out of the way today. \nThen we will have, as I have indicated, a little over 2 weeks to work \nsomething out on a long-term basis. The President has said he would \nlike a longer period of time. We could not work that out with our \nfriends on the Republican side. I hope, I hope they do not need a \ngovernment shutdown--and I am not referring to my friends in the Senate \nbut the House. I hope they do not need a government shutdown to do what \nis necessary for this country. I think we should avoid that shutdown, \nand we can avoid that shutdown and still recognize that there are costs \nthat need to be cut from government spending. It cannot all come from \nour domestic discretionary side of the ledger. There are Pentagon \nmoneys that can be saved. There are other programs that have been \nuntouchable in past years that we need to look at for a long-term \nsolution to the country's problems.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/02/senate-section/article/S1078-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1078-S1083]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          AUTHORIZING EXPENDITURES BY COMMITTEES OF THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I wish to start this morning by \nacknowledging the progress that has been made this week. Senator Reid's \nprediction that the Senate will follow the House in approving a $4 \nbillion cut for the current fiscal year is a small step, but it is \nindeed a step in the right direction. This is a long-awaited \nacknowledgment by Democrats in Congress that we have a spending problem \naround here. It is hard to believe when we are spending $1.6 trillion \nmore than we are taking in in a single year that it would take this \nlong to cut a penny in spending, but it is progress nonetheless. It was \nalso encouraging to hear the White House say yesterday that they would \nbe supportive of a 4-week CR with $8 billion in cuts. So it is \nencouraging that the White House and congressional Democrats now agree \nthat the status quo won't work and that the bills we pass must include \nspending reductions.\n  Beyond that, the GAO report which Senator Coburn requested and which \nwe all saw yesterday makes it pretty clear--to me, at least--that there \nare a lot of very obvious targets for additional cuts. I wish to thank \nSenator Coburn for requesting the report, first of all. I don't think \nmost Americans are surprised to hear that Washington is wasting so much \nmoney. I do think some people might be surprised at how rampant it is \nand, frankly, the sheer idiocy--the sheer idiocy--of some of the waste \nwe have been tolerating around here.\n  I can't imagine anyone in the Senate voting against a bill that would \nreturn to taxpayers money we are wasting on the bloated and duplicative \nprograms outlined in this report, programs which, as ABC put it, are \nchewing up billions of dollars in funding every year. It would be an \nembarrassment and a double indictment of Congress to not act. The \nreport is damning, but it comes at a good time. Right when we are \nlooking to make cuts on which both parties can agree, we learn that we \nhave a roadmap showing more than 100 programs dealing with surface \ntransportation issues, 82 programs monitoring teacher quality, 80 \nprograms for economic development, 47 programs for job training, and 17 \ndifferent programs for disaster preparedness. Here is my favorite: 56 \nprograms to help people understand finances.\n\n[[Page S1084]]\n\nHow do you like that? There are 56 programs to help people understand \nfinances. If that isn't an emblem of government waste, I don't know \nwhat is. We are going to be $1.6 trillion in the red this year alone. \nNot only do we think we are in a position to teach other people about \nfinancial literacy, we have 56 overlapping programs to do it. If we are \ngoing to create the conditions for private sector job growth in this \ncountry, this is a good place to start.\n  We have to stop spending money we don't have on more government and \ncalling that progress. Democrats have tried that. They have borrowed $3 \ntrillion over the past 2 years to expand the size and scope of \ngovernment. And what has it gotten us? It has gotten us 3 million more \nlost jobs.\n  We have made some progress this week--a very small step, perhaps, but \none in the right direction. At the same time, the White House took \nanother step backward this week by failing to fulfill another \nresponsibility. According to the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act, the \nPresident is required to submit a reform proposal for Medicare if more \nthan 45 percent of the program's finances are being drawn from the \ngovernment's general revenue fund instead of a fund specifically set \naside for Medicare for 2 years in a row. As of today, that is the \nsituation. As of today, that is the situation. The President is \nsupposed to have taken care of this, but he hasn't. He is punting on \nthis responsibility just as he punted on other reforms in the 10-year \nbudget plan he released last month.\n  Washington's unsustainable spending on entitlements such as Medicare \nand Medicaid and Social Security must be addressed now--now--and we \nwill never be able to ensure the stability and solvency of any of them \nwithout Presidential leadership. In this case, that is not just my \nopinion; the law actually requires it.\n  Now, just one more word on the continuing resolution. Once we pass \nthis stopgap spending measure, we will be right back at it again 2 \nweeks from now unless we can reach an agreement on a long-term measure \nbefore then.\n  The House has sent us a bill that will keep the government funded \nthrough the end of the year. At the moment this next continuing \nresolution expires, we will be nearly halfway through the fiscal year. \nThe House bill contains a much needed defense spending bill for the \nrest of the year. Many important programs have been delayed, and \nSecretary Gates has made clear that further delay will harm combat \nreadiness. So there are many compelling reasons for us to reach \nagreement on a longer term bill.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/02/senate-section/article/S1084-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I thank the majority leader and the \nminority leader both for their comments on this report. It is important \nfor the American people to know that this is the first of three reports \nwe are going to receive. This report just covers what the GAO has \nlooked at in the last 4 to 5 years. It truly only covers about one-\nthird of the Federal Government, and I am talking discretionary \nprograms, not mandatory programs such as Social Security and Medicare \nand Medicaid.\n  The GAO report shows at least $100 billion in savings if we could do \nour job. We are going to have a large debate over the next 2 weeks \nfocused on funding the government for the next 6 months of this fiscal \nyear and what the funding is going to be like in the next year. If I \nwere sitting at home as a regular American looking at Congress, having \nread this report, the question I would ask is, Why will there be any \ndebate at all? The GAO has given us a roadmap. They have said: Here is \nwhere $100 billion--those are my numbers, not theirs--of savings can \ncome on an annualized basis on the first third of the discretionary \nside of the Federal Government. The discretionary programs of this \ngovernment are 24 percent greater now than they were 2 years ago.\n  The challenge we face before us as a nation is a far greater \nchallenge than anything we have ever faced. That sounds like a gigantic \noverstatement, but when the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who \nis head of all of our military, reporting to our civilian officials, \nsays the greatest threat to this country is our debt, we ought to wake \nup and pay attention to it. The average American--75 percent of \nAmericans--across this land wants the size of the Federal Government \nand its spending reduced, and that includes Democrats, Republicans, and \nIndependents. What is lacking today is the leadership to define the \nproblem for the American people so that we can come together as a \nnation and solve this greatest of all challenges before us.\n  Let me spend a minute talking about what is going to happen if we \ndon't solve it. We heard the minority leader, the Senator from \nKentucky, talk about the $1.65 trillion deficit this year. Today, the \nUnited States is borrowing money, on average, for everything we have \nborrowed, for about 2 percent. The historical average at which we \nborrow money is around 6 percent. Over the next 2 years, we are going \nto add, if we don't change things drastically--and I am talking \ndrastically--another $3.5 trillion to the debt, to bring us to almost \n$18 trillion worth of debt. If we apply our historical interest rate to \nthe debt--which we will be at in 2 or 3 years, there is no question \nabout that--of 6 percent to $18 trillion, what we get is $1.08 trillion \na year in interest costs. Think about that. We spent $127 billion this \nlast year on interest, and we are going to take $1 trillion.\n  What happens if that happens? What that means is there is no \ndiscretionary budget. That means there is no money for the military; \nthere is no money for education; there is no money for any or all of \nthe programs other than Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. That \nis the only thing that is left. And if that happens, our ability to \nborrow money in the international market will markedly decline, and the \nlikelihood is that interest rates will go even higher than our \nhistorical average of 6 percent.\n  So the time to call us together, the time for shared sacrifice--not \nfor sacrifice's sake but so we can restore the hope of prosperity for \nour Nation--is now. It is not tomorrow, it is now.\n  We are going to have a small bill on the floor that over the next 2 \nweeks will eliminate $4 billion by advancing terminations of programs \nboth President Bush and President Obama want to terminate and eliminate \n$2.7 billion worth of earmarks that are inappropriate. So that is $4 \nbillion over 2 weeks. Our interest cost today and what we are borrowing \nis $3 billion. That is what we are borrowing a day that we don't have. \nEvery day, we go into the markets and borrow $3 billion. So over these \n2 weeks, 14 days--14 days--we are going to borrow $42 billion, and we \nare only going to save $4 billion. Do my colleagues see the magnitude \nof the problem? We cannot continue to go in this direction.\n  The bill the House sent us is a step in the right direction but far \nless than what is needed based on the reality of what is in front of \nus. Every dollar this government spends, we borrow 40 cents of it--40 \ncents. What do we think a 20-year-old individual out there is going to \nsee 20 years from now as a consequence of us going down the drain in\n\n[[Page S1085]]\n\nterms of the interest costs and the debt?\n  Necessity is the mother of invention. We have a need now as a \nnation--not as Republicans and Democrats but as a Nation--to come \ntogether and make the decisions that will put us on a course that \nguarantees the future for our kids and grandkids. The easiest way I \nknow right now to take some of the sting out of the parochialism and \npartisanship is for every Member of this body and those in the House to \nbecome acutely aware of what this report says.\n  The minority leader listed a few of the programs. Let me go through \nthese. Sitting at home or sitting in your office, think about if any of \nthis makes sense.\n  There are 82 separate teacher training programs run by the Federal \nGovernment--82 separate sets of bureaucracies and sets of Federal \nemployees. None of these teacher training programs, by the way, have a \nmetric on them to evaluate whether they are successful. So when we are \nnot successful--and I question whether it is even the role of the \nFederal Government to be involved in teacher training. I couldn't find \nit in the Constitution. Thomas Jefferson couldn't find it in the \nConstitution. Roosevelt couldn't find it in the Constitution. Johnson \ncouldn't find it in the Constitution. They all said so. We have quotes \non that. Yet we have 82 programs, none of which do we know whether they \nare working.\n  We have 47 job training programs, 44 of which overlap one another--\nsome to the degree of 100 percent, some 60 percent. We spend $18 \nbillion a year on it, and not one of them has a measurement of whether \nit is effective. We have a great need in our country today to retrain \npeople to available jobs. Yet we don't have any idea whether these will \nwork. If you are trying to figure out how to get through these \nprograms, you need another government program to help you figure out \nhow to get through them.\n  We have 20 offices with programs for homeless people--20 different \nprograms--at the Federal level. Again, if you read the Constitution and \nthe enumerated powers, you find a real difficulty in saying whether \nthat is a Federal responsibility versus a State responsibility. Yet we \nhave 20 separate programs for homeless people. How about one that \nworks--if, in fact, it is a responsibility of the Federal Government.\n  We run 80 separate economic development programs--80 of them. That is \nin four different Cabinet agencies. We spend $6.5 billion a year, and \nwhat the GAO says is you cannot say whether there is any economic \ndevelopment that has come out of this $6.5 billion.\n  The Department of Transportation spends $58 billion on 100 separate \nprograms run by 5 different agencies with 6,000 employees, with no idea \nwhether that is the most efficient or effective way to do it because \nnobody has ever put a metric on it.\n  We have 30 separate programs on food safety, run by 15 different \nFederal agencies. We just added a whole bunch more with the last food \nsafety bill--none of which had a metric on it, none of which perfected \nthe food safety in terms of interstate transport, which is undoubtedly \na Federal responsibility. How about an efficient and effective way to \ndo that. How about 1 agency being responsible for food safety instead \nof 15.\n  We have 18 domestic food and nutrition programs--we spend $62.5 \nbillion--11 of which we have no idea whether they are performing \neffectively.\n  The first question you might ask is, How in the world did we get all \nthese programs? We got all these programs because somebody saw a need \nand thought that would solve that need. They did so without the benefit \nof one of the No. 1 obligations of Congress, which is the oversight of \nthe bureaucracy. We have all these complaints by those who favor the \nearmarking process that if we don't earmark it, then the Federal \nagencies will spend the money where they are. They forget one little \nclue in terms of the Congress. We have absolute power to oversee every \nbranch of the Federal Government in terms of their effectiveness and \ntheir efficiency.\n  Yet we have not done it. The Congress has that. Whether it is run by \nRepublicans or Democrats, it is not done. It is not a partisan issue. \nIt is laziness on our part. It is far easier to write a new bill that \nsolves the same problem and not oversee the others. Consequently, we \nanswer the humanitarian, compassionate call to fix something we have \ndone by treating symptoms rather than the disease.\n  We have a real disease in our country today. The disease is a cancer \nthat will take away our freedom. If you look back in history, all \nrepublics have fallen. The average age of a republic is 206 years. How \ndid they fail? What caused them to fail? If you read the history books \nand look at all of them, you will find that even though they might have \nbeen overrun by an enemy, the key factor that caused them to fail was \nfiscal every time. They lived beyond their means. Look at what is \nhappening to us in the world today. The scope of our power militarily \nis being limited by our economic power because we are extremely far in \ndebt. When you go to the lead economists, such as Ken Rogoff and Carmen \nReinhart--the book they have written is ``This Time is Different.'' The \neconomists tell us our debt right now--not what is coming this next \nyear but right now--with the interest costs we have today, is costing 1 \npercent of GDP. We are only going to grow about 3.5 percent this year. \nIf we didn't have the debt, it would be 4.5 percent. That means 1 \nmillion more people would have great-paying jobs this year if we didn't \nhave this debt. So there is a clarion call out there coming from \nAmerica--not inside Washington--to fix the real problems.\n  As a physician, what I know is this: If I treat the symptoms of a \ndisease and do not treat the real disease, I ultimately make the \ndisease much worse. I cover up the signs and symptoms of the disease. \nThe disease we have is a disease of not recognizing the very critical \nnature that you cannot--never--you can never live above and beyond your \nmeans without ultimately paying a greater price. The difference between \nthe Federal Government, most of the State governments, and every family \nis when you have maxed out the credit card, it is maxed. You are not \ngoing to get another credit card company to give you more. You will \neither have to start paying or you will default on it.\n  The question comes, Will we honor our true commitments? Will we make \nthe hard decisions that are required to put us on a path for renewed \nprosperity? Will we take real information--and I have offered 70 \namendments on this over the past 6 years, which have been voted down--\nand will we start paying attention now because, ultimately, if we don't \nmake decisions today that will control and set us on a path of \nprosperity, we are going to be in a position where our debtholders will \nmake our decisions for us. That is when liberty declines. That is when \nAmerican exceptionalism dies. That is when our destiny is taken from \nour hands. It should not be that way.\n  I, again, call on the President to lead this Nation to define the \nproblem, the real threat to our freedom, and come forward and pull us \ntogether and let's solve this problem, with everyone recognizing that \neveryone is going to sacrifice, but the sacrifice will create a future \nbenefit that will be rewarded in the lives of our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KIRK. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I rise to support this continuing \nresolution. As we know, the Senate is set to pass a short-term funding \nbill, while negotiations continue on a longer term funding bill for the \nrest of the year.\n  The administration has presented us with a request also to fund the \ngovernment next year and is expected to ask for an increase in the \nFederal debt ceiling. This legislation cuts about $4 billion. Up \nagainst our annual deficit or the total debt, it is but a microdrop in \nthe budget.\n  The Federal Government is on track to spend about $3.7 trillion this \nfiscal\n\n[[Page S1086]]\n\nyear, while taking in only $2.2 trillion in revenue. If we compared \nthis to a middle-class example, it would be as if someone was spending \n$37,000 a year, with an income of only $22,000.\n  Replace ``thousand'' for ``trillion'' and you get a good idea of how \nfiscally irresponsible the Federal Government has become. We have a $14 \ntrillion debt and, as we all know now, we are borrowing 40 cents of \nevery $1 we spend. Clearly, there is a growing danger in the country \nfrom tremendous debt and runaway spending. It is this resolution that \nwill help in a very small way to put us on a better track.\n  I encourage us to use a multipronged approach as we move forward. We \nneed to reverse the current spending trend of the Congress. We need to \naddress long-term obligations and put statutory backstops into place to \nmake sure it will be very difficult for future Congresses to do what \npast Congresses have done.\n  As a very new member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I will \nbe asking Federal agencies to identify further programs and ways to \nreduce Federal spending. The administration has been on the right track \nin several key areas. They have proposed to cut or terminate almost 150 \ndiscretionary programs that would save about $21 billion and defense \nprograms that would save about $25 billion. But that savings should be \nput to reducing our total need to borrow and not bumped back into \nadditional spending by the government.\n  Additionally, we need to incorporate what we just learned from the \nGovernment Accountability Office about inefficient and duplicative \nareas of the Federal budget. GAO's recommendations for consolidations \nand eliminating programs should be fully reviewed and, in many places, \nimplemented for next year's budget.\n  Treasury Secretary Geithner will soon ask the Congress to increase \nthe allowable Federal debt a fourth time for the last 2 years. In my \njudgment, Congress should say no unless such an increase is coupled \nwith new and dramatic antispending reforms that would make any future \nadditions to our debt nearly impossible.\n  While defaulting on U.S. bonds is not an option, Congress must tie \nfuture debt limit extensions to reforms that produce much smaller and \nsmarter government. As Indiana's Governor Daniels has said: ``You will \nnever know how much government you won't miss.''\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, we face as a nation some of the most \ndifficult circumstances this country has faced since the Great \nDepression. Two of the major issues we are facing is the collapse of \nthe middle class and, simultaneously, while poverty increases and the \nmiddle class in this country disappears, we also find ourselves with a \n$14 trillion national debt and a $1.6 trillion deficit.\n  At this momentous time in American history, the question arises as to \nhow we, in fact, will deal with the deficit. Will we deal with it in a \nway that is fair and just or will we, at a time when the gap between \nthe very wealthy and everybody else is growing wider, in fact, try to \nbalance the budget on the backs of the middle class, on the backs of \nthe poor, on the backs of the elderly, the sick, the children?\n  That is the question we have to address right now.\n  Yes, the deficit is a serious problem. Yes, we have to go forward in \ndeficit reduction. But, no, in the midst of a major recession, it is \nmorally wrong and economically bad policy to balance the budget on the \nbacks of those people who are already hurting.\n  I find it interesting that some of the loudest voices who come before \nus every day talking about the serious problem of the deficit are \nprecisely those people who have voted time after time after time to \nraise the deficit, raise the national debt. Yet now they come forward \nand say we have to cut programs for the elderly, the poor, and the \nchildren in order to balance the budget.\n  I suppose it turns out that now I and a few others are the real \ndeficit hawks in the Senate. When it came to the war in Iraq--which \nwill end up costing us some $3 trillion--I didn't hear a whole lot of \ndiscussion about how that war was going to be paid for. I voted against \nthat war.\n  When it came to giving huge tax breaks to the wealthiest people in \nthis country, I didn't hear my Republican friends say: Oh, gee, we \ncan't do that because it is going to drive up the deficit. I voted \nagainst tax breaks for the wealthy.\n  When it came to passing an unfunded $4 billion Medicare Part D \nprescription drug program--written by the insurance companies and the \ndrug companies--I didn't hear my Republican friends say our kids and \ngrandchildren are going to have to pay for that. I voted against that.\n  Madam President, you will recall that after the crooks on Wall Street \ndrove this Nation into a recession and they needed a bailout from the \nAmerican people, you didn't hear too many of our friends who voted for \nthat bailout say: Oh, we can't do that; it is unpaid for. It is going \nto drive up the deficit and the national debt. You didn't hear that.\n  But now, suddenly we have people who have great concern about the \nnational debt and the deficit, and they intend to balance that budget \non the backs of working people, the elderly, the sick, the poor, and \nthe children. Among other things, which is incomprehensible to me, at a \ntime when approximately 16 percent of our people are truly unemployed--\nway above the official levels, the official numbers, because the \nofficial numbers do not include those people who have given up looking \nfor work, those people working part-time when they want to work full-\ntime--the Republicans come up with a deficit reduction package which \nwill cost us some 700,000 jobs.\n  Now, I don't know how or why in the middle of a severe recession, \nwhen unemployment is so high, they would come up with a proposal that \ncosts 700,000 jobs.\n  Madam President, you well know that we do an abysmal job in this \ncountry in terms of taking care of our children. We have the highest \nrate of childhood poverty in the industrialized world. We have a \ntotally inadequate early childhood education program in this country. \nHead Start, to the degree that it is funded adequately, does a good \njob. But in the midst of the crisis in early childhood education and \nchildcare, the Republican proposal would cut Head Start--Head Start--\none of the most important programs in America, giving low-income kids a \nchance to maybe get into school in the first grade, in kindergarten, on \npar with the other kids. They want to cut that program by 20 percent \nfrom fiscal year 2010, depriving over 200,000 little kids the \nopportunity not only to receive early childhood education but health \ncare benefits and nutrition benefits from this important program.\n  I worked very hard to expand community health centers in America \nbecause maybe--just maybe--it is a bad idea that 45,000 Americans are \ngoing to die this year because they do not get to a doctor. Pick up the \npapers all over America. Tens of thousands of people are going to be \nthrown off Medicaid. What do you do if you don't have health insurance \nand you are 40 or 50 years of age and you get sick? What do you do? Yet \nthe Republican proposal would cut community health centers by $1.3 \nbillion, denying 11 million patients access to quality primary health \ncare. In the midst of a major health care crisis, when millions of \npeople are uninsured--50 million uninsured and people being thrown off \nMedicaid--you don't shut down community health centers and deny people \naccess to health care.\n  In Vermont--and I am sure in New York State--young people are finding \nit very difficult to afford a college education. They are coming out of \ncollege deeply in debt. In some cases, they can't go to college. We are \nfalling behind other countries in terms of the percentage of our young \npeople graduating from college. Yet the Republican proposal would \nreduce by 17 percent the average Pell grant, and 9.4\n\n[[Page S1087]]\n\nmillion low-income college students would lose some or all of their \nPell grant.\n  At this moment in American history where we are involved in an \ninternational, global economy, with so much pressure from abroad, we \nhave to invest more in education, more in higher education, not less.\n  In the State of Vermont, the Community Services Block Grant Program \nprovides vital services to low-income people who are in need of \nemergency food, emergency housing--emergency services. They do a great \njob. The Republican proposal would cut the Community Services Block \nGrant Program by $405 million, which would harm 20 million low-income \npeople, including millions of seniors.\n  Lastly--not lastly because there is a long list of these cuts which \nmake no sense to me--I want to mention a cut of $1.3 billion to the \nSocial Security Administration. Our Republican friends say we are not \ncutting Social Security, but they are proposing a $1.3 billion cut to \nthe Social Security Administration--the people who administer the \nprogram. What does that mean?\n  Right now, there is a significant delay if you are looking for \ndisability benefits--a huge delay. People are calling my office all the \ntime saying they can't find anybody to process their claims. Yet the \nRepublicans would propose a $1.3 billion cut, which would delay Social \nSecurity benefits to about 500,000 Americans.\n  The issue is pretty clear: The top 1 percent in America earns 23 \npercent of all income, more than the bottom 50 percent. The wealthiest \npeople in this country over the last 20 years have seen a reduction--a \nreduction--in the tax rates they pay. Today, at 16 percent, the \nwealthiest people in this country are paying the lowest tax rates that \nthe rich have paid in many decades.\n  This is not a complicated issue. This issue is, do we move forward to \nbalance the budget on the backs of people who are on Social Security, \non the backs of little children who need Head Start, on the backs of \nseniors in the State of Vermont who depend upon heating assistance? Do \nwe balance the budget on the backs of the weak, the vulnerable, the \nelderly or the poor or do we say: When we have an increasingly unequal \ndistribution of income--the rich are doing very well--do we ask the \nwealthiest people to start paying their fair share of taxes?\n  The American people are pretty clear on this matter. They think it is \nwrong to balance the budget on the backs of those people who are \nalready hurting in a recession. Let's ask the people on top to start \npaying their fair share so we can see some shared sacrifice in the \nmidst of this recession.\n  Madam President, with that, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, in a few minutes the Senate will gather \nhere to vote on the continuing resolution which funds our Federal \nGovernment, in this case for 2 weeks. It is hard to believe we have \nreached that point in Washington where we are going to fund our \ngovernment 2 weeks at a time. Critics may look at us and say that \ncertainly the men and women who serve in the House and Senate ought to \nbe able to gather together, to sit down like adults, Democrats and \nRepublicans, and really plot the spending and budget for our government \nfor at least the remaining 7 months of this year. It does not seem like \nan unreasonable request. Instead, we appear to be lurching from 1 month \nto 2 weeks, and I don't know what is next.\n  What is at issue is how much money will be spent in the remainder of \nthis year and whether we will follow the House lead in a bill known as \nH.R. 1, the House budget bill, which made $100 billion in cuts for the \nremainder of this year. The Senate has already made some $41 billion in \ncuts in an effort to use these spending cuts to reduce the deficit, but \nthe House wants to move that to a higher level.\n  I just returned this past week from a visit to my State when we had a \nweek of recess and went from one end of the State to the other to \nmeasure the House budget cuts and their impact on my State of Illinois. \nWhat I found is, in community after community, many of the cuts that \nwere made by the House were not done in a thoughtful manner.\n  I was a member of the deficit commission. I acknowledge we have to \ndeal with this deficit in a timely and serious way. I was 1 of the 11 \nwho voted for the commission report, and I stand by the commission \nreport, at least in its goal to bring all of our spending on the table \nand to look at it seriously so we bring this deficit down and not \nsaddle our children and grandchildren with this obligation to pay off \nour debt. But we took a measured, thoughtful approach and engaged all \nlevels of government spending to reach our goal.\n  The House took 14 percent of the Federal budget, the so-called \ndomestic discretionary section, and made all the cuts there--all of \nthem. As a result, they went too far. Let me give an example of how \nthey went too far.\n  My last visit was to the Argonne National Laboratory outside of \nChicago. I had representatives there from the Fermilab, a national \naccelerator laboratory in the same region. The resulting cuts from the \nHouse budget will reduce the amount of money available for those two \nkey national laboratories by 20 percent. That sounds painful but not \ncrippling; yet it is because it is a cut that has to take place in 7 \nmonths.\n  In the Argonne National Laboratory, they will have to lay off one-\nthird of their scientists and support staff and cut back their research \nby 40 to 50 percent for the remainder of this year. Well, so what. What \ndifference would it make? Here is the difference. Right now, the \nArgonne National Laboratory is doing critical research and work in \nareas of innovation. Where is the fastest computer in the world today? \nGood old USA, right? No. The fastest computer in the world today is in \nChina. We have been doing research to make sure we develop the next \n``fastest computer.'' It is not just bragging rights either; it is \ndeveloping the technology that helps us develop our economy and develop \nour businesses and create jobs.\n  Part of this laboratory, the Advanced Photon Source, brings in \npharmaceutical companies from all over the United States that test \ndrugs that cure disease. They do it right there, Argonne National \nLaboratory.\n  I asked the person from Eli Lily what happens if they close down for \nthe next 6 months.\n  He said: I don't know where we will go. We may have to go overseas.\n  I said: Where?\n  Well, Europe, he said, or perhaps India or China.\n  Time and again, there is a recurring theme here. When we back off of \nan investment in America, our competitors have an advantage and an \nopportunity. That is why the House budget was so shortsighted to cut \nback in research and innovation.\n  The day before, I had gone to the Northwestern University Cancer \nResearch Center and met with 50 or 60 medical doctors and researchers \nwho said the cuts in the House budget would force them to lay off \nmedical researchers for the remainder of this year. Is there anyone \namong us who has not had a moment in life when someone sick in their \nfamily needs help? You look for the best doctor and best hospital and \nask that question we all would ask: Doctor, is there anything going on? \nIs there a drug we can turn to? Is there some experimental opportunity \nhere?\n  The clinical trials that are part of the National Institutes of \nHealth will be cut back by 20 percent during the remainder of this \nyear. The oncologist at the Southern Illinois University School of \nMedicine said: I have 100 people suffering from cancer who are gravely \nill, and unfortunately I can only put 80 of\n\n[[Page S1088]]\n\nthem in a clinical trial because of these budget cutbacks. Senator, \nwhich ones should I turn away?\n  That is why the decisions on cutting money should require more than \njust bragging rights of how much you cut. We should be thoughtful. We \nshould not cut education and training; that is tomorrow's workforce. \nThe Pell grants that are denied today stop children, young people from \nlow-income families, from going to school and getting an education and \nbeing prepared for the workforce. The cutback in innovation and \nresearch we have seen here with this House budget goes too far. The \nidea that we cannot invest in basic infrastructure for America so our \neconomy moves forward is so shortsighted.\n  Today, we are likely, by a strong bipartisan vote, to extend the \nbudget of the U.S. Government for 2 weeks. In the meantime, we have to \nsit down and be honest, honest about reducing the deficit in a \nthoughtful way that does not cripple our economy, that does not kill \nbasic research, that does not stop the job training and education we \nneed for the workforce of the 21st century because, I will tell you \nthis, if we don't think about it carefully, our competitors around the \nworld, particularly the No. 2 economy in the world today--China--will \nhave an opportunity for a toehold and an opportunity to move forward at \nthe expense of American businesses and American workers.\n  In this recession, with 15 million Americans out of work, we cannot \nafford to make the wrong decision on our budget. We have to sit down \nand make the right decision, carefully cutting waste and inefficiency--\nand there is plenty of it--but not cutting the essential services of \nour government that will build our economy and give us a chance to \nsucceed in the future.\n  Mark Zandi, who is with Moody's, has said that H.R. 1, the House \nbudget, will literally kill 700,000 jobs in America. With 15 million \nAmericans out of work, is that the best Congress can do? I don't think \nso. Let's be thoughtful about what we are going to do. Let's make sure \nwe get this economy moving forward and creating good-paying jobs for \nAmericans so we can walk into a store someday, pick up a product, flip \nit over, and smile when we read ``Made in the U.S.A.'' Wouldn't that be \na great thing to prepare for by spending our money, investing our \nresources today for the workforces and businesses of tomorrow?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/02/senate-section/article/S1088-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1088]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE CONTINUING RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, this is the fifth time this fiscal year \nthat I have urged the Senate to support a continuing resolution to keep \nthe Federal Government running. CRs are inefficient and hamstring our \nagencies and departments, especially the Department of Defense in a \ntime of war. A CR funds programs that should be terminated and does not \nfund programs that need to be initiated. There is only one advantage to \na CR--it is better than the alternative, a government shutdown.\n  The House has proposed a 2-week continuing resolution, which would \nkeep the government operating through March 18. The proposal includes \n$4 billion in cuts, many of which were recommended by the President in \nhis fiscal year 2012 budget request. Clearly, the 2-week extension in \nthis CR does not provide sufficient time to hammer out a final \nagreement. At this point, however, it would appear that the only \nalternative is a government shutdown. This is an unacceptable outcome--\nthe consequences for our economy and the American people would be \nsevere. As a result, I have come to the reluctant conclusion that we \nshould pass this extension quickly and send it to the President for his \nsignature.\n  As things stand today, I believe that we will find ourselves in the \nsame place 2 weeks from now. I am not optimistic that there will be \nsufficient time to work out a final deal that will pass the House and \nSenate prior to March 18. I hope I am wrong, but the reality is that \nthe two Houses remain far apart and the negotiations will be long and \nintense. By accepting this extension, Senate Democrats have \ndemonstrated a good faith effort to work with our House and Senate \nRepublican counterparts on a reasonable compromise that will end the \ncurrent budget stalemate. Let us hope that our colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle are willing to meet us half way as we move forward \nwith these critical negotiations in the weeks to come.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, let us be clear about where we are. The \nlegislation before us is designed to avoid a shutdown of the Federal \nGovernment. It would provide funding for a 2-week period while we \ncontinue to debate and negotiate funding levels for the rest of fiscal \nyear 2011. The price its supporters want to exact for that 2-week \nrespite is our agreement to major cuts in spending, without any attempt \nto address our deficit by closing tax loopholes.\n  I do not believe we should pay that price. Let me offer one example \nwhy. Under this continuing resolution, the Army Corps of Engineers' \ninvestigations budget--the funding for Army Corps studies of possible \nprojects--would be reduced by 35 percent, for the whole year, not just \nthis 2-week period. The Corps' construction budget would be reduced by \n17 percent. What does that mean? It means that the Army Corps of \nEngineers, which already faces a huge backlog of necessary projects, \nwould be deprived of a big chunk of the funding it needs to do its \nvital work, funding that was included in the President's budget for \n2011.\n  This legislation exacts other big cuts. It reduces funding for \nsurface transportation projects by $293 million. We will not build \nneeded roads and bridges--and we will not gain the jobs those projects \nwould create--under those cuts. We will also cut tens of millions of \ndollars from energy research projects at the very moment our Nation \nfaces the urgent task of liberating ourselves from dependence on \nforeign oil. These cuts will damage our economy today, and they will \ndamage our competitiveness tomorrow. They will do our country harm.\n  The new House Republican majority sent us those spending cuts while \ncontinuing big tax cuts for upper income taxpayers. Last year, when we \napproved the extension of those tax cuts, I opposed them. I did so \nbecause I feared that they would create such strain in the budget that \nsome would argue for massive, damaging cuts in spending levels. The \nlegislation before us is confirmation that those fears were justified. \nThe cuts it would impose would do very little to reduce our budget \ndeficit, while doing much to harm working Americans, and leave \nuntouched one large cause of deficits, the unfair and unnecessary tax \ncuts for upper bracket Americans. In fact, the price of those tax cuts \nfor upper bracket taxpayers, about $30 billion a year, far exceeds the \n$4 billion in spending cuts included in this bill. In other words, we \ncould avoid draconian spending cuts if we do not continue the Bush tax \ncuts for the roughly one in 50 U.S. households with incomes above \n$250,000 a year, households that have done very well in the last 10 \nyears while the middle class has lost ground.\n  That is not a fair approach. I cannot agree to it, and I will vote \nagainst this continuing resolution.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, yesterday, we were finally able to make \nprogress when the Senate proceeded to a vote on the managers' \namendment, the Leahy-Grassley-Kyl amendment, to the America Invents \nAct. That was a very important amendment, with contributions from many \nSenators from both sides of the aisle. It should ensure our moving \nforward to make the changes needed to unleash American innovation and \ncreate jobs without spending a single dollar of taxpayer money. In \nfact, according to the Congressional Budget Office, enactment of the \nbill will save millions of dollars.\n  I also thank those Senators who have stayed focused on our \nlegislative effort, and who joined in tabling those amendments that \nhave nothing to do with the subject of the America Invents Act. \nExtraneous amendments that have nothing to do with the important issue \nof reforming our out-of-date patent system so that American innovators \ncan win the global competition for the future have no place in this \nimportant bill. They should not be used to slow its consideration and \npassage. If America is to win the global economic competition, we need \nthe improvements in our patent system that this bill can bring.\n  I continue to believe, as I have said all week, that we can finish \nthis bill today, and show the American people that the Senate can \nfunction in a bipartisan manner. We have not been as efficient as I \nwould have liked. We have been delayed for hours at a time, and forced \ninto extended quorum calls rather than being allowed to consider \nrelevant amendments to this bill. Nonetheless, we are on the brink of \ndisposing of the final amendments and passing this important \nlegislation.\n  Today we should be able to adopt the Bennet amendment on satellite \noffices and the Kirk-Pryor amendment regarding the creation of an \nombudsman for patents relating to small businesses. I hope that we can \nadopt the Menendez amendment on expediting patents for important areas \nof economic growth, like energy and the environment, as well. I am \nprepared to agree to short time agreements for additional debate, if \nneeded, and votes on those amendments.\n  The remaining issue for the Senate to decide will be posed by an \namendment that Senator Feinstein has filed to turn back the advancement \ntoward a first-inventor-to-file system.\n  I want to take a moment to talk about an important component of the \nAmerica Invents Act, the transition of the American patent system to a \nfirst-inventor-to-file system. I said yesterday that the administration \nstrongly supports this effort. The administration's Statement of \nAdministration Policy notes that the reform to a first-inventor-to-file \nsystem ``simplifies the process of acquiring rights'' and describes it \nas an ``essential provision [to] reduce legal costs, improve fairness \nand support U.S. innovators seeking to market their products and \nservices in a global marketplace.'' I agree, and believe it should help \nsmall and independent inventors.\n  This reform has broad support from a diverse set of interests across \nthe patent community, from life science and high-tech companies to \nuniversities and independent inventors. Despite the very recent efforts \nof a vocal minority, there can be no doubt that there is wide-ranging \nsupport for a move to a first-inventor-to-file patent system. A \ntransition to first-inventor-to-file is necessary to fulfill the \npromises of higher quality patents and increased certainty that are the \ngoals of the America Invents Act.\n  This improvement is backed by broad-based groups such as the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, the American Intellectual Property Law \nAssociation, the Intellectual Property Owners Association, the American \nBar Association, the Association for Competitive Technology, the \nBusiness Software Alliance, and the Coalition for 21st Century Patent \nReform, among others. All of them agree that transitioning our outdated \npatent system to a first-inventor-to-file system is a crucial component \nto modernizing our patent system. I also commend the assistant \nRepublican leader for his remarks yesterday strongly in favor of the \nfirst-inventor-to-file provisions.\n  A transition to a first-inventor-to-file system is needed to keep \nAmerica at the pinnacle of innovation by ensuring efficiency and \ncertainty in the patent system. This transition is also necessary to \nbetter equip the Patent and Trademark Office, PTO, to work through its \ncurrent backlog of more than 700,000 unexamined patent applications \nthrough work-sharing agreements with other patent-granting offices.\n  The Director of the PTO often says that the next great invention that \nwill drive our economic growth may be sitting in its backlog of \napplications. The time consuming ``interference proceedings'' that are \ncommonplace in our current, outdated system are wasting valuable \nresources that contribute to this delay, and unfairly advantage large \ncompanies with greater resources.\n  A transition to a first-inventor-to-file system was recommended in \nthe 2004 Report by the National Academy of Sciences. The transition has \nbeen a part of this bill since its introduction four Congresses ago. \nThis legislation is the product of eight Senate hearings and three \nmarkups spanning weeks of consideration and many amendments. Until very \nrecently, first-inventor-to-file had never been the subject of even a \nsingle amendment in committee.\n\n[[Page S1090]]\n\n  Senator Feinstein has worked with me on this bill, has cosponsored it \nin the past and has voted for it.\n  I urge Senators who support the goals of the America Invents Act to \nvote against this amendment to strike the bill's important reform \nrepresented by the first-inventor-to-file provision. Every \nindustrialized nation other than the United States uses a patent \npriority system commonly referred to as a ``first-to-file'' system. In \na first-inventor-to-file system, the priority of a right to a patent is \nbased on the earlier filed application. This adds simplicity and \nobjectivity into a very complex system. By contrast, our current, \noutdated method for determining the priority right to a patent is \nextraordinarily complex, subjective, time-intensive, and expensive. The \nold system almost always favors the larger corporation and the deep \npockets over the small, independent inventor.\n  The transition to a first-inventor-to-file system will benefit the \npatent community in several ways. It will simplify the patent \napplication system and provide increased certainty to businesses that \nthey can commercialize a patent that has been granted. Once a patent is \ngranted, an inventor can rely on its filing date on the face of the \npatent. This certainty is necessary to raise capital, grow businesses, \nand create jobs.\n  The first-inventor-to-file system will also reduce costs to patent \napplicants and the Patent Office. This, too, should help the small, \nindependent inventor. In the outdated, current system, when more than \none application claiming the same invention is filed, the priority of a \nright to a patent is decided through an ``interference'' proceeding to \ndetermine which applicant can be declared to have invented the claimed \ninvention first. This process is lengthy, complex, and can cost \nhundreds of thousands of dollars. Small inventors rarely, if ever, win \ninterference proceedings. In a first-inventor-to-file system, however, \nthe filing date of the application is objective and easy to determine, \nresulting in a streamlined and less costly process.\n  Importantly, a first-inventor-to-file system will increase the global \ncompetitiveness of American companies and American inventors. As \nbusiness and competition are increasingly global in scope, inventors \nmust frequently file patent applications in both the United States and \nother countries for protection of their inventions. Since America's \ncurrent, outdated system differs from the first-inventor-to-file system \nused in other patent-issuing jurisdictions, it causes confusion and \ninefficiencies for American companies and innovators. Harmonization \nwill benefit American inventors.\n  Finally, the first-inventor-to-file provisions that are included in \nthe America Invents Act were drafted with careful attention to needs of \nuniversities and small inventors. That is why the bill includes a 1-\nyear grace period to ensure that an inventor's own publication or \ndisclosure cannot be used against him as prior art, but will act as \nprior art against another patent application. This will encourage early \ndisclosure of new inventions, regardless of whether the inventor ends \nup trying to patent the invention.\n  For these reasons among others, the transition is supported by the \noverwhelming majority of the patent community and American industry, as \nwell as the administration and the experts at the Patent and Trademark \nOffice.\n  This past weekend, the Washington Post editorial board endorsed the \ntransition, calling the first-inventor-to-file standard a ``bright \nline,'' and stating that it would bring ``certainty to the process.'' \nThe editorial also recognizes the ``protections for academics who share \ntheir ideas with outside colleagues or preview them in public \nseminars'' that are included in the bill.\n  The Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council has expressed its \nstrong support for the first-inventor-to-file system, writing that \n``small firms will in no way be disadvantaged, while opportunities in \nthe international markets will expand.''\n  The Intellectual Property Owners Association calls the first-\ninventor-to-file system ``central to modernization and simplification \nof patent law'' and ``very widely supported by U.S. companies.''\n  Independent inventor Louis Foreman has said the first-inventor-to-\nfile transition will help ``independent inventors across the country by \nstrengthening the current system for entrepreneurs and small \nbusinesses.''\n  And, in urging the transition to the first-to-file system, the \nAssociation for Competitive Technology, which represents small and mid-\nsize IT firms, has said the current first-to-invent system ``negatively \nimpacts entrepreneurs'' and puts American inventors ``at a disadvantage \nwith competitors abroad who can implement first inventor to file \nstandards.''\n  If we are to maintain our position at the forefront of the world's \neconomy, if we are to continue to lead the globe in innovation and \nproduction, if we are to win the future through American ingenuity and \ninnovation, then we must have a patent system that is streamlined and \nefficient. The America Invents Act, and a transition to a first-\ninventor-to-file system in particular, are crucial to fulfilling this \npromise.\n  Madam President, in summary, as I said, yesterday we were finally \nable to make progress when the Senate proceeded to a vote on the \nmanagers' amendment, the Leahy-Grassley-Kyl amendment, to the America \nInvents Act. It was a very important amendment, with contributions from \nmany Senators from both sides of the aisle.\n  I think it was a little bit frustrating for the public to watch. They \nsaw us several hours in quorum calls and then having an amendment that \npassed 97 to 2. I would hope we might, in doing the Nation's business, \nmove with a little bit more speed. But I do thank those Senators who \nsupported it.\n  The Leahy-Grassley-Kyl amendment should ensure our moving forward to \nmake the changes needed to unleash American innovation and create jobs \nwithout spending a single dollar of taxpayer money. In fact, according \nto the Congressional Budget Office, enactment of the bill will save \nmillions of dollars. These are not bumper slogan ideas of saving money. \nThese are actually doing the hard work necessary to save money.\n  I thank those Senators who have stayed focused on our legislative \neffort and who joined in tabling nongermane amendments that had nothing \nto do with the subject of the America Invents Act.\n  Extraneous amendments that have nothing to do with the important \nissue of reforming our out-of-date patent system so American innovators \ncan win the global competition for the future have no place in this \nimportant bill.\n  We are at a time when China and Europe and the rest of Asia are \nmoving ahead of us. We need the tools to keep up. We should not waste \ntime with a lot of sloganeering amendments that would stop the bill. \nWhat we ought to focus on is making America good and making sure we can \ncompete with the rest of the world. We should not have amendments used \nto slow this bill's consideration and passage. If America is going to \nwin the global economic competition, we need the improvements in our \npatent system this bill can bring.\n  I continue to believe, as I have said all week, we can finish the \nbill--we actually could have finished it yesterday, when you consider \nall the time wasted in quorum calls--but I believe we can finish it \ntoday and show the American people the Senate can function in a \nbipartisan manner.\n  We have not been as efficient as I would have liked. We have been \ndelayed for hours at a time and forced into extended quorum calls \nrather than being allowed to consider relevant amendments to the bill. \nBut we are on the brink of disposing of the final amendments and \npassing this important legislation.\n  We should be able to adopt the Bennet amendment on satellite offices \neither by a voice vote or a rollcall, I would hope in the next few \nminutes, and the Kirk-Pryor amendment regarding the creation of an \nombudsman for patents relating to small businesses.\n  I hope we can adopt the Menendez amendment on expediting patents for \nimportant areas of economic growth, such as energy and the environment, \nas well. I am prepared to agree to very short time agreements for \nadditional debate, if needed. If a rollcall is called for, I am happy \nto have those.\n  The remaining issue for the Senate to decide will be posed by an \namendment Senator Feinstein filed to turn back the advancement toward a \nfirst-inventor-to-file system.\n  I wish to take a moment to talk about an important component of the\n\n[[Page S1091]]\n\nAmerica Invents Act, the transition of the American patent system to a \nfirst-inventor-to-file system. This is strongly supported by the \nadministration and by the managers of this package. The \nadministration's Statement of Administration Policy notes that the \nreform to a first-inventor-to-file system ``simplifies the process of \nacquiring rights,'' and it describes it as an ``essential provision \n[to] reduce legal costs, improve fairness and support U.S. innovators \nseeking to market their products and services in a global \nmarketplace.'' I agree. I also believe it should help small and \nindependent inventors.\n  This reform has broad support from a diverse set of interests across \nthe patent community, from life science and high-tech companies to \nuniversities and independent inventors. Despite the very recent \nefforts--and they were very recent efforts; after all, we have been \nworking on this bill for years--of a vocal minority, there can be no \ndoubt that there is wide-ranging support for a move to a first-\ninventor-to-file patent system.\n  A transition to first-inventor-to-file system is necessary to fulfill \nthe promises of higher quality patents and increased certainty that are \nthe goals of the America Invents Act. This improvement is backed by \nbroad-based groups such as the National Association of Manufacturers, \nthe American Intellectual Property Law Association, the Intellectual \nProperty Owners Association, the American Bar Association, the \nAssociation for Competitive Technology, the Business Software Alliance, \nand the Coalition for 21st Century Patent Reform, among others. All of \nthem agree that transitioning our outdated patent system to a first-\ninventor-to-file system is a crucial component to modernizing our \npatent system.\n  I commend the assistant Republican leader for his remarks yesterday \nstrongly in favor of the first-inventor-to-file provisions. It actually \nallows us to put America at the pinnacle of innovation by ensuring \nefficiency and certainty in the patent system.\n  This transition is also necessary to better equip the Patent and \nTrademark Office to work through its current backlog. That backlog has \nmore than 700,000 unexamined patent applications.\n  A transition to a first-inventor-to-file system will benefit the \npatent community in several ways. It will simplify the patent \napplication system and provide increased certainty to businesses that \nthey can commercialize a patent that has been granted.\n  The first-inventor-to-file system will also reduce costs to patent \napplicants and the Patent Office. Importantly, a first-inventor-to-file \nsystem will increase the global competitiveness of American companies \nand American inventors. Also, the first-inventor-to-file provisions \nthat are included in the America Invents Act were drafted with careful \nattention to needs of universities and small inventors. For these \nreasons, among others, this transition is supported by the overwhelming \nmajority of the patent community and American industry, as well as the \nadministration and experts at the Patent and Trademark Office.\n  At this time I wish to have printed in the Record a few letters of \nsupport for the transition to first-to-file.\n  The Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council says that ``by moving \nto a first-inventor-to-file system, small firms will in no way be \ndisadvantaged, while opportunities in international markets will \nexpand.''\n  The Intellectual Property Owners Association says the transition to \nfirst-inventor-to-file ``is central to modernization and simplification \nof patent law and is very widely supported by U.S. companies.''\n  BASF says the first-to-file system will ``enhance the patent system \nin ways that would benefit all sectors of the U.S. economy.''\n  And the American Bar Association refutes claims that the first-to-\nfile system would disadvantage small and independent inventors, saying \nthat the legislation ``makes it clear that the award goes to the first \ninventor to file and not merely to the first person to file.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that copies of these letters be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    Small Business\n\n\n                                   & Entrepreneurship Council,\n\n                                    Oakton, VA, February 28, 2011.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Bldg.,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: The Small Business & Entrepreneurship \n     Council (SBE Council) and its members across the nation have \n     been strong advocates for patent reform. We are pleased that \n     you have introduced the Patent Reform Act (S. 23), and we \n     strongly endorse this important piece of legislation.\n       An effective and efficient patent system is critical to \n     small business and our overall economy. After all, the U.S. \n     leads the globe in entrepreneurship, and innovation and \n     invention are central to our entrepreneurial successes. \n     Indeed, intellectual property--most certainly including \n     patents--is a key driver to U.S. economic growth. Patent \n     reform is needed to clarify and simplify the system; to \n     properly protect legitimate patents; and to reduce costs in \n     the system, including when it comes to litigation and the \n     international marketplace.\n       Make no mistake, this is especially important for small \n     businesses. As the Congressional Research Service has \n     reported: ``Several studies commissioned by U.S. federal \n     agencies have concluded that individuals and small entities \n     constitute a significant source of innovative products and \n     services. Studies have also indicated that entrepreneurs and \n     small, innovative firms rely more heavily upon the patent \n     system than larger enterprises.''\n       The Patent Reform Act works to improve the patent system in \n     key ways, including, for example, by lowering fees for micro-\n     entities, and by shortening time periods for patent reviews \n     by making the system more predictable.\n       During the debate over this legislation, it is expected \n     that two important areas of reform will come under attack.\n       First, the U.S. patent system is out of step with the rest \n     of the world. The U.S. grants patents on a first-to-invent \n     basis, rather than the first-inventor-to-file system that the \n     rest of the world follows. First-to-invent is inherently \n     ambiguous and costly, and that's bad news for small \n     businesses and individual inventors.\n       In a 2004 report from the National Research Council of the \n     National Academies (titled ``A Patent System for the 21st \n     Century''), it was pointed out: ``For those subject to \n     challenge under first-to-invent, the proceeding is costly and \n     often very protracted; frequently it moves from a USPTO \n     administrative proceeding to full court litigation. In both \n     venues it is not only evidence of who first reduced the \n     invention to practice that is at issue but also questions of \n     proof of conception, diligence, abandonment, suppression, and \n     concealment, some of them requiring inquiry into what an \n     inventor thought and when the inventor thought it.'' The \n     costs of this entire process fall more heavily on small \n     businesses and individual inventors.\n       As for the international marketplace, patent harmonization \n     among nations will make it easier, including less costly, for \n     small firms and inventors to gain patent protection in other \n     nations, which is critical to being able to compete \n     internationally. By moving to a first-inventor-to-file \n     system, small firms will in no way be disadvantaged, while \n     opportunities in international markets will expand.\n       Second, as for improving the performance of the USPTO, it \n     is critical that reform protect the office against being a \n     ``profit center'' for the federal budget. That is, the USPTO \n     fees should not be raided to aid Congress in spending more \n     taxpayer dollars or to subsidize nonrelated programs. \n     Instead, those fees should be used to make for a quicker, \n     more predictable patent process.\n       Thank you for your leadership Senator Leahy. Please feel \n     free to contact SBE Council if we can be of assistance on \n     this important issue for small businesses.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Karen Kerrigan,\n     President & CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             Intellectual Property\n\n\n                                           Owners Association,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 25, 2011.\n     Re Amendments to S. 23, the ``Patent Reform Act of 2011.''\n\n     Honorable __,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     __ Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator __: Intellectual Property Owners Association \n     (IPO) is pleased that the Senate is planning to proceed with \n     consideration of S. 23, the ``Patent Reform Act of 2011.''\n       IPO is one of the largest and most diverse trade \n     associations devoted to intellectual property rights. Our 200 \n     corporate members cover a broad spectrum of U.S. companies in \n     industries ranging from information technology to consumer \n     products to pharmaceuticals and biotechnology.\n       We wish to give you our advice on amendments that we \n     understand might be offered during consideration of S. 23:\n       Vote AGAINST any amendment to delete the ``first-inventor-\n     to-file'' and related provisions in section 2 of the bill. \n     First-inventor-to-file, explained in a 1-page attachment to \n     this letter, is central to modernization and simplification \n     of patent law and is very widely supported by U.S. companies.\n       Vote FOR any amendment guaranteeing the U.S. Patent and \n     Trademark Office access\n\n[[Page S1092]]\n\n     to all user fees paid to the agency by patent and trademark \n     owners and applicants. Current delays in processing patent \n     applications are totally unacceptable and the result of an \n     underfunded Patent and Trademark Office.\n       Vote AGAINST any amendment that would interpose substantial \n     barriers to enforcement of validly-granted ``business \n     method'' patents. IPO supports business method patents that \n     were upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in the recent Bilski \n     decision.\n       For more information, please call IPO at 202-507-4500.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Douglas K. Norman,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n   First-Inventor-to-File in S. 23, the ``Patent Reform Act of 2011''\n\n       Section 2 of S. 23 simplifies and modernizes U.S. patent \n     law by awarding the patent to the first of two competing \n     inventors to file in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office \n     (PTO), a change from the traditional system of awarding the \n     patent, in theory, to the first inventor to invent. First-\n     inventor-to-file in S. 23 has these advantages:\n\n       Eliminates costly and slow patent interferences proceedings \n     conducted in the PTO and the courts to determine which \n     inventor was the first to invent.\n       Creates legal certainty about rights in all patents, the \n     vast majority of which never become entangled in interference \n     proceedings in the first place, but which are still subject \n     to the possibility under current law that another inventor \n     might come forward and seek to invalidate the patent on the \n     ground that this other inventor, who never applied for a \n     patent, was the first to invent.\n       Encourages both large and small patent applicants to file \n     more quickly in order to establish an early filing date. \n     Early filing leads to early disclosure of technology to the \n     public, enabling other parties to build on and improve the \n     technology. (Applicants who plan to file afterward in other \n     countries already have the incentive to file quickly in the \n     U.S.)\n       Makes feasible the introduction of post-grant opposition \n     proceedings to improve the quality of patents, by reducing \n     the issues that could be raised in a post-grant proceeding, \n     thereby limiting costs and delay.\n       Follows up on changes already made by Congress that (1) \n     established inexpensive and easy-to-file provisional patent \n     applications and, (2) in order to comply with treaty \n     obligations, allowed foreign inventors to participate in U.S. \n     patent interference proceedings.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                         BASF,\n\n                              Florham Park, NJ, February 28, 2011.\n     Hon. Frank Lautenberg,\n     Hon. Bob Menendez,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Lautenberg and Menendez: On behalf of BASF's \n     North American headquarters located in Florham Park, New \n     Jersey, I am writing to urge your support for S. 23, the \n     Patent Reform Act of 2011.\n       At BASF, We Create Chemistry, and we pride ourselves on \n     creating technological advances through innovation. We \n     recognize that America's patent system is crucial to \n     furthering this innovation and that the system is in need of \n     modernization and reform. The United States desperately needs \n     to enhance the efficiency, objectivity, predictability, and \n     transparency of its patent system.\n       BASF likes S. 23 because we feel it will preserve the \n     incentives necessary to sustain America's global innovation \n     and spur the creation of high-wage, high-value jobs in our \n     nation's economy. In particular, the shift to a ``first to \n     file'' system, an appropriate role for the court in \n     establishing patent damages, and improved mechanisms for \n     challenging granted patents enhance the patent system in ways \n     that would benefit all sectors of the U.S. economy.\n       I want to stress that BASF supports S. 23 in the form \n     recently passed out of the Senate Judiciary Committee via a \n     bipartisan 15-0 vote. This bill represents a great deal of \n     work and hard fought consensus. We ask that you reject \n     amendments on the floor that would substantively alter the \n     bill, including one that would reportedly strike the ``first \n     to file'' provision.\n       Please note, however, that BASF does support a planned \n     amendment that would end the practice of diverting funds from \n     the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to other agencies. This \n     amendment is necessary, since the USPTO is funded entirely by \n     user fees and does not get any taxpayer money.\n       Our patent system has helped foster U.S. innovation and \n     protect the intellectual property rights of inventors for \n     more than 200 years, and it can continue to do so if it is \n     updated to make sure it meets the challenges facing today's \n     innovators, investors, and manufacturers. I urge you to work \n     with your colleagues in the Senate to pass S. 23 without \n     substantive amendment to the patent provisions and with \n     language that would prevent diversion of USPTO funds.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           Steven J. Goldberg,\n\n                                                   Vice President,\n     Regulatory Law & Government Affairs\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     American Bar Association,\n\n                                   Chicago, IL, February 28, 2011.\n       Dear Senator: This week the Senate will be considering S. \n     23, the ``Patent Reform Act of 2011.'' I am writing to \n     express the support of the Section of Intellectual Property \n     Law of the American Bar Association for Senate approval of S. \n     23, and our opposition to any amendment that may be offered \n     to strike the ``first-inventor-to-file'' provisions of the \n     bill. These views have not been considered by the American \n     Bar Association's House of Delegates or Board of Governors \n     and should not be considered to be views of the American Bar \n     Association.\n       S. 23 is a bi-partisan product of six years of study and \n     development within the Judiciary Committee. By necessity, it \n     contains a number of provisions that are the result of \n     negotiation and compromise and it is unlikely that all of the \n     Judiciary Committee co-sponsors favor each and every \n     provision. We too would have addressed some issues \n     differently. However, the perfect should not be the enemy of \n     the good and we believe that this is a good bill. S. 23 and \n     S. 515, its close predecessor in the 111th Congress, are the \n     only bills that we have endorsed in the six years that we \n     have been following this legislation. The enactment of S. 23 \n     would substantially improve the patent system of the United \n     States and we support that enactment.\n       At the same time, we want to express our strong opposition \n     to an amendment that may be offered to strike the provisions \n     of S. 23 that would switch the U.S. patent system to one that \n     awards a patent to the first inventor who discloses his \n     invention and applies for a patent (``first-inventor-to-\n     file''), rather than awarding a patent based on winning the \n     contest to show the earliest date of conception or reduction \n     to practice of the invention (``first-to-invent'').\n       The United States is alone in the world in retaining the \n     first-to-invent system. While a first-inventor-to-file system \n     encourages inventors to file for a patent and disclose their \n     inventions at an early date, the first-to-invent standard \n     increases opportunity for competing claims to the same \n     invention, and facilitates protracted legal battles in \n     administrative and court proceedings, which are extremely \n     costly, in both time and money.\n       Some have long thought that small and independent inventors \n     would be disadvantaged in a first-inventor-to-file \n     environment and that competitors with more resources might \n     learn of their inventions and get to the U.S. Patent Office \n     first with an application. This current legislation, however, \n     makes it clear that the award goes to the first inventor to \n     file and not merely to the first person to file.\n       Equally important, recent studies show that, under the \n     present U.S. patent system, small and independent inventors \n     who are second to file but who attempt in the U.S. Patent \n     Office and court proceedings to establish that they were the \n     first to invent, actually lose more patents than they would \n     obtain had the United States simply awarded patents to the \n     first inventor to file.\n       Moreover, since 1996, an inventor based in the United \n     States faces a much more difficult task of ever obtaining a \n     patent. For inventions made after 1996, the U.S. patent \n     system has been open to proofs of inventions made outside the \n     United States--creating for many U.S.-based inventors a new \n     and potentially even more expensive obstacle to obtaining a \n     patent under the current first-to-invent rule.\n       Finally, U.S. inventors more and more are facing the need \n     to file patent applications both at home and abroad to remain \n     competitive in our global economy. Requiring compliance with \n     two fundamentally different systems places undue additional \n     burdens on our U.S. inventors and puts them at a competitive \n     disadvantage in this global economy.\n       We urge you to support enactment of S. 23 and to oppose any \n     amendment to strike the ``first-inventor-to-file'' \n     provisions.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Marylee Jenkins,\n\n                                                      Chairperson,\n                             Section of Intellectual Property Law.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, we are now ready to go forward on the \nBennet and Kirk-Pryor amendments. I am prepared to call them up for a \nvote in the next few minutes if we could get somebody on the floor.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 117, as Modified\n\n  I understand there is a modification at the desk of Bennet amendment \nNo. 117.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the amendment is \nso modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 104, between lines 22 and 23, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 18. SATELLITE OFFICES.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--Subject to available resources, the \n     Director may establish 3 or more satellite offices in the \n     United States to carry out the responsibilities of the Patent \n     and Trademark Office.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of the satellite offices \n     established under subsection (a) are to--\n       (1) increase outreach activities to better connect patent \n     filers and innovators with the Patent and Trademark Office;\n       (2) enhance patent examiner retention;\n       (3) improve recruitment of patent examiners; and\n       (4) decrease the number of patent applications waiting for \n     examination and improve the quality of patent examination.\n       (c) Required Considerations.--In selecting the locale of \n     each satellite office to be\n\n[[Page S1093]]\n\n     established under subsection (a), the Director--\n       (1) shall ensure geographic diversity among the offices, \n     including by ensuring that such offices are established in \n     different States and regions throughout the Nation; and\n       (2) may rely upon any previous evaluations by the Patent \n     and Trademark Office of potential locales for satellite \n     offices, including any evaluations prepared as part of the \n     Patent and Trademark Office's Nationwide Workforce Program \n     that resulted in the 2010 selection of Detroit, Michigan as \n     the first ever satellite office of the Patent and Trademark \n     Office.\n       (3) Nothing in the preceding paragraph shall constrain the \n     Patent and Trademark Office to only consider its prior work \n     from 2010. The process for site selection shall be open.\n       (d) Phase-in.--The Director shall satisfy the requirements \n     of subsection (a) over the 3-year period beginning on the \n     date of enactment of this Act.\n       (e) Report to Congress.--Not later than the end of the \n     first fiscal year that occurs after the date of the enactment \n     of this Act, and each fiscal year thereafter, the Director \n     shall submit a report to Congress on--\n       (1) the rationale of the Director in selecting the locale \n     of any satellite office required under subsection (a);\n       (2) the progress of the Director in establishing all such \n     satellite offices; and\n       (3) whether the operation of existing satellite offices is \n     achieving the purposes required under subsection (b).\n       (f) Definitions.--In this section, the following \n     definitions shall apply:\n       (1) Director.--The term ``Director'' means the Director of \n     the United States Patent and Trademark Office.\n       (2) Patent and trademark office.--The term ``Patent and \n     Trademark Office'' means the United States Patent and \n     Trademark Office.\n       On page 104, line 23, strike ``SEC. 18.'' and insert ``SEC. \n     19.''.\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 117, as Modified, and 123\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nresume consideration of Bennet amendment No. 117, as modified, with the \nchanges at the desk and Kirk amendment No. 123 en bloc; further, that \nthe amendments be agreed to en bloc and the motions to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, reserving the right to object, and I \nwill not object, I wish to say as manager of my side of the aisle that \nwe support this. We think both of these amendments are good amendments \nand that we ought to move forward. I appreciate very much the majority \nworking with us to accomplish this goal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments, Nos. 117, as modified, and 123, were agreed to en \nbloc.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am ready to go to third reading unless \nthere are others who are otherwise tied up who knows where, but I wish \nthey would take the time to drop by if they have amendments. Senator \nGrassley and I spent hours on the floor yesterday just waiting for \npeople to bring up amendments. We went through a number of quorum \ncalls. We are talking about something that is going to be a tremendous \nboost to businesses and inventors. Those who are watching are wondering \nprobably why we have spent years getting this far. So much time is \nbeing wasted.\n  I just want everybody to know the two of us are ready to vote. \nYesterday we took hours of delay to vote on the Leahy-Grassley, et al. \namendment, and then it passed 97 to 2.\n  So I would urge Senators who have amendments to come to the floor. As \nthe gospel says, ``Many are called, but few are chosen.'' It may be the \nsame thing on some of the amendments, but ultimately we will conclude. \nBefore my voice is totally gone, unless the Senator from Iowa has \nsomething to say, I yield to the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, supporting what the chairman has just \nsaid, outside of the fact that there might be one or two controversial \nnongermane amendments to this legislation, we have to look at the \nunderlying product. The underlying product is very bipartisan. Most \neconomic interests within our country are supporting this patent reform \nlegislation. Everybody agrees it is something that probably should have \nbeen passed a Congress ago.\n  I join my Democratic manager and the chairman of the committee in \nurging Senators on my side of the aisle who have either germane \namendments or nongermane amendments to come to the floor and offer them \nso the underlying piece of legislation can be passed and sent on to the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I also wish to associate myself with the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Iowa. He has worked very hard to help \nus get to the floor. Considering the enormous amount of time that has \nbeen spent by both sides of the aisle on this bill, the amount of time \nthat has been spent working out problems, I wish we could complete it. \nI understand there are a couple Senators who may have amendments. I am \nnot sure where they are, but I am sure they will show up at some point. \nIn the meantime, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). Without objection, \nit is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 133\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 133, and I ask \nunanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein], for herself, \n     Mr. Risch, Mr. Reid, Mr. Crapo, Mrs. Boxer, and Mr. Ensign, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 133.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 2, line 1, strike ``FIRST INVENTOR TO FILE.'' and \n     insert ``FALSE MARKING.''\n       On page 2, strike line 2 and all that follows through page \n     16, line 4.\n       On page 16, line 5, strike ``(1) In general.--'' and insert \n     ``(a) In General.--'' and move 2 ems to the left.\n       On page 16, line 7, strike ``(A)'' and insert ``(1)'' and \n     move 2 ems to the left.\n       On page 16, line 11, strike ``(B)'' and insert ``(2)'' and \n     move 2 ems to the left.\n       On page 16, line 18, strike ``(2) Effective date.--'' and \n     insert ``(b) Effective Date.--'' and move 2 ems to the left.\n       On page 16, line 19, strike ``subsection'' and insert \n     ``section''.\n       On page 16, strike line 22 and all that follows through \n     page 23, line 2.\n       On page 23, strike line 3 and all that follows through page \n     31, line 15, and renumber sections accordingly.\n       On page 64, strike line 18 and all that follows through \n     page 65, line 17.\n       On page 69, line 10, strike ``derivation'' and insert \n     ``interference''.\n       On page 69, line 14, strike ``derivation'' and insert \n     ``interference''.\n       On page 71, line 9, strike ``Derivation'' and insert \n     ``Interference''.\n       On page 71, lines 9 and 10, strike ``derivation'' and \n     insert ``interference''.\n       On page 71, line 14, strike ``derivation'' and insert \n     ``interference''.\n       On page 72, line 3, strike ``derivation'' and insert \n     ``interference''.\n       On page 72, line 8, strike ``derivation'' and insert \n     ``interference''.\n       On page 73, line 1, strike ``derivation'' and insert \n     ``interference''.\n       On page 73, between lines 5 and 6, insert the following:\n       (d) Conforming Amendments.--Sections 41, 134, 145, 146, \n     154, 305, and 314 of title 35, United States Code, are each \n     amended by striking ``Board of Patent Appeals and \n     Interferences'' each place that term appears and inserting \n     ``Patent Trial and Appeal Board''.\n       On page 73, line 6, strike ``(d)'' and insert ``(e)''.\n       On page 93, strike lines 6 through 8, and insert the \n     following: by inserting ``(other than the requirement to \n     disclose the best mode)'' after ``section 112 of this \n     title''.\n       On page 98, strike lines 20 and 21, and insert the \n     following:\n\n     ``SEC. 17.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much.\n  I rise today to offer an amendment to strike the first-to-file \nprovisions of this bill. I am joined in this effort by my cosponsors, \nSenator Risch, Majority Leader Reid, and Senators Crapo\n\n[[Page S1094]]\n\nand Boxer. I also ask unanimous consent that Senator Ensign be added as \na cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I know the bill has contained these provisions for \nsome time now, and I acknowledge I have voted for different versions of \nit that contain these provisions. However, I have heard more and more \nin the past 2 years from small inventors, startup companies, small \nbusinesses, venture capitalists, and, yes, even large companies from \nall around our country, but especially in my State of California, that \nthis proposed transition from our first-to-invent system to a first-to-\nfile system would be severely harmful to innovation, and especially \nburdensome on small inventors, startups, and small businesses. And I \nhave become convinced it is the wrong thing to do.\n  For the benefit of my colleagues who have not been so embroiled in \nthis rather technical issue, let me provide a little background. For \nover a century, our country has awarded patents to the first inventor \nto come up with an idea, even if somebody else beat them to the Patent \nOffice--a first-to-invent system. And we have done very well under the \nfirst-to-invent system. This bill would change that, so that the first \nperson to file an application for a patent for a particular invention \nwould be entitled to that patent, even if another person actually \ncreated the invention first. This is what is known as the first-to-file \nsystem.\n  Now, the argument that is made for transitioning to first-to-file is \nthat the rest of the world follows first-to-file, and that will \nharmonize our system with theirs. This is supported by big companies \nthat have already made it, that have an international presence. \nTherefore, I understand their support for first-to-file. But under \nfirst-to-invent, we have been the world's leader in innovation, and the \nfirst-to-file countries have been playing catchup with our \ntechnological advances. So with all due respect, I wouldn't trade \nAmerica's record of innovation for that of virtually any other country \nor certainly any first-to-file country.\n  The genius of America is inventions in small garages and labs, in \ngreat ideas that come from inspiration and perspiration in such \nsettings and then take off. So many of America's leading companies--\nHewlett Packard, Apple, Google, even AT arising from Alexander Graham \nBell's lab, for example--started in such settings and grew \nspectacularly, creating jobs for millions of Americans and lifting our \neconomy and standard of living.\n  A coalition of affected small business groups, including the National \nSmall Business Association and others, recently said first-to-file \n``disrupts the unique American start-up ecosystem that has led to \nAmerica's standing as the global innovation leader . . .''\n  I believe it is critical that we continue to protect and nurture this \nculture of innovation, and preserving the first-to-invent system that \nhas helped foster it is essential to do this.\n  Moreover, this bill would not actually harmonize our patent priority \nsystem with that of the rest of the world. Many first-to-file countries \nallow more extensive use of prior art to defeat a patent application \nand provide for greater prior user rights than this bill would provide. \nEurope does not provide even the limited 1-year publication grace \nperiod this bill does.\n  An important part of this debate is the change the bill makes to the \nso-called grace period that inventors have under U.S. current law. \nPresently, a person's right to their invention is also protected for 1 \nyear from any of the following: No. 1, describing their invention in a \nprinted publication; No. 2, making a public use of the invention; or, \nNo. 3, offering the invention for sale. This is called the grace \nperiod, and it is critical to small inventors.\n  Mr. President, 108 startups and small businesses wrote last year \nthat:\n\n       U.S. patent law has long allowed inventors a 1-year ``grace \n     period,'' so that they can develop, vet, and perfect their \n     invention, begin commercialization, advance sales, seek \n     inventors and business partners, and obtain sufficient funds \n     to prosecute the patent application. During the grace period, \n     many inventors learn about starting a technology-based \n     business for the first time. They must obtain investment \n     capital and must learn from outside patent counsel (at \n     considerable expense) about patenting and related deadlines \n     and how to set up confidentiality agreements. Many startups \n     or small businesses are in a race against insolvency during \n     this early stage. The grace period protects them during this \n     period from loss of patent rights due to any activities, \n     information leaks or inadvertent unprotected disclosures \n     prior to filing their patent applications.\n\n  S. 23 eliminates this grace period from offering an invention for \nsale or making a public use of it, leaving only a grace period from \n``disclosure'' of the invention.\n  There are two problems with this. First, ``disclosure'' is not \ndefined in the bill. This will generate litigation while the courts \nflesh out that term's meaning. While this plays out in the courts, \nthere will be uncertainty about whether many inventions are patentable. \nThis uncertainty will, in turn, chill investment, as venture \ncapitalists will be reluctant to invest until they are confident that \nthe inventor will be able to patent and own their invention.\n  Secondly, because of this lack of definition, some patent lawyers \ninterpret ``disclosure'' to mean a disclosure that is sufficiently \ndetailed to enable a person of ordinary skill in the particular art to \nmake the invented item. In practical terms, this means a patent \napplication or a printed publication.\n  Now, this does provide some protection to universities, it is true. \nThey often publish about their inventions. However, it is scant \nprotection for the small inventor. They don't publish about their \ninventions, until they file a patent application. As the 108 small \nbusinesses put it, ``no business willingly publishes complete technical \ndisclosures that will tip-off all competitors to a company's \ntechnological direction. . . . Confidentiality is crucial to small \ncompanies.''\n  The grace period from offering for sale or public use is critical for \ntheir protection; eliminating it will have the effect, in the words of \nthese small businesses, of ``practically gutting the American 1-year \ngrace period.'' The National Small Business Association wrote recently:\n\n       The American first-to-invent grace period patent system has \n     been a major mechanism for the dynamism of small business \n     innovation. . . . It is clear that the weak or (entirely \n     absent) [sic] grace periods used in the rest of the world's \n     first-to-file patent system throttles small-business \n     innovation and job creation.\n\n  Our amendment would preserve America's world-leading system.\n  I am also very concerned that first-to-file would proportionately \ndisadvantage small companies and startups with limited resources. I \nhave become convinced that this change would impede innovation and \neconomic growth in our country, particularly harming the small, early-\nstage businesses that generate job growth.\n  Obviously, the process of innovation starts with the generation of \nideas. Small California companies and inventors have described to me \nhow most of these ideas ultimately do not pan out; either testing or \ndevelopment proves they are not feasible technologically, or they prove \nnot to be viable economically.\n  Unfortunately, first-to-file incentivizes inventors to ``race to the \nPatent Office,'' to protect as many of their ideas as soon as possible \nso they are not beaten to the punch by a rival. Thus, first-to-file \nwill likely result in significant overfiling of these ``dead end'' \ninventions, unnecessarily burdening both the Patent and Trademark \nOffice and inventors. As Paul Michel, former chief judge of the Court \nof Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and Gregory Junemann, president of \nthe International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, \nput it in a recent letter to the committee:\n\n       As Canada recently experienced, a shift to a first-to-file \n     system can stimulate mass filing of premature applications as \n     inventors rush to beat the effective date of the shift or \n     later, filings by competitors.\n\n  This presents a particular hardship for independent inventors, for \nstartups, and for small businesses, which do not have the resources and \nvolume to employ in-house counsel but must instead rely on more-costly \noutside counsel to file their patents. This added cost and time \ndirected to filing for ideas that are not productive will drain \nresources away from the viable ideas that can build a patent \nportfolio--and a business.\n  At a time when the Patent and Trademark Office has a dramatic backlog \nof over 700,000 patents waiting to be examined and a pendency time of \nsome 3 years, Congress should be careful to\n\n[[Page S1095]]\n\nensure that any legislative changes will not increase patent filings \nthat are unfruitful.\n  The counter-argument is made that a small inventor could file a cheap \n``provisional patent application,'' and that is sufficient protection. \nHowever, patent lawyers who work with small clients have said that they \nadvise their clients not to treat a provisional application any less \nseriously than a full patent application. If there is part of an \ninvention that is left out of the provisional application, that will \nnot be protected. And the parts that are included in the provisional \napplication will be vulnerable too, under an attack that the inventor \nfailed to disclose the ``best mode'' of the invention by leaving out \nnecessary information.\n  The argument is made that first to file will establish a simple, \nclear priority of competing patent applications. Proponents of first to \nfile argue that it will eliminate costly, burdensome proceedings to \ndetermine who actually was the first to invent, which are known as \n``interference proceedings.''\n  However, the reality is that this is not a significant problem under \nour current system. There are only about 50 ``interference \nproceedings'' a year to resolve who made an invention first. This is \nout of about 480,000 patent applications that are submitted each year--\nin other words, one-one hundredth of 1 percent of patent applications.\n  Another problem with the bill's first to file system is the \ndifficulty of proving that someone copied your invention.\n  The bill's proponents assert that it protects against one person \ncopying another person's invention by allowing the first inventor to \nprove that ``such other patent was derived from the inventor of the \ninvention . . .''.\n  Currently, you as a first inventor can prove that you were first by \npresenting evidence that is in your control--your own records \ncontemporaneously documenting the development of your invention. But to \nprove that somebody else's patent application came from you under the \nbill, was ``derived'' from you, you would have to submit documents \nshowing this copying. Only if there was a direct relationship between \nthe two parties will the first inventor have such documents.\n  If there was only an indirect relationship, or an intermediary--for \nexample, the first inventor described his invention at an angel \ninvestor presentation where he didn't know the identities of many in \nattendance--the documents that would show ``derivation''--copying--are \nnot going to be in the first inventor's possession; they would be in \nthe second party's possession. You would have to find out who they \ntalked to, e-mailed with, et cetera to trace it back to your original \ndisclosure. But the bill doesn't provide for any discovery in these \n``derivation proceedings,'' so the first inventor can't prove their \nclaim.\n  For these reasons, and many others, the first to invent system, which \nI believe has made our Nation the leader in the world, which our \namendment would preserve, is supported by numerous people and \nbusinesses around the country, including the National Small Business \nAssociation; Coalition for Patent Fairness, a coalition of large high-\ntech companies; IEEE, Institute of Electrical and Electronics \nEngineers, which has 395,000 members; the International Federation of \nProfessional and Technological Engineers, AFL-CIO; the University of \nCalifornia System; the University of Kentucky; Paul Michel--Former \nChief Judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which \nplays the critical role of hearing appeals in patent cases; the U.S. \nBusiness and Industry Council; American Innovators for Patent Reform; \nNational Association of Patent Practitioners; Professional Inventors \nAlliance USA; CONNECT, a trade association for small technology and \nlife science businesses; and many small inventors, as represented, for \ninstance, in a letter signed by 108 startups and small businesses from \nall over the country.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this letter be \nprinted in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I don't often agree with the \norganization Gun Owners of America, a group that thinks the National \nRifle Association is too liberal. But I do agree with them on this \nissue. They are part of a coalition of 23 conservative organizations \nthat wrote to the leaders about this, arguing: ``Our competitors should \nhave to `harmonize up' to our superior intellectual property regime, \nrather than our having to weaken our patent system and `harmonize down' \nto their levels.'' Other signatories on this letter include Phyllis \nSchlafly of the Eagle Forum; Edwin Meese III, former Attorney General \nunder President Reagan; the American Conservative Union; and the \nChristian Coalition.\n  I think this is really a battle between the small inventors beginning \nin the garage, like those who developed the Apple computer that was \nnowhere, and who, through the first-to-invent system, were able to \ncreate one of the greatest companies in the world. America's great \nstrength is the cutting-edge of innovation. The first-to-invent system \nhas served us well. If it is not broke, don't fix it. I don't really \nbelieve it is broke.\n  I am delighted to see that my cosponsor, the distinguished Senator \nfrom California, is also on the floor on this matter, and I welcome her \nsupport.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                     June 1, 2010.\n     Re Effective repeal of the one-year ``grace period'' under S. \n         515, the Patent Reform Act of 2010.\n\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators, on behalf of the undersigned companies and \n     organizations whose survival and new job creations depend on \n     patent protection, we are writing regarding the patent reform \n     legislation, S. 515. We write today to draw renewed attention \n     to a proposed rewrite of 35 U.S.C. Sec. 102, which \n     effectively eliminates the American one-year grace period \n     during which current law permits an inventor to test and vet \n     an invention, publically demonstrate it to obtain advance \n     sales revenue and seek investors before filing the patent \n     application. No representatives of small business were called \n     to testify during five years of Senate hearings on patent \n     legislation. This issue has been overshadowed by the debate \n     on other provisions of S. 515, but it is no less disruptive \n     to the technology investments fostered by the patent system. \n     The proposed sweeping changes in Sec. 102 is another issue \n     where some large, incumbent firms are seeking a change to the \n     detriment of small companies, new entrants, startup \n     innovators, independent inventors, and future businesses.\n       U.S. patent law has long allowed inventors a one-year \n     ``grace period,'' so that they can develop, vet, and perfect \n     their invention, begin commercialization, advance sales, seek \n     investors and business partners, and obtain sufficient funds \n     to prosecute the patent application. During the grace period, \n     many inventors learn about starting a technology-based \n     business for the first time. They must obtain investment \n     capital and often must learn from outside patent counsel (at \n     considerable expense) about patenting and related deadlines \n     and how to set up confidentiality agreements. Many startups \n     or small businesses are in a race against insolvency during \n     this early stage. The grace period protects them during this \n     period from loss of patent rights due to any activities, \n     information leaks or inadvertent unprotected disclosures \n     prior to filing their patent applications.\n       Small businesses and startups are significantly more \n     exposed than large firms in this regard because they must \n     rely on far greater and earlier private disclosure of the \n     invention to outside parties. This is often required for \n     raising investment capital and for establishing strategic \n     marketing partnerships, licensing and distribution channels. \n     In contrast, large established firms have substantial \n     patenting experience, often have in-house patent attorneys \n     and often use internal R investment funds. They can also \n     use their own marketing, sales and distribution chains. \n     Therefore, they seldom need early disclosure of their \n     inventions to outside parties.\n       S. 515 amends Sec. 102 to confer the patent right to the \n     first-inventor-to-file as opposed to the first-to-invent as \n     provided under current law. This change is purportedly made \n     for the purpose of eliminating costly contests among near-\n     simultaneous inventors claiming the same subject matter, \n     called ``interferences.'' The goal of eliminating \n     interferences is achievable by simple amendment of only \n     Sec. 102(g) to a first-inventor-to-file criterion. However, \n     under the heading of First-Inventor-To-File, S. 515 does far \n     more, it changes all of Sec. 102, redefining the prior art \n     and practically gutting the American one-year grace period.\n\n[[Page S1096]]\n\n       Without the grace period, the patent system would become \n     far more expensive and less effective for small companies. It \n     would create the need to ``race to the patent office'' more \n     frequently and at great expense before every new idea is \n     fully developed or vetted. The pressure for more filings will \n     affect all American inventors--not only a few that end up in \n     interferences under current law. Because filing decisions \n     must be made based on information that will be preliminary \n     and immature, the bill forces poor patenting decisions. \n     Applicants will skip patent protection for some ultimately \n     valuable inventions, and will bear great costs for \n     applications for inventions that (with the additional \n     information that is developed during the grace period year of \n     current law) prove to be useless, and subsequently abandoned. \n     The evidence for this high abandonment trend under systems \n     having no grace period is readily available from European \n     application statistics.\n       The proponents of S. 515 suggest that the harm of the weak \n     grace period of proposed Sec. 102(b) can be overcome if an \n     inventor publishes a description of the invention, allowing \n     filing within a year following such publication. Underlying \n     this suggestion are two errors. First, no business willingly \n     publishes complete technical disclosures that will tip off \n     all competitors to a company's technological direction. We \n     generally do not, and will not, publish our inventions right \n     when we make them, some 2.5 years before the 18-month \n     publication or 5-7 years before the patent grant. \n     Confidentiality is crucial to small companies.\n       Second, even if we were to avail ourselves of such \n     conditional grace period by publishing first before filing, \n     we would instantly forfeit all foreign patent rights because \n     such publication would be deemed prior art under foreign \n     patent law. No patent attorney will advise their client to \n     publish every good idea they conceive in order to gain the \n     grace period of S. 515. The publication-conditioned ``grace \n     period'' in S. 515 is a useless construct proposed by parties \n     intent on compelling American inventors to ``harmonize'' de \n     facto with national patent systems that lack grace periods. \n     S. 515 forces U.S. inventors to make the ``Hobson's Choice'' \n     of losing their foreign patent rights or losing the American \n     grace period. It should be clear that the only way for \n     American inventors to continue to benefit from a grace period \n     and be able to obtain foreign patent rights, is to keep \n     intact the current secret grace period that relies on \n     invention date and a diligent reduction to practice.\n       The American grace period of current law ensures that new \n     inventions originating in American small companies and \n     startups--the sector of the economy that creates the largest \n     number of new jobs--receive patent protection essential for \n     survival and that American small businesses' access to \n     foreign markets is not destroyed. We urge you to amend S. 515 \n     so that Sec. 102 remains intact in order to preserve the \n     American grace period in its full scope and force.\n       Thank you for your consideration of our views and concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n                                        (Signed by 108 Companies).\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom California be permitted to speak, and then I ask that the \nremaining time be granted to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, will the Chair cut me off at 1 minute?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Hatch so much. I thank my \nfriend and colleague, Senator Feinstein, for this critical amendment.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered by my dear \nfriend and colleague, Senator Feinstein.\n  The amendment would strike the first-to-file provision in the patent \nreform bill.\n  I was pleased to work with my colleague, Dr. Coburn, in support of \nhis amendment to allow the patent office to keep its user fees, which \nwas accepted into the managers' amendment that passed yesterday.\n  To me, that was one of the most important reforms we could enact in \nthis legislation--giving the PTO the resources it needs to serve the \npublic.\n  I support efforts to improve our patent system. And there are some \ngood things in this bill, including efforts to help small businesses \nnavigate the PTO.\n  But I strongly disagree with changing the core principle of our \npatent system--awarding a patent to the true inventor--for the sake of \nperceived administrative ease.\n  Unlike other countries, our patent system is rooted in our \nConstitution. We are the only country in the world whose Constitution \nspecifically mentions ``inventor.''\n  Article I, section 8 states ``The Congress shall have the power . . . \nTo promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for \nlimited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their \nrespective writings and discoveries.''\n  Our system recognizes the complete process of invention--from \nconception to completion.\n  The United States is still the heart of innovation in the world, and \nits patent system is its soul.\n  Despite our rich history, the bill before us today seeks to erase \nover 200 years of invention and achievement, and replace it with a \nweaker system.\n  Let's talk about those changes.\n  Section 2 of the bill awards a patent to the first person to file, \nregardless of whether that person was the true inventor--the one who \nfirst conceived and developed the invention to completion.\n  That goes directly against the express language of the Constitution, \nwhich awards patents to the inventor, not the fastest to the PTO.\n  Section 2 of the bill also provides a weaker grace period than \ncurrent law. This is a big change that will have a significant economic \neffect on startups, entrepreneurs and individual inventors.\n  I believe it is a change that we cannot afford, especially in these \ntough economic times when we need our small businesses to create new \njobs.\n  Current law allows an inventor to obtain a patent if an application \nis filed within a year of a public use, sale or publication of \ninformation about the invention.\n  That year is called the grace period, during which an inventor's \nright to apply is protected from disclosures or applications by others \nrelated to his invention.\n  The grace period is important because it allows smaller entities, \nlike startups or individual inventors, time to set up their businesses, \nseek funding, offer their inventions for sale or license, and prepare a \nthorough patent application.\n  Put another way, the grace period is an integral part of the \nformation of a small business.\n  The grace period has been a part of our patent system since 1839, and \nit was implemented to encourage inventors to engage in commercial \nactivity, such as demonstrations and sales negotiations, without fear \nof being beaten to the patent office by someone with more resources.\n  The new grace period in the bill, however, would no longer cover \nimportant commercial activities such as sales or licensing \nnegotiations.\n  The new provision also contains vague, undefined terms that will \ninject more uncertainty into the system at a time when inventors and \ninvestors need more certainty.\n  Proponents of first-to-file will argue that there have been studies \nor reports that show that a first-to-file system does not harm small \nentities. For example, they often mention the report of the National \nAcademies of Science that reached that conclusion.\n  However, those studies and reports only analyzed the rare cases where \ntwo parties claimed to be the first inventor.\n  Do you know how rare those cases are? Last year, there were 52 cases \nout of over 450,000 applications filed--.01 percent of all applications \nended up in a contest.\n  I do not think we should change over 170 years of protection for \nsmall entities based on cases that happen with the frequency of a hole \nin one in golf--1 out of 12,500, or .01 percent.\n  Listen to the conclusion of a report analyzing the business effects \nof Canada's switch to a first-to-file system:\n\n       The divergence between small entities and large \n     corporations in patenting after the Reforms supports the idea \n     that a switch to a first-to-file system will result in \n     relatively less inventive activity being carried out by \n     independent inventors as well as small businesses, and more \n     being channeled through large corporations instead.\n\n  In closing, I believe there are things we can do to improve our \npatent system.\n  But I also believe that the foundation of our Constitution-based \nsystem--a patent is awarded to the inventor--has worked well for over \n220 years, and we should not change that core.\n  It has produced inventors such as Thomas Edison, the Wright Brothers, \nand George Washington Carver.\n  We should not change the core of our system, and I urge my colleagues \nto vote for the Feinstein amendment.\n  Mr. President, I will conclude in this way. The Feinstein amendment \nis necessary. It is necessary because the first\n\n[[Page S1097]]\n\nperson to invent should get the protection from the Patent Office. We \nbelieve that if this amendment does not pass, it goes against the \nexpress language of the Constitution which awards patents to the \ninventor, not the fastest one to run down to the Patent Office. Senator \nFeinstein has explained why this is a matter of fairness and is better \nfor consumers. I am hopeful that the amendment passes.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have been following the debate on the \npatent bill closely. I wish to again voice my strong support for \npassage of this very important legislation.\n  We have been working on this bill for a number of years and it is \nsatisfying to finally see the full Senate consider it now. As I have \nsaid before, the patent reform bill is about moving our Nation toward \nthe future. It will equip America's inventors with an improved patent \nsystem that will enable them to better compete in today's global \neconomy. Toward that end, I would like to discuss some of the key \nprovisions of this bill and what they will do to improve and modernize \nour patent system.\n  There are some misconceptions about the proposed first-inventor-to-\nfile provision. Some have questioned why we cannot maintain the current \nfirst-to-invent system, in which priority is established by determining \nwhich applicant actually invented the claimed invention first. Under \nthis system, if there is a dispute, it costs applicants an average of \n$500,000 in legal fees to prove they were the first-to-invent. This \namount does not include extra expenses that can follow if the decision \nis appealed. Unfortunately, many small businesses and independent \ninventors do not have the resources to engage in the process we have \nnow.\n  Conversely, moving to a first-inventor-to-file system would provide \ninventors a cost-effective and certain path to protect one's invention \nthrough the filing of a provisional application, at a much more \nreasonable cost of about $100.\n  The purpose of the proposed transition is certainly not to hurt small \nbusinesses or independent inventors. Quite the contrary. These \ninnovators are too important to our Nation's economic health. But let's \nconsider some facts: in the past 7 years, more than 3,000,000 \napplications have been filed, and only 25 patents were granted to small \nentities that were the second inventor to file, but later proved that \nthey were first to invent. Of those 25, only one patent was granted to \nan individual inventor who was the second to file. Thus, in the last 7 \nyears, only one inventor in over 3,000,000 patent filings would have \ngotten a different outcome if we, like the rest of world, used a first-\ninventor-to-file patent system. I assure you that I do not want to \nminimize the reluctance that some have with changing to this new \nsystem; however, the facts speak for themselves. Simply put, moving to \na first-inventor-to-file system does not appear to have the level of \nrisk some have feared.\n  Additionally, the American Bar Association's Section of Intellectual \nProperty Law recently confirmed the importance of the proposed \ntransition by stating:\n\n       For inventions made after 1996, the U.S. patent system has \n     been open to proofs of inventions made outside the United \n     States--creating for many U.S.-based inventors a new and \n     potentially even more expensive obstacle to obtaining a \n     patent under the current first-to-invent rule. Finally, U.S. \n     inventors more and more are facing the need to file patent \n     applications both at home and abroad to remain competitive in \n     our global economy. Requiring compliance with two \n     fundamentally different systems places undue additional \n     burdens on U.S. inventors and puts them at a competitive \n     disadvantage in this global economy.\n\n  Indeed, the transition to the first-inventor-to-file system is long \noverdue and will help our U.S. companies and inventors out-compete \ntheir global challengers.\n  The proposed legislation would also give the USPTO rulemaking \nauthority to set or adjust its own fees, without requiring a statutory \nchange every time an adjustment is needed. Providing the USPTO the \nability to adjust its own fees will give the agency greater flexibility \nand control, which, in the long run, will benefit inventors and \nbusinesses.\n  Speaking of greater fiscal flexibility for the USPTO, let me take a \nmoment to discuss the importance of ensuring full access to the fees \nthe agency collects.\n  American inventors, who create jobs and keep our economic engine \nrunning, should not have to wait for years after they have paid their \nfees to have their patent applications processed. This is tantamount to \na tax on innovation and it creates disincentives for inventors and \nentrepreneurs.\n  A fully funded USPTO, with fiscal flexibility, would--at the very \nleast--mean more and better trained patent examiners, greater \ndeployment of modern information technologies to address the agency's \ngrowing needs, and better access to complete libraries of prior art.\n  Over the years, fee diversion has forced a vicious cycle of abrupt \nstarts and stops in the hiring, training, and retention of qualified \noffice personnel. To make matters worse, under current conditions, \noutdated computer systems are not keeping pace with the volume of work \nbefore the agency. It is clear to most that the USPTO has yet to \nrecover from the negative impact of diverting close to a billion \ndollars from its coffers, for its own use. That has not only been \nwrong, it is obscene.\n\n  I agree with what has been said that there cannot be true patent \nreform without full access to collected fees from the USPTO. We owe it \nto our inventor community to do this. We all have a vested interest in \nensuring that our country's unique spirit of ingenuity and innovation \ncontinues to thrive and flourish. Last night, an overwhelming majority \nof the Senate voted to finally put an end to fee diversion from the \nUSPTO. It was a historic moment, and I hope our House colleagues will \nmaintain this momentum. I understand some people on the Appropriations \nCommittee do not like it. They do not like it because they like to be \nable to play with that money. But it is disastrous to not have that \nmoney stay with the USPTO so we can move forward faster, better and get \na lot more done and still be the leading innovative nation in the \nworld.\n  The legislation also enables patentholders to request a supplemental \nexamination of a patent if new information arises after the initial \nexamination. By establishing this new process, the USPTO would be asked \nto consider, reconsider or correct information believed to be relevant \nto the patent. The request must be made before litigation commences. \nTherefore, supplemental examination cannot be used to remedy flaws \nfirst brought to light in the course of litigation, nor does it \ninterfere with the court's ability to address inequitable conduct. That \nis an important point. Further, this provision does not limit the \nUSPTO's authority to investigate misconduct or to sanction bad actors.\n  In a nutshell, the supplemental examination provision satisfies a \nlong-felt need in the patent community to be able to identify whether a \npatent would be deemed flawed if it ever went to litigation and enables \npatentees to take corrective action. This process enhances the quality \nof patents, thereby promoting greater certainty for patentees and the \npublic.\n  The America Invents Act also creates a mechanism for third parties to \nsubmit relevant information during the patent examination process. This \nprovision would provide the USPTO with better information about the \ntechnology and claimed invention by leveraging the knowledge of the \npublic. This will also help the agency increase the efficiency of \nexamination and the quality of patents.\n  The pending legislation also provides a new postgrant review \nopposition proceeding to enable early challenges to the validity of \npatents. This new but time-limited postgrant review procedure will help \nto enhance patent quality and restore confidence in the presumption of \nvalidity that comes with issued patents.\n  Finally, this bipartisan patent bill provides many improvements to \nour patent system which include, among other provisions, just some of \nthe following:\n  Changes to the best mode disclosure requirement, increased incentives \nfor government laboratories to commercialize inventions, restrictions \non false\n\n[[Page S1098]]\n\nmarking claims, removal of restrictions on the residency of Federal \ncircuit judges, clarification of tax strategy patents, providing \nassistance to small businesses through a patent ombudsman program, \nestablishing additional USPTO satellite offices, and creation of a \ntransitional postgrant proceeding specific to business method patents.\n  As we can see, this bipartisan bill represents significant changes to \nour patent laws. They will enable our great country to more effectively \ncompete in the 21st century global economy. I encourage my colleagues \nto take action and vote in favor of this bill. We cannot afford to \nallow this opportunity to pass us by.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah for his \nstrong statement of support for the America Invents Act, a bill that \nis, at its heart, all about moving our economy forward. When we think \nabout the brass tacks of our country, we think about ideas, we think \nabout inventions. It was our inventors who developed the light bulb, \nthe assembly line, the Internet, the iPod, and, of course, my 15-year-\nold daughter's favorite invention, Facebook. This all came from our \ngreat country.\n  I wish to comment, briefly--I know Senator Rockefeller has an \nimportant issue to talk about, the issue we have just been discussing.\n  First of all, we have heard from stakeholders from across the \nspectrum--from high tech and life sciences to universities and small \ninventors--in support of the transition to the first-to-file system.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a list of \nsupporters of the transition to the first-to-file system that is \ncontained in the America Invents Act.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Supporters of the First-to-File Transition\n\n       AdvaMed; American Bar Association; American Council on \n     Education; American Intellectual Property Law Association; \n     Association of American Medical Colleges; Association for \n     Competitive Technology; Association of American Universities; \n     Association of Public and Land-grant Universities; \n     Association of University Technology Managers; BASF, the \n     Chemical Company; Biotechnology Industry Organization; \n     Business Software Alliance; Caterpillar; Coalition for 21st \n     Century Patent Reform; Council on Governmental Relations; \n     Gary Michelson, Independent Inventor; Genentech; Intellectual \n     Property Owners Association; Louis J. Foreman, Enventys, \n     independent inventor; National Association of Manufacturers; \n     Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council; and Software & \n     Information Industry Association.\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, we have heard also on the floor that \nthere is, as Senator Hatch mentioned, strong support throughout the \nSenate for this change. In fact, Commerce Secretary Locke emphasizes \nthat support in a column appearing in the Hill newspaper today. He \nstates:\n\n       [P]atent reform adopts the ``first-inventor-to-file'' \n     standard as opposed to the current ``first-to-invent'' \n     standard. First inventor to file is used by the rest of the \n     world \n     and would be good for U.S. businesses, providing a more \n     transparent and cost-effective process that puts them on a \n     level playing field. . . .\n\n  I could not agree more. Small businesses, independent investors, and \nstakeholders across the spectrum support this important transition.\n  I wish to mention one other aspect of this system. With the current \nfirst-to-invent system, when two patents are filed around the same time \nfor the same invention, it also creates problems. It means the \napplicants must go through an arduous and expensive process called an \ninterference to determine which applicant will be awarded the patent.\n  Small inventors rarely, if ever, win interference proceedings because \nthe rules for interferences are often stacked in favor of companies \nthat can spend more money. We believe this needs to change. There was a \nrecent article about this in the Washington Post in which David Kappos, \nthe Director of the Patent Office and Under Secretary for Intellectual \nProperty, described the current system is similar to parking your car \nin a metered space and having someone else come up and say they had \npriority for that space and then having your car towed. Instead, we \nneed a system in which, if you are the first to pull in and pay your \nfee, you can park there and no one else can claim it is their space.\n  The America Invents Act would create that system. It transitions our \npatent system from a first-to-invent system to a first-inventor-to-file \nsystem. By simply using the file date of an application to determine \nthe true inventor, the bill increases the speed of a patent application \nprocess, while also rewarding novel, cutting-edge inventions.\n  A first-to-file system creates more certainty for inventors looking \nto see if an idea has already been patented. At the same time, the bill \nstill provides a safe harbor of 1 year for inventors to go out and \nmarket their inventions before having to file for their patent. This \ngrace period is one of the reasons our Nation's top research \nuniversities, such as the University of Minnesota, support the bill. \nThe grace period protects professors who discuss their inventions with \ncolleagues or publish them in journals before filing their patent \napplication.\n  Mr. President, I know Senator Rockefeller is here to discuss a very \nimportant issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside \nthe pending amendment so I may call up amendment No. 134.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have to object on behalf of the manager \nof the bill who is not here right now. If the Senator can at least wait \nuntil Senator Grassley returns to make his request.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I know the Senator from Utah, and I remind him he \nwas the lead author of the Hatch-Waxman Act, creating the 180-day \nperiod for generics.\n  Mr. HATCH. I object right now, but as soon as Senator Grassley gets \nback----\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Will the Senator from Utah object if I talk about \nit?\n  Mr. HATCH. No.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. An objection has been heard.\n  The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 134\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, my amendment is based on legislation \nI introduced earlier this year, obviously quite recently. The \ncosponsors of that bill, which is called the Fair Prescription Drug \nCompetition Act, are Senator Shaheen, Senator Leahy, who chairs the \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Inouye, Senator Stabenow, and Senator \nSchumer, who is on the Judiciary Committee.\n  I wish to acknowledge that the managers of this bill, Chairman Leahy \nand Senator Grassley, have been steadfast partners in pushing the \nFederal Trade Commission to investigate further consumer access to \ngeneric drugs, which is a huge problem. We do a lot of talking about \nthe health care bill and a lot of other things about saving money and \nsaving consumers money. This is a bill which would do this, if I were \nallowed to actually proceed to it.\n  This amendment eliminates one of the most widely abused loopholes \nthat brand-name drug companies use to extend their shelf life, their \nmonopoly, and limit consumer access to lower cost generic drugs which \nare just as good and just the same, but they have a system to work on \nthat. It ends the marketing of so-called authorized generic drugs \nduring the 180-day marketing exclusivity period that Congress designed \nto give real low-cost generics a major incentive to enter the market.\n  What was happening was the brand-name drug companies had their 18 \nyears of exclusivity. That is a monopoly time unrivaled. Then somebody \nelse would come in with a cheaper way of doing the same thing, an FDA-\napproved drug, but it would be a generic drug. It would be the same \ndrug, have the same effect, but it would be much cheaper. Since \nmillions of people buy these drugs, that would seem to be a good thing \nin a budget-conscious era for American families, as well as for the \ngovernment.\n  As I say, this amendment ends the so-called authorized generic drugs \nduring the 180-day marketing exclusivity\n\n[[Page S1099]]\n\nperiod Congress designated to give real low-cost generics a major \nincentive to enter the market. You have to be able to enter the market \nto compete and to get your lower priced, equally good drugs out there. \nThey do that by challenging a brand-name patent. That is the only way \nthey can do it.\n  An authorized generic drug is a brand-name prescription drug produced \nby the same brand manufacturer yet repackaged as a generic. That is \nclever, but it is also a little devious. Many brand-name drug \nmanufacturers are repackaging their drugs as generics for the purpose \nof extending their market shares after their patents expire. They have \na little subsidiary which produces something which they shift over to \nthem.\n  Unfortunately, this often eliminates the incentive for an independent \ngeneric to enter the marketplace. Therefore, the price of drugs remains \nmuch higher, and that would seem to be not in the interest of the \nAmerican people.\n  In 1984, Congress passed the Hatch-Waxman Act to provide consumer \naccess to lower cost generic drugs. Under the law which the Senator \nfrom Utah led, if a true generic firm successfully challenges a brand-\nname patent, the generic firm is provided a 180-day period for that \ndrug to exclusively enter the market. This is a crucial incentive for \ngeneric drug companies to enter that market and make prescription drugs \nmore affordable for consumers. It would seem to me this would be a very \nlaudable pursuit.\n  Every American agrees on the need to reduce health care costs. \nGeneric drugs save consumers an estimated total of $8 billion to $10 \nbillion a year--$8 billion to $10 billion-a-year savings for the same \nquality of drug. Of course, they get that at the retail pharmacies \nwhere the prescription is handed out. For working families, these \nsavings can make a huge difference, particularly during very tough \neconomic times, which we are going through.\n  This amendment would restore the main incentive generic drug \ncompanies have to challenge a brand-name patent and enter the market. \nWe give them the incentive to challenge the brand-name prescriber.\n  That is what this amendment is about. It is profoundly important. It \nhas been before this body many times. I guess it is a question of do we \nwant to help people who have to take a lot of prescriptions and older \npeople--any kind of people. Do we want to help them pay less? I guess \nit divides into if you do or if you don't. I am in the camp of, yes, I \nwant to have people pay less. So I would just say that.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor for the time being.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for approximately 20 minutes, and I probably will not \nuse all of that time and will yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                     Executive Order on Regulations\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to speak again about President Obama's \nJanuary 18 Executive order that directed all Federal agencies within \nthe administration to review or repeal those significant regulatory \nactions that are duplicative, overly burdensome, or would have a \nsignificant economic impact on ordinary Americans.\n  The President went on to say--I am paraphrasing from his words--they \nare costly, they are duplicative, in many cases they aren't necessary, \nwe need to review them, and in some cases, actually, they are stupid. \nThat is a direct quote from the President. I am paraphrasing, but he \ndid say the word ``stupid.''\n  Probably ``stupid'' would be the word, or maybe ``egregious'' or \n``fed up'' that almost any group or any organization back home would \nuse when you visit with them. I know Senators, on their past break or \nour work period, if you will, probably spoke to a lot of groups. I will \ntell you what happened to me.\n  I would walk into a group--any organization, be it farmers, ranchers, \neducators, health care, whatever--and they would say: Pat, what on \nEarth are you doing back there, passing all these regulations, a wave \nof regulations that do not make common sense and do not fit the \nyardstick, if you will, of cost and benefit? We can't even wake up any \nmorning without some new regulation popping up across the desk, and we \njust don't have the people to do this. You are about to put us out of \nbusiness.\n  The first thing I say is, I am not a ``you guy,'' I am an ``us guy.'' \nAnd I am very much aware of these regulations. We have to do something \nabout it. I brought up the fact the President himself recognized these \nproblems.\n  But I have to say that while I applauded this decision by the \nPresident, I noted there were some loopholes in his Executive order, \nand they are roughly these--if I could sort of summarize them: No. 1, \nif you are doing something for the public good--and, obviously, the \nsecretary of any agency is going to say: Sure, we are doing something \nfor the public good--well, then, you are exempt. That is a pretty big \nloophole to drive the truck through.\n  Secondly, it was if you are an independent agency. Well, let's try \nthe IRS. I think more people than most would say: Yes, we have some \nregulatory problems with the IRS.\n  Several more, and I won't go into those. Then you have this \nparagraph, which I am going to read, that agencies can apply to their \ndecision as to whether they are going to review the regulations they \nhave on the books and regulations coming down the pike. They can apply \nthis to see if they are exempt, and this is within the Executive order.\n\n       In applying these principles, each agency is directed to \n     use the best available techniques to quantify anticipated \n     present and future benefits and costs as accurately as \n     possible.\n\n  I can't imagine anybody being opposed to that.\n\n       Where appropriate and permitted by law, each agency may \n     consider and discuss qualitatively values that are difficult \n     or impossible to quantify--\n\n  I don't know how you do that--\n\n     including equity, human dignity, fairness and distributive \n     impacts.\n\n  That is about as amorphous as any language that I could possibly put \ntogether. If any secretary, or anybody in any agency who promulgates \nall the regulations they think they are forced to under some \ncongressional act or perhaps an Executive order they are trying to \nissue applies this language, of course, they are exempt.\n  So there are loopholes, again, that you can drive trucks through in \nregards to the fact that this Executive order is basically not going to \nbe adhered to because everybody will stand up and say: We are exempt. \nWe are doing public good. We are doing this language--whatever that \nmeans.\n  So while I applaud the decision by the President, I decided last week \nI would introduce legislation to strengthen and codify his Executive \norder. All that means is, when I say we codify it, we say: OK, the \nExecutive order stands but, sorry, no exemptions.\n  What a day that would bring to Washington, with all the Federal \nagencies saying: Whoa, stop. We are going to take a look at all the \nregulations we have out there now, and we are going to take a look at \nall the ones we are promulgating--which are hundreds of them. And, I \nmight just note, there were 44 major regulatory decisions that cost the \nAmerican business community $27 billion just last year, according to \none study. We are finding more and more people coming to Washington who \nhave an agenda in regards to these regulations, but the folks out there \nwho are being impacted seem to be overlooked.\n  I have 30, 32, 35 cosponsors on this bill. I asked on both sides of \nthe aisle for cosponsors. I think it is a good bill. It would be a \nbrandnew day in Washington if every Federal agency had to stop and say: \nWhoa, wait a minute. Let's apply a cost-benefit yardstick. The \nExecutive order sort of goes into what that would mean. They have one \nindividual who is supposed to be doing all of this, so they could \nreport to him, although that would be quite a load. My goodness, if all \nthe Federal agencies stopped their regulatory process, there would be a \ncheer out in the hinterland in regards to every business I can think \nof.\n  Well, as the administration moves forward with this review, I am \ngoing to have something to say in several areas: health care, energy, \nand financing, to people who are lending agencies and the effect of the \nregulatory reform. But today I want to talk about agriculture.\n\n[[Page S1100]]\n\nToday I want to talk about the EPA and what is going on in regards to \nwhat I think is regulatory overkill for sure.\n  I am privileged to be the ranking Republican and to serve with the \nSenator from Michigan, our chairwoman of the committee, Senator \nStabenow. Basically, as the administration moves forward with its \nreview, I recommend the President and his advisers pay particularly \nclose attention to the activities of three specific agencies when they \nare determining which proposed regulations will place the greatest \nburden on agriculture--a key component of our Nation's economy and the \nability to feed this country and a troubled and hungry world--the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, the Department of Agriculture, and the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission.\n  Since fiscal year 2010, 10 new regulations promulgated--that is a \nfancy word in Washington which means issued--by the EPA have accounted \nfor over $23 billion in new cost to the American taxpayer. Now, that is \noutrageous, and they are just getting started. The EPA has several new \nproposals, many of which will have immediate negative impacts on the \nability of America's farmers and ranchers to continue to produce enough \nfood to feed our communities, our States, our country, and, yes, the \nworld. Think of how valuable that is as we look down the road with \nabout a 9.3 billion increase in population compared to 6 billion today. \nWe are going to have to double agriculture production, and I will talk \nabout that a little later.\n  Why on Earth would we want to do anything to the farmer and rancher \nwhose job it is to do that? That is beyond me. I will highlight two \nsuch proposals that many producers have brought to my attention. I just \naddressed the Commodity Classic in Kansas, in Great Bend, of about 200 \nfarmers. Guess what their No. 1 concern was. Overregulation, regulation \nthat could put them out of business. They are concerned about the farm \nbill and they are concerned about lending and they are concerned about \ndebt. But first, in only 7 short weeks, the EPA will require farmers--\nwho are applying pesticide to kill pests so they can save the crop--to \nobtain a permit under the Clean Water Act, even though that activity is \nalready highly regulated under the Federal pesticide law. The President \nsaid we don't need regulations that are duplicative. We don't need two \nagencies having a different agreement on one regulation. We probably \ndon't even need that regulation because we have very strong regulations \nunder the FIFRA act that we have right now.\n  Farmers and other pesticide applicators, under this regulatory \nimpact, would not be facing these requirements if the administration \nhad chosen to vigorously defend its longstanding policy that \nprotections under the Federal pesticide law were sufficient to protect \nthe environment.\n  Excuse me, Mr. President. That was probably a phone call from some \nfarmer listening to this and saying: Go ahead and give them you know \nwhat, Pat.\n  Unfortunately, the administration chose a different path and now \nestimates suggest this duplicative regulation will require 365,000 \nindividuals to get a Clean Water Act permit--365,000 individuals--a \nrequirement that will cost $50 million and require 1 million hours per \nyear to implement. Bottom line, it will not add any environmental \nprotection.\n  This layer of redtape will place a huge financial burden on the \nshoulders of farm families all across the country, as well as State \ngovernments responsible for enforcement while at the same time facing \ndire budget situations. Last month, John Salazar, a former Member of \nthe House of Representatives and newly appointed Colorado Commissioner \nof Agriculture stated in his testimony before the House:\n\n       It is no secret that States across the country face dire \n     budget situations and many have had to close State parks, \n     cancel transportation projects and cut funding to higher \n     education. It is very difficult to justify diverting even \n     more resources to manage paperwork for a permit that is \n     duplicative of other regulatory programs and has no \n     appreciable environmental benefits. However, if Colorado's \n     estimates are reflective of the situation in other States, \n     the true cost to States will quickly outstrip EPA's \n     estimates. More than 365,000 individuals, $50 million, and 1 \n     million hours per year to implement on the backs of our \n     farmers and ranchers.\n\n  Mr. President, these expenses are not just limited to the cost of \ncompliance and enforcement. The April 9 effective date is near. There \nis still significant confusion and uncertainty about what pesticide \napplications will fall under these new regulations. This means farmers \nand other pesticide applicators may very well find themselves subject \nto massive penalties. On top of the fact that they shouldn't be filling \nout the paperwork in the first place, if they do not, they could be \nheld responsible for massive penalties for minor paperwork violations \nto the tune of--get this--$37,500 per day per violation. Unbelievable.\n  Beyond agency enforcement, they will also now be exposed to the \nthreat of litigation under the clean water law's citizen suit \nprovisions. With the volatile nature of agricultural markets and \nincreased demand, these sort of risks and resulting costs are something \nthat producers and the hungry mouths who depend on them simply cannot \nafford.\n  Next, EPA is undertaking an effort to control particulate matter--\nthis is a favorite of mine--otherwise known as dust. They call it rural \nfugitive dust. This is a dust-off of the old 1970s effort to control \nrural fugitive dust. I remember that. Somebody must have pulled it from \nthe file. This is part of the EPA's review of the PM standard under the \nClean Air Act.\n  The agency is currently considering the most stringent regulations on \nfarm dust that have ever been proposed. I finally reached the person \nwho, when they first proposed this, was in charge of promoting it, or \nshe was going to promulgate these regulations on rural fugitive \ndust. Before I could get a word in--I finally reached the person in \ncharge; it took me 3 days--finally, before I could get a word in, she \nsaid: Did you realize--at that point I was a Congressman, and she said: \nDo you realize, Mr. Roberts, you have a lot of dust in your part of the \ncountry?\n\n  I said: I think I know that. That is why we had the Great Plains \nConservation Program. Each farmer has to have a conservation program if \nthey are going to apply or for it to be applicable to the farm bill. We \nhave a Conservation Reserve Program. We are doing everything we can to \ncontrol dust, rest assured. Nobody likes that.\n  I said: What would you have us do to comply with rural fugitive dust \nrules?\n  She said: You know the grain trucks at harvest go up and down gravel \nroads, and they cause a lot of dust.\n  No kidding.\n  I said: What would you have us do?\n  She said: Why don't you send out water trucks at 10 o'clock in the \nmorning and 2 in the afternoon to every community in Kansas that has \nthose gravel roads where you harvest wheat.\n  I said: Great idea. That would be marvelous. Maybe we could get a \ngrant. Today, that would be a stimulus grant to small communities in \nregard to rural areas where we are doing the wheat harvest to, No. 1, \nbuy the trucks and, No. 2, find the water.\n  That is just how ridiculous this is with rural fugitive dust. To put \nit simply, this defies common sense, whether it is cattle kicking up \ndust in a feedlot in Dodge City, KS, or Larned, KS, or anywhere in \nKansas during harvest on a hot afternoon on the high plains in June. \nDust is a naturally occurring event. Standards beyond the current limit \nwould be impossible to meet, particularly in the western portion of the \nNation where rainfall is often scarce. I don't even know why I am \ntaking this seriously in regard to that kind of regulation.\n  In a bipartisan June letter, 23 Members of this body wrote a letter \nto express these concerns to Administrator Jackson stating:\n\n       Considering the Administration's focus on rural America and \n     rural economic development, a proposal such as this could \n     have a negative effect on those very goals . . . Common sense \n     requires the EPA to acknowledge that the wind blows and so \n     does dust.\n\n  As we think about EPA's actions impacting agriculture, it is critical \nto recognize that no one cares more about maintaining a clean \nenvironment than the American farmer and rancher. Producers across the \ncountry manage their operations responsibly because of their desire to \nkeep farming and to one day pass along that ranch or field to their \nsons, daughters and grandchildren if\n\n[[Page S1101]]\n\nthey can. They know firsthand that clean air and water and healthy soil \ngo hand-in-hand with a healthy economy. Our producers deserve respect \nand appreciation from the EPA, not costly and redundant and yes, even \nridiculous regulation.\n  Shifting departments now, the Department of Agriculture's Grain \nInspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration--GIPSA--released a \nproposed rule that would dramatically increase the redtape governing \nthe business relationships surrounding production and marketing of \nlivestock in the United States. The rule was initially proposed last \nsummer without the benefit of a meaningful cost-benefit analysis--\nsomething we have been trying to get and something the administration \nshould have included.\n  However, the proposal has since received significant criticism from \nranchers, industry and members of Congress alike and is now being \nfurther evaluated by USDA officials.\n  As written, the proposal would dramatically reduce consumer choice \nand increase costs. The proposal exposes packers to liability for use \nof alternative marketing arrangements and other innovative procurement \nmethods, thereby ultimately depressing the prices received for \nAmerica's most efficient and successful producers while potentially \nreducing the quality available to consumers.\n  Further, the proposed rule would actually increase concentration in \nthe sector as businesses are forced to change their current \norganizational structure--exacerbating the very issue the rule is \nallegedly designed to address. For example, in Kansas, we have a highly \nsuccessful rancher-owned company made up of individual producers who \nown both cattle and shares in the company's processing infrastructure. \nUnder this proposal, many of the individual members of the company may \nnow be prohibited from selling cattle directly to other processors, \ncreating the need for a middleman that would then lower the price the \nproducer actually receives.\n  If implemented, the GIPSA rule poses a substantial threat to the \ncontinued viability of the domestic livestock sector. In Kansas, this \nindustry contributes over $9.5 billion to our economy. With an economic \nfootprint of this magnitude, the GIPSA regulation is a burden that \nKansas and many other rural States and many of the livestock producers \nsimply cannot afford.\n  Another agency falling through the President's Executive order \nloophole is the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. As a result of \nthe Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC is charged with developing dozens of new \nregulations impacting participants up and down the swaps and futures \nchain.\n  Shouldn't these regulations be held to the same standard of cost-\neffectiveness and undue burden as others? Yes--but no. I talked to \nChairman Gensler in my office just a couple of days ago. He is a very \nnice man, very pleasant. He believes very strongly that the CFTC is \nexempt from the President's Executive order because the President said \nit was exempt. I indicated that I didn't think so, especially since the \nCFTC is presently pushing 40-plus rules out the door in 1 year with \nlittle or no priority.\n  We were told the intent of Dodd-Frank was to reduce systemic risk in \nthe financial marketplace. However, several of CFTC's proposals appear \nto increase risk management costs on those who do not pose a systemic \nthreat. The CFTC must be mindful that increased costs through high \nmargin and capital requirements on certain segments of the marketplace \nmay decrease a user's ability to use appropriate risk management tools.\n  A rigorous cost-benefit analysis is tailor-made for the CFTC's \ncurrent situation: dozens of economically significant rules; the \npotential to negatively impact risk management costs of American \nbusinesses; and a simple question needing to be answered--do the \nbenefits of this proposed regulation--we are talking about anywhere \nfrom 40 to 60 now--in the form of lower systemic risk in our financial \nsystem outweigh the increased costs on businesses?\n  Let me say something. In talking with Chairman Gensler--again, I \nreally appreciate him coming by the office and talking. It became \nobvious to me that with all these regulations, maybe the first one \nought to be a definition regulation. What is a swap? Who is a dealer? \nIt has not been done yet. So we are going to propose 39 more \nregulations and we have not even defined whom the regulations will \naffect and what the subject matter is that they are going to regulate. \nThat is really unbelievable.\n  We are going to have a hearing tomorrow in the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee. Chairman Gensler will attend and give his testimony. We are \ngoing to be very welcoming to him in regard to the committee, but that \nis something I am going to ask him. Why on Earth are you going ahead \nwith 40 regulations and you can't even define whom you are going to \nregulate or what you are going to regulate? There is no definition. \nThat, to me, is pretty bad. You have the cart before the horse there.\n  In closing, I wish to make two points. First, in many rural areas of \nKansas and the rest of the country, agriculture is the cornerstone of \nthe economy. Second, in the coming decades we will be even more reliant \non America's farmers and ranchers to feed an ever-growing world \npopulation. I said that before.\n  We must truly commit to a real and robust--here is a good Senate \nword--robust review and revocation of any and all unduly burdensome \nregulations that could inhibit American agriculture's ability to \nproduce the safest, most abundant, and affordable food, feed, and fiber \nsupply in the world. What are we talking about? We are talking about \n9.3 billion people. What are we talking about? The ability for our \nagriculture--for everybody in agriculture to double our production, all \nthe farmers and ranchers. Why on Earth would we want this whole \nbusiness of regulatory impact--most of which is highly questionable, \nnone of which fits the President's Executive order to take a look at \nthe cost-benefit--why on Earth would we do this to the very person \nwhose job it is to feed this country and the hungry world?\n  Look at the Mideast--in turmoil. I remember one interview on TV where \nsomebody stuck a microphone in and asked one of the protesters in \nLibya: What are you protesting for? Democracy?\n  He said: No, a loaf of bread.\n  Where people are hungry and malnourished, you have no economic \nopportunity. Where you have people who are hungry, they will go and \njoin extremist groups, even on over into terrorism groups.\n  I had the privilege of being the chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee here in the Senate. That was one of the big considerations we \nhad in whole areas of the world where people do not have the ability to \nfeed themselves, where they are in a food-deficient area. It really \nposes problems for the future of that part of the world. Yet here we \nask our farmers and ranchers to double our ag production in a couple of \ndecades. I don't know how we are going to do this with this regulatory \nnightmare.\n  Let's hope we wake up soon. I hope everybody will take a look at my \nbill to codify the President's Executive order--I give him credit for \ndoing that--but not with all these loopholes that are going to drive us \nnuts out there in rural, smalltown America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Second Opinion\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor today as someone who \nhas practiced medicine in Wyoming, taken care of families there for a \nquarter of a century, working with people all across our great State, \nas a physician who has also served in our State senate.\n  Both in my practice, as well as in my service in the State senate, I \nhave dealt with the issue of Medicaid, a program that was set up to \nhelp low-income Americans obtain health care. So I came today with a \ndoctor's second\n\n[[Page S1102]]\n\nopinion about recent developments and findings with regard to the \nhealth care law because, day after day, we see news reports showing \nStates all across the country facing extreme financial budget \npressures, even bankruptcy. One of the key factors exacerbating State \nfiscal troubles is the Medicaid Program. Over the next 10 years, \nWashington will spend about $4.4 trillion on Medicaid. At the State \nlevel, Medicaid spending now consumes roughly one-quarter of the \nbudgets of each of the States.\n  Increases in Medicaid costs often force Governors and State \nlegislators to make drastic cuts to local priorities, such as \neducation, law enforcement, public safety. As I mentioned, I did serve \nin the Wyoming State Legislature--5 years in the Wyoming State Senate--\nand was there last week to address the legislatures, the Wyoming State \nSenate and House, to talk with them, listen to them about their \nconcerns.\n  In the State of Wyoming, we are required, on an annual basis, to \nbalance our budget. We do it every year. So I know from a firsthand \nexperience that tough choices need to be made. That is why I can tell \nyou this current health care law, President Obama's health care law, is \nnot going to make it any easier for our States to close the budget gaps \nthey are facing, and, as a matter of fact, it is going to make the \nsituation worse.\n  The President's health care law created the biggest Medicaid \nexpansion in history. The law says every State must provide Medicaid \nfor every one of their citizens who earns up to 133 percent of the \nFederal poverty limit. This does not work for the States, and it does \nnot work for the people who will be forced onto Medicaid.\n  The health care law does not provide additional resources to States \nthat are already strapped for cash in order to try to deal with paying \nfor this incredible expansion of Medicaid, and it certainly does not \ngive States additional financial help so they can pay health care \nproviders enough to participate in Medicaid--because about 40 percent \nof physicians across the country refuse to see Medicaid patients. My \npartners and I took care of everyone in Wyoming who would call or come \nto our office, regardless of ability to pay, but across the country \nabout 40 percent of physicians refuse to see Medicaid patients.\n  So I have said, over and over throughout this health care reform \ndebate over the last year or so, that having a health care government \ninsurance card does not mean someone will automatically have access to \nmedical care. The President frequently talks about making sure people \nhave coverage, but that does not necessarily mean they will have access \nto care.\n  So I wish to be very clear. The States, especially my home State of \nWyoming, do an incredible job of running the Medicaid programs. They do \nit with limited resources. But a weak economy, combined with a high \nunemployment rate, drove Medicaid enrollment to record levels. So it is \nnot a surprise that Medicaid is quickly consuming greater and greater \nportions of State budgets, cutting into money that is being used to pay \nfor teachers, for police, and for firefighters.\n  Former Governor Phil Bredesen of Tennessee, a Democrat, said it best \nwhen he called the health care law's Medicaid expansion ``the mother of \nall unfunded mandates.'' Governor Bredesen went on to say that \n``Medicaid is a poor vehicle for expanding coverage.'' Let me repeat \nthat. Medicaid, which the President has used as the approach to expand \ncoverage, the Governor, the Democratic Governor, says Medicaid is a \npoor vehicle for expanding coverage. He want to say:\n\n       It's a 45-year-old system originally designed for poor \n     women and their children. It's not health care reform to dump \n     more money into Medicaid.\n\n  Well, the former Governor of Tennessee is not alone. On November 9, \n2010, Governor Brian Schweitzer, of my neighboring State of Montana, \nalso a Democrat, met with his State's health industry leaders to talk \nabout Medicaid, the challenges they are facing.\n  What he said was: ``As the manager of Montana's budget, I am worried \nbecause there are only three states that will increase the number of \npeople on Medicaid at a faster rate than Montana, thanks to the new \nhealth care bill.''\n  He said: ``My job is to try and find ways to go forward that Montana \ncan continue to fund Medicaid and not be like 48 other States . . . \nbroke.''\n  So, in January, 33 Governors and Governors-elect sent a letter to \nPresident Obama, to Congressional leadership, and to Health and Human \nServices Secretary Sebelius. What did they say? Well, the letter asks \nFederal lawmakers to lift the constraints placed on them by the health \ncare law's mandates. The Governors are begging Congress for help.\n  They each have very unique Medicaid Programs across the country, the \ndifferent States, and they want, they asked, they need the flexibility \nto manage their programs, their individual programs as effectively and \nefficiently as possible.\n  Well, they all need to make tough but necessary budget decisions, and \nthey cannot do it when Washington bureaucrats and the enduring wisdom \nof those in Washington will not allow it. You want to add insult to \ninjury? This week, the President claimed, as he was addressing \nGovernors at the National Governors Association, that the health care \nlaw offers States flexibility to create their own health care plans.\n  This was Monday in an address to the National Governors Association. \nThe President made an announcement. He announced: ``If your state can \ncreate a plan that covers as many people as affordably and \ncomprehensively as the Affordable Care Act does--without increasing the \ndeficit--you can implement that plan.''\n  Well, that is quite a tall and almost impossible order. The American \npeople and certainly the Governors who were listening to him in the \naudience on Monday saw right through the President's PR stunt. The \nPresident's plan requires States to create health care plans that \nimitate his health care law, rather than actually offering States true \nfreedom to innovate better solutions. There are better solutions out \nthere than what this body and the House of Representatives passed and \nthe President signed into law almost 1 year ago.\n  It seems to me the President wants to have his cake and eat it too. \nHe tells the States they already have the ability to craft a different \nhealth care plan, but, of course, there is a catch. What the President \ndoes not say, what he would not tell the Governors, is that States can \nonly design different health care plans if--if, and only if--they meet \nthe health care law's litany of Washington mandates.\n  States still must pass legislation mandating all its citizens buy \nhealth insurance. States must still provide Washington-approved \ninsurance coverage--Washington levels, Washington approved--limiting \nuse of innovative health care products such as health savings accounts. \nOh, no, that is not allowed by the President. States are still locked \ninto the law's Medicaid expansion spending requirements. During these \ntough economic times, the States need certainty, they need consistency, \nnot more Washington doublespeak.\n  Last month, I introduced, along with Senator Lindsey Graham, a bill \ngiving the States exactly what they need: flexibility, freedom, and \nchoice. The bill is called the State Health Care Choice Act. This \nlegislation is simple, it is straightforward, and it protects States \nrights by allowing them to voluntarily opt out of portions of the \nhealth care law.\n  Specifically, our bill offers States the chance to opt out of the \nlaw's individual mandate, to opt out of the law's employer mandate and \npenalties, to opt out of the Medicaid expansion, and to opt out of the \ninsurance benefit mandates.\n  Why should the Federal Government, why should Washington, force the \nStates to adopt a one-size-fits-all health care plan? States can decide \nwhat works best for them. They need to be able to act on those \ndecisions. They do not need Washington to tell them what to do.\n  Well, some of the most innovative health care policy ideas truly do \noriginate at the State and local levels. Governors, State legislators, \nState insurance commissioners, each have much greater insight into what \nworks for their citizens and what does not. States are feeling trapped \nby the new health care law's mandates.\n  My bill, the one along with Senator Graham, gives the States the \nsovereignty to pursue their own reform ideas and approaches. Each State \ndeserves the right--let me repeat that:\n\n[[Page S1103]]\n\neach State deserves the right--to pursue health care reforms they think \nactually help the citizens of their State.\n  The States have always been the laboratories of democracy, the \nlaboratories to test good ideas. Unfortunately, this health care law \nlocks them into a one-size-fits-all approach. The States want their \nfreedom. The States deserve their freedom. Our bill gives it to them, \noffering the flexibility needed to generate better health care reform \nsolutions, solutions that do not require the States to follow a \nWashington plan that may ultimately leave them broke.\n  In writing the State Health Care Choice Act, I started with the \nassumption that people generally can be trusted to do the right thing, \nand society prospers when government has less to say about how people \nrun their lives. Others, many in this body, start by assuming \nWashington knows best and should take more authority over everyone \nelse.\n  Well, the States, the American people are telling us they want health \ncare reform. But they are telling us loudly and clearly that they do \nnot want this health care law. So it is time to give the States the \nautonomy to create health care systems that work best for them, and we \ndo not have to dismantle the Nation's current health care system, build \nit up in the image of big government, shift costs to the States, add \nbillions to our national debt, and then try to sell it as reform.\n  There are better ideas, and I have put forward mine. I ask all \nSenators to join me in cosponsoring the State Health Care Choice Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n            Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, we have all watched in awe during the past \nweeks as the unquenchable desire for liberty and human dignity has \ninspired the people of the Middle East to lift themselves from \noppression and move their country toward a new dawn.\n  Sadly, we now also watch in horror the brutality of Colonel Qadhafi, \nwho murders his own people as he clings to power. I join President \nObama in calling for Colonel Qadhafi to leave Libya immediately and \nsupport our efforts, in concert with the international community, to \nhelp the Libyan people.\n  What happens next? No one knows. I certainly do not have the answer. \nI pray that peace and stability comes quickly to Libya and hope the \npeople of Egypt and Tunisia make a swift and concrete progress in \nestablishing democratic institutions and the rule of law.\n  While each country in the region must find its own path in this \njourney, I would suggest the international community currently has a \nprocess in place that can serve as a way forward for the countries in \nthe Middle East and North Africa in establishing a more democratic \nprocess, that guarantees free elections and free speech.\n  I am referring to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in \nEurope, the OSCE. The OSCE traces its origins to the signing of the \nHelsinki Accords in 1975, and for more than 35 years has helped bridge \nthe chasm between Eastern and Western Europe and Central Asia, by \nensuring both military security for member countries and the \ninalienable human rights of its citizens.\n  There are three baskets in OSCE. One basket deals with human rights \nbecause it is critically important that the countries respect the \nrights of their citizens. Another basket deals with security because \nyou cannot have human rights unless you have a secured country that \nprotects the security of its people. The third basket deals with \neconomics and environment because you cannot have a secure country and \nyou cannot have human rights unless there is economic opportunity for \nyour citizens and you respect the environment in which we live. The \nthree baskets are brought together.\n  In the United States, the Congress passed the U.S. Helsinki \nCommission that monitors and encourages compliance by the member states \nin the OSCE.\n  I am privileged to serve as the Senate chairman of the U.S. Helsinki \nCommission, and I represent our Commission on most, on these issues. \nToday Egypt and Tunisia, along with Algeria, Israel, Jordan, and \nMorocco, are active Mediterranean partners within the OSCE and have \nmade a commitment to work toward the principles of the organization.\n  In 1975, the Helsinki Final Act recognized that security in Europe is \nclosely linked with security in the Mediterranean and created this \nspecial partnership between the signatory states and the countries in \nthe Mediterranean as a way to improve relations and work toward peace \nin the region. Libya was an original partner in this endeavor but, \nregrettably--and, in my view, to its detriment--ultimately, turned its \nback on the organization.\n  More recently, the U.S. Helsinki Commission has made the \nMediterranean partnership a priority on our agenda. Parliamentary \nassembly meetings have taken place in which all of the member states \nwere present, including our partners, and we have had sidebar events to \nencourage the strengthening of the relationship between our \nMediterranean partners for more cooperation to deal with human rights \nissues, to deal with free and fair elections, to deal with their \neconomic and environmental needs, including trade among the \nMediterranean partners and, yes, to deal with security issues to make \nsure the countries and the people who live there are safe.\n  A Helsinki-like process for the Middle East could provide a pathway \nfor establishing human rights, peace, and stability in Egypt, Tunisia, \nand other countries in the Middle East. As a member of the Helsinki \nCommission since 1993, I have discussed the possibility of a Helsinki-\nlike process for the region with Middle Eastern leaders, a process that \ncould result in a more open, democratic society with a free press and \nfair elections. The Helsinki process, now embodied in the Organization \nfor Security and Cooperation in Europe, bases relations between \ncountries on the core principles of security, cooperation, and respect \nfor human rights. These principles are implemented by procedures that \nestablish equality among all the member states through a consensus-\nbased decisionmaking process, open dialog, regular review of \ncommitments, and engagement with civil society.\n  We have seen the Helsinki process work before in a region that has \ngone through generations without personal freedom or human rights. \nCountries that had been repressed under the totalitarian regime of the \nSoviet Union are now global leaders in democracy, human rights, and \nfreedom. One need only look as far as the thriving Baltic countries to \nsee what the Middle East could aspire to. Lithuania now chairs both the \nOSCE and the Community of Democracies. Estonia has just joined the \nUnified European common currency, and Latvia has shown a commitment to \nshared values as a strong new member of the NATO alliance.\n  Enshrined among the Helskini Accord's 10 guiding principles is a \ncommitment to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, including \nfree speech and peaceful assembly. The Helsinki process is committed to \nthe full participation of civil society. These aspects of the Helsinki \nprocess--political dialog and public participation--are critical in the \nMiddle East, and we have watched these principles in action today in \nEgypt and Tunisia.\n  The principles contained in the Helsinki Accords have proven their \nworth over three decades. These principles take on increasing \nimportance as the people of the Middle East demand accountability from \ntheir leaders. Whether the countries of the region choose to create \ntheir own conference for security and cooperation or, as some have \nsuggested, the current OSCE Mediterranean partners and their neighbors \nseek full membership in the OSCE, I believe such an endeavor could \noffer a path for governments in the region to establish human rights, \nestablish a free press, and institute fair elections.\n  Finally, as the citizens of both Tunisia and Egypt demand more \nfreedom, I urge both countries to permit domestic and international \nobservers to participate in any electoral process. The OSCE and its \nparliamentary assembly have extensive experience in assessing and \nmonitoring elections and could serve as an impartial observer as both \ncountries work to meet the demands of openness and freedom of their \ncitizens.\n\n[[Page S1104]]\n\n  The election monitoring which takes place within the OSCE states is a \ncommon occurrence. During our midterm elections, there were OSCE \nobservers in the United States. So they are present in most of the OSCE \nstates because we find this a helpful way to make sure we are doing \neverything we can to have an open and fair election system. Free and \nfair elections are critical, but they must be built upon the \nstrengthening of democratic institutions and the rule of law. I believe \nthe principles contained in the Helsinki Accords have a proven track \nrecord and could help guide this process.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 133\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to get back to the underlying patent \nlegislation to talk on a particular amendment. I am talking about the \nAmerica Invents Act, legislation that would modernize our patent laws, \nlegislation which I believe will have very strong support as soon as we \nare able to bring our debate to a close and have a vote.\n  There is one amendment that would be very troublesome if adopted. It \nis offered by my friend from California, Senator Feinstein. It would \nstrike the bill's first-to-file provisions. This would not be a good \nidea. In fact, it would be a very bad idea. I wish to describe why.\n  First-to-file, which is just a concept, the filing date of the patent \ndates to the time one files it, is not new. The question is whether we \nwould codify that. It has been a subject of debate now for about 20 \nyears. But at this point it has been thoroughly explored by hearings \nbefore the House and Senate Judiciary Committees. We considered this at \nthe outset of the drafting of our patent reform legislation, and it has \nbeen in every version of the bill since 2005.\n  Importantly, this provision we have in the bill that would be taken \nout by the Feinstein amendment is supported by all three of the major \npatent law organizations that represent all industries across the \nboard. It has the support of the American Bar Association's \nIntellectual Property Law section. It is supported by Intellectual \nProperty Owners, which is a trade group or association of companies \nwhich own patents and cuts across all industrial sectors. And, very \nimportantly, our language also has the support of independent \ninventors, many of whom have signed letters to the Senate in support of \nthe codification of the first-to-file rule embedded in the Leahy bill.\n  The bottom line is there is a strong consensus to finally codify what \nis the practice everywhere else in the world; namely, that patents are \ndated by when they were filed, which obviously makes sense.\n  Let me respond to a couple arguments raised in favor of the Feinstein \namendment. One argument is that the current first-to-invent system is \nbetter for the little guy, the small independent inventor. It turns out \nthat is actually not only not true but the opposite is the case.\n  Under the first-to-invent system, if the big company tries to claim \nthe same innovation that a small innovator made, that innovator would \nprevail if he could prove that he actually invented first, even if he \nfiled last. But to prove he invented first, the independent inventor \nwould need to prevail in what is called an interference proceeding. \nThese are proceedings before the Patent and Trade Office in which there \nis a determination by the PTO of who actually invented first. The PTO \nlooks at all the parties' notebooks and other documents to determine \nissues such as conception of the idea and reduction to practice, the \nelements of a workable patent.\n  Yesterday I quoted from commentary published on Sunday, February 27, \nby Mr. Gene Quinn, a patent lawyer who writes for the IP Watchdog Web \nsite. I quoted his commentary noting that only one independent inventor \nhas actually prevailed in an interference proceeding in the last 7 \nyears. In other words, if the idea is that we need to preserve \nsomething that is used by small inventors, by independent inventors, it \njust isn't the case that first-to-invent actually does that.\n  In his column, Mr. Quinn does a very good job of explaining why the \ninterference proceeding is largely an illusory remedy for small or \nindependent inventors. I will quote from what he said:\n\n       [T]he independent inventors and small entities, those \n     typically viewed as benefiting from the current first to \n     invent system, realistically could never benefit from such a \n     system. To prevail as the first to invent and second to file, \n     you must prevail in an Interference proceeding, and according \n     to 2005 data from the AIPLA, the average cost through an \n     interference is over $600,000. So let's not kid ourselves, \n     the first to invent system cannot be used by independent \n     inventors in any real, logical or intellectually honest way, \n     as supported by the reality of the numbers above. . . . \n     [F]irst to invent is largely a ``feel good'' approach to \n     patents where the underdog at least has a chance, if they \n     happen to have $600,000 in disposable income to invest on the \n     crap-shoot that is an Interference proceeding.\n\n  Obviously, the parties that are likely to take advantage of a system \nthat costs more than $\\1/2\\ million to utilize are not likely to be \nsmall and independent inventors. Indeed, it is typically major \ncorporations that invoke and prevail in interference proceedings. The \nvery cost of the proceeding alone effectively ensures that it is these \nlarger parties that can benefit from this system. In many cases, small \ninventors such as startups and universities simply cannot afford to \nparticipate in an interference, and they surrender their rights once a \nwell-funded party starts such a proceeding.\n  I think that first argument is unassailable. Since only one small \ninventor in the last 7 years has prevailed in such a proceeding, it \ndoesn't seem it is something that favors the small or independent \ninventor.\n  Mr. Quinn's article also responded to critics who allege that the \npresent bill eliminates the grace period for patent applications. The \ngrace period is the 1-year period prior to filing when the inventor may \ndisclose his invention without giving up his right to patent. Mr. Quinn \nquotes the very language of the bill and draws the obvious conclusion:\n\n       Regardless of the disinformation that is widespread, the \n     currently proposed S. 23 does, in fact, have a grace period. \n     The grace period would be quite different than what we have \n     now and would not extend to all third party activities, but \n     many of the horror stories say that if someone learns of your \n     invention from you and beats you to the Patent Office, they \n     will get the patent. That is simply flat wrong.\n\n  He, of course, is referring to the bill's proposed section 102(b). \nUnder paragraph (1)(A) of that section, disclosures made by the \ninventor or someone who got the information from the inventor less than \none year before the application is filed do not count as prior art. \nUnder paragraph (1)(B), during the 1-year period before the application \nis filed, if the inventor publicly discloses his invention, no \nsubsequently disclosed prior art, regardless of whether it is derived \nfrom the inventor, can count as prior art and invalidate the patent.\n  This effectively creates a first-to-publish rule that protects those \ninventors who choose to disclose their invention. An inventor who \npublishes his invention or discloses it at a trade show or academic \nconference, for example, or otherwise makes it publicly available has \nan absolute right to priority if he files an application within 1 year \nof his disclosure. No application effectively filed after his \ndisclosure and no prior art disclosed after his disclosure can defeat \nhis application for the patent.\n  These rules are highly protective of inventors, especially those who \nshare their inventions with the interested public but still file a \npatent application within 1 year.\n  These rules are also clear, objective, and transparent. That is what \nwe are trying to achieve with this legislation, so that there is \nuniformity, clarity, and it is much easier to defend what one has done. \nIn effect, the rules under the legislation create unambiguous \nguidelines for inventors. A return to the proposal of Senator Feinstein \nwould create the ambiguity we are trying to get away from.\n  The bottom line is, an inventor who wishes to keep his invention \nsecret must file an application promptly before another person \ndiscloses the invention to the public or files a patent for it. An \ninventor can also share his invention with others. If his activities \nmake the invention publicly available, he must file an application \nwithin a year, but his disclosure also prevents any subsequently \ndisclosed prior art from taking away his right to patent.\n\n[[Page S1105]]\n\n  The bill's proposed section 102 also creates clear guidelines for \nthose who practice in a technology. To figure out if a patent is valid \nagainst prior art, all a manufacturer needs to do is look at the \npatent's filing date and figure out whether the inventor publicly \ndisclosed the invention. If prior art disclosed the invention to the \npublic before the filing date, or if the inventor disclosed the \ninvention within a year of filing but the prior art predates that \ndisclosure, then the invention is invalid. If not, then the patent is \nvalid against a prior art challenge.\n  Some critics of the first-to-file system also argue that it will be \nexpensive for inventors because they will be forced to rush to file a \ncompleted application rather than being able to rely on their invention \ndate and take their time to complete an application. But these critics \nignore the possibility of filing a provisional application which \nrequires only a written description of the invention and how to make \nit.\n  Once a provisional application is filed, the inventor has a year to \nfile the completed application. Currently, filing a provisional \napplication only costs $220 for a large entity and $110 for a small \nentity.\n  So this is easily accomplished and quite affordable.\n  In fact, one of Mr. Quinn's earlier columns, on November 7, 2009, \neffectively rebuts the notion that relying on invention dates offers \ninventors any substantial advantage over simply filing a provisional \napplication. Here is what he says:\n\n       If you rely on first to invent and are operating at all \n     responsibly you are keeping an invention notebook that will \n     meet evidentiary burdens if and when it is necessary to \n     demonstrate conception prior to the conception of the party \n     who was first to file . . .\n       [Y]our invention notebook or invention record will detail, \n     describe, identify and date conception so that others skilled \n     in the art will be able to look at the notebook/record and \n     understand what you did, what you knew, and come to believe \n     that you did in fact appreciate what you had. If you have \n     this, you have provable conception. If you have provable and \n     identifiable conception, you also have a disclosure that \n     informs and supports the invention. . . . [And] [i]f the \n     notebook provably demonstrates conception, then it can be \n     filed as a provisional patent application. . . .\n\n  In other words, what you would ordinarily have in any event can be \nused as the provisional application.\n  In other words, the showing that an inventor must make in a \nprovisional application is effectively the same showing that he would \nhave to make to prove his invention date under the first-to-invent \nsystem. A small inventor operating under the first-to-invent rules \nalready must keep independently validated notebooks that show when he \nconceived of his invention. Under first-to-file rules, the only \nadditional steps the same inventor must take are writing down the same \nthings his notebooks are supposed to prove, filing that writing with \nthe Patent Office, and paying a $110 fee.\n  Once the possibility of filing a provisional application is \nconsidered, along with the bill's enhanced grace period, it should be \nclear that the first-to-file system will not be at all onerous for \nsmall inventors. Once one considers the bill's clean, clear rules for \nprior art and priority dates, its elimination of subjective elements in \npatent law, its new proceeding to correct patents, and its elimination \nof current patent-forfeiture pitfalls that trap legally unweary \ninventors, it is clear this bill will benefit inventors both large and \nsmall.\n  So because this issue has been considered from the inception of the \ndebate about the legislation, in all of the testimony and markups in \nevery version of the bill since 2005, is supported by all the industry \ngroups who believe patent reform is necessary, conforms to the rules of \nall other countries in the world, and provides clear and easily \ndemonstrable evidence of your patent, we believe the first-to-file rule \nis the best rule--date it from the date you filed your patent rather \nthan this rather confusing notion of first-to-invent, which has not \nworked especially well, and certainly has not worked well for the small \ninventor, which is the point, I gather, of the amendment proposed by \nSenator Feinstein.\n  I urge my colleagues, if there are questions or confusion about this, \nthose of us who have been involved in this will be happy to try to \nanswer them. I will be happy to be on the Senate floor to discuss it \nfurther. But at such time as we have a vote, I hope my colleagues would \ngo along with what the committee did and what all of the versions of \nthe bill have written in the past and support the bill as written and \nnot approve this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona for \nhis very strong comments and also for his support for this important \nbill. As you know, this has come through the Judiciary Committee. \nSenator Kyl is a member of that committee, as I am, as well. We \nappreciate Senator Leahy's leadership on this bill, as well as all the \nother Senators who have worked so hard on a difficult bill where there \nare so many interests. But in the end, what guided us to get this \nAmerica Invents Act on this floor was the fact that innovation is so \nimportant to our economy, that the protection of ideas in America is \nwhat built our economy over the years. So I want to thank Senator Kyl.\n  Before we hear from Senator Bingaman, who is here on another matter, \nI just want to support Senator Kyl's statements about the need to \ntransition to the first-inventor-to-file system. As I noted before, we \nhave heard from many small inventors and entrepreneurs who support this \ntransition. Independent inventor Louis Foreman has said the first-to-\nfile system will strengthen the current system for entrepreneurs and \nsmall businesses. We have heard from nearly 50 small inventors in more \nthan 20 States who share Mr. Foreman's view.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a list of those supporters, as well as \nMr. Foreman's letter to the Judiciary Committee in support of the \nAmerica Invents Act, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       The following independent inventors posted support for S. \n     23 on EdisonNation.com:\n       Krissie Shields, Palm Coast, Florida 32164; Sarkis \n     Derbedrosian, Glendale, CA 91206; Frank White, Randleman, \n     North Carolina; Ken Joyner, Pasadena, CA 91109; Charlie \n     Lumsden, Kula, HI 96790; Timothy J.

Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman,\n     Hon. Chuck Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, \n         Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley: First, \n     please accept my congratulations on the overwhelming, \n     bipartisan Judiciary Committee vote on compromise patent \n     reform legislation. I strongly urge you to continue your \n     efforts toward comprehensive reform by pushing for a vote on \n     the Senate floor at the first available opportunity.\n       Your bill will make independent inventors, such as myself, \n     more competitive in today's global marketplace. America's \n     economic future rests on our ability to innovate new \n     technologies that change the way people work, live and play. \n     Yet, as you know, today's patent system hinders this process, \n     rather than cultivating entrepreneurship and the new ideas \n     needed to create more jobs and foster economic growth.\n       As executive producer of the Emmy Award-winning series, \n     ``Everyday Edisons,'' and\n\n[[Page S1106]]\n\n     publisher of Inventors Digest, a long-standing publication \n     serving the independent-inventor community, I am continually \n     in contact with individuals across the country dedicating \n     their lives in search of the next big idea. Some of these \n     efforts bear fruit, while others falter. However, what \n     ensures the continuity of their efforts, are the legal \n     protections afforded under U.S. patent law.\n       I started my first business as a sophomore in college and \n     twenty years later, I can point to 8 successful start-ups, \n     along with being an integral part of twenty additional \n     ventures. As a result, I have registered ten U.S. patents and \n     my firm has helped develop and file another 400 patents. \n     These experiences have shaped my views on how the current \n     system functions at a practical level for those attempting to \n     translate their inventions into a profitable business \n     endeavor. Let me begin by commending the USPTO for its \n     tireless efforts to make the current system work in an \n     efficient manner. Unfortunately, the USPTO is hampered by a \n     system that is in dire need of reform.\n       From my perspective, the Judiciary Committee-passed bill \n     helps independent inventors across the country by \n     strengthening the current system for entrepreneurs and small \n     businesses by including the following:\n       Lower fees for micro-entities;\n       Shorter times for patent prosecution creating a more \n     predictable system;\n       First-Inventor-to-File protections to harmonize U.S. law \n     with our competitors abroad while providing independent \n     inventors with certainty;\n       Stronger patent quality and reliability by incorporating \n     ``best practices'' into patent application examination and \n     review, making it easier for independent inventors to attract \n     start-up capital; and\n       Resources for the USPTO to reduce the current patent \n     backlog of 700,000 patents.\n       Your efforts in the Committee represent a critical \n     milestone for passage of comprehensive reform and highlight \n     an opportunity for progress. I also hope that Committee \n     action paves the way for vigorous bicameral discussions on \n     enacting legislation in the near future.\n       We cannot afford to wait. The need for these types of \n     common sense reforms dates back to 1966 when the President's \n     Commission to the Patent System issued thirty-five \n     recommendations to improve the system. Some of these measures \n     have been enacted over the years, but the economic challenges \n     inherent in today's global market necessitate a broader \n     modernization of the patent system. The 2004 National \n     Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences report \n     echoed this sentiment pointing to how economic and legal \n     changes were putting new strains on the system.\n       America's economic strength has always rested on our \n     ability to innovate. While a number of positive economic \n     indicators provide hope for the future, the environment for \n     small businesses remains mixed. Patent modernization is a \n     tangible way to help America's small entrepreneurs in a \n     fledgling economy. Not only will these reforms help create \n     new jobs and industries, but they will help ensure our \n     economic leadership for years to come.\n       Please do not hesitate to contact me if I can be of any \n     assistance in helping expedite passage of this critical \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Louis J. Foreman,\n                                          Chief Executive Officer.\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I know Senator Bingaman is here to \nspeak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I appreciate the chance to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n\n\n                           World Oil Supplies\n\n  Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to discuss the increasing \noil prices that we are observing each day and the evolving situation in \nthe Middle East and North Africa.\n  From an oil market perspective, the turmoil in the Middle East \nchanged course just over a week ago, and it changed course when Libya \njoined the group of countries that are witnessing historic popular \nuprisings. Libya is the first major energy exporter in the region to \nexperience such an uprising.\n  At the moment, as much as 1 million barrels per day of Libya's total \n1.8 million barrels per day of oil production is offline, with \ncontinued political turbulence threatening to take even more oil \noffline before order is restored.\n  It appears that international oil companies, which are responsible \nfor over 40 percent of Libyan oil production, have removed their \npersonnel from the country, and that has led to shutdowns of most \nfields operated by those international companies.\n  For the moment, it appears that the Libyan national oil companies \nthemselves are mostly continuing to produce and export oil, although \nthere might be some limited production losses in national oil company \nproduction as well.\n  There is reason to be concerned that the situation in Libya and \nthroughout the region could become worse before it improves. I do not \nknow that it is useful to try to predict the most likely outcome for \nwhat is occurring in the country, but the reality is that many of the \npotential scenarios that have been thought of are not good for the \nstability of world oil flows.\n  Fortunately, Saudi Arabia is widely believed to have enough spare oil \nproduction capacity to offset any losses in Libyan oil production. The \nSaudis have already publicly committed to compensating for any Libyan \nshortfall and very likely have already ramped up production to make \ngood on that promise.\n  However, the additional Saudi crude oil will not be of the same \nquality as the lost Libyan barrels of oil, which are light sweet crude. \nAbout three-quarters of Libyan exports go to Western Europe, and the \nrefineries in Western Europe generally cannot manage the heavier and \nsour crudes that come out of the Persian Gulf region. There will be \nsome crude oil dislocation, as higher quality crudes are rerouted to \nEurope, and incremental Saudi barrels of oil head for refineries that \nare able to handle the lower grade oil they produce.\n  Between the lost production in Libya, the crude oil dislocation \nassociated with additional Saudi production, and the prospect of \nfurther turmoil in the region, we are now unquestionably facing a \nphysical oil supply disruption that is at risk of getting worse before \nit gets better.\n  For this reason, I believe it would be appropriate for the President \nto be ready to consider a release of oil from our Strategic Petroleum \nReserve if the situation in Libya deteriorates further. Any additional \noil market disturbance--such as turmoil spreading from Libya to \nAlgeria, or from Bahrain to Saudi Arabia--would clearly put us into a \nsituation where there would be a very strong argument in favor of a \nsale from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n  While I do not think high oil prices alone are sufficient \njustification for tapping the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, I do believe \nthe announcement of a Strategic Petroleum Reserve sale would help to \nmoderate escalating prices.\n  My recommendation that we stand ready to release oil from the SPR is \nsquarely in the traditional policy we have had in our government for \nSPR use, going back to the Reagan administration in the 1980s. In \ntestimony before the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources on \nJanuary 30, 1984, President Reagan's Secretary of Energy Donald Hodel \nstated that the administration's SPR policy in the event of an oil \nsupply disruption was to ``go for an early and immediate drawdown.'' \nThe SPR would be used to send a signal, a strong signal, to oil markets \nthat the United States would not allow a physical oil shortage to \ndevelop.\n  The SPR policy carried out during the 1990-1991 Desert Storm \noperation offers an example of this ``early and in large volumes'' \npolicy in action.\n  On January 16, 1991, President George H.W. Bush announced that the \nallied military attack against Iraq had begun. Simultaneously, he \nannounced that the United States would begin releasing SPR stocks as \npart of an international effort to minimize world oil market \ndisruptions. Less than 12 hours after President Bush's authorization, \nthe Department of Energy released an SPR crude oil sales notice, and on \nJanuary 28, 1991, 26 companies submitted offers.\n  Then-Secretary of Energy Watkins noted:\n\n       We have sent an important message to the American people \n     that their $20 billion investment in an emergency supply of \n     crude oil has produced a system that can respond rapidly and \n     effectively to the threat of an energy disruption.\n\n  According to an analysis posted on the Department of Energy's Web \nsite during the George W. Bush administration:\n\n       The rapid decision to release crude oil from government-\n     controlled stocks in the United States and other OECD \n     countries helped calm the global oil market, and prices began \n     to moderate. . . . World oil markets remained remarkably calm \n     throughout most of the war, due largely to the swift release \n     of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve oil.\n\n  In recent years, the policy signals surrounding SPR use have not been \nas clear. Some SPR sales were criticized as efforts to manipulate oil \nprices. The SPR was then ignored during other oil supply disruptions--\nincluding simultaneous oil supply disruptions due to a\n\n[[Page S1107]]\n\nstrike in Venezuela, political turmoil in Nigeria, and the initiation \nof the current war in Iraq.\n  I believe the Reagan administration set the correct course for SPR \ndecisionmaking. The current administration would be well served in \nconsidering that example and should be ready, in my view, to make a \ndecision to calm world oil markets should the threat to world oil \nsupplies increase in the coming days and weeks.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Grassley pertaining to the introduction of S. 454 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 115\n\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, I am on the floor to speak again in support \nof amendment No. 115, which I propose in connection with the patent \nreform bill, a bill I support and a bill I intend to vote for and a \nbill that is going to be used as a vehicle for this amendment that \ncalls for the sense of the Senate on support for the need of a balanced \nbudget amendment. I am grateful to have the support of my good friend, \nthe former Governor of West Virginia, now the junior Senator from West \nVirginia, Joe Manchin, who is cosponsoring this amendment with me.\n  Here is what it does. It calls on us as Senators to come forward and \nvote on whether we think we should amend the Constitution and submit \nthat to the States for ratification to restrict our power to engage in \nperpetual deficit spending.\n  We, as Members of Congress, are authorized, pursuant to article I, \nsection 8, clause 2 to incur debt in the name of the United States. \nThis power has been abused over time to such a degree that we are now \nalmost $15 trillion in debt. By the end of the decade, we will have \namassed annual interest payments that will be approaching $1 trillion. \nThis threatens every government program under the Sun. Whether you most \nwant to protect Social Security or national defense or any other \ngovernment program, you should be concerned about this practice that \nwill threaten the livelihood of so many Americans who depend on these \nprograms one way or another, whether it is to fund their day-to-day \nexistence or fund programs that provide for our safety and security as \na nation.\n  We do have an increased reason to be optimistic about this for a few \nreasons. First, we have recent polling data showing Americans \noverwhelmingly support the idea of a balanced budget amendment. \nSecondly, a recent GAO report shows we could find at least $100 billion \nannually in wasteful government spending. This is the type of wasteful \nWashington spending we ought to have eliminated a long time ago, that \nwe could eliminate and would be forced to eliminate if we, in fact, had \na balanced budget amendment.\n  It would also require us to address issues that will confront our \nchildren and grandchildren. As a proud and happy father of three, I can \ntell you, as difficult as the choices we will have to make may be, I am \nunwilling, as a father, to pass these problems on to my children and my \ngrandchildren who are yet unborn. I am unwilling to pass along to them \na system that mortgages the future of coming generations for the simple \npurpose of perpetuating government largess and wasteful Washington \nspending.\n  All this amendment does is call on Members of the Senate to come \nforward and say they support the idea. By voting in favor of this \namendment, they do not have to embrace any particular balanced budget \namendment proposal. But what they do say is that they want the wasteful \nWashington spending to stop, they want the perpetual deficit spending \npractice to stop, and they want us to stop the practice of mortgaging \nthe future of coming generations. This is immoral, it is unwise, and it \nought to be illegal. Soon it will be. With this amendment, we will set \nin motion a sequence of events that will lead to just that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I rise this afternoon to express my very \nstrong support for Senator Lee's amendment and the underlying \nconstitutional amendment I hope this body will take up at some point \nsoon. I commend Senator Lee for his leadership on this issue, for \noffering this amendment now.\n  I feel a tremendous sense of urgency. I do not think we have time to \nwaste, time to wait, time to kick this can down the road anymore. We \nhave done that too long.\n  The fact is, a balanced budget amendment to our Constitution would \nprovide the kind of fiscal straitjacket this government clearly needs. \nIf we operated the way many States did, if we operated the way all \nbusinesses did, if we operated the way families did and we lived within \nour means, then maybe this would not be necessary. But it has become \nobvious to anybody that we are not living within our means--not even \nclose.\n  We are running a budget deficit this year of $1.6 trillion. That is \n10 percent of the size of our entire economy--just this year alone. \nLast year, it was $1.5 trillion. If we do not do something very serious \nabout this now--not soon, not in the next few years but now--if we do \nnot do something about this now, this is already at unsustainable \nlevels.\n  In 1988, the total debt as a percentage of our economy was about 40 \npercent. In 2008, the total debt as a percentage of our economy was \nabout 40 percent. Today it is at about 63 percent, and by October it \nwill be 72 percent. These numbers are staggering, and they are not \nsustainable. It is already costing us jobs because this huge level of \ndebt and the ever-increasing debt from the ongoing deficits raise real \ndoubts in the minds of investors and entrepreneurs and small business \nowners what kind of financial future is in store for us. The threat of \nserious inflation, high interest rates, even a financial disruption \ngrows dramatically as we keep piling on this debt. This is not just \nspeculation or theory. We have seen this with other countries that have \ngone down this road.\n  The good news is it is not quite too late; we can do this; we can get \nour spending under control. And I am absolutely convinced we can have \ntremendous prosperity and a tremendously robust recovery and the job \ncreation we need if we follow some basic fundamental principles that \nhave always led to prosperity wherever they have been tried.\n  There are several--I will not go through all of them--but one of the \nfundamental ones is a government that lives within its means. I would \ndefine ``means'' as keeping a budget that is balanced. This amendment \ntoday, of course, only expresses the will of the Senate that we ought \nto do this. I strongly hope all our colleagues will join Senator Lee in \nthis very constructive amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I know personally the extraordinary \nefforts made by the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee to bring \nthis patent reform bill to the floor. I have worked with him in the \npast, and it has not been an easy task. I know that many times he felt \nhe was close to having the right bill at the right moment, and then it \nslipped away. But his determination and his capacity to bring people \ntogether has resulted in this moment where the bill is before us. And \nit\n\n[[Page S1108]]\n\nis important that it is, not just because of his hard work but because \nof what it means for this country.\n  I don't know whether it has formally been done, but this bill is \nbeing recharacterized as the America Invents Act instead of the Patent \nReform Act because those few words tell a much bigger story. We are \ntalking about the kind of innovation and research in America that will \ncreate successful companies and good American jobs, and that is why \nthis bill is important.\n  It has been a long time--going back to our origins as a nation--since \nwe recognized the right for those who invent things to have some \nproprietary personal interest in those inventions, and we set up the \nPatent and Trademark Office for that purpose. Unfortunately, that \noffice of the Federal Government isn't keeping pace with the creativity \nof our country, and that is why Senator Leahy has brought this bill to \nthe floor.\n  This is bipartisan legislation. I commend him for his work on it, and \nI commend my Republican colleagues for joining him. Senators Grassley, \nKyl, Sessions, and Hatch have also worked diligently on this.\n  This may not be the simplest area of the law. I can remember that \nwhen I was in law school here in town, there was one student--he was \nthe only African-American student in my class, and that goes back to \nthe days of Georgetown Law, Senator Leahy, when there were few \nminorities and few women. He was African American. He wore a white \nshirt and tie to class every day.\n  I went up to him one day and said: So tell me your background.\n  He said: Well, I am an engineer, and I want to be a patent lawyer.\n  And I quickly moved to another table because I realized there wasn't \nanything we could talk about. I knew nothing about his world. But it is \na specialized world, and one in which I am sure he was very successful. \nPatent law is something that is very hard to explain, and I think that \nis part of the reason this bill has taken some time to come here.\n  But economic growth is driven by innovation, and if you have a good \nidea for a new product in America, you can get a patent and turn that \nidea into a business. Millions of good American jobs are created this \nway. The list is endless.\n  Patents have been the source of great American stories. Joseph \nGlidden, a farmer from DeKalb, IL, patented barbed wire fence in 1874. \nIt dramatically changed the way ranchers and cattlemen and others were \nable to do their business as they settled the frontier in America. I \nmight add that the DeKalb High School nickname is ``The Barbs'' as a \nconsequence of this one discovery. Glidden's invention made him a \nwealthy man, but his legacy included granting the land for what became \nNorthern Illinois University in DeKalb. Ives McGaffey of Chicago \ninvented and patented one of the first vacuum cleaners in 1869. \nJosephine Cochran of Shelbyville, IL, once said, ``If nobody else is \ngoing to invent a dishwashing machine, I'll do it myself.'' In 1886, \nshe did it and got a patent for it. The company she created is now \nknown as Whirlpool.\n  Our patent laws set the rules of the road for American innovation. By \ngiving inventors exclusive rights over their inventions for a term of \n20 years, patents provide great incentive for investment. Patents \nenable inventions to be shared with the public so new innovations can \nbe based upon them.\n  It has been a long time since we have looked at our patent laws and \nreally updated them. Just think about this, putting it into \nperspective. It has been over 50 years. And I commend Senator Leahy for \ntackling this. It has not been easy. The pace and volume of innovation \nhas quickened a great deal since we looked at this law over 50 years \nago, and the Patent and Trademark Office has struggled to keep up.\n  Over the last few years, Congress has debated how best to modernize \nour patent law. It has been a tough issue. We have one set of patent \nlaws governing the incredibly diverse range of inventions and \nindustries. In trying to update our laws, we have to be careful not to \nmake changes that benefit some industries but undermine innovation in \nothers. The bill before us strikes the right balance. That is why I \nvoted for it in Committee and support it. It is a product of years of \nbipartisan negotiation. It is a good compromise. It is consensus \nlegislation passed out of the Judiciary Committee a few weeks ago with \na unanimous 15-to-0 vote.\n  The bill is supported by the Obama administration and his Cabinet \nofficers and a broad and diverse group of stakeholders, all the way \nfrom the American Bar Association, to the AFL-CIO, to the Biotechnology \nIndustry Organization. The list is very long.\n  In my own home State, I went to the major manufacturing companies and \nsaid: You look at it because these inventions are your future. You have \nto be confident that what we do to the law is consistent with new \ninventions, new innovations, and new jobs not just at your company but \nat other places.\n  I am happy to say that those supporting it include the Illinois Tool \nWorks, Caterpillar--the largest manufacturer in my State--Motorola, \nMonsanto, Abbott, IBM, and PepsiCo.\n  The bill will improve the ability of the Patent and Trademark Office \nto award high-quality patents. Right now, there is a backlog of over \n700,000 patent applications, which they are struggling to clear. Think \nabout that--700,000 inventions and ideas that are waiting to be legally \nrecognized so that they can go forward in production. This bill will \nstreamline the operations and adjust the user fees to make sure the \nagency clears the backlog.\n  The bill takes steps to improve submission of information to the PTO \nabout pending patent applications. I would note that it keeps user fees \nlow for small startups and individual investors.\n  In past years, there were some parts of the bill that generated \ncontroversy, including provisions relating to damages and venue in \npatent infringement lawsuits. The good efforts in this bill that have \nbeen negotiated have resulted in these provisions no longer being a \nsubject of controversy.\n  I know we will have some amendments offered on the bill, and I expect \nwe will have a good debate on them. At the end of the day, I expect we \nwill have a strong bipartisan vote in passing this bill. Senator Leahy \nis now trying to get this train into the station. There are a lot of \npeople bringing cars here who want to hook on because they know this is \nan important bill and likely to pass.\n  There are some areas, I might add, which we did not discuss in \ncommittee and which I considered raising in an amendment on the floor \nbut held back. One of them relates to the controversial issue of gene \npatenting, which I have been learning about recently. It is my \nconsidered opinion this is now working its way through the courts and \nto try to intervene on the floor here would be premature. The courts \nhave to decide whether people can patent genes.\n  There was a recent story I saw on ``60 Minutes'' where a company \nknown as Myriad had patented the gene for breast cancer. They have now \ncreated a test, incidentally, to determine whether a woman has this \ngene. The test is in the range of $4,000 to $5,000. The actual cost of \nthe test should be much lower, and the obvious question the courts are \ndeciding is, How can you claim ownership of a gene that occurs in \nnature in human bodies you didn't create? That is the question before \nthe courts. We could have debated it here for a long time and maybe \nnever resolved it, but depending on how the courts come out on the \nissue, we may visit it again.\n  I hope the House will take this bill up quickly. I know they want to \nlook it over from their perspective, but we need to pass this. If we \nare talking about creating jobs in successful, thriving businesses in \nAmerica, this bill needs to pass.\n  I thank Chairman Leahy for his leadership and for his hard work on \nthis issue. I am honored to serve with him on the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the distinguished senior Senator from Illinois, \nwho has been an invaluable member of the Judiciary Committee all the \ntime I have been there. This has been very helpful. I appreciate what \nhe said. I found interesting the list of patents from his home State of \nIllinois, and I think each one of us can point to some of those with \npride. If we are going to stay competitive with the rest of the world, \nwe have to get this bill passed.\n\n[[Page S1109]]\n\nIt has been more than 60 years since we updated our patent law. We are \nway behind the rest of the world. We have to be able to compete, so I \nthank the Senator.\n\n\n           Further Modification to Amendment 121, as Modified\n\n  Madam President, I have cleared this with the Senator from Iowa. \nNotwithstanding the adoption of the Leahy-Grassley amendment No. 121, \nas modified, I ask unanimous consent the amendment be modified further \nwith the changes that are at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The further modification is as follows:\n       On page 3 of the amendment, delete lines 8 through 17.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, we are down to very few things. I hate to \nput in another quorum call and then hear from Senators calling they \nwant some time to speak about amendments. I know sometimes we follow \nthe ``Dracula'' rule, being that we do not legislate until it is dark \nand Dracula comes out. Maybe, since the days are getting longer, we \ncould do some things during daytime hours. I send out a call, a \npleading call: If people want their amendments, come forward, let's \nhave a vote up or down on them and be done with it.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 115\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I rise in strong support of the Lee \namendment, which is a sense of the Senate that this body and the House \nshould pass a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget. \nClearly, I think in the mind of every American, our top domestic \nchallenge is to get hold of our fiscal situation to move us to a \nsustainable path, to tighten the belt of the Federal Government just \nlike every American family has been doing for many years in this \nrecession.\n  We are making a start, a real but modest start, in terms of this \nyear's budget. I was happy the Senate followed the lead of the House \nand passed a 2-week CR today that has substantial cuts, the exact level \nof cuts as the House passed for the rest of the fiscal year. I support \nthat important start in terms of this year's budget. Of course, we need \nto finish the job by passing a spending bill for the entire rest of the \nfiscal year with that level of cuts or more.\n  That is a start, but it is only a start. The other thing I think we \nneed to do is create reform, a structure that demands that Congress \nstay on that path to a balanced budget until we get there. I believe \nthe most important thing we can create to demand that is a straitjacket \nfor Congress, if you will, a balanced budget constitutional amendment. \nUnfortunately, I think Congress, time and time again over years and \ndecades, has proved we need to put Congress in that straitjacket if we \nare ever going to get to a sustainable fiscal situation, a balanced \nbudget.\n  This is not some academic debate. This is about the future of our \nkids, our grandkids, and our immediate future because we could be put \ninto economic chaos at any time because of our untenable fiscal \nsituation. Forty cents of every $1 the Federal Government is spending \nis borrowed money--so much of that money borrowed from the Chinese. \nThis is about whether we are going to remain the most free, most \nprosperous country in human history. This is about if we are going to \nremain our own masters or if we are going to have to look to the folks \nwho are lending us all this money, including the Chinese, for consent \nin terms of how we map our future.\n  Is that the future we want to hand to our kids? It is certainly not \nthe future I want to hand to my kids. That is what it is all about. \nAgain, it is not far off in the distance. This is an immediate \nchallenge.\n  This could lead to an immediate economic crisis unless we get \nourselves on the path to a balanced budget quickly. Again, step 1 is \ncuts this year, a budget that is going back to 2008 levels, \nprestimulus, pre-Obama budget, this year. That is step 1.\n  But step 2 is some sort of important structural reform such as a \nbalanced budget constitutional amendment that puts a straitjacket on \nCongress, that demands that we get there in a reasonable period of \ntime.\n  The huge majority of States operate under exactly this type of \nconstitutional amendment. The huge majority of municipalities, towns, \ncities, other jurisdictions, operate under this sort of constraint. It \nis hard sometimes. It demands tough choices. In times such as these, in \na recession, it demands real cuts.\n  But guess what. Just like a family does sitting around their kitchen \ntable making their family budget fit reality, States do that, cities do \nthat, towns do that, and Congress should have to do that for the \nFederal Government. Congress should have to tighten its belt, like \nfamilies do reacting to their budget reality sitting around the kitchen \ntable.\n  I think it is perfectly clear we are not going to get there, unless \nand until we are made to through some sort of mechanism such as the \nbalanced budget constitutional amendment.\n  Even beyond the deadline imposed by the expiration of the current or \nany other CR spending bill, we have another looming deadline, which is, \nwhenever the United States Federal Government hits up on the current \ndebt ceiling. That is going to happen sometime between late March and \nMay is the projection.\n  I firmly believe it would be enormously irresponsible to address that \nissue until and unless we put ourselves on this road to reform, until \nand unless we pass something like a meaningful balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment. So this sense of the Senate is meant as a \nfirst step. I applaud Senator Lee for putting it before us as that \nfirst step. Let's say yes. Let's say we are going to do it.\n  Then, of course, most important, let's do it. Let's do it now. The \nclock is ticking. Let's do it now, well before we reach any crisis \npoint such as coming up on the debt limit I spoke about.\n  Let's act responsibly, which means acting now. Let's take up the \nNation's important business, which is spending and debt. Let's avoid \nthe economic calamity that is threatened if we stay on the current \npath, which is completely, utterly unsustainable. It is not just me \nsaying that, it is everybody knowing it, including Ben Bernanke, \nChairman of the Federal Reserve Board. He testified before us at the \nBanking Committee yesterday and said exactly the same thing.\n  Ben Bernanke is not some ideologue. He is not some tea party \nconservative. But he said yesterday, very clearly, three important \nthings. First of all, the greatest medium and long-term challenge we \nface as a country is our fiscal posture. Secondly, the fiscal path we \nare on is completely and utterly unsustainable. Third, while that is a \nlong-term challenge, it poses short-term, immediate consequences.\n  If we do not get on a sustainable path now, immediately in the short \nterm, we could have immediate short-term consequences, even economic \ncrisis. Let's avoid that. Let's do right by our children. Let's tighten \nour belt, as American families have been for several years in this \nrecession, and let's demand that we keep on that path with a balanced \nbudget constitutional amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse.) The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent that an article written for The \nHill by the distinguished Secretary of Commerce Gary Locke, dated March \n2 of this year, be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is interesting, I do not want to \nembarrass the person whom I wanted to speak about at all, but I was \ninterested in listening to my dear friend, Senator Durbin, speak about \nhis time at Georgetown Law School. Both he and I graduated from the \nGeorgetown Law School. He talked about a classmate of his who was in \npatent law, and he realized this was a complex subject, one that is not \nthe sort of law that he, Senator Durbin, was going to go into, any more \nthan I would have.\n\n[[Page S1110]]\n\n  But I also think of another graduate of Georgetown Law Center who was \nan engineer, had a degree in engineering, studied patent law, and \nbecame one of the most distinguished patent lawyers, litigators in this \ncountry, and is now a member of the Federal circuit court of appeals \nand that is Judge Richard Linn.\n  It was interesting hearing the Senator from Illinois, himself one of \nthe finest lawyers in this body. My wife Marcella and I had the honor \nof being out in Chicago with Judge Linn and his wife Patty for a \nmeeting of the Richard Linn American Inn of Court in Chicago. He serves \nwith great distinction. In fact, a major part of this legislation \nreflects an opinion he wrote.\n  But I digress. I ask unanimous consent the Senate resume \nconsideration of the Lee amendment No. 115, with the time until 5:15 \nequally divided between the two leaders or their designees; that upon \nthe use or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to vote in \nrelation to the Lee amendment No. 115; that the Lee amendment be \nsubject to a 60-vote threshold; that upon disposition of the Lee \namendment, the Senate resume consideration of the Menendez amendment \nNo. 124; that Senator Menendez be recognized to modify his amendment \nwith the changes at the desk and the amendment, as modified, be agreed \nto; that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate; and there be no amendments \nin order to the amendments prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the superb staff for writing that out because I am \nnot quite sure I could have done that on my own.\n  I had hoped as we began debate on this important bill to modernize \nAmerica's patent system that the Senate would focus specifically on \nthis measure designed to help create jobs, energize the economy and \nencourage innovation.\n  I had hoped that we would consider relevant amendments, and pass the \nbill. The America Invents Act is a key part of any jobs agenda. We can \nhelp unleash innovation and promote American invention, all without \nadding a penny to the deficit.\n  This is commonsense, bipartisan legislation. I said at the outset \nthat I hoped the Senate would come together to pass this needed \nlegislation and do so in the finest tradition of the Senate. I thank \nthe Republican manager of the bill and the assistant Republican leader \nfor their support and efforts on this bill.\n  Unfortunately, we have become bogged down with nongermane, \nnonrelevant, extraneous discussions and amendments.\n  Earlier this week, Senators who were focused on our legislative \neffort and responsibilities joined in tabling an amendment that has \nnothing to do with the subject matter of the America Invents Act.\n  Extraneous amendments that have nothing to do with the important \nissues of reforming our out-of-date patent system so that American \ninnovators can win the global competition for the future have no place \non this important bill. They should not be slowing its consideration \nand passage.\n  If America is to win the global economic competition, we need the \nimprovements in our patent system that this bill can bring.\n  We must now dispose of another such amendment so that we may proceed \nto final passage of the America Invents Act and help inventors, \nAmerican businesses and our economic recovery.\n  I take proposals to amend the Constitution of the United States \nseriously. I take seriously my oath as a Senator to support and defend \nthe Constitution and to bear true faith and allegiance to it.\n  Over the years I have become more and more skeptical of recent \nefforts to amend the design that established the fundamental liberties \nand protections for all Americans. I believe the Founders did a pretty \ngood job designing our fundamental charter.\n  I likewise take seriously the standard set in article V of the \nConstitution that the Congress propose amendments only when a \nsupermajority of the Congress deem it ``necessary.'' While there have \nbeen hundreds of constitutional amendments proposed during my service \nin the Senate, and a number voted upon during the last 20 years, I have \nbeen steadfast in my defense of the Constitution.\n  The matter of a so-called balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution is not new to the Senate. Indeed, I believe the first \nmatter Senator Hatch moved through the Judiciary Committee when he \nchaired it and I served as the ranking member was his proposed \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget.\n  I strongly opposed it, but I cooperated with him in his effort to \nhave the committee consider it promptly and vote.\n  I wish others would show the managers of this bill that courtesy and \ncooperation and not seek to use this bill as a vehicle for messages on \nother matters.\n  The Judiciary Committee has considered so-called balanced budget \namendments to the Constitution at least nine times over the last 20 \nyears. The Senate has been called upon to debate those amendments \nseveral times, as well, in 1982, 1986, 1992, 1994, 1995 and 1997. \nDespite the persistent and extraordinary efforts of the senior Senator \nfrom Utah, they have not been adopted by the Congress.\n  The only time the Senate agreed to the proposed constitutional \namendment was in 1982. On that occasion, the House of Representatives \nthought the better of it. On the subsequent five occasions, as Senators \ncame to understand how the proposed amendment undercut the \nConstitution, it was defeated.\n  Now another Senator has adopted this cause.\n  He has proposed a different, even more complicated proposed \nconstitutional amendment. That will require study in order to be \nunderstood. It will require working with the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Human \nRights.\n  While the new Senator from Utah is a member of the Judiciary \nCommittee and a member of the Constitution subcommittee, he has not \nconsulted with me about his proposal, nor, as far as I know, with the \nchairman of the subcommittee, the senior Senator from Illinois.\n  Instead, he preemptively seeks to raise the matter on this important \nbill, which is designed to create jobs, encourage American innovation \nand strengthen our economy.\n  For the last 20 years, the so-called balanced budget amendment has \nbeen a favorite slogan for some. For some others of us, we have done \nthe hard work to actually produce a balanced budget and, indeed, a \nsurplus.\n  Rather than defile the Constitution, we have worked and voted to \ncreate a balanced budget and a budget surplus. In 1993, without a \nsingle Republican vote to help us, Democrats in the Congress passed a \nbudget that led to a balanced budget and, indeed, to a budget surplus \nof billions of dollars by the end of the Clinton administration.\n  That surplus was squandered by the next administration on tax breaks \nfor the wealthy and an unnecessary war that cost trillions but went \nunpaid for. Those misjudgments were compounded by financial fraud and \ngreed that led to the worst economic recession since the Great \nDepression. That is what we have been seeking to dig out from under \nsince 2008.\n  At this time, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \nletter received from American Federation of State, County and Municipal \nEmployees, AFSCME, in opposition to the Lee amendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                       AFSCME,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 2, 2011.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the 1.6 million members of the \n     American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, \n     I am writing to urge you to oppose Senator Lee's amendment to \n     S. 23, providing that it is the sense of the Senate that \n     Congress should pass and the states should agree to an \n     amendment to the Constitution requiring a Federal balanced \n     budget.\n       A constitutional balanced budget amendment is a simplistic \n     answer to a complicated issue and would serve only to further \n     weaken our economy and move us away from fiscal \n     responsibility at a time of much economic uncertainty. It \n     would require large, indiscriminate spending cuts during \n     economic downturns, precisely the opposite of what is needed \n     to stabilize the economy and avert recessions.\n\n[[Page S1111]]\n\n       The immediate result of a balanced budget amendment would \n     be devastating cuts in education, homeland security, public \n     safety, health care and research, transportation and other \n     vital services. Any cuts made to accommodate a mandated \n     balanced budget would fall most heavily on domestic \n     discretionary programs, but ultimately, there would be no way \n     to achieve a balanced budget without cuts in Social Security \n     and other entitlement programs as well. A balanced budget \n     amendment would likely disproportionately affect unemployed \n     and low-income Americans.\n       There are also serious concerns about the implementation of \n     such an amendment and how it would involve the courts in \n     matters more appropriately resolved by the legislative and \n     executive branches of government. Budgetary decisions should \n     be made by officials elected by the people, not by unelected \n     court officials with no economic or budget expertise.\n       I urge you to oppose the Lee amendment and to oppose any \n     effort to adopt an amendment to the Constitution requiring a \n     balanced budget.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Charles M. Loveless,\n                                          Director of Legislation.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. We have stabilized the economic freefall and begun to \nrevive the economy.\n  Everyone knows that economic growth is the path toward budget \nbalance. Economic growth and winning the future through American \ninnovation is what the bipartisan American Invents Act is all about.\n  Accordingly, for all these reasons as well as the reasons for which I \nopposed the efforts to amend the Constitution in 1982, 1986, 1992, \n1994, 1995 and 1997, I oppose amendment No. 115.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                     [From the Hill, Mar. 2, 2011]\n\n          Delivering Innovation and Jobs Through Patent Reform\n\n                  (By Commerce Secretary, Gary Locke)\n\n       Today, there are more than 700,000 unexamined patent \n     applications log-jammed at the U.S. Patent and Trademark \n     Office (USPTO).Many of them represent inventions that will \n     come to market and launch new businesses and create new, \n     high-paying jobs.\n       But without a patent, securing the funds needed to get a \n     business or innovation off the ground is nearly impossible, \n     for both small and large inventors alike.\n       Patent reform legislation the Senate is considering this \n     week can change that.\n       And it can build on the progress USPTO Director David \n     Kappos has already made in reducing the time it takes to \n     process the average patent--currently nearly 3 years.\n       New programs have been introduced to fast-track promising \n     technologies, reforms have been made to help examiners more \n     quickly process applications, and the Patent Office recently \n     announced a plan to give inventors more control over when \n     their patent is examined.\n       The result? The backlog of patents is decreasing for the \n     first time in years, even as new applications have actually \n     increased 7 percent.\n       But if the USPTO is to speed the movement of job-creating \n     ideas to the marketplace, it will take more than internal, \n     administrative reforms alone. That's where the patent reform \n     legislation comes in.\n       Here's what it promises to do: First, it allows the USPTO \n     to set its own fees--a major part of ensuring that the agency \n     has reliable funding. This will enable the USPTO to hire more \n     examiners and bring its IT system into the 21st century so it \n     can process applications more quickly and produce better \n     patents that are less likely to be subject to a court \n     challenge.\n       Second, it decreases the likelihood of expensive litigation \n     because it creates a less costly, in-house administrative \n     alternative to review patent validity claims.\n       Also, the pending legislation would add certainty to court \n     damages awards, helping to avoid excessive awards in minor \n     infringement cases, a phenomenon that essentially serves as a \n     tax on innovation and an impediment to business development.\n       Finally, patent reform adopts the ``first-inventor-to-\n     file'' standard as opposed to the current ``first-to-invent'' \n     standard. First inventor to file is used by the rest of the \n     world, and would be good for U.S. businesses, providing a \n     more transparent and cost-effective process that puts them on \n     a level playing field with their competitors around the \n     world.\n       There is some concern among some small, independent \n     inventors, who feel like the current system is better for \n     them, but it's our strong opinion that the opposite is true.\n       Here's why: The cost of proving that one was first to \n     invent is prohibitive and requires detailed and complex \n     documentation of the invention process. In cases where \n     there's a dispute about who the actual inventor is, it \n     typically costs at least $400,000 in legal fees, and even \n     more if the case is appealed. By comparison, establishing a \n     filing date through a provisional application and \n     establishing priority of invention costs just $110. The \n     125,000 provisional applications currently filed each year \n     prove that early filing dates protect the rights of small \n     inventors.\n       In the past seven years, of almost 3 million applications \n     filed, only 2 patents were granted to small entities that \n     were the second inventor to file but were able to prove they \n     were first to invent. Of those 25, only one patent was \n     granted to an individual inventor who was the second to file. \n     Thus, in the last seven years, only one independent inventor \n     in nearly 3 million patent filings would have gotten a \n     different outcome under the ``first-inventor-to-file'' \n     system.\n       Many proposals in this legislation have been debated for a \n     decade, but we now have core provisions with broad support \n     that will undoubtedly add more certainty around the validity \n     of patents; enable greater work sharing between the USPTO and \n     other countries; and help the agency continue with \n     operational changes needed to accelerate innovation, support \n     entrepreneurship and business development, and drive job \n     creation and economic prosperity.\n       And thanks to the leadership of Senate and House Judiciary \n     Committee Chairmen, Patrick Leahy1 and Lamar Smith, getting \n     this bipartisan jobs legislation passed is a top priority.\n       There's a clear case for it. As President Obama said in his \n     State of the Union address, ``The first step in winning the \n     future is encouraging American innovation.''\n       Reforming our patent system is a critical part of that \n     first step.\n       Speeding the transformation of an idea into a market-making \n     product will drive the jobs and industries of the future and \n     strengthen America's economic competitiveness.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, all time has now \nexpired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the Lee amendment No. 115.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, even though I oppose this amendment and \nwould simply allow it to go for a voice vote because the proponent of \nthe amendment is not even on the floor, I will, to protect his right \nand notwithstanding his not following the normal policy, ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, pursuant to the previous order, I ask \nthat my amendment be modified with the changes that are at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

PRIORITY EXAMINATION FOR TECHNOLOGIES IMPORTANT TO \n                   AMERICAN COMPETITIVENESS.\n\n       Section 2(b)(2) of title 35, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) in subparagraph (E), by striking ``; and'' and \n     inserting a semicolon;\n       (2) in subparagraph (F), by striking the semicolon and \n     inserting ``; and''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(G) may, subject to any conditions prescribed by the \n     Director and at the request of the patent applicant, provide \n     for prioritization of examination of applications for \n     products, processes, or technologies that are important to \n     the national economy or national competitiveness without \n     recovering the aggregate extra cost of providing such \n     prioritization, notwithstanding section 41 or any other \n     provision of law;''.\n\n     SEC. 19. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, this modified amendment, cosponsored by \nSenator Bennet, would allow the Patent Office Director to prioritize \npatents that are important to the national economy or national \ncompetitiveness. The amendment will ensure that patents that are vital \nto our national interests do not languish in any backlog at the Patent \nOffice and that they ultimately promote the national economy and \nnational competitiveness.\n  My understanding is that by previous agreement the amendment, as \nmodified, is agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. Under the previous order, the \namendment, as modified, is agreed to.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Without objection, the motions to reconsider on the two previous \namendments are laid upon the table.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to explain my vote against the \nmanagers' amendment to S. 23, the America Invents Act.\n  I agree wholeheartedly with the chairman of the Judiciary Committee \nthat we must enable our inventors to out innovate and produce the \nproducts and jobs of the future.\n  However, a provision in the managers' amendment would take the Patent \nand Trademark Office, PTO, off-budget. I cannot support this provision \nfor three reasons.\n  First, the provision is unnecessary. Proponents argue that it will \nprevent the diversion of PTO's fees. However, since fiscal year 2005, \nthe Appropriations Committee has rejected the practice of diverting PTO \nfees for other purposes and instead has consistently recommended that \nPTO retain every dollar it collects from inventors. In fact, the \nAppropriations Committee has on several occasions approved bills to \nallow PTO to spend up to $100 million in excess of PTO's appropriation \nif fee revenue is higher than the appropriations level.\n  Second, the amendment would reduce oversight. Rather than being \nsubject to the annual appropriations process, this agency--with a \nbudget of more than $2 billion--would be on autopilot. The underlying \nbill seeks to reduce the backlog of pending patent applications. \nCurrently, it takes PTO nearly 3 years to process a patent application. \nThe backlog of applications stands at over 700,000. Some progress has \nbeen made in this area, thanks to the annual oversight provided in \nappropriations bills which has succeeded in forcing management reforms \nthat have slowed the growth of PTO's backlog.\n  The amendment requires PTO to submit annual budget requests and \nspending plans to Congress. However, this approach eliminates the \nrequirement for an annual legislative vehicle to closely examine and \napprove expenditures of taxpayer dollars and fee revenue. Instead the \namendment would restrict accountability for an agency that struggles to \nkeep up. While our inventors are standing in line for patents, their \nideas can be stolen to fuel another country's economy. I am very \nencouraged by Director Kappos' new leadership at PTO, but much more \nprogress and greater management oversight are still necessary to give \nAmerican inventors the protections they deserve.\n  Finally, the amendment may hamper PTO operations in the future. PTO \nhas adequate fee revenue now, but that has not always been the case. As \nrecently as fiscal year 2009, PTO experienced a revenue shortfall due \nto lower than expected fee collections. To keep PTO's operations whole \nand to help tackle the patent backlog, we gave PTO a direct \nappropriation to bridge their financial gap when fees weren't enough. \nIn fact, PTO fee collections have fallen short of appropriations levels \nby more than $250 million since fiscal year 2005. Unfortunately, should \nsuch a gap occur in future years, the Appropriations Committee would \nnot be poised to step in if PTO's fee collections are not adequate to \ncover operations.\n  Again, I applaud the Judiciary Committee, under Chairman Leahy's \nleadership, for pushing PTO to continue its progress as part of our \nNation's innovation engine. Unfortunately, this amendment will only \nsend PTO drifting on autopilot with little congressional \naccountability.\n\n\n                           Amendment no. 133\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I support Senator Feinstein's amendment to \nrestore the grace period under current law and eliminate the so-called \nfirst-inventor-to-file provisions of the legislation. This is the No. 1 \noutstanding issue of concern my constituents have raised with me, \nparticularly small and independent inventors. It is a technical and \ncomplex issue, one about which experts in patent law have strong \ndisagreements. But I think the bill would be much better without these \nprovisions.\n  For shorthand, a lot of people talk about this issue as first-\ninventor-to-file versus ``first-to-invent.'' But, in my view, this \nterminology just confuses the issue. My constituents are most concerned \nabout the loss of the unconditional 1-year grace period under current \nlaw. Both a first-to-invent and a first-inventor-to-file system could \nhave the grace period; there is no inherent inconsistency. I am not \nsure why the two issues have been merged. Frankly, people who talk \nabout priority fights and interferences are completely missing the \npoint. The concerns are all about the grace period.\n  My constituents tell me that the current law grace period is crucial \nto small and independent inventors, for numerous reasons. First, it \ncomports with the reality of the inventive process. An idea goes \nthrough many trials, errors, and iterations before it becomes a patent-\nworthy invention. Small inventors in Nevada tell me that sometimes they \nmay have conceived an idea as an improvement to the apple; and it turns \nout to be a new type of orange. The grace period allows inventors the \ntime to refine their inventions, test them, talk issues through with \nothers, all without worry of losing their rights if these activities \nresult in an accidental disclosure or the development of new ``prior \nart.''\n  Second, the grace period comports with the reality of small entity \nfinancing through friends, family, possible patent licensees, and \nventure capitalists. The grace period allows small inventors to have \nconversations about their invention and to line up funding, before \ngoing to the considerable expense of filing a patent application.\n  In fact, in many ways, the 1-year grace period helps improve patent \nquality--inventors find out which ideas can attract capital, and focus \ntheir efforts on those ideas, dropping along the way other ideas and \ninventions that don't attract similar interest and may not therefore be \ncommercially meaningful.\n  These inventors therefore believe that the effective elimination of \nthe grace period in the law is therefore a serious blow. They tell me \nthat now they will have to try to file many more applications, earlier \nin the process. They tell me that the balm of ``cheap provisionals'' is \nsnake oil, because a provisional still has to meet certain legal \nstandards, meaning that you still have to spend a lot for patent \ncounsel, which is the biggest single expense of filing an application. \nBecause they can't afford to file that many applications, regular or \nprovisional, they will have to give up on some inventions altogether. \nIf that is so, it wouldn't just be bad for them, it would be bad for \nthe creation of innovation in America.\n\n[[Page S1113]]\n\n  They also are concerned that it will be harder to get VC funding \nbecause they will have filed applications on inventions that weren't \nquite the right ones. The added risk about whether they can ensure that \nthe provisional application will be adequate to provide protection to \nthis slightly modified but commercially more meaningful invention will \nbe enough to scare off already difficult to obtain venture capital \nfunding.\n  The legislation doesn't turn a blind eye to these problems. It \nprovides a type of grace period, triggered by inventor disclosures. \nWill this new, significantly more scaled back grace period work? Maybe. \nI don't know. I can tell you that the independent inventors in Nevada \nswear by a code of secrecy and nondisclosure until they are far enough \nalong to get patent protection. It would require a sea change in \nculture to be able to benefit from this very limited inventor's \ndisclosure-triggered grace period.\n  Further, there are legitimate questions about how this new disclosure \nprovision would work--for instance, what happens when an invention that \nis disclosed leads to other, different ideas and disclosures that \nupdate the state of the art before the application has been filed? How \nis an inventor going to be able to prove that changes in an ``ecosystem \nof technology'' were necessarily derived from her disclosure?\n  I would also note that I appreciate that PTO Director Kappos has been \ndoing great work in terms of reaching out to small inventors, trying to \nmake things cheaper and more efficient for them; trying to demystify \nthe PTO for them. If any PTO Director could make this work, I feel \nconfident he is the one who can do it.\n  But, you know what, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Our current \nsystem has helped make America the most innovative country in the \nworld; I will venture to say the most innovative society in world \nhistory. Our innovation system is the envy of the world. We don't need \nto harmonize with them; they are trying to figure out how we do it. \nThis is one area where nothing is broken, and I am very worried about \nunintended consequence, especially when a lot of the folks arguing \nabout this issue are not even talking about the thing that matters--the \ngrace period.\n  Accordingly, I support the Feinstein amendment. And I encourage my \ncolleagues to support it too. I am not making this argument as the \nSenate majority leader, but as the Senator from Nevada--if the current \ngrace period isn't broke, then we absolutely shouldn't fix it with \nsomething that my constituents tell me, with alarm, may make it harder \nfor them to patent their innovations.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nas in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                             Risk Retention\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I come at the end of a long day for all \nof us to talk about a subject that is off the subject from the bill on \nthe floor but is one of tremendous importance to the United States and \nthe recovery of our economy.\n  I want to also point out for the record--and hopefully also for the \nright people--that we are at a critical point in terms of housing in \nAmerica, with Dodd-Frank having been passed and newly promulgated \nrules. It is essential that we don't make the mistakes that led us to \nthe last collapse that caused the tragedy in the housing market in \n2007, 2008, and 2009.\n  In the Dodd-Frank bill, there was an amendment called the qualified \nresidential mortgage, which was offered by Senators Landrieu, Hagan, \nand myself to ensure that the risk retention provisions of Dodd-Frank \nwould not apply to a well-underwritten, well-qualified loan. Risk \nretention, as the Chair remembers, is the 5-percent retention \nrequirement of any lender who made a residential mortgage that was not \nqualified, but they were not specific in their definition of what a \nqualified mortgage would be. So we took the point to take the \nhistorical underwriting standards that have proven to work so well in \nthis country and write them into the Dodd-Frank bill, which were that a \nmortgage that may be exempted from a risk retention would have to have \n20 percent down, and if there was more than 80 percent loan to value, \nthat amount above 80 percent would have to be covered by private \nmortgage insurance. We required third-party verification of bank \ndeposits, third-party verification of employment, third-party \nverification of an individual's ability to make the payments and \nservice the debt, credit records, and all the underwriting standards. \nAs the Chair remembers, what got us into so much trouble from 2000 to \n2007 is that we made subprime loans, used stated income, didn't do debt \nchecks or anything else we should have done. We made bad mortgages.\n  My point is this. There is a committee that has been formed--made up \nof very distinguished Americans--that is promulgating the rules to \ncarry out the intent of Dodd-Frank. That committee includes Sean \nDonovan from HUD; Ben Bernanke; Edward DeMarco, Acting Director of the \nFederal Housing Finance Agency; John Walsh, Acting Comptroller of the \nCurrency; Mary Shapiro, head of the SEC; and Sheila Bair, head of FDIC. \nThat is a very august group. They are in the process of promulgating \nrules to carry out the intent of Dodd-Frank. The rumors coming out of \nthose negotiations--and I say rumors because I cannot verify it because \nI am not there. But I know the articles I have read in the papers in \nthe last couple of days send a troubling signal to me.\n  Just for a few minutes, I wish to make the points that I think are so \ncritical.\n  No. 1, it is my understanding they are considering memorializing 80 \npercent as the maximum amount of loan to value for a loan that would \nfall as a qualified residential mortgage and do not address private \nmortgage insurance for coverage above 80 percent.\n  Without getting technical, what that would mean is the only qualified \nresidential mortgage that could be made and not require risk retention \nwould have to have a minimum of a 20-percent downpayment. In the olden \ndays of standard lending in the eighties, seventies, and sixties, when \nyou borrowed more than 80 percent but not over 95 percent, you had \nprivate mortgage insurance to insure the top 30 percent of the loan \nmade so the investors had the insurance of knowing, if there was a \ndefault, the top portion of that loan, which was the most in terms of \nloan to value, would be insured and would be paid.\n  If it is, in fact, correct that this committee is going to recommend \na qualified residential mortgage require a 20-percent downpayment and \nnot make provisions for PMI, we will be making a serious mistake \nbecause two things will happen. One, very few people will be able to \nget a home loan in the entry-level market or even in the move-up market \nbecause a 20-percent downpayment is significant. Second, by not \nutilizing PMI, we will be turning our back on 50 years of history in \nAmerica, where PMI has been used to satisfactorily insure risk and \ninsure qualified lending.\n  We must remember what happened in terms of the collapse of Freddie \nMac and Fannie Mae. What happened was Congress directed they buy a \ncertain percentage of their portfolio in what were called affordable \nloans, which became subprime securities, which became 13 percent of \ntheir portfolio, which brought them down when subprime securities \ncollapsed. If we all of a sudden, through fiat, decide to pass \nregulations to define a qualified residential mortgage that is so \nprohibitive we run everybody to FHA, which is exempt, then we will be \nputting a burden on FHA that is unsustainable and create a situation of \nanother collapse or another inability of the United States to meet \nhousing needs through the private sector and through well underwritten \nloans.\n  My reason for coming to the floor tonight is, hopefully, to send a \nmessage, before the decisions are made, to be thoughtful in determining \nwhat the parameters will be on a qualified residential mortgage. Yes, I \ndo think an 80-percent or less loan should be qualified and avoid risk \nretention. But a well-paid, well-verified, well-credit-evaluated \nindividual who borrows more than 80 percent but less than 75 should be \nable to do so and be excluded from the risk retention as long as they \nhave private mortgage insurance covering that top 30 percent of the \ndebt created by that loan.\n  If you do that, you protect the equity provisions, you protect the \ninvestor,\n\n[[Page S1114]]\n\nyou make the qualified loan, you do not put the country at risk, but \nmost important of all, you do not force everybody to FHA. That is what \nwe are about to do because FHA is, by definition under Dodd-Frank, \nexempt from risk retention. All other loans are not, except those that \nwill fall under the QRM, qualified residential mortgage. It would be a \ndisaster for the recovery of American housing to force Americans to \nonly one source of money to finance their home and put so much stress \non the Federal Housing Administration that it collapses under the \nburden.\n  We need to be pragmatic when we look at issues facing housing. We \nneed to be practical in taking Dodd-Frank and making it work for the \nAmerican people. We need to recognize the value of private mortgage \ninsurance, the value of good, solid underwriting and not put a risk \nretention in that is so high that we take most American mortgage \nlenders out of the business, isolated only for a few who dictate and \nwrite the parameters they want to write for housing. We are at a \ncritical time in our recovery. Housing has hit the bottom, and it has \nbounced along the bottom, but it is showing some signs of coming back. \nNow would be the worst time to send a signal that mortgage money is \ngoing to be harder to get, the banks are going to have to hold 5 \npercent risk retention on even the best of loans and, worst of all, it \nwould give the American people only one alternative for lending; that \nis, the Federal Housing Administration which, in and of itself, is \nalready under a burden and stressed.\n  I appreciate the time tonight to bring this message to the floor that \nas we write the rules to promulgate the intent of the Dodd-Frank bill \nin terms of residential housing and finance, we be sure we do so in \nsuch a way that we meet the demands of a vibrant marketplace rather \nthan restricting it, putting a burden on FHA, and protracting what has \nalready been a long and difficult housing recession.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to read the letter from COL \nWilliam Barret Travis from the Alamo, something I have done every year \nsince Senator Phil Gramm retired. He read the letter on Texas \nIndependence Day every year after Senator Tower left office. So we have \na tradition every Texas Independence Day of a Texas Senator reading the \nvery moving speech from William Barret Travis.\n  Today is the 175th anniversary of our independence from Mexico.\n  This past Sunday, I had the honor of participating in the Washington-\non-the-Brazos' 175th anniversary celebration of the Texas Declaration \nof Independence signing. It was a special occasion that brought \ntogether almost all the 59 signers' descendants. Thousands of proud \nTexans came to commemorate this most pivotal event in Texas's legacy of \nfreedom and patriotism.\n  My great-great-grandfather, Charles S. Taylor, was willing to sign \nthe document that declared Texas free from Mexico. I am humbled to \noccupy the Senate seat from Texas that was first held by Thomas \nJefferson Rusk, who was another signer of the Texas Declaration of \nIndependence.\n  Those 59 brave men did not just come in and sign a paper. They took \ngreat risk. They put their lives, their treasures, and the lives of \ntheir families on the line to do this. One hundred seventy-five years \nlater, sometimes you do not think of how hard it was for them to \ndeclare this separation from Mexico and know that there was going to be \na war fought over it because the Mexican Army was in San Antonio at the \nAlamo, getting ready to take the Alamo from William Barret Travis and \nthe roughly 180 men who were there who were trying to defend that \nfortress.\n  The accounts of the revolution have been some of our most dramatic \nstories of patriotism in both Texas and America.\n  We remember the sacrifice of William Barret Travis, Davy Crockett, \nJim Bowie, and the others who died bravely defending the Alamo against \nSanta Anna and his thousands of trained Mexican troops.\n  They were outnumbered by more than 10 to 1. For 13 days of glory, the \nAlamo defenders bought critical time for GEN Sam Houston, knowing they \nwould probably never leave the mission alive.\n  The late Senator John Tower started the tradition of reading a \nstirring account by Alamo commander William Barret Travis, and Senator \nGramm and now I have continued that tradition.\n  From within the walls of the Alamo, under siege by Santa Anna's \nMexican Army of 6,000 trained soldiers, Colonel Travis wrote this \nletter to the people of Texas and all Americans:\n\n       Fellow Citizens and Compatriots: I am besieged with a \n     thousand or more of the Mexicans under Santa Anna. I have \n     sustained a continual Bombardment and cannonade for 24 hours \n     and have not lost a man. The enemy has demanded surrender at \n     discretion, otherwise, the garrison is to be put to the \n     sword, if the fort is taken. I have answered the demand with \n     a cannon shot, and our flag still waves proudly over the \n     wall. I shall never surrender our retreat.\n       Then I call on you in the name of Liberty, of patriotism, \n     of everything dear to the American character, to come to our \n     aid with all dispatch. The enemy is receiving reinforcements \n     daily and will no doubt increase to three or four thousand in \n     four or five days. If this call is neglected I am determined \n     to sustain myself as long as possible and die like a soldier \n     who never forgets what is due his honor and that of his \n     country--Victory or Death.\n                     --William Barrett Travis, Lt. Col. Commander.\n\n  Steadfast to the end and independent to the core, that is the essence \nof Texas.\n  Had Colonel Travis and his men not laid down their lives in the \nBattle of the Alamo, Sam Houston's victory at San Jacinto just 2 months \nlater would never have been possible. Texas's freedom might not have \nbeen won.\n  It is important that every generation of Texas pause to remember the \npatriots of the Texas revolution: each soldier who gave his life at the \nAlamo, Goliad, and San Jacinto; the 59 men who met at Washington-on-\nthe-Brazos, putting their lives in danger by signing that Declaration \nof Independence and becoming heroes for a cause; and the bravery of the \nwomen who gave up an easier life in the East to join the struggle to \nmake Texas the marvelous place it is today.\n  My great-great-grandmother was one of those brave women. She took her \nfour children in what was called the Runaway Scrape, trying to flee \neastward from Nacogdoches, where they lived, to try to escape the \nadvancing Mexican Army and the Indian raids that were happening all \nover east Texas.\n  My great-great-grandmother lost all four of her living children \nduring that sad and hard time for Texas. But that was not the last \nchapter in the revolution. She came back to Nacogdoches, met my great-\ngreat-grandfather, who was there signing the Texas Declaration of \nIndependence, and had nine more children.\n  So the women also were heroes and heroines of this time.\n  It is my honor to memorialize the Texas legacy of freedom and \npatriotism in this way.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my speech at the Washington-on-the-\nBrazos celebration this past weekend be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              Washington-on-the-Brazos Celebration Remarks\n\n(Delivered February 27, 2011 at Washington-on-the-Brazos Historic Site)\n\n       Thank you so much. What a great representative Lois \n     Kolkhorst is for this area\n\n[[Page S1115]]\n\n     and so fitting to have someone who loves the history. Thank \n     you, Lois, and thank you for that lovely introduction and \n     thank you for this welcome.\n       I wanted to say especially thank you to the Washington-on-\n     the-Brazos Association and all of the associations that keep \n     our Texas history alive. Thank you from the bottom of our \n     hearts because we are passing it through the generations \n     because of you. Thank you all.\n       You know it is so special that you have honored all of us, \n     the descendants, on the 175th anniversary, because those 59 \n     brave men did not just come in and sign a paper.\n       They took great risk. They put their lives, their \n     treasures, and the lives of their families on the line to do \n     it. And sometimes, 175 years later, sometimes we don't think \n     about the risk that they were willing to take.\n       They were actually elected as delegates by their peers in \n     the little towns throughout Texas because every one of those \n     people wanted to govern themselves.\n       In Texas, independence is not merely a state of being free \n     from tyranny; it is a spirit instilled within us, anchored in \n     our knowledge that we are part of something truly unique.\n       Across the nation, Texans have earned the reputation for \n     being exceptionally proud--a little too much, some people \n     think! But Texans earned it; they earned it 175 years ago, \n     and we have passed it from generation to generation.\n       We are the only state that came in to our nation as a \n     nation, and with that distinction comes a vivid history and a \n     storied past unlike any other.\n       What some interpret as a brazen stubbornness--we know to be \n     a fierce and steadfast will to live in freedom.\n       When that will was tested, Texans rose up and rebelled \n     against oppression.\n       In the time leading up to the Texas Revolution, colonists \n     were living under the centralized power of the Mexican \n     government. Its steel grip on trade, religion, and heavy \n     taxation, conflicted with the yearning for independence that \n     drew the early American settlers to Texas.\n       The accounts of our revolution have become some of the most \n     dramatic stories of patriotism in both Texas and American \n     history.\n       We remember the sacrifice of Colonel William Barret Travis, \n     Davy Crockett, Jim Bowie, and the 189 men who died bravely \n     defending the Alamo against Santa Anna and his thousands of \n     trained Mexican troops.\n       Outnumbered by more than 10 to one, for 13 days of glory, \n     the Alamo defenders bought critical time for General Sam \n     Houston, knowing they would never leave the mission alive.\n       Had they not laid down their lives in that seminal battle, \n     Sam Houston's victory at San Jacinto just two months later \n     would never have been possible. Texas' freedom might not have \n     been won.\n       Those who signed the Texas Declaration of Independence, \n     where we stand today, were akin to those who signed the \n     American Declaration of Independence in 1776. They were the \n     leaders of this area. They risked their lives and those of \n     their family when they put pen to paper.\n       And the 59 Texans who are so ably represented here today \n     were considered traitors to Mexico as they used their voices, \n     their professions, and positions of influence to wage \n     critical battles in the revolution.\n       My great-great-grandfather, Charles Taylor, was one of \n     these patriots whose principles and will to survive were \n     tested.\n       In 1836, he was land commissioner in East Texas, \n     responsible for issuing titles and collecting taxes. He \n     served as alcalde, essentially the mayor, of Nacogdoches \n     Territory.\n       This position of course made him a representative of the \n     government of Mexico, but he was witnessing firsthand the \n     widening rift between Texans and Mexico's emerging autocracy.\n       As the movement for independence from Mexico began to grow, \n     he sided, of course, with Texas in the dispute with the \n     central government over taxation.\n       Secretary of War Thomas Rusk asked Taylor to allow the fees \n     entrusted to him to be used to purchase weapons for the Texas \n     army.\n       He was technically obligated to pass the money to Mexico, \n     so Rusk's request presented him with an ethical dilemma.\n       But Taylor ultimately agreed, believing that the people who \n     paid the taxes wanted and deserved freedom to govern \n     themselves.\n       With this money and every penny they could collect all over \n     Texas from the towns everywhere, they were armed for the \n     battle. But remember they had no money for uniforms, they \n     were not formally trained. What they did have was the will to \n     fight for something greater than themselves.\n       As he prepared his men for the final stand in the fight for \n     freedom at San Jacinto, these were Sam Houston's words, ``We \n     view ourselves on the eve of battle. We are nerved for the \n     contest, and must conquer or perish. It is vain to look for \n     present aid: for it is not there. We must now act or abandon \n     all hope! Rally to the standard, and be no longer the scoff \n     of mercenary tongues! Be men, be free men, that your children \n     may bless their father's name.''\n       After the victory at the battle of San Jacinto and Santa \n     Anna's surrender, Secretary of War Rusk wrote the report. I \n     love these words. His description:\n       ``The sun was sinking in the horizon as the battle \n     commenced; but at the close of the conflict, the sun of \n     liberty and independence rose in Texas, never, it is hoped, \n     to be obscured by the clouds of despotism . . . The unerring \n     aim and irresistible energy of the Texas army could not be \n     withstood. It was freemen fighting against the minions of \n     tyranny and the results proved the inequality of such a \n     contest.''\n       I now want to bring attention to another contingent of \n     brave Texans whose involvement in the revolution was \n     significant, but sometimes overlooked: the women. They \n     struggled to keep their families together, or even alive.\n       One of our state's first historians, Mary Austin Holley, \n     who was the cousin of Stephen F. Austin, chronicled the \n     daring, enterprising nature of Texas' women settlers.\n       She wrote that these hardy women hunted with their husbands \n     and rode long distances on horseback to attend social events \n     with their ball gowns stuffed in their saddlebags.\n       During the Texas Revolution, their vigor and free-\n     spiritedness translated to steadfast courage and unshakeable \n     resolve to survive and protect their families in the face of \n     extreme trial.\n       Thomas Rusk himself wrote, ``The men of Texas deserved much \n     credit, but more was due the women. Armed men facing a foe \n     could not but be brave; but the women, with their little \n     children around them, without means of defense or power to \n     resist, faced danger and death with unflinching courage.''\n       The Runaway Scrape of 1836 swept every family in Central \n     and East Texas. My great-great-grandmother, Anna Maria \n     Taylor, was one of the thousands of refugees fleeing eastward \n     from the Mexican advance and the threat of Indian raids.\n       With her husband, Charles Taylor, attending the convention \n     of delegates right here, Anna Maria, like many of your great-\n     great-grandmothers struggled to escape on foot.\n       Anna Maria fought to feed her four children. Despite \n     widespread food shortages, she did everything she could to \n     shield them from seasonal rains and disease.\n       Tragically, like so many mothers of the time, she lost \n     every one of her four children.\n       But the trials of the revolution were not the final \n     chapters in their lives.\n       After the War of Independence ended, Anna Maria and Charles \n     went right back to Nacogdoches, and she bore nine more \n     children.\n       The families of all of you here today, as descendents, \n     recovered and rebuilt their lives after independence was won, \n     and they started building Texas at the same time.\n       I inherited Thomas Rusk's world atlas dated 1850 which is \n     now in my office reception room in Washington, DC.\n       According to the atlas, in 1850, Texas had just over \n     212,500 people. And we learned just last week that our \n     state's population today is over 25 million.\n       I think the 59 signers of the Declaration of Independence \n     would be awestruck by this staggering figure. Oh, how far \n     we've come!\n       When I finish my term, I will bring Thomas Rusk's world \n     atlas back to its rightful home in Texas, to Stephen F. \n     Austin University, which is built on land he owned. There it \n     will be on display for future generations to see.\n       In order to secure our bright future, we must preserve our \n     rich history.\n       Each year on March 2, I read William Barret Travis' letter \n     from the Alamo, because it is so stirring and so amazingly \n     brave.\n       The late Senator John Tower started the tradition of \n     reading it every single year. Senator Phil Gramm continued \n     it, and I took it when Phil retired.\n       Colonel Travis wrote in that letter, ``I shall never \n     surrender or retreat.'' And displaying the ultimate courage \n     in the face of certain demise, he wrote, ``I am determined to \n     sustain myself as long as possible and die like a soldier who \n     never forgets what is due to his own honor and that of his \n     country--Victory or Death.''\n       Steadfast to the end and independent to the core--that is \n     the essence of Texas.\n       Finally . . . the cliff notes to my speech today are:\n       That we, the descendents of these great 59 men and their \n     wives and all of those who followed, and all of those in \n     these associations who have no descendents but know that \n     Texas is special, it is important that every generation of \n     Texas pause to remember the patriots of the Texas revolution:\n       Each soldier who gave his life at the Alamo, Goliad, and \n     San Jacinto;\n       The 59 men who met at Washington-on-the-Brazos, putting \n     their lives in danger by signing that Declaration of \n     Independence and becoming heroes for a cause;\n       And the bravery of the women who gave up an easier life in \n     the East to join the struggle to make Texas the marvelous \n     place that it is today.\n       It is our challenge to pass their spirit to our children \n     and our grandchildren. This gathering today and the annual \n     celebration that we have of Texas Independence Day do just \n     that.\n       Thank you! And God bless Texas!\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON.

Her tenacious spirit and determination made \nher one of the most inspiring and hardworking people I have ever had \nthe privilege of knowing, and I am honored to have called her my \nfriend.\n  Coming from a successful family with a rich tradition of philanthropy \nand public service, Kate's interest in volunteerism and conservation \nbegan at an early age. Her parents, the late Robert and Margaret \nIreland, were also avid philanthropists and conservationists who taught \nKate to admire and appreciate the beauty of life around her. It was \nthis sense of appreciation that inspired her to hold a lifelong \ndedication to philanthropy of the arts, education, and health care.\n  After graduating from St. Timothy's in Baltimore and attending Vassar \nCollege for a year, Kate realized that she had another calling in life \nto fulfill. So, 20-year-old Kate packed her bags and moved to the \nCommonwealth to volunteer at the Frontier School of Midwifery and \nFamily Nursing, a nursing service to the underserved families of the \nremote regions around the southeastern Kentucky town of Hyden. \nContinuing the work of her grandmother and sister, who also volunteered \nthere, Kate served as a courier by looking after the horses and jeeps \nused by the nurse midwives, tending to the milk cows and pigs that were \nkept by Frontier, and packing supplies for the nurses for their rounds.\n  Even early on, Kate's fearless leadership was recognized by her \nFrontier mentors, as many people looked to her to make sure things got \ndone and done correctly. This ``dogged determination,'' as many who \nknew her described it, is what moved her to volunteer for the position \nof director of volunteers for 14 years. Kate's no-nonsense, \nprofessional demeanor eventually led her to collect numerous other \ntitles, such as chairman of the Development Committee, vice chairman of \nthe board, and ultimately the title of national chairman of the Board \nof Governors in 1975, a position she held for 17 years. Respectfully, \nKate remains the board's honorary chairman.\n  Although Kate was an avid traveler with residences in Georgia, Maine \nand Florida, she remained a guiding force in the Commonwealth for \nadvancements in education and health care for nearly six decades. Kate \nlent her expertise, advice, hard work and financial support to FNS as \nwell as Hyden Citizens Bank, the Kentucky River Area Development \nDistrict in which she was chairman, and Berea College, where she was \nalso chairman and trustee.\n  Kate once said that going to Kentucky had always been in the cards \nfor her. Well, she couldn't have been more right. Because of her \ngenerosity and dedication, countless Kentuckians have benefited from \neducation and training programs that she loyally supported and \nestablished, such as the Community-Based Nurse-Midwifery Education \nProgram, The Mary Breckinridge Chair to support the faculty of \nFrontier, and the Kate Ireland and Kitty Ernst Scholarships which are \nawarded to students annually. She was an upstanding woman who dedicated \nmost of her life to serving others. Her impressive accomplishments and \npleasant manner left a wide-reaching legacy that forever changed her \ncommunity, and there is no doubt that the Commonwealth is poorer for \nher loss. My thoughts go out to her sister, Louise; her dear friend \nAnne Cundle; and many other friends and family. The Leslie County News \nrecently published an article about Kate and the legacy she left \nbehind. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n A Lifetime Supporter of Frontier, Kate Ireland Leaves a Lasting Legacy\n\n       Miss Kate Ireland, a lifelong philanthropist and a guiding \n     force of the Frontier Nursing Service, passed away on Feb. \n     15, 2011, at her home in northern Florida. Miss Ireland \n     devoted her life to public service, and her wide-reaching \n     legacy includes her work on behalf of the Frontier Nursing \n     Service and the Frontier School of Midwifery and Family \n     Nursing in Hyden.\n       Miss Ireland was born in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1930 into a \n     family with a tradition of supporting the vision of Mary \n     Breckinridge. Her grandmother was a donor from the beginning \n     of the City Committees established to support the \n     demonstration of Frontier's nursing service to the \n     underserved families living in the remote regions of \n     Southeastern Kentucky. Her mother was Chairman of the \n     Cleveland Committee. Kate's sister served as a courier in \n     1938.\n       Miss Ireland served as courier during the summers of 1951-\n     1954 and as a part-time courier from 1959-1960. In her role \n     as a courier, Kate looked after the horses and jeeps used by \n     the FNS nurse-midwives. She also tended to milk cows and pigs \n     kept by FNS and packed supplies for the nurses for their \n     rounds. Mrs. Breckinridge recognized Kate as a leader, and \n     many people looked to her to get things done. She volunteered \n     as Director of Volunteers for FNS from 1961-1975. For nearly \n     six decades, Miss Ireland lent her expertise, advice, hard \n     work and financial support to help FNS provide healthcare in \n     Leslie County and educate nurse-midwives and nurse \n     practitioners across the globe. In Miss Ireland's biography \n     by David Treadwell, ``Full Speed Ahead: with a Twinkle in Her \n     Eye,'' Kate says of her calling to Frontier that ``going to \n     Kentucky had always been in the cards for me.''\n       She was well-known in the Leslie County community. Miss \n     Ireland, a prominent member of Cleveland society, felt \n     passionately about her work in Leslie County. Upon returning \n     there in the early '60s, Miss Ireland built a beautiful home \n     called Willow Bend overlooking Hurricane Creek and the Middle \n     Fork. Although a world traveler with residences in Georgia \n     and Maine, while serving the people of Leslie County, Miss \n     Ireland primarily resided at her home in the community of \n     Wendover with her lifelong friend and companion, Anne Cundle, \n     a former FNS nurse-midwife.\n       While living in Kentucky, Miss Ireland became involved in \n     local interests such as the LKLP and Hyden Citizens Bank and \n     served as Chairman of the Kentucky River Area Development \n     District and Trustee and Chairman of Berea College.\n       In 1963, in recognition of her strong leadership skills, \n     Miss Ireland was elected to the FNS Board of Governors and \n     served in various capacities on the Board until her death. \n     She was Chairman of the Development Committee in 1967; Vice \n     Chairman of the Board in 1968; and National Chairman of the \n     Board of Governors in 1975, a post she held until 1992. In \n     1997 she was named National Honorary Chairman.\n       ``She was a great mentor and a very determined and forceful \n     woman who had the gift of convincing others to agree to \n     support her in whatever project she was interested in,'' said \n     Jane Leigh Powell, Chairman of the FNS Board of Governors and \n     a friend of Miss Ireland's for nearly 50 years. ``She \n     maintained her interest in Leslie County after moving to \n     Florida and continued to be a very loyal supporter of the \n     FNS.''\n       One example of Kate Ireland's ability to see the potential \n     for Mary Breckinridge's vision for nursing and midwifery was \n     her support for the creation of the Community-Based Nurse-\n     Midwifery Education Program (CNEP). ``We clearly would not \n     have the successful, distance education programs that we have \n     today without the support of Kate Ireland,'' reports Susan \n     Stone, President and Dean of the Frontier School of Midwifery \n     and Family Nursing.\n       Miss Ireland was better able than many to see that such a \n     program could take the Frontier model of care out to the \n     ``wide neighborhoods'' of mankind, which it is successfully \n     doing as it prepares thousands of nurse-midwives and nurse \n     practitioners to care for families in rural and underserved \n     areas across the United States and abroad. Her support of \n     distance education continued when, with Mary Breckinridge's \n     cousin, Marvin Breckinridge Patterson, she established the \n     first endowed Chair of Midwifery in the United States, The \n     Mary Breckinridge Chair, to support faculty at the Frontier \n     School. For support of students, she established and endowed \n     the Kate Ireland and Kitty Ernst Scholarships to be awarded \n     to students annually. Her footprints on the future of \n     Frontier School continue to make a lasting impact on faculty \n     and students alike.\n       In lieu of flowers, Miss Ireland requested donations be \n     made to one of several named organizations or to a charity of \n     your choice. There are several ways to give to Frontier in \n     honor of Miss Ireland:\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/02/senate-section/article/S1116-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1116-S1117]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     ESSENTIAL AIR SERVICE PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I strongly oppose a provision \nincluded in the FAA Air Transportation Modernization and Safety \nImprovement Act that would eliminate the Essential Air Service Program \nat those airports boarding 10 passengers or less per day. Essential Air \nService, EAS, truly is essential to the communities of Alliance, \nChadron and McCook in my home State of Nebraska being impacted by this \nprovision. In all, there are 40 rural airports in several States across \nthe country which would no longer be a part of the EAS Program if this \nprovision is included in any piece of legislation signed into law.\n  The adoption of this amendment to the FAA bill is bad for Nebraska \nand bad for rural America. The communities and surrounding areas being \nserved by these airports use them as\n\n[[Page S1117]]\n\neconomic development tools and rely on having commercial air service in \norder to stay connected to our Nation's transportation network. The \nmany Nebraskans who have contacted me about this attempt to cut off EAS \nfunding for their rural airports have expressed great concern about how \nlosing EAS support would be devastating to their communities' ability \nto attract employers and create jobs. During a time when our country is \nstarting to see glimpses of economic recovery, cutting off EAS support \nfor these airports is not the answer.\n  As a supporter of the EAS Program and someone who always considers \nthe impact any legislation will have on rural Nebraska, I once again \nexpress my opposition to this provision and will work to see that it is \nnot included in any final legislation authorizing our Nation's aviation \nprograms.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/02/senate-section/article/S1117-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1117]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            PAY PROHIBITION\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I rise to voice my concerns regarding S. \n388, a bill to prohibit Members of Congress and the President from \nreceiving pay during government shutdowns. While I believe it is \nimportant we in Congress lead by example, I am concerned this bill does \nnot go far enough. Every bill that Senate moves this Congress should \nsend a clear message to the American taxpayer that we are serious about \nour Nation's finances, the economic struggles being faced by our fellow \ncitizens across the country, and the future of this great country.\n  If we are going to prohibit pay for Members of Congress and the \nPresident, we must also include members of the President's Cabinet, for \nexample.\n  The bill prohibits retroactive pay for Members of Congress and the \nPresident who would not be paid during a government shutdown. This \nprohibition on retroactive pay should also apply to nonessential \nFederal Government employees who would be furloughed during a \ngovernment shutdown. It is unfair to force hard-working Americans to \npay the salaries of politicians who have failed to do their jobs or \ngovernment employees who did not have to report to work because they \nare nonessential.\n  It is also my opinion that this legislation encourages Members of \nCongress to raise the debt ceiling. Clearly Congress does not need any \nmore incentive to borrow and spend money or raise the debt ceiling. \nSince March of 1996 Congress has raised the debt limit 12 times. In \n1995, the gross Federal debt was $4.92 trillion. Today, the national \ndebt exceeds $14 trillion. We should not be passing legislation \nincentivizing more borrowing and debt. If anything, this bill should \nreduce Members' pay if they increase the debt limit, not the other way \naround.\n  I am also concerned with the timing and need for this bill. Prior to \nthe Presidents Day recess, the House of Representatives passed a bill \nfunding the operations of the Federal Government through the remainder \nof the fiscal year that included over $60 billion in spending \nreductions. Unfortunately, the Senate, which has not passed a single \nappropriations bill for fiscal year 2011, once again failed to act on \nthis bill. And just today, the House passed a 2-week continuing \nresolution that the Senate will pass. It is about time for the Senate \nto do its most basic job--ensuring the continued operations of the \nFederal Government in a fiscally responsible manner.\n  With government spending at unsustainable levels, it is imperative \nthat every Member of Congress make hard choices regarding Federal \nspending and cut waste, fraud, abuse, and duplication at every level of \ngovernment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/02/senate-section/article/S1117-2", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1117]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL SHEPARD\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, today I recognize Michael Shepard \nfor his achievement of being named the National Assistant Principal of \nthe Year for his work at Har-Ber High School in Springdale, AR.\n  In his fourth year as an assistant principal at Har-Ber, Michael is \ncontinuously looking for ways to improve educating students. His \nefforts as the advanced placement coordinator helped secure funding for \nlead AP instructors for math, English and science. Since taking on the \nrole of AP coordinator the number of students taking AP courses has \nmore than doubled and minority participation has increased \ntremendously. Going above and beyond, Michael found funds to expand \nHar-Ber's technological capabilities, allowing students the use of \nlaptops, wireless Internet access, and projection units.\n  Michael is committed to educating our youth and continues improving \nhis skills to help meet the needs of Springdale students. He recently \nearned a licensure endorsement in English as a second language to help \nmeet the needs of the district's 8,000 English language learners.\n  It is the efforts of educators like Michael Shepard that will enable \nour future generations to reach their full potential and I am proud of \nhis commitment to education and his efforts to improve the lives of \nstudents in Arkansas.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Colby \nQualls from Monette, AR, for being selected for participation in the \nannual U.S. Senate Youth Program.\n  Created in 1962, the U.S. Senate Youth Program was organized to \nencourage an understanding of our government with an emphasis of how \nits three branches work and how elected officials work for their \nconstituents and create policies that impact our Nation and the world. \nThe weeklong visit to Washington, DC, allows students to meet and \ninteract with lawmakers, appointed officials and staff who are involved \nin crafting legislation and making decisions that influence our laws.\n  This program brings together some of our Nation's top youth leaders, \nlike Colby, who show a commitment to public service. An outstanding \nstudent at Buffalo Island Central High School, Colby excels both in and \nout of the classroom.\n  He previously served as student council vice president and treasurer, \nin addition to his activities with the Future Business Leaders of \nAmerica as vice president and national convention representative. Colby \nis captain of Quiz Bowl and all-region MVP; he is president of the 4-H \nClub and a member of the Buffalo Island Youth Council and the Arkansas \nTeen Leadership Council. In addition, he participates in many community \nvolunteer activities. Colby plans to attend a top university and \naspires to hold public office one day.\n  Colby is very deserving of this honor.

Mr. President, today I recognize Marshall \nUniversity, which this week celebrates its 50th year as a designated \n``university.'' Founded in 1837, Marshall is the oldest public \ninstitution of higher education in the State of West Virginia. However, \nthe granting of university status to the school formerly known as \nMarshall College did not occur until March 2, 1961.\n  The change from ``college'' to ``university'' was far more than a \nshift in nomenclature. Marshall's greatest champions--including Dr. \nStewart H. Smith, president of Marshall from 1946 to 1968; State \nlegislators and the local community--had to overcome entrenched beliefs \nthat West Virginia did not need another large university.\n  Marshall's supporters made a strong case for the school, which was \ngrowing in enrollment as well as offering many academic programs and \nadvanced degrees. The institution earned ``university status,'' which \nrecognized its role as an advanced institution of higher learning in \nthe state, and all of West Virginia has benefited as a result.\n  Marshall University now educates more than 14,000 students at campus \nlocations in Huntington, Point Pleasant, South Charleston, Beckley, \nLogan and Gilbert, offering degrees at the associate, baccalaureate, \nmaster's and doctoral levels. The school boasts 90,000 proud alumni \naround the world.\n  For every dollar the State of West Virginia invests in Marshall \nUniversity, the school generates more than\n\n[[Page S1118]]\n\n$20 in economic impact, resulting in the generation of $1.5 billion per \nyear in economic impact. This figure has tripled since 2005.\n  Marshall offers 159 majors and 105 degrees through its 12 colleges. \nThe school has earned a national reputation for its research in \nbiotechnology, forensic science, and medicine, and is currently \nlaunching a new School of Pharmacy, which will create good-paying jobs \nand generate an estimated $150 million economic impact. The Robert C. \nByrd Institute for Advanced Flexible Manufacturing is providing \nservices to all 55 State counties and expertise to 5,250 small and \nmedium-sized manufacturers that employ more than 81,000 individuals \nacross West Virginia. Marshall University's medical and health science \nschools and departments train hundreds of West Virginians to serve as \ndoctors, nurses, therapists and health technicians each year.\n  As your U.S. Senator, it is truly my honor to extend my most sincere \ncongratulations to Marshall on its 50th anniversary of becoming a \nuniversity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/02/senate-section/article/S1118-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1118]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/02/senate-section/article/S1118-2", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1118]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/02/senate-section/article/S1118-3", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1118]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY ORIGINALLY DECLARED IN EXECUTIVE \nORDER 13288 ON MARCH 6, 2003, WITH RESPECT TO THE ACTIONS AND POLICIES \n OF CERTAIN MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE AND OTHER PERSONS TO \n    UNDERMINE ZIMBABWE'S DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES OR INSTITUTIONS--PM 6\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent to the \nFederal Register for publication the enclosed notice stating that the \nnational emergency with respect to the actions and policies of certain \nmembers of the Government of Zimbabwe and other persons to undermine \nZimbabwe's democratic processes or institutions is to continue in \neffect beyond March 6, 2011.\n  The crisis constituted by the actions and policies of certain members \nof the Government of Zimbabwe and other persons to undermine Zimbabwe's \ndemocratic processes or institutions has not been resolved. While some \nadvances have been made in Zimbabwe, particularly on economic \nstabilization, since the signing of the power-sharing agreement, the \nabsence of progress on the most fundamental reforms needed to ensure \nrule of law and democratic governance leaves Zimbabweans vulnerable to \nongoing repression and presents a continuing threat to peace and \nsecurity in the region and the foreign policy of the United States. \nPolitically motivated violence and intimidation, and the undermining of \nthe power-sharing agreement by elements of the Zimbabwe African \nNational Union-Patriotic Front party, continue to be of grave concern. \nFor these reasons, I have determined that it is necessary to continue \nthis national emergency and to maintain in force the sanctions to \nrespond to this threat.\n  The United States welcomes the opportunity to modify the targeted \nsanctions regime when blocked persons demonstrate a clear commitment to \nrespect the rule of law, democracy, and human rights. The United States \nhas committed to continue its review of the targeted sanctions list for \nZimbabwe to ensure it remains current and addresses the concerns for \nwhich it was created. We hope that events on the ground will allow us \nto take additional action to recognize progress in Zimbabwe in the \nfuture.

A bill to provide for environmental restoration activities \nand forest management activities in the Lake Tahoe Basin, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the need to \nrestore and protect Lake Tahoe. Lake Tahoe is a national treasure. Her \nalpine beauty has drawn and inspired people for centuries: artists and \npoets, John Muir and Mark Twain, and millions of visitors from around \nthe world.\n  As a girl, I went to Lake Tahoe to ride horses through the woods, \nbike around the magnificent Basin and swim in the clear blue waters.\n  Today, I am proud to work with representatives from different ends of \nthe political spectrum to restore Lake Tahoe to that pristine State. \nFor 14 years, we have come together to Keep Tahoe Blue.\n  That is why today I am reintroducing the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act \nof 2011, which is cosponsored by Senators Harry Reid, John Ensign and \nBarbara Boxer.\n  It would authorize $415 million over 10 years to improve water \nclarity, reduce risk of catastrophic wildfire, and restore the \nenvironment.\n  Specifically, it would provide $248 million over 10 years for the \nhighest priority restoration projects, as established using scientific \ndata. The legislation authorizes at least $72 million for stormwater \nmanagement and watershed restoration projects scientifically determined \nto be the most effective ways to improve water clarity.\n  This bill also requires prioritized ranking of environmental \nrestoration projects and authorizes $136 million for State and local \nagencies to implement these projects.\n\n[[Page S1122]]\n\n  Now, and this is an important point, this legislation would direct \ninvestment to where it is needed most.\n  For example, today we know the major sources of stormwater runoff \nthat send sedimentation into the lake, degrading water clarity.\n  So the monies would go to specific projects addressing California \nstate roads, source of 23 percent of urban particle loads; the city of \nSouth Lake Tahoe, Calif., 22 percent; Washoe County, Nevada, 17 \npercent; and so forth.\n  In this bill, these stormwater projects are targeted to the areas of \ngreatest concern. Priority projects will improve water quality, forest \nhealth, air quality and fish and wildlife habitat around Lake Tahoe. In \naddition, projects that benefit low-income neighborhoods are \nencouraged.\n  The bill authorizes $136 million over 10 years to reduce the threat \nof wildfire around Lake Tahoe. This would finance hazardous fuels \nreduction projects, at $17 million per year, including grants to local \nfire agencies.\n  It provides the Forest Service up to $10 million for fuels projects \nthat have multiple environmental benefits, with an emphasis in \nrestoring Stream Environment Zones.\n  This is critical because, again, these streams feed into the lake and \nform a critical link in the ecosystem. We need to pay attention to \nthese stream zones if we hope to restore water clarity.\n  The bill protects Lake Tahoe from the threat of quagga mussels and \nother invasive aquatic species. Quagga mussels pose a very serious \nthreat to Lake Tahoe, a threat made more intractable because these \nmussels have been shown to survive in cold waters. A few years ago \nUniversity of California scientists reported that they found up to \n3,000 Asian clams per square meter at spots between Zephyr Point and \nElk Point in Lake Tahoe. The spreading Asian clam population could put \nsharp shells and rotting algae on the Lake's beaches and contribute to \nthe spread other invasive species such as quagga mussels.\n  The bill would authorize $20.5 million for watercraft inspections and \nremoval of existing invasive species. It would require all watercraft \nto be inspected and decontaminated.\n  One quagga or zebra mussel can lay 1 million eggs in a year. This \nmeans that a single boat carrying quagga could devastate the lake's \nbiology, local infrastructure, and the local economy.\n  The damage that could be inflicted at Lake Tahoe by a quagga \ninfestation has been estimated at tens of millions of dollars annually. \nThe threat to Lake Tahoe cannot be overstated. There were no quagga \nmussels in Lake Mead 4 years ago. Today there are more than 3 trillion. \nThe infestation is probably irreversible.\n  But there is some good news. Last summer, scientists placed long \nrubber mats across the bottom of Lake Tahoe to cut off the oxygen to \nthe Asian clams. Early research suggests these mats were very effective \nat killing the clams. And scientists have also discovered how to \ndecontaminate boats and kill quagga mussels.\n  We can fight off these invaders. But it will require drive and \nimagination--and the help authorized within this bill.\n  The bill supports reintroduction of the Lahontan Cutthroat Trout. The \nlegislation authorizes $20 million over 10 years for the Lahontan \nCutthroat Trout Recovery Plan. The Lahontan Cutthroat Trout is an \niconic species that has an important legacy in Lake Tahoe.\n  When John C. Fremont first explored the Truckee River in January of \n1844, he called it the Salmon Trout River because he found the Pyramid \nLake Lahontan Cutthroat Trout. The trout relied on the Truckee River \nand its tributaries for their spawning runs in spring, traveling up the \nentire river's length as far as Lake Tahoe and Donner Lake, where they \nused the cool, pristine waters and clean gravel beds to lay their eggs. \nBut dams, pollution and overfishing caused the demise of the Lahontan \nCutthroat Trout.\n  Lake Tahoe is one of 11 historic lakes where Lahontan Cutthroat Trout \nflourished in the past, and it's a critical part of the strategy to \nrecover the species.\n  The bills funds scientific research. The legislation authorizes $30 \nmillion over 10 years for scientific programs and research which will \nproduce information on long-term trends in the Basin and inform the \nmost cost-effective projects.\n  The bill prohibiting mining operations in the Tahoe Basin. The \nlegislation would prohibit new mining operations in the Basin, ensuring \nthat the fragile watershed, and Lake Tahoe's water clarity, are not \nthreatened by pollution from mining operations.\n  The bill increases accountability and oversight. Every project funded \nby this legislation will have monitoring and assessment to determine \nthe most cost-effective projects and best management practices for \nfuture projects.\n  The legislation also requires the Chair of the Federal Partnership to \nwork with the Forest Service, Environmental Protection Agency, Fish and \nWildlife Service and regional and state agencies, to prepare an annual \nreport to Congress detailing the status of all projects undertaken, \nincluding project scope, budget and justification and overall \nexpenditures and accomplishments.\n  This will ensure that Congress can have oversight on the progress of \nenvironmental restoration in Lake Tahoe.\n  The bill provides for public outreach and education. The Forest \nService, Environmental Protection Agency, Fish and Wildlife Service and \nTahoe Regional Planning Agency will implement new public outreach and \neducation programs including: encouraging Basin residents and visitors \nto implement defensible space, conducting best management practices for \nwater quality, and preventing the introduction and proliferation of \ninvasive species.\n  In addition, the legislation requires signage on federally financed \nprojects to improve public awareness of restoration efforts.\n  The bill allows for increased efficiency in the management of public \nland. Under this legislation, the Forest Service would have increased \nflexibility to exchange land with state agencies which will allow for \nmore cost-efficient management of public land. There is currently a \ncheckerboard pattern of ownership in some areas of the Basin.\n  Under this new authority, the Forest Service could exchange land with \nthe California Tahoe Conservancy of approximately equal value without \ngoing through a lengthy process to assess the land.\n  For example, if there are several plots of Forest Service land that \nsurround or are adjacent to Tahoe Conservancy land, the Tahoe \nConservancy could transfer that land to the Forest Service so that it \ncan be managed more efficiently.\n  This legislation is needed because the ``Jewel of the Sierra'' is in \nbig trouble. If we don't act now, we could lose Lake Tahoe--and lose it \nwith stunning speed--as climate change increases in severity.\n  The effects of climate change on Lake Tahoe are already visible. It \nis making the basin dry and tinder-hot, increasing the risks of \ncatastrophic wildfire. Daily air temperatures have increased 4 degrees \nsince 1911. Snowfall has declined from an average of 52 percent of \noverall precipitation in 1910 to just 34 percent in recent years.\n  Climate change has raised Lake Tahoe's water temperature 1.5 degrees \nin 38 years. That means the cyclical deep-water mixing of the lake's \nwaters will occur less frequently, and this could significantly disrupt \nLake Tahoe's ecosystem.\n  Anyone doubting that climate change poses a considerable threat to \nLake Tahoe should read an alarming recent report by the UC Davis Tahoe \nEnvironmental Research Center.\n  It was written for the U.S. Forest Service by scientists who have \ndevoted their professional careers to studying Lake Tahoe. And it \npaints a distinctly bleak picture of the future for the ``Jewel of the \nSierra.''\n  Among its findings: The Tahoe Basin's regional snowpack could decline \nby as much as 60 percent in the next century, with increased floods \nlikely by 2050 and prolonged droughts by 2100.\n  Even ``under the most optimistic projections,'' average snowpack in \nthe Sierra Nevada around Tahoe will decline by 40 to 60 percent by \n2100, according to the report.\n  This would bankrupt Tahoe's ski industry, threaten the water supply \nof Reno and other communities, and degrade the lake's fabled water \nclarity. It would be devastating.\n\n[[Page S1123]]\n\n  Pollution and sedimentation have threatened Lake Tahoe's water \nclarity for years. In 1968, the first year UC Davis scientists measured \nclarity, the lake had an average depth of 102.4 feet. Clarity declined \nover the next 3 decades, hitting a low of 64 feet in 1997.\n  There has been some improvement this decade. This year scientists \nrecorded average clarity at 69.6 feet--roughly within the range of the \npast eight years. But it is a fragile gain.\n  The University of California Davis report has determined that an all-\nout attack on pollution and sedimentation is the lake's last hope.\n  Geoff Schladow, director of the UC Davis Tahoe Environmental Research \nCenter and one of the report's authors, has highlighted the need to \nrestore short-term water quality in Lake Tahoe--while there's still \ntime to do it.\n  According to the report, ``reducing the load of external nutrients \nentering the lake in the coming decades may be the only possible \nmitigation measure to reduce the impact of climate change on lake \nclarity.'' In other words, the sediment and runoff entering the lake \ncould fuel algal growth, creating a downward spiral in water quality \nand clarity.\n  The Lake Tahoe Restoration Act of 2011 would directly fund efforts to \naddress water clarity issues and impacts from climate change.\n  Last year, the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act of 2010 passed the Senate \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee unanimously, but there was not \nenough time for a floor vote. It is my hope that this legislation can \nbe passed early in the legislative session.\n  A lot of good work has been done. But there's a lot more work to do, \nand time is running out.\n  Mark Twain called Lake Tahoe ``the fairest picture the whole world \naffords.'' We must not be the generation who lets this picture fall \ninto ruin. We must rise to the challenge, and do all we can to preserve \nthis ``noble sheet of water.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 432\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I join Senator Feinstein in \nintroducing the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act of 2011 along with Senator \nEnsign and Senator Boxer. Our bill protects Lake Tahoe by helping \nfederal agencies work more collaboratively with local governments to \nmanage federal lands, preventing catastrophic wildfires, keeping \ninvasive species out of the lake, using sound science to prioritize \nprojects, and leveraging state and local funding. Senator Feinstein has \ndone a lot of work to improve this legislation while maintaining a \nbroad coalition of support and I want to thank her for her good work.\n  Lake Tahoe is a place of incredible beauty. When Mark Twain first saw \nLake Tahoe in 1861, he described it as ``a noble sheet of blue water \nlifted 6,300 feet above the level of the sea, and walled in by a rim of \nsnow-clad mountain peaks that towered aloft full three thousand feet \nhigher still!'' He went on to proclaim the view in front of him as \nsurely ``the fairest picture the whole earth affords.'' I could not \nagree more.\n  But for all its beauty, Lake Tahoe Basin is in peril. The famed \nclarity of the lake declined by over a third during the last 50 years; \nit is estimated that 25 percent of the trees in the basin are dead or \ndying; the prized Lahontan cutthroat trout sport fish that once grew to \nmore than 40 pounds are no longer present; and many of the basin's \nnatural marshes and wetlands have been altered or drained. This \nperilous decline jeopardizes the 23,000 jobs and $1.8 billion in annual \nrevenues that Lake Tahoe contributes to the Nevada and California \neconomies.\n  It became clear to me in the 1990s that a major commitment and \ncoordinated efforts were necessary to turn things around for the health \nand future of Lake Tahoe and the Lake Tahoe Basin. In 1996, I called \nthen-President Clinton and Vice President Gore and asked if they would \ncome to Lake Tahoe with me so that they could see both the incredible \nbeauty of the place and many threats facing it. When we convened in \nJuly 1997, the President and Vice President brought four cabinet \nsecretaries with them and we had a multi-day session on the future of \nLake Tahoe. President Clinton promised to make Lake Tahoe a priority--\nfor the people of Nevada, for the people of California, and for the \nwhole country. An executive order and the subsequent Lake Tahoe \nRestoration Act of 2000 were the result of that commitment.\n  It would have been difficult to imagine at that first summit how much \nprogress we would be able to make in the last 14 years. The clarity of \nthe lake now appears to have stabilized, thousands of acres of forest \nlands have been restored, roads and highways across the basin have been \nimproved to limit runoff, and the natural function of many miles of \nstream zones and riparian areas has been restored. But there is a great \ndeal yet to be done. We offer the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act of 2011 as \nthe next step.\n  Our bill focuses federal attention on the areas where we can be most \neffective and it builds on the lessons we have learned since 1997. The \nbasic summary of the bill is that it authorizes $415 million over 10 \nyears to improve water clarity, reduce the threat of fire, and restore \nthe environment.\n  I would like to make a very important point about the federal role in \nprotecting Lake Tahoe. The U.S. Forest Service manages 75 percent of \nthe land surrounding the lake and it is impossible to make real \nprogress in the Lake Tahoe Basin without providing the Forest Service \nwith the tools they need to manage that land. With that in mind, we \ncall on the Forest Service to support the thresholds put forth by the \nTahoe Regional Planning Agency, we provide encouragement and funding to \nwork on the restoration of stream environment zones, and we withdraw \nall Forest Service in the Basin lands from mineral entry in order to \nminimize soil disturbance. The Forest Service is also granted increased \nflexibility to exchange land with the states of Nevada and California \nwhich will allow for more cost-efficient management of the over 8,000 \npublicly owned urban parcels spread throughout the Basin. Currently, \nthe Forest Service owns over 3,280 of these urban parcels and there are \nquestions about whether it is in the public interest for the Forest \nService to manage these urban lands or whether it would be better to \npass them to other responsible entities that could provide more \nefficient management. We have asked the Forest Service to report to \nCongress on their plans for improving this part of their program, \nincluding any suggestions for how Congress might be able to help. Along \nwith these new authorities and direction for forest management, the \nbill authorizes $136 million to reduce the threat of wildfire. This \nincludes work on Forest Service lands as well as work done by local \nfire agencies. Local communities and fire districts that receive grants \nfrom this generous program will provide a 25 percent cash match.\n  Lake Tahoe is uniquely beautiful and it's worth fighting to protect \nit. It is my sincere hope that my grandchildren will see the day when \nthe lake's clarity is restored to 100 feet or more, when Tahoe's giant \nnative trout are once again plentiful, and when nearby forests are \ndiverse and healthy. Mark Twain saw something amazing when he crested \ninto the Lake Tahoe Basin. We owe it to ourselves and to subsequent \ngenerations to restore as much of that splendor as we can. This bill is \nthe next step in that journey.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COCHRAN (for himself and Ms. Mikulski):\n  S. 434. A bill to improve and expand geographic literacy among \nkindergarten through grade 12 students in the United States by \nimproving professional development programs for kindergarten through \ngrade 12 teachers offered through institutions of higher education; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n[[Page S1129]]\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Teaching \nGeography is Fundamental Act. I am pleased to be joined as a cosponsor \nby my friend, the distinguished Senator from Maryland, Ms. Mikulski. \nThe purpose of this bill is to improve geographic literacy among K \nthrough 12 students by supporting professional development programs for \ntheir teachers that are administered in institutions of higher \nlearning. The bill also assists States in measuring the impact of \neducation in geography.\n  Ensuring geographic literacy prepares students to be good citizens of \nboth our Nation and the world. John Fahey, who is Chairman and CEO of \nthe National Geographic Society, once stated that, ``Geographic \nilliteracy impacts our economic well-being, our relationships with \nother nations and the environment, and isolates us from the world.'' \nWhen students understand their own environment, they can better \nunderstand the differences in other places, and the people who live in \nthem. Knowledge of the diverse cultures, environment, and distances \nbetween states and countries helps our students to understand national \nand international policies, economies, societies and political \nstructures on a global scale.\n  To expect that Americans will be able to work successfully with other \npeople around the world, we need to be able to communicate and \nunderstand each other. It is a fact that we have a global marketplace, \nand we need to be preparing our younger generation for competition in \nthe international economy. A strong base of geography knowledge \nimproves these opportunities.\n  The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis reports that in 2010, the \noverall volume of international trade, as the sum of imports and \nexports, was over $4.3 trillion. Geographic knowledge is increasingly \nneeded for U.S. businesses in international markets to understand such \nfactors as physical distance, time zones, language differences and \ncultural diversity.\n  Geospatial technology is an emerging career that is now available to \npeople with an extensive background in geography education. \nProfessionals in geospatial technology are employed in federal \ngovernment agencies, and in the private and non-profit sectors in areas \nsuch as agriculture, archeology, ecology, land appraisal, and urban \nplanning and development. It is important to improve and expand \ngeography education so that students in the United States can attain \nthe necessary expertise to fill and retain the estimated 70,000 new \njobs that are becoming available each year in the geospatial technology \nindustry.\n  Former Secretary of State Colin Powell once said, ``To solve most of \nthe major problems facing our country today--from wiping out terrorism, \nto minimizing global environmental problems, to eliminating the scourge \nof AIDS--will require every young person to learn more about other \nregions, cultures, and languages.'' It is clear to me that we need to \ndo more to ensure that the teachers responsible for the education of \nour students, from kindergarten through high school graduation, are \nprepared and trained to teach the skills necessary to solve these \nproblems.\n\n  Over the last 15 years, the National Geographic Society has awarded \nmore than $100 million in grants to educators, universities, geography \nalliances, and others for the purposes of advancing and improving the \nteaching of geography. Their models are successful, and research shows \nthat students who have benefitted from this teaching outperform other \nstudents. State geography alliances exist in 26 states and the District \nof Columbia endowed by grants from the Society. But, their efforts \nalone are not enough.\n  In my home state of Mississippi, teachers and university professors \nare making progress to increase geography education in schools through \nadditional professional training. Based at the University of \nMississippi, hundreds of geography teachers are members of the \nMississippi Geography Alliance. This Alliance conducts regular \nworkshops for graduate and undergraduate students who are preparing to \nbe certified to teach elementary and high school-level geography in our \nState. These workshops have provided opportunities for model teaching \nsessions and discussion of best practices in the classroom.\n  The bill I am introducing establishes a Federal commitment to enhance \nthe education of our teachers, focuses on geography education research, \nand develops reliable and advanced technology based classroom \nmaterials. I hope the Senate will consider the seriousness of the need \nto make this enhanced investment in geography.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 440. A bill for the relief of Jose Buendia Balderas, Alicia Aranda \nDe Buendia, and Ana Laura Buendia Aranda; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am reintroducing a private relief \nbill on behalf of the Buendias, a family who has lived in the Fresno \narea of California for more than 20 years. The beneficiaries of this \nbill include Jose Buendia Balderas, his wife, Alicia Aranda de Buendia, \nand their daughter, Ana Laura Buendia Aranda. I believe this family \nmerits Congress' special consideration.\n  I would like to start with the story of Jose Buendia, a remarkable \nfather and husband who has embraced the hard work ethic of this \ncountry. Many years ago, Jose's father worked as an agricultural worker \non the Bracero program.\n  In 1981, he brought his son to the United States. Jose worked hard, \nproviding financial support to his family in Mexico and working his way \nup through jobs in landscaping and construction.\n  Today, Jose is a valuable employee with Bone Construction, Inc. He \nhas worked with this California-based company for nearly 10 years, \ndeveloping skills and experience and now serving as a lead foreman. \nTimothy Bone, the owner of the company, calls Jose a ``reliable, \nhardworking and conscientious'' worker.\n  Jose is married to Alicia, who goes to work season after season in \nCalifornia's labor-intensive agriculture industry. She currently works \nfor a fruit packing company in Reedley, California. Jose and Alicia \nhave raised two outstanding children, Ana Laura, age 22, and Alex, age \n20, who have both always excelled in school.\n  Ana Laura earned a 4.0 GPA at Reedley High School, and was offered an \nacademic scholarship at the University of California, Berkeley. \nUnfortunately, she could not accept the scholarship because of her \nundocumented status.\n  Ana Laura nonetheless persisted. She enrolled at the University of \nCalifornia, Irvine and is on track to graduate this spring with a major \nin Chicano Studies and Art.\n  Ana Laura's younger brother, Alex, is a United States citizen. He \ngraduated high school with a 3.85 GPA and now studies engineering at \nthe University of California, Merced. Last spring, he graduated with \nhonors and a scholarship from Reedley College with an Associate of \nScience degree in Engineering.\n  Remarkably, the Buendias should have been able to correct their \nimmigration status years ago. Jose should have qualified for \nlegalization pursuant to the Immigration and Reform Control Act of \n1986; however, his application was never acted upon because his \nattorney was convicted of fraudulently submitting legalization and \nSpecial Agricultural Worker applications, tainting all of his clients.\n  The Immigration and Naturalization Service took nearly 7 years to \ndetermine that Jose's application contained no fraudulent information, \nbut at that point it was too late. Jose was no longer eligible for \nrelief due to changes in U.S. immigration law.\n  Still, the Buendia family continued to seek legal status through \nother means. In 1999, it appeared they had succeeded when an \nImmigration Judge granted the family cancellation of removal based on \nthe hardship their son, Alex, would face if deported to Mexico. \nHowever, the decision was appealed and ultimately overturned. At this \npoint, the Buendias have exhausted their options to remain together as \na family here in the United States.\n  In the more than 20 years of living in California, the Buendias have \nshown that they are committed to working to achieve the American dream. \nThey have a strong connection to their local community, as active \nmembers of the Parent Teachers Association and their\n\n[[Page S1130]]\n\nchurch. They pay their taxes every year, paid off their mortgage, and \nremain free of debt. They have shown that they are responsible, \nmaintaining health insurance, savings accounts, and retirement \naccounts.\n  Moreover, the Buendia children are excellent students pursuing higher \neducation here in the United States. Without this private bill, these \nyoung adults will be separated from their family or forced to relocate \nto a country they simply do not know. I do not believe it is in the \nNation's best interest to prevent talented youth raised here in the \nUnited States, who have good moral character and outstanding academic \nrecords, from realizing their future.\n  I respectfully ask my colleagues for their support of the Buendia \nfamily. I hope the Senate will consider this private relief legislation \nin the 112th Congress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 440\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS FOR JOSE BUENDIA \n                   BALDERAS, ALICIA ARANDA DE BUENDIA, AND ANA \n                   LAURA BUENDIA ARANDA.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of \n     section 201 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1151), Jose Buendia Balderas, Alicia Aranda De Buendia, and \n     Ana Laura Buendia Aranda shall each be eligible for issuance \n     of an immigrant visa or for adjustment of status to that of \n     an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence upon \n     filing an application for issuance of an immigrant visa under \n     section 204 of such Act (8 U.S.C. 1154) or for adjustment of \n     status to lawful permanent resident.\n       (b) Adjustment of Status.--If Jose Buendia Balderas, Alicia \n     Aranda De Buendia, or Ana Laura Buendia Aranda enter the \n     United States before the filing deadline specified in \n     subsection (c), Jose Buendia Balderas, Alicia Aranda De \n     Buendia, or Ana Laura Buendia Aranda, as appropriate, shall \n     be considered to have entered and remained lawfully in the \n     United States and shall be eligible for adjustment of status \n     under section 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 \n     U.S.C. 1255) as of the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Application and Payment of Fees.--Subsections (a) and \n     (b) shall apply only if the application for the issuance of \n     an immigrant visa or the application for adjustment of status \n     is filed with appropriate fees not later than 2 years after \n     the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (d) Reduction of Immigrant Visa Numbers.--Upon the granting \n     of an immigrant visa or permanent residence to Jose Buendia \n     Balderas, Alicia Aranda De Buendia, and Ana Laura Buendia \n     Aranda, the Secretary of State shall instruct the proper \n     officer to reduce by 3, during the current or next following \n     fiscal year--\n       (1) the total number of immigrant visas that are made \n     available to natives of the country of birth of Jose Buendia \n     Balderas, Alicia Aranda De Buendia, and Ana Laura Buendia \n     Aranda under section 203(a) of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1153(a)); or\n       (2) if applicable, the total number of immigrant visas that \n     are made available to natives of the country of birth of Jose \n     Buendia Balderas, Alicia Aranda De Buendia, and Ana Laura \n     Buendia Aranda under section 202(e) of such Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1152(e)).\n       (e) PAYGO.--The budgetary effects of this Act, for the \n     purpose of complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go-Act of \n     2010, shall be determined by reference to the latest \n     statement titled ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' \n     for this Act, submitted for printing in the Congressional \n     Record by the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, \n     provided that such statement has been submitted prior to the \n     vote on passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 441. A bill for the relief of Esidronio Arreola-Saucedo, Maria \nElna Cobain Arreola, Nayely Arreola Carlos, and Cindy Jael Arreola; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today, I offer private immigration \nrelief legislation to provide lawful permanent resident status to \nEsidronio Arreola-Saucedo, Maria Elena Cobian Arreola, Nayely Arreola \nCarlos, and Cindy Jael Arreola. The Arreolas are Mexican nationals \nliving in the Fresno area of California.\n  Esidronio and Maria Elena have lived in the United States for over 20 \nyears. Two of their five children, Nayely, age 25, and Cindy, age 20, \nalso stand to benefit from this legislation.\n  The other three Arreola children, Robert, age 19, Daniel, age 15, and \nSaray, age 14, are United States citizens. Today, Esidronio and Maria \nElena and their two eldest children face deportation.\n  The story of the Arreola family is compelling and I believe they \nmerit Congress' special consideration for such an extraordinary form of \nrelief as a private bill.\n  The Arreolas are facing deportation in part because of grievous \nerrors committed by their previous counsel, who has since been \ndisbarred. In fact, the attorney's conduct was so egregious that it \ncompelled an immigration judge to write the Executive Office of \nImmigration Review seeking the attorney's disbarment for his actions in \nhis client's immigration cases.\n  Esidronio came to the United States in 1986 and was an agricultural \nmigrant worker in the fields of California for several years. As a \nmigrant worker at that time, he would have been eligible for permanent \nresidence through the Seasonal Agricultural Workers SAW, program, had \nhe known about it.\n  Maria Elena was living in the United States at the time she became \npregnant with her daughter Cindy. She returned to Mexico to give birth \nbecause she wanted to avoid any problems with the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service.\n  Because of the length of time that the Arreolas were in the United \nStates, it is likely that they would have qualified for suspension of \ndeportation, which would have allowed them to remain in the United \nStates legally. However, their poor legal representation foreclosed \nthis opportunity.\n  One of the most compelling reasons for my introduction of this \nprivate bill is the devastating impact the deportation of Esidronio and \nMaria Elena would have on their children--three of whom are American \ncitizens--and the other two who have lived in the United States since \nthey were toddlers. For these children, this country is the only \ncountry they really know.\n  Nayely, the oldest, was the first in her family to graduate from high \nschool and the first to graduate college. She attended Fresno Pacific \nUniversity, a regionally ranked university, on a full tuition \nscholarship package and worked part-time in the admissions office. She \ngraduated from Fresno Pacific University with a degree in Business \nAdministration and is working on her graduate degree. Nayely recently \ngot married.\n  At a young age, Nayely demonstrated a strong commitment to the ideals \nof citizenship in her adopted country. She worked hard to achieve her \nfull potential both through her academic endeavors and community \nservice. As the Associate Dean of Enrollment Services at Fresno Pacific \nUniversity states in a letter of support, ``[T]he leaders of Fresno \nPacific University saw in Nayely, a young person who will become \nexemplary of all that is good in the American dream.''\n  In high school, Nayely was a member of Advancement Via Individual \nDetermination, AVID, college preparatory program in which students \ncommit to determining their own futures through achieving a college \ndegree. Nayely was also President of the Key Club, a community service \norganization. Perhaps the greatest hardship to this family, if forced \nto return to Mexico, will be her lost opportunity to realize her dreams \nand further contribute to her community and to this country.\n  Nayely's sister, Cindy, also recently married and has a one-year-old \ndaughter. Neither Nayely nor Cindy are eligible to adjust their status \nbased on their marriages because they grew up in the United States \nundocumented.\n  The Arreolas also have other family who are United States citizens or \nlawful permanent residents of this country. Maria Elena has three \nbrothers who are American citizens, and Esidronio has a sister who is \nan American citizen. It is also my understanding that they have no \nimmediate family in Mexico.\n  According to immigration authorities, this family has never had any \nproblems with law enforcement. I am told that they have filed their \ntaxes for every year from 1990 to the present. They have always worked \nhard to support themselves.\n  As I previously mentioned, Esidronio was previously employed as a \nfarm worker, but now has his own business in California repairing \nelectronics. His business has been successful enough to\n\n[[Page S1131]]\n\nenable him to purchase a home for his family. He and his wife are \nactive in their church community and in their children's education.\n  It is clear to me that this family has embraced the American dream. \nEnactment of the legislation I have reintroduced today will enable the \nArreolas to continue to make significant contributions to their \ncommunity as well as the United States.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this private bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 441\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill for the relief of Robert Liang and Alice Liang; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to reintroduce private relief \nlegislation for Robert Kuan Liang and his wife, Chun-Mei, ``Alice'', \nHsu-Liang.\n  I first introduced a private bill for Robert and Alice in 2003. Since \nthen this family has only further demonstrated their hard work ethic \nand commitment to realizing the American dream. I continue to believe \nthat Robert and Alice merit Congress' special consideration and the \nextraordinary relief provided by private legislation.\n  Robert and Alice have been living in San Bruno, California, for the \nlast 27 years. Robert is a national and refugee from Laos, and Alice is \noriginally from Taiwan. They have three children who are all United \nStates citizens. I am concerned that forcing Robert and Alice to return \nto their home countries would tear this family apart and cause immense \nand unwarranted hardship to them and their children.\n  Robert and Alice have called California their home since they first \nentered the United States in 1983. They came here legally on tourist \nvisas. They face deportation today because they remained in the United \nStates past the terms of their visas, and because their attorney failed \nto handle their immigration case on a timely basis before federal \nimmigration laws changed in 1996.\n  In many ways, the Liang family represents a uniquely American success \nstory. Robert was born in Laos, but fled the country as a teenager \nafter his mother was killed by Communists. He witnessed many traumatic \nexperiences in his youth, including the attack that killed his mother \nand frequent episodes of wartime violence. He routinely witnessed the \nbrutal persecution and deaths of others in his village in Laos. In \n1975, he was granted refugee status in Taiwan.\n  Robert and his wife risked everything to come to the United States. \nDespite the challenges of their past, they built a family in California \nand established a place for themselves in the local community. They are \nhomeowners. They own a successful business, Fong Yong Restaurant. They \nfile annual income taxes and are financially stable.\n  Robert and Alice support their three children, Wesley, Bruce, and \nEva, who are all American citizens. Wesley is now 18 years old and \nstudying at City College of San Francisco. The younger children, Bruce \nand Eva, attend schools in the San Bruno area and continue to do well \nin their classes.\n  There are many reasons to believe that deporting Robert and Alice \nwould have a harmful impact on the children, who have all of their ties \nto the United States. Deportation would either break this family apart \nor force them to relocate to a country entirely foreign to the one they \nknow to be home.\n  The Immigration Judge who presided over Robert and Alice's case in \n1997 also concluded that Robert and Alice's deportation would adversely \nimpact the Liang children.\n  Moreover, Robert would face significant hurdles if deported, having \nfled Laos as a refugee more than 27 years ago. The emotional impact of \nthe wartime violence Robert experienced at a young age was traumatic \nand continues to strain him. He battles severe clinical depression here \nin the United States. Robert fears that if he is deported and moves to \nhis wife's home country, Taiwan, he will face discrimination on account \nof his nationality. Robert does not speak Taiwanese, and he worries \nabout how he would pursue mental health treatment in a foreign country.\n  Robert and Alice have worked since 1993 to resolve their immigration \nstatus. They filed for relief from deportation; however, it took nearly \nfive years for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, INS, to act \non the case. By the time their case went through in 1997, the \nimmigration laws had changed and the Liangs were no longer eligible for \nrelief. I supported these changes, set forth in the Illegal Immigration \nReform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. But, I also believe \nthere may be situations worthy of special consideration.\n  Robert and Alice Liang represent one such example. They are long-term \nresidents of the United States. Their children are all U.S. citizens. \nThe Immigration Judge that presided over the appeal of this case \ndetermined that Robert and Alice would have qualified for relief from \ndeportation, in light of these positive factors, had the INS given \ntheir case timely consideration. Unfortunately, their immigration case \ntook nearly five years to move forward.\n  A private bill is the only way for both Robert and Alice to remain in \nthe United States together with their family. They have worked \nextraordinarily hard to make the United States their home. I believe \nRobert and Alice deserve the relief provided by a private bill.\n  I respectfully ask my colleagues to support this private relief bill \non behalf of the Liangs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 442\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ADJUSTMENT OF STATUS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law \n     or any order, for the purposes of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.), Robert Liang and \n     Alice Liang shall be deemed to have been lawfully admitted \n     to, and remained in, the United States, and shall be eligible \n     for issuance of an immigrant visa or for adjustment of status \n     under section 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 \n     U.S.C. 1255).\n       (b) Application and Payment of Fees.--Subsection (a) shall \n     apply only if the applications for issuance of immigrant \n     visas or the applications for adjustment of status are filed \n     with appropriate fees not later than 2 years after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Reduction of Immigrant Visa Numbers.--Upon the granting \n     of immigrant visas\n\n[[Page S1132]]\n\n     to Robert Liang and Alice Liang, the Secretary of State shall \n     instruct the proper officer to reduce by 2, during the \n     current or subsequent fiscal year, the total number of \n     immigrant visas that are made available to natives of the \n     country of birth of Robert Liang and Alice Liang under \n     section 203(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 \n     U.S.C. 1153(a)), or, if applicable, the total number of \n     immigrant visas that are made available to natives of the \n     country of birth of Robert Liang and Alice Liang under \n     section 202(e) of that Act (8 U.S.C. 1152(e)).\n       (d) PAYGO.--The budgetary effects of this Act, for the \n     purpose of complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go-Act of \n     2010, shall be determined by reference to the latest \n     statement titled ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' \n     for this Act, submitted for printing in the Congressional \n     Record by the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, \n     provided that such statement has been submitted prior to the \n     vote on passage.-\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 443. A bill for the relief of Javier Lopez-Urenda and Maria \nLeticia Arenas; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce a private \nrelief bill on behalf of Javier Lopez-Urenda and Maria Leticia Arenas. \nJavier and Leticia, originally from Mexico, are the parents of three \nU.S. citizen children, Bryan, age 17, Ashley, age 13, and Nancy, age 7. \nThis family lives in Fremont, California.\n  I first introduced a bill for Javier and Leticia in 2009, and I \ncontinue to believe they deserve Congress' special consideration for \nsuch an extraordinary form of relief as a private bill. Javier and \nLeticia are outstanding parents, volunteers, workers, and leaders in \ntheir community. Javier and Leticia came to the United States after \neach suffered the loss of a parent.\n  Leticia left Mexico at age 17 after her mother died from cancer. \nJavier came to the United States in 1990, at age 23, several years \nafter the murder of his father in Michoacan, Mexico.\n  Javier had been living and working in the United States for over 25 \nyears when I first learned about this case. He originally entered the \ncountry looking for work to support his extended family. Today, Javier \nis a Manager at Full Bloom Baking Company in San Mateo, California, \nwhere he has been an employee for over 18 years. In fact, Javier was \nthe second employee hired at Full Bloom when the company first began.\n  Javier's fellow co-workers at Full Bloom have written compelling \nletters to me about Javier's hard work ethic and valuable \ncontributions. The company owners assert that with his help, the \ncompany grew to be one of the largest commercial bakeries in the Bay \nArea, today employing approximately 385 people.\n  They write that Javier is a mentor to others and maintains a \n``tremendous amount of `institutional knowledge' that can never be \nreplaced.'' One of his co-workers wrote, ``Without Javier at the \nbakery, the lives of hundreds of people will change.''\n  Javier made attempts to legalize his status in the United States. At \none point, he received an approved labor certification. However, his \ncase could not be finalized due to poor timing and a lengthy \nimmigration process. It took three years, for example, for his labor \ncertification to be approved. By that time, Javier was already in \nremoval proceedings and his case is now closed.\n  During consideration of Javier's case, the Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals acknowledged the difficult situation Javier faces. The Court \nwrote, ``We are not unmindful of the unique and extremely sympathetic \ncircumstances of this case. By all accounts, Petitioner has been an \nexemplary father, employee, and member of his local community. If he \nwere to be deported, he would be separated from his wife, three U.S. \ncitizen children, and the life he has worked so hard to build over the \npast 17 years. In light of the unfortunate sequence of events leading \nup this juncture and Petitioner's positive contributions to society, \nPetitioner may very well be deserving of prosecutorial grace.''\n  Unfortunately, the Court ultimately denied the case. Javier and his \nwife have no additional avenues for adjusting their status. A private \nbill is the only way for them to remain in the United States.\n  I believe it is important to consider the potentially harmful impact \non Javier and Maria Leticia's three U.S. citizen children, Bryan, \nAshley, and Nancy, should their parents be deported. Bryan, Ashley, and \nNancy are all in school in California. Javier owns their home in \nFremont. He is the sole financial provider for his wife and children, \nwhile also providing some financial support to extended family members \nin Mexico. Javier and Leticia are good parents and play active roles in \ntheir children's lives. The Principal of Patterson Elementary School \ndescribed Javier and Leticia as ``two loving and supportive parents who \nare committed to their children's success.''\n  All too often, deportation separates U.S. citizen children from their \nparents. In 2009, the Inspector General of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity found that, in the last ten years, at least 108,434 immigrant \nparents of American citizen children were removed from this country. \nOther reports show that deporting a parent causes trauma and long-\nlasting harm to children.\n  Moreover, the deportation of Javier and Leticia would be a \nsignificant loss to the community. Leticia is currently volunteering \nand training for a job with Bay Area Women Against Rape in Oakland, \nwhich provides services to survivors of sexual assault. She is also a \ncertified health promoter and volunteer at Vazquez Health Center in \nFremont.\n  Javier's community involvement is just as impressive. He has \nvolunteered with the Women's Foundation of California, Lance \nArmstrong's Livestrong Foundation, the Saint Patrick Proto Cathedral \nParish, the American Red Cross, and the California AIDS Ride.\n  Patricia W. Chang, a long-time community leader in California and \ncurrent CEO of Feed the Hunger, writes: ``Asking Mr. Urenda to leave \nthe United States would deprive his children of their father, an \nupstanding resident of the country. It would deprive the community of \nan active participant, leader, and volunteer.''\n  Judy Patrick, President/CEO of the Women's Foundation of California, \nstates that Javier ``is a model participant in this society.''\n  Clearly, Javier and Leticia have earned the admiration of their \ncommunity here in the United States. They are the loving parents of \nthree American children. Javier is a valued employee at Full Bloom \nBaking Company. This family shows great potential, and I believe it is \nin our Nation's best interest to allow them to remain here with their \nchildren and to continue making significant contributions to California \nand the Nation as a whole.\n  I respectfully ask my colleagues to support this private relief bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 443\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill for the relief of Shirley Constantino Tan; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing a bill for the \nprivate relief of Shirley Constantino Tan. Shirley is a Filipina \nnational living in Pacifica, California. She is the proud mother of 14-\nyear-old U.S. citizen twin boys, Jashley and Joreine, and the spouse of \nJay Mercado, a naturalized U.S. citizen.\n  I believe Shirley merits Congress' special consideration for this \nextraordinary form of relief because I believe her removal from the \nUnited States would cause undue hardship for her and her family. \nShirley faces deportation to the Philippines, which would separate her \nfrom her family and jeopardize her safety.\n  Shirley experienced horrific violence in the Philippines before she \nleft to come to the United States. When Shirley was only 14 years old, \nher cousin murdered her mother and her sister and shot Shirley in the \nhead. While the cousin who committed the murders was eventually \nprosecuted, he received a short jail sentence. Fearing for her safety, \nShirley fled the Philippines just before her cousin was due to be \nreleased from jail. She entered the United States legally on a \nvisitor's visa in 1989.\n  Shirley's current deportation order is the result of negligent \ncounsel. Shirley applied for asylum in 1995. While her case appeal was \npending at the Board of Immigration Appeals, her attorney failed to \nsubmit a brief to support her case. As a result, the case was \ndismissed, and the Board of Immigration Appeals granted Shirley \nvoluntary departure from the United States.\n  Shirley never received notice that the Board of Immigration Appeals \ngranted her voluntary departure. Shirley's attorney moved offices, did \nnot receive the order, and ultimately never informed her of the order. \nAs a result, Shirley did not depart the United States and the grant of \nvoluntary departure automatically became a deportation order. Shirley \nlearned about the deportation order for the first time on January 28, \n2009, when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents took her into \nimmigration custody.\n  Because of her attorney's negligent actions, Shirley was denied the \nopportunity to present her case in U.S. immigration proceedings. \nShirley later filed a complaint with the State Bar of California \nagainst her former attorney. She is not the first person to file such a \ncomplaint against this attorney.\n  In addition to the hardship that would come to Shirley if she is \ndeported, Shirley's deportation would be a serious hardship to her two \nUnited States citizen children, Jashley and Joreine, who are minors.\n  Jashley and Joreine are currently attending Terra Nova High School in \nPacifica, California, where they continue to be excellent students on \nthe honor roll. The children are involved in their school's music \nprogram, playing the clarinet and the flute. The children's teacher \nwrote a letter to me in which she described Shirley's involvement in \nJashley and Joreine's lives, referring to Shirley as a ``model'' parent \nand describing her active role in the school community. In addition to \ncaring for her two children, Shirley is the primary caregiver for her \nelderly mother-in-law.\n  If Shirley were forced to leave the United States, her family has \nexpressed that they would go with Shirley to the Philippines or try and \nfind a third country where the entire family could relocate. This would \nmean that Jashley and Joreine would have to leave behind their \neducation and the only home they know in the United States.\n  While Shirley and Jay are legally married under California law at \nthis time, Shirley cannot legally adjust her immigration status through \nthe regular family-based immigration procedures.\n  I do not believe it is in our Nation's best interest to force this \nfamily, with two United States citizen children, to make the choice \nbetween being separated and relocating to a country where they may face \nsafety concerns or other serious hardships.\n  Shirley and her family are involved in their community in Pacifica \nand own their own home.

A bill for the relief of Jorge Rojas Gutierrez, Oliva \nGonzalez Gonzalez, and Jorge Rojas Gonzalez; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing a private \nrelief bill on behalf of Jorge Rojas Gutierrez, his wife, Oliva \nGonzalez Gonzalez, and their son, Jorge Rojas Gonzalez. The Rojas \nfamily, originally from Mexico, is living in the San Jose area of \nCalifornia.\n  The story of the Rojas family is compelling, and I believe they merit \nCongress' special consideration for such an extraordinary form of \nrelief as a private bill.\n  Jorge and his wife, Oliva, originally came to the United States in \n1990 when their son Jorge Rojas, Jr. was just 2 years old. In 1995, \nthey left the country to attend a funeral, and then re-entered the \nUnited States on visitor's visas.\n  The family has since expanded to include two sons, Alexis Rojas, now \n18 years old, Matias, now a year old, a daughter Tania Rojas, now age \n16, and a granddaughter, Mina Rojas, who is less than a year old.\n  The Rojas family first attempted to legalize their status in the \nUnited\n\n[[Page S1134]]\n\nStates when an unscrupulous immigration consultant, who was not an \nattorney, advised them to apply for asylum. Unfortunately, without \nproper legal guidance, this family did not realize at the time that \nthey lacked a valid basis for asylum. The asylum claim was denied in \n2008, leaving the Rojas family with no further options to legalize \ntheir status.\n  Since their arrival in the United States more than 20 years ago, the \nRojas family has demonstrated a robust work ethic and a strong \ncommitment to their community in California. They have paid their taxes \nand worked hard to contribute to this country.\n  Jorge is a hard-working individual who has been employed by Valley \nCrest Landscape Maintenance in San Jose, California, for the past 16 \nyears. Currently, he works on commercial landscaping projects. Jorge is \nwell-respected by his supervisor and his peers.\n  In addition to supporting his family, Jorge has volunteered his time \nto provide modern green landscaping and building projects at his \nchildren's school in California. He is active in his neighborhood \nassociation, working with his neighbors to open a library and community \ncenter in their community.\n  Oliva, in addition to raising her three children, has also been very \nactive in the local community. She works to help other immigrants \nassimilate to American life by acting as a translator and a tutor for \nimmigrant children in local schools and after school programs in \nNorthern California.\n  Before her youngest son was born, Oliva volunteered with the People \nActing in Community Together, PACT, organization, where she worked to \nprevent crime, gangs and drug dealing in San Jose neighborhoods and \nschools.\n  Both Jorge and Oliva are active volunteers with the Second Harvest \nFood Bank, assisting in distributing food to the needy at a community \ncenter.\n  Perhaps one of the most compelling reasons for permitting the Rojas \nfamily to remain in the United States is the impact that their \ndeportation would have on their three children. Two of the Rojas \nchildren, Alexis and Tania, are American citizens. Jorge Rojas, Jr. has \nlived in the United States since he was a toddler.\n  For Alexis, Tania, and Jorge, this country is the only country they \nreally know.\n  Jorge Rojas, Jr., who entered the United States as an infant with his \nparents, recently became a father. He is now 22 years old and working \nat a job that allows him to support his daughter, Mina. Jorge graduated \nfrom Del Mar High School in 2007 and is taking classes at San Jose City \nCollege.\n  Alexis, age 18, graduated from Del Mar High School and is now a \nstudent at West Valley College in Saratoga, California. He is \ninterested in studying linguistics. Tania, age 16, still attends Del \nMar High School and plans to graduate next year. Their teachers \ndescribe them as ``fantastic, wonderful and gifted'' students.\n  It seems so clear to me that this family has embraced the American \ndream and their continued presence in our country would do so much to \nenhance the values we hold dear.\n  When I first introduced this bill, I received dozens of letters from \nthe community in Northern California in support of this family. \nEnactment of the legislation I have reintroduced today will enable the \nRojas family to continue to make significant contributions to their \ncommunity as well as the United States.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this private bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 445\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill for the relief of Ruben Mkoian, Asmik Karapetian, and \nArthur Mkoyan; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to reintroduce private relief \nlegislation in the 112th Congress on behalf of Ruben Mkoian, Asmik \nKarapetian, and their son, Arthur Mkoyan. The Mkoian family has been \nliving in Fresno, California, for over 15 years. I continue to believe \nthis family deserves Congress' special consideration for such an \nextraordinary form of relief as a private bill.\n  The Mkoian family is originally from Armenia. They decided to leave \nArmenia for the United States in the early 1990s, following several \nincidents in which the family experienced vandalism and threats to \ntheir well-being.\n  In Armenia, Ruben worked as a police sergeant on vehicle licensing. \nAt one point, he was offered a bribe to register stolen vehicles, which \nhe refused and reported to his superior, the police chief. He later \nlearned that a co-worker had gone ahead and registered the vehicles at \nthe request of the chief.\n  Several disturbing incidents occurred after Ruben reported the bribe \noffer to illegally register vehicles. Ruben's store was vandalized; \nafter he said he would call the police, he received threatening phone \ncalls telling him to keep quiet. At one point, the Mkoians suffered the \nloss of their home when a bottle of gasoline was thrown into their \nresidence, burning it to the ground. In April 1992, several men entered \nthe family store and assaulted Ruben, hospitalizing him for 22 days.\n  Ruben, Asmik, and their three-year-old son, Arthur, left Armenia soon \nthereafter and entered the United States on visitor visas. They applied \nfor political asylum in 1992 on the grounds that they would be subject \nto physical attacks if returned to Armenia. It took 16 years for their \ncase to be finalized, and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals denied \ntheir asylum case in January 2008.\n  At this time, Ruben, Asmik, and Arthur have exhausted every option to \nremain legally in the United States.\n  The Mkoians have worked hard to build a place for their family in \nCalifornia. Ruben works as a truck driver for a California trucking \ncompany. He has been described as ``trustworthy,'' ``knowledgeable,'' \nand an asset to the company. Asmik has completed training at a local \ncommunity college and is now a full-time medical assistant with Fresno \nShields Medical Group.\n  The Mkoians attend St. Paul Armenian Apostolic Church in Fresno. They \ndo charity work to send medical equipment to Armenia. Asmik also \nteaches\n\n[[Page S1135]]\n\nArmenian School on Saturdays at the church.\n  I would particularly like to highlight the achievements of the Ruben \nand Asmik's two children, Arthur and Arsen, who were raised in \nCalifornia and have been recognized publicly for their scholastic \nachievements.\n  I first introduced a private bill for this family on Arthur's high \nschool graduation day. Despite being undocumented, Arthur maintained a \n4.0 grade point average in high school and was a valedictorian for the \nclass of 2008. Arthur, now 20 years old, is in his third year at the \nUniversity of California, Davis. He is studying biochemistry, maintains \nexcellent grades, and was on the Dean's Merit List again this past \nquarter.\n  Arthur's brother, Arsen, is 14 years old and a United States citizen. \nHe is currently a freshman at Bullard High School in Fresno, where he \ndoes well in his classes, maintaining a 3.9 grade point average.\n  I believe Arthur and Arsen are two young individuals with great \npotential here in the United States. Like their parents, they have \ndemonstrated their commitment to working hard--and they are succeeding. \nThey clearly aspire to do great things here in the United States.\n  It has been more than 18 years since Ruben, Asmik, and Arthur left \nArmenia. This family has few family members and virtually no supporting \ncontacts in Armenia. They invested their time, resources, and effort in \norder to remain in the United States legally, to no avail. A private \nrelief bill is the only means to prevent them from being forced to \nreturn to a country that long ago became a closed chapter of their \npast.\n  When I first introduced a bill on behalf of the Mkoian family in \n2008, I received written endorsements from Representatives George \nRadanovich, R-CA, and Jim Costa, D-CA, in strong support of the family. \nI also received more than 200 letters of support and dozens of calls of \nsupport from friends and community members, attesting to the positive \nimpact that this family has had in Fresno California.\n  I believe that this case warrants our compassion and our \nextraordinary consideration. I respectfully ask my colleagues to \nsupport this private legislation on behalf of the Mkoian family.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 446\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill for the relief of Jose Alberto Martinez Moreno, \nMicaela Lopez Martinez, and Adilene Martinez; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing private \nimmigration relief legislation to provide lawful permanent resident \nstatus to Jose Alberto Martinez Moreno, Micaela Lopez Martinez, and \ntheir daughter, Adilene Martinez. This family is originally from Mexico \nbut has been living in California for twenty years. I believe they \nmerit Congress' special consideration for this extraordinary form of \nrelief.\n  When Jose came to the United States from Mexico, he began working as \na busboy in restaurants in San Francisco, California. In 1990, he \nstarted working as a cook at Palio D'Asti, an award-winning Italian \nrestaurant in San Francisco.\n  Jose worked his way through the ranks, eventually becoming Palio's \nsous chef. His colleagues describe him as a reliable and cool-headed \ncoworker, and as ``an exemplary employee'' who not only is ``good at \nhis job but is also a great boss to his subordinates.''\n  He and his wife, Micaela, call San Francisco home. Micaela works as a \nhousekeeper. They have three daughters, two of whom are United States \ncitizens. Their oldest child Adilene, age 22, is undocumented. Adilene \ngraduated from the Immaculate Conception Academy and attended San \nFrancisco City College. She is now studying nursing at Los Medranos \nCollege.\n  The Martinez's second daughter, Jazmin, is a senior at Leadership \nHigh School and has applied to attend several Universities in \nCalifornia. Jazmin is a United States citizen and has been diagnosed \nwith asthma. According to her doctor, if the family returns to Mexico, \nthe high altitude and air pollution in Mexico City could be fatal to \nJazmin.\n  The Martinez family attempted to legalize their status through \nseveral channels.\n  In 2001, Jose's sister, who has legal status, petitioned for Jose to \nget a green card. However, the current green card backlog for siblings \nfrom Mexico is long, and it will be many years before Jose will be \neligible to legalize his status though his sister.\n  In 2002, the Martinez family applied for political asylum. Their \napplication was denied. An immigration judge denied their subsequent \napplication for cancellation of removal because he could not find the \n``requisite hardship'' required for this form of immigration relief. \nIronically, the immigration judge who reviewed their case found that \nJose's culinary ability was a negative factor weighing against keeping \nthe family in the United States, finding that Jose's skills indicated \nthat he could find a job in Mexico.\n  Finally, Daniel Scherotter, the executive chef and owner of Palio \nD'Asti, petitioned for legal status for Jose based upon Jose's unique \nskills as a chef. Even though U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services \napproved Jose's work petition, there is a backlog for employment based \nvisas and it may be many years before Jose can get a visa. Until then, \nhe and his family remain subject to deportation.\n  Jose, Micaela, and their daughter, Adilene, have no other \nadministrative options to legalize their status. If they are deported, \nthey will face a several-year ban from returning to the United States. \nJose and Micaela will be separated from their American citizen-children \nand their community.\n  The Martinez family has become an integral part of their community in \nCalifornia. They are active in their faith community and their \nchildren's schools. They volunteer with community-based organizations \nand are, in turn, supported by their community. When I first introduced \nthis bill, I received dozens of letters of support from their fellow \nparishioners, teachers, and members of their community.\n\n[[Page S1136]]\n\n  The Martinez family truly embraces the American dream. Jose worked \nhis way through the restaurant industry to become a chef and an \nindispensable employee at a renowned restaurant. Adelene worked hard in \nhigh school and is now attending college.\n  I believe the Martinez family's presence in the United States allows \nthem to continue making significant contributions to their community in \nCalifornia.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this private bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 447\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ADJUSTMENT OF STATUS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, for the purposes of the Immigration and Nationality Act \n     (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.), Jose Alberto Martinez Moreno, \n     Micaela Lopez Martinez, and Adilene Martinez shall each be \n     deemed to have been lawfully admitted to, and remained in, \n     the United States, and shall be eligible for adjustment of \n     status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent \n     residence under section 245 of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1255) upon filing an application \n     for such adjustment of status.\n       (b) Application and Payment of Fees.--Subsection (a) shall \n     apply only if the application for adjustment of status is \n     filed with appropriate fees not later than 2 years after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Reduction of Immigrant Visa Numbers.--Upon the granting \n     of permanent resident status to Jose Alberto Martinez Moreno, \n     Micaela Lopez Martinez, and Adilene Martinez, the Secretary \n     of State shall instruct the proper officer to reduce by 3, \n     during the current or subsequent fiscal year, the total \n     number of immigrant visas that are made available to natives \n     of the country of the birth of Jose Alberto Martinez Moreno, \n     Micaela Lopez Martinez, and Adilene Martinez under section \n     202(e) or 203(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 \n     U.S.C. 1152(e) and 1153(a)), as applicable.\n       (d) PAYGO.--The budgetary effects of this Act, for the \n     purpose of complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go-Act of \n     2010, shall be determined by reference to the latest \n     statement titled ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' \n     for this Act, submitted for printing in the Congressional \n     Record by the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, \n     provided that such statement has been submitted prior to the \n     vote on passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 448. A bill for the relief of Shing Ma ``Steve'' Li; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a private \nrelief bill on behalf of Shing Ma ``Steve'' Li. Steve is a Peruvian \nnational who lives in San Francisco, California. He was brought to the \nUnited States as a child and is now a student at City College of San \nFrancisco hoping to become a nurse.\n  I decided to introduce a private bill on Steve's behalf because I \nbelieve that Steve would suffer undue hardship if he were removed to \nPeru. Without this legislation, Steve would be separated from his \nfamily and his community, and returned to a country he does not know.\n  Steve was only 12 years old when his parents brought him to the \nUnited States. Steve's parents are Chinese nationals who originally \nfled China to escape economic oppression and the Chinese government's \npolicies on reproductive rights. From China, his parents went to Peru, \nwhere Steve was born.\n  The family then sought asylum in the United States, which was denied. \nSteve was ordered removed to Peru, where he was born, while his parents \nwere ordered removed to China, the country of their nationality. \nSteve's parents would not be able to accompany their son to Peru.\n  Steve's parents never told him about the asylum denial or the removal \norders. Steve did not know that he was in the United States illegally, \nand he went through all of his teenage years in the United States \nbelieving he was legally allowed to be here. He did not learn about his \ndeportation order until one morning this past September when \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrived at his home and took \nhim into custody.\n  All too often, youngsters like Steve are put in the position of being \nreturned to a country they do not know. These young people did not make \nthe choice to come to the United States but were brought to this \ncountry by their parents. Many of these young people grew up in America \nand have little or no memory of the countries they came from. They are \nhard working young people dedicated to their education. They have \nstayed out of trouble. Some are valedictorians and honor roll students. \nMany are community leaders and have an unwavering commitment to serving \nthe United States.\n  I hoped that the Senate would pass the DREAM Act last year to provide \nqualified young people the opportunity to contribute to this country \nand their communities. Unfortunately, the bill fell short of the 60 \nvotes it needed to move forward. I hope the Senate will one day pass \nthe DREAM Act. The legislation I am introducing today will provide one \nof these youngsters the opportunity give back to the country he calls \nhome.\n  Steve attended George Washington High School in San Francisco, \nCalifornia. While there, he was enrolled in the Honor's Program and \nbecame very involved in his high school community. Steve was an athlete \non the cross country and track team. He worked for the school newspaper \nas a reporter, editor, and cameraman. Demonstrating his desire to \neducate his community on health issues, Steve also provided \npresentations to other students through his high school's wellness \nprogram on the risks of drinking and driving and sexually transmitted \ndiseases.\n  Steve graduated high school in 2008 and enrolled at City College of \nSan Francisco to pursue a career in nursing. City College of San \nFrancisco awarded Steve the Goldman Scholarship to cover the cost of \nhis tuition. Steve has continued his active involvement in his \ncommunity, joining the Asian American Student Success Center, as well \nas the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Program, which \nis a 2-year outreach and educational support program.\n  Steve continued his commitment to academic achievement when he \nattended the San Francisco State University Summer Science Institute, \nwhich provided a year-long internship to prepare him for a career in \nhealth care upon his graduation from college.\n  Educators working with Steve highlight his potential for giving back \nto the United States, while Steve's friends and other community members \nhave contacted me about the impact his compassion and helpfulness has \nhad on the community. Steve's teachers call him a ``great student,'' \n``hard working,'' ``an exceptional student,'' and ``goal directed.''\n  This private bill is an opportunity for Steve to finish his education \nand remain in the country he considers his only home. If he were forced \nto relocate to Peru, his education would be cut short, and Steve would \nbe sent to a place where he knows no one. I believe that, by staying in \nCalifornia, Steve will only continue to serve his community and serve \nthis country as a health care professional.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this private bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 448\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill for the relief of Joseph Gabra and Sharon Kamel; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today, I am reintroducing private \nrelief legislation on behalf of Joseph Gabra and Sharon Kamel, a couple \nliving with their family in Camarillo, California.\n  Joseph and Sharon are nationals of Egypt who fled their home country \nover twelve years ago after being targeted for their religious \ninvolvement in the Christian Coptic Church in Egypt. They became \ninvolved with this church during the 1990s, Joseph as an accountant and \nproject coordinator helping to build community facilities and Sharon as \nthe church's training director in human resources.\n  Unfortunately, Joseph and Sharon were also subjected to threats and \nabuse. Joseph was jailed repeatedly because of his involvement with the \nchurch. Sharon's family members were violently targeted, including her \ncousin who was murdered and her brother whose business was firebombed. \nWhen Sharon became pregnant with her first child, she was threatened by \na member of a different religious organization against raising her \nchild in a non-Muslim faith.\n  Joseph and Sharon came to the United States legally seeking refuge in \nNovember 1998. They immediately notified authorities of their intent to \nseek protection in the United States, filing for political asylum in \nMay 1999.\n  However, Joseph, who has a speech impediment, had difficulty \ncommunicating why he was afraid to return to Egypt, and one year later \ntheir asylum application was denied because they could not adequately \nestablish that they were victims of persecution. Joseph and Sharon \npursued the appropriate means for appealing this decision, to no avail.\n  It should be noted that sometime later Sharon's brother applied for \nasylum in the United States. He, too, applied on the basis of \npersecution he and his family faced in Egypt, but his application was \napproved and he was granted this status in the United States.\n  There are no other avenues for Joseph and Sharon to pursue relief \nhere in the United States. If they are deported, they will be forced \nback to a country where they sincerely fear for their safety.\n  Since arriving in the United States more than twelve years ago, \nJoseph and Sharon have built a family here, including four children who \nare United States citizens: Jessica, age 12, Rebecca, age 11, Rafael, \nage 10, and Veronica, age 6. Jessica, Rebecca, and Rafael attend school \nin California and maintain good grades. Veronica is attending \nkindergarten at Camarillo Heights Elementary School.\n  Joseph and Sharon worked hard to achieve financial security for their \nchildren, and they created a meaningful place for their family in \nCalifornia. Both earned college degrees in Egypt. Joseph, who has his \nCertified Public Accountant license, has been working in the accounting \ndepartment for a technology company in California.\n  Joseph also volunteers for his son's Boy Scout Troop, and has \nexpressed interest in pursuing opportunities as an Arabic language \nexpert here in the United States. Joseph and Sharon carry strong \nsupport from friends, co-workers, members of their local church, and \nother Californians who attest to their good character and community \ncontributions.\n  I am concerned that the entire family would face serious and \nunwarranted hardships if forced to relocate to Egypt. For Jessica, \nRebecca, Rafael, and Veronica, the only home they know is in the United \nStates. It is quite possible these four American children would face \ndiscrimination or worse in Egypt on account of their religion, as was \nthe experience of many of their family members.\n  Joseph and Sharon have made a compelling plea to remain in the United \nStates. These parents emphasize their commitment to supporting their \nchildren and making a healthy and productive place for them to grow up \nin California. I believe this family deserves that opportunity.\n  I respectfully ask my colleagues to support this private relief bill \non behalf of Joseph Gabra and Sharon Kamel.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 449\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ADJUSTMENT OF STATUS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, for the purposes of the Immigration and Nationality Act \n     (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.), Joseph Gabra and Sharon Kamel shall \n     each be deemed to have been lawfully admitted to, and \n     remained in, the United States, and shall be eligible for \n     adjustment of status to that of an alien lawfully admitted \n     for permanent residence under section 245 of the Immigration \n     and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1255) upon filing an \n     application for such adjustment of status.\n       (b) Application and Payment of Fees.--Subsection (a) shall \n     apply only if the application for adjustment of status is \n     filed with appropriate fees not later than 2 years after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Reduction of Immigrant Visa Numbers.--Upon the granting \n     of permanent resident status to Joseph Gabra and Sharon \n     Kamel, the Secretary of State shall instruct the proper \n     officer to reduce by 2, during the current or subsequent \n     fiscal year, the total number of immigrant visas that are \n     made available to natives of the country of birth of Joseph \n     Gabra and Sharon Kamel under section 203(a) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1153(a)), or, if \n     applicable, the total number of immigrant visas that are made \n     available to natives to the country of birth of Joseph Gabra \n     and Sharon Kamel under section 202(e) of that Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1152(e)).\n       (d) PAYGO.--The budgetary effects of this Act, for the \n     purpose of complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go-Act of \n     2010, shall be determined by reference to the latest \n     statement titled ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' \n     for this Act, submitted for printing in the Congressional \n     Record by the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, \n     provided that such statement has been submitted prior to the \n     vote on passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 450. A bill for the relief of Jacqueline W. Coats; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor to reintroduce \nprivate relief legislation on behalf of Jacqueline Coats, a widow \nliving in the San Francisco Bay Area. I rise today to ask my colleagues \nto support this legislation in the 112th Congress, which would provide \nJacqueline with the extraordinary relief I believe she deserves.\n  Jacqueline came to the United States from Kenya in 2001 on a student \nvisa to study Mass Communications at San Jose State University. In \nJanuary 2002, based on the advice she received from a college advisor, \nJacqueline attempted to transfer to City College of San Francisco, \nwhich required her to file for reinstatement. However, the request for \nreinstatement was denied in October 2002, and Jacqueline's immigration \nstatus lapsed the following year.\n  Jacqueline married Marlin Coats, an American citizen, on April 17, \n2006, at San Francisco City Hall. But not even a month after the \nmarriage, on May 13, 2006, Jacqueline's husband died while heroically \nattempting to save two boys from drowning at Ocean Beach in San \nFrancisco. The two children survived with the help of a rescue crew, \nbut Mr. Coats was caught in a riptide and died. The sudden and \nunexpected loss of her husband devastated Jacqueline.\n  Unfortunately, a loophole in U.S. immigration laws meant that \nJacqueline's status in the United States was suddenly in jeopardy due \nto the death of her husband. Jacqueline and her husband had prepared \nand signed an application for a green card at their attorney's office \njust four days before Mr. Coats died. However, the petition did not get \nfiled until after his death, meaning it could no longer be considered \nvalid.\n  Jacqueline very likely would have received permanent residence in the \nUnited States were it not for the abrupt death of Mr. Coats. At the \ntime, Jacqueline received a medal honoring her husband's heroic \nactions. The San\n\n[[Page S1138]]\n\nFrancisco Board of Supervisors, the San Francisco Police Department, \nand the San Francisco chapter of the NAACP all passed resolutions in \nsupport of her remaining in the United States.\n  In 2009, I co-sponsored legislation known as the Fairness to \nSurviving Spouses Act to address this hole in U.S. immigration laws \nthat creates unnecessary hardship for foreign-born men and women--like \nJacqueline--whose immigration status is at risk when the sponsoring \nU.S. citizen spouse dies. I do not believe our immigration system \nshould penalize individuals whose earnest efforts to become permanent \nlegal residents of this country are cut short when their sponsoring \nspouse dies.\n  I was pleased that the President signed the Fairness to Surviving \nSpouses Act into law as part of a Department of Homeland Security \nappropriations bill on October 28, 2009. U.S. Citizenship and \nImmigration Services is now implementing this law, which allows widows \nof American citizens to continue to petition for permanent residency as \nlong as they can prove that they entered into their marriage in good \nfaith. Jacqueline may be eligible for this form of relief; however, I \nbelieve that a private bill remains necessary until this process can be \nfinalized.\n  Jacqueline has been a hard-working employee for a transit company in \nOakland, California, since 2004. She is taking three classes at St. \nMary's College, and she remains close with the family of her late \nhusband. For Jacqueline, the Coats family here in the United States has \nbecome her own.\n  Ramona Burton, one of Mr. Coats' siblings, wrote in a letter to me: \n``She spent her first American Christmas with us, her first American \nThanksgiving . . . I can't imagine looking around and not seeing her \nthere. She needs to be there.'' Another concerned California \nconstituent wrote to me that common fairness, morality and decency'' \nshould be the standards by which we view this case. I agree. Despite \nthe tragedy of losing her husband, Jacqueline continues to work hard, \ntake classes, and integrate herself within her community.\n  Without some form of relief, Jacqueline will be deported to Kenya, a \ncountry she has not lived in since she was 21 years old. This is never \nwhat her late husband, a citizen of the United States, intended.\n  I believe Congress should honor this family by granting Jacqueline \npermanent residency in the United States. I urge my colleagues to give \nconsideration to Jacqueline and to support this private relief \nimmigration bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 450\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS FOR JACQUELINE W. COATS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of \n     section 201 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1151), Jacqueline W. Coats shall be eligible for issuance of \n     an immigrant visa or for adjustment of status to that of an \n     alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence upon filing \n     an application for issuance of an immigrant visa under \n     section 204 of that Act (8 U.S.C. 1154) or for adjustment of \n     status to lawful permanent resident.\n       (b) Adjustment of Status.--If Jacqueline W. Coats enters \n     the United States before the filing deadline specified in \n     subsection (c), Jacqueline W. Coats shall be considered to \n     have entered and remained lawfully in the United States and \n     shall be eligible for adjustment of status under section 245 \n     of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1255) as of \n     the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Application and Payment of Fees.--Subsections (a) and \n     (b) shall apply only if the application for issuance of an \n     immigrant visa or the application for adjustment of status is \n     filed with appropriate fees not later than 2 years after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (d) Reduction of Immigrant Visa Numbers.--Upon the granting \n     of an immigrant visa or permanent residence to Jacqueline W. \n     Coats, the Secretary of State shall instruct the proper \n     officer to reduce by 1, during the current or subsequent \n     fiscal year, the total number of immigrant visas that are \n     made available to natives of the country of birth of \n     Jacqueline W.

A bill for the relief of Claudia Marquez Rico; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to \nreintroduce private relief legislation for Claudia Marquez Rico. I \nfirst introduced a private bill for Claudia back in 2006. This young \nwoman has lived in California for most of her life. She suffered \ntremendous hardship after the sudden death of her parents more than ten \nyears ago. I believe she deserves the special relief granted by a \nprivate bill.\n  Claudia was born in Jalisco, Mexico. She was only 6 years old when \nher parents brought her, and her two younger brothers, to the United \nStates.\n  Ten years ago, tragedy struck this family. Early in the morning on \nOctober 4, 2000, while driving to work, Claudia's parents were killed \nin a horrific car accident when their vehicle collided with a truck on \na rural road.\n  Suddenly orphaned, Claudia and her siblings were fortunate enough to \nhave a place to go. They were welcomed into the loving home of their \naunt, Hortencia, and uncle, Patricio, who are both United States \ncitizens. Hortencia and Patricio are active at Buen Pastor Catholic \nChurch. Patricio is a youth soccer coach. This couple raised the \nMarquez children as their own, counseling them through the loss of \ntheir parents and helping them with their school work. They became the \nlegal guardians of the Marquez children in 2001.\n  Claudia likely would have resolved her immigration status, were it \nnot for poor legal representation. The death of the Marquez parents \nmeant that Claudia and her siblings should have qualified for special \nimmigrant juvenile status. Congress created this special immigrant \nstatus to protect children under extraordinary circumstances and spare \nthem the hardship of deportation when a state court deems the children \nto be dependents as a result of abuse, abandonment, or neglect. In \nfact, Claudia's younger brother, Omar, was granted this special \nimmigrant juvenile status, providing him legal permanent residency.\n  However, the lawyer for the Marquez children failed to secure this \nrelief for Claudia. She has now reached the age of majority without \nhaving resolved her immigration status, making her ineligible for this \nspecial relief.\n  It is important to take note that the lawyer who handled this case \ncurrently faces charges on numerous counts of professional incompetence \nand moral turpitude for mishandling immigration cases. The California \nState Bar accused him of a ``despicable and far-reaching pattern of \nmisconduct.'' The Bar sought to disbar the attorney before he resigned \nwith pending charges.\n  Claudia deserved a fair chance at resolving her immigration status, \nbut her attorney's egregious behavior stripped her of this opportunity.\n  Claudia, nonetheless, finished school despite these adverse \ncircumstances. She secured a job in Redwood City, California, and she \ncurrently lives with her younger sister, Maribel, in Menlo Park, where \nthey care for their grandfather. Claudia also provides financial \nsupport to her two brothers, Jose and Omar, whenever necessary. She is \nstill active in the local community, attending San Clemente Catholic \nChurch in Hayward.\n  It would be an injustice to add to the Marquez family's misfortune by \ntearing these siblings apart. Claudia and her siblings have come to \nrely on each other in the absence of their deceased parents, and \nClaudia is clearly a central support of this family. Moreover, Claudia \nhas never visited Mexico and has no close relatives in the country. She \nwas so young when her parents brought her to the United States that she \nhas no memories of Mexico.\n  I am reintroducing a private relief bill on Claudia's behalf because \nI believe her removal from the United\n\n[[Page S1139]]\n\nStates would go against our standard of fairness and would only cause \nadditional hardship on a family that already endured so much.\n  I respectfully ask my colleagues to support this private relief \nlegislation on behalf of Claudia Marquez Rico.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 451\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS FOR CLAUDIA MARQUEZ \n                   RICO.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of \n     section 201 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1151), Claudia Marquez Rico shall be eligible for issuance of \n     an immigrant visa or for adjustment of status to that of an \n     alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence upon filing \n     an application for issuance of an immigrant visa under \n     section 204 of such Act (8 U.S.C. 1154) or for adjustment of \n     status to lawful permanent resident.\n       (b) Adjustment of Status.--If Claudia Marquez Rico enters \n     the United States before the filing deadline specified in \n     subsection (c), she shall be considered to have entered and \n     remained lawfully and, if otherwise eligible, shall be \n     eligible for adjustment of status under section 245 of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1255) as of the \n     date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Application and Payment of Fees.--Subsections (a) and \n     (b) shall apply only if the application for issuance of an \n     immigrant visa or the application for adjustment of status is \n     filed with appropriate fees not later than 2 years after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (d) Reduction of Immigrant Visa Number.--Upon the granting \n     of an immigrant visa or permanent residence to Claudia \n     Marquez Rico, the Secretary of State shall instruct the \n     proper officer to reduce by 1, during the current or \n     subsequent fiscal year, the total number of immigrant visas \n     that are made available to natives of the country of birth of \n     Claudia Marquez Rico under section 203(a) of the Immigration \n     and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1153(a)) or, if applicable, the \n     total number of immigrant visas that are made available to \n     natives of the country of birth of Claudia Marquez Rico under \n     section 202(e) of such Act (8 U.S.C. 1152(e)).\n       (e) Denial of Preferential Immigration Treatment for \n     Certain Relatives.--The natural parents, brothers, and \n     sisters of Claudia Marquez Rico shall not, by virtue of such \n     relationship, be accorded any right, privilege, or status \n     under the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et \n     seq.).\n       (f) PAYGO.--The budgetary effects of this Act, for the \n     purpose of complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go-Act of \n     2010, shall be determined by reference to the latest \n     statement titled ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' \n     for this Act, submitted for printing in the Congressional \n     Record by the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, \n     provided that such statement has been submitted prior to the \n     vote on passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 452. A bill for the relief of Alfredo Plascencia Lopez and Maria \nDel Refugio Plascencia; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer legislation to \nprovide lawful permanent residence status to Alfredo Plascencia Lopez \nand his wife, Maria del Refugio Plascencia, Mexican nationals who live \nin the San Bruno area of California.\n  I have decided to offer legislation on their behalf because I believe \nthat, without it, this hardworking couple and their five children, all \nUnited States citizens, would face extreme hardship. Their children \nwould either face separation from their parents or be forced to leave \nthe only country they know and give up on their education in the United \nStates.\n  The Plascencias have been in the United States for over 20 years. \nThey worked for years to adjust their status through appropriate legal \nchannels, but poor legal representation ruined their opportunities. The \nPlascencias' lawyer refused to return their calls or otherwise \ncommunicate with them in any way. He also failed to forward crucial \nimmigration documents, or even notify the Plascencias that he had them. \nBecause of the poor representation they received, Alfredo and Maria \nonly became aware that they had been ordered to leave the United States \nfifteen days prior to their scheduled deportation.\n  The Plascencias were shocked to learn of their attorney's \nmalfeasance, but they acted quickly to secure legitimate counsel and to \nfile the appropriate paperwork to delay their deportation to determine \nif any other legal action could be taken.\n  Since arriving in the United States in 1988, Alfredo and Maria have \nproven themselves a civic-minded couple who share our American values \nof hard work, dedication to family, and devotion to community.\n  For over 15 years, Alfredo has been gainfully employed at Vince's \nShellfish, where his dedication and willingness to learn have propelled \nhim from part-time work to a managerial position. He now oversees the \nmarket's entire packing operation and several employees.\n  The president of the market, in one of the several dozen letters I \nreceived in support of Alfredo, referred to him as ``a valuable and \nrespected employee'' who ``handles himself in a very professional \nmanner'' and serves as ``a role model'' to other employees. Others who \nhave written to me praising Alfredo's job performance refer to him as \n``gifted,'' ``trusted,'' ``honest'' and ``reliable.''\n  Maria has distinguished herself as a medical assistant at a Kaiser \nPermanente hospital in the Bay Area. Not satisfied with working as a \nmaid at a local hotel, she went to school, earned her high school \nequivalency degree, and improved her skills to become a medical \nassistant. She is now in a program to become a Licensed Vocational \nNurse. She plans to graduate next year and start a nursing program with \nKaiser to become a registered nurse.\n  Several Californians who wrote to me in support of Maria describe her \nas ``responsible,'' ``efficient,'' and ``compassionate.'' Kaiser \nPermanente's Director of Internal Medicine wrote to say that Maria is \n``an asset to the community and exemplifies the virtues we Americans \nextol: hardworking, devoted to her family, trustworthy and loyal, [and] \ninvolved in her community. She and her family are a solid example of \nthe type of immigrant that America should welcome wholeheartedly.''\n  Together, Alfredo and Maria have used their professional successes to \nrealize many of the goals dreamed of by all Americans. They saved up \nand bought a home. They own a car. They have good health care benefits, \nand they each have begun saving for retirement. They are sending their \ndaughter, Christina, age 19, to college and plan to send the rest of \ntheir children to college as well.\n  Allowing the Plascencias to remain in the United States would \npreserve their achievements and ensure that they will be able to make \nsubstantive contributions to the community in the future.\n  In addition, this bill will have a positive impact on the couple's \nUnited States citizen children, who are dedicated to pursuing their \neducations and becoming productive members of their community.\n  Christina is the Plascencias' oldest child. She is 20 years old, \nworking and taking classes at Skyline Community College and the College \nof San Mateo. She would like to be a paralegal. Erika, age 16, attends \nPeninsula High School in San Bruno and was recently named Student of \nthe Month. Erika's teachers praise her abilities and have referred to \nher as a ``bright spot'' in the classroom.\n  Alfredo and Maria also have three young children: Alfredo, Jr., age \n14, Daisy, age 9, and Juan-Pablo, age 5.\n  Removing Alfredo and Maria from the United States would be tragic for \ntheir children. The Plascencia children were born in America and \nthrough no fault of their own have been thrust into a situation that \nhas the potential to dramatically alter their lives.\n  It would be especially tragic if Erika, Alfredo, and Daisy have to \nleave the United States. They are old enough to understand that they \nare leaving their schools, their teachers, their friends, and their \nhome. They would leave everything that is familiar to them.\n  The Plascencia family would then be in Mexico without a means for \nsupporting themselves and with no place to live. The children would \nhave to acclimate to a different culture, language, and way of life.\n  The only other option would be for Alfredo and Maria to leave their \nchildren here with relatives. This separation is a choice which no \nparents should have to make.\n  I am reintroducing this legislation because I believe that the \nPlascencias will continue to make positive contributions to their \ncommunity in California and this country. The Plascencia\n\n[[Page S1140]]\n\nchildren should be given the opportunity to realize their full \npotential in the United States, with their family intact.\n  I respectfully ask my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 452\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security \nAct to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse under Medicare, Medicaid and \nCHIP, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, earlier today the Finance Committee held \na hearing to discuss the serious problems of fraud in Medicare and \nMedicaid. Over the last 9 years, the Finance Committee has held more \nthan 20 oversight hearings dealing with Medicare and Medicaid fraud. \nThese hearings highlighted the flaws in how the Federal Government \nadministers Medicare and Medicaid. They also stress the need to create \ndisincentives for those who seek to defraud these vital programs.\n  Every dollar lost to Medicare or Medicaid fraud is a dollar that is \nnot available for beneficiaries. Of course, we ought to be very \ncognizant of that considering the impending bankruptcy of Medicare. In \n2009, the Federal Government spent $502 billion on Medicare and $379 \nbillion on Medicaid. It is estimated that between $40 billion and $70 \nbillion was lost to fraud that year. However, officials from the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services and the Department of Justice \nannounced last month that their health care fraud prevention and \nenforcement efforts recovered $4 billion in fraud. So compare that $4 \nbillion with the $44 billion to $70 billion, and it means we still have \na very long way to go.\n  When it comes to public programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, it is \nclear the Federal Government needs to be more effective in combating \nwaste, fraud, and abuse. The Federal Government has simply made it too \neasy for bad actors to steal from each of these programs. It says a lot \nwhen we hear that organized crime has moved into health care fraud \nbecause it is more lucrative than organized crime. Medicare and \nMedicaid also attract more criminals because the profits of fraud \ngreatly outweigh the consequences if you get caught. Then there are \nthose who don't even get caught.\n  Taxpayer dollars should only go to bona fide providers and medical \nsuppliers. But the reimbursement system is set up so that the Federal \nGovernment pays first and asks questions later. In other words, the \nsystem is based on a program we call the pay-and-chase system.\n  Over the years, Congress has given the executive branch more \nauthority to improve enforcement of fraud, waste, and abuse laws. \nDuring health care reform, Senator Baucus and I developed a bipartisan \nset of legislative proposals to combat fraud, waste, and abuse. Many of \nthese proposals are in the bill I introduced in the last Congress, S. \n2964, the Strengthening Program Integrity and Accountability in Health \nCare Act, and many were even included in the Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act. These provisions did not draw opposition from \neither side of the aisle.\n  Tackling fraud, waste, and abuse in health care is one of the areas \nwhere there is widespread agreement. But our work does not end with the \npassage of legislation. Congress needs to keep the pressure on Federal \nofficials to do everything possible to prevent and stop fraud.\n  There is also more Congress must do in ways of reform to enhance the \ngovernment's ability to fight this fraud. We need to ensure that \nphantom doctors, pharmacies, and durable medical equipment suppliers \ncannot simply bill Medicare millions of dollars in just a few months \nand then get out of town scot-free. Health and Human Services and the \nCenter for Medicare and Medicaid Services need to use the tools already \navailable to them to make sure claims are legitimate before they are \npaid.\n  But even with all of that, we must remain vigilant in our oversight \nefforts, which is the constitutional responsibility of the legislative \nbranch of government, because tomorrow's criminals will find ways to \nget around the laws and regulations we put in place today. That is why \nI am introducing the Strengthening Program Integrity and Accountability \nin Health Care Act of 2011. This bill contains the remaining proposals \nfrom S. 2964 that are necessary to enhance the government's ability to \ncombat Medicare and Medicaid fraud. It builds on reforms we made in the \nlast Congress.\n  The bill would require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \nissue regulations to make Medicare claims and payment data available to \nthe public similar to other Federal spending disclosed through \nwww.USAspending\n.gov. This Web site lists almost all Federal spending, but it doesn't \ninclude Medicare payments made to physicians. That means virtually \nevery other government program, including even some defense spending, \nis more transparent, or responds to the citizens' right to know, than \nspending by the Medicare Program. So that differential between defense \nspending and most other government programs and what we allow the \npublic to know about the Medicare tax dollars being spent is too big of \na gap and one we should not tolerate anymore because a taxpayer dollar \nspent on Medicare isn't any different from the public's right to know \nabout a taxpayer dollar spent on defense programs. Let's say even for \nthis Senator, with my background in farming and participating in a \nfamily farm operation, the public can read in the newspapers of Iowa, \nas they can for every State, the amount of money a certain Senator--or \nI shouldn't say Senator--a certain farmer gets from the farm program. \nIt is all taxpayers' dollars.\n  In addition, this bill also goes on to create a national \nclearinghouse of information so that we can better detect, prevent, and \nthereby deter medical identity theft. This is about the Federal \nGovernment sharing information it already has in ways that protect the \ntaxpayer and work against those defrauding the system.\n  The bill would also change Federal laws that require Medicare to pay \nproviders quickly regardless of the risks of fraud, waste, and abuse. \nUnder current law, the government is required to\n\n[[Page S1141]]\n\nmake payments for what is called a clean claim within 14 to 30 days \nbefore interest accrues on the claim. That is not enough time for the \nlimited number of Medicare auditors to determine if a claim is \nlegitimate before a payment has to be made. The result is that this \nwhat we call prompt-payment rule requires that Medicare pay bad actors \nfirst and ask questions later, which leads to that pay-and-chase system \nI previously mentioned.\n  So this bill would add to the tools Congress provided to the \nexecutive branch last year to prevent fraudulent payment on the front \nend. It would extend the time payments must be made if the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services determines there is a likelihood of fraud, \nwaste, and abuse.\n  In addition, the bill would expand the Health and Human Services \ninspector general's authority to exclude an individual from \nparticipating in the Federal health care program. I wish to give an \nexample. The inspector general would be able to exclude an individual \nif the individual had ownership or control interests in an entity at \nthe time the entity engaged in misconduct such as health care fraud. \nNow, I know that is common sense to the taxpayers of America, but it is \nnot something the inspector general can do today.\n  I still have other areas my bill addresses, and one is in the area of \nillegal, unapproved drugs. Just last week, the Los Angeles Times \nreported that the Food and Drug Administration is struggling to keep \nunapproved drugs off the market. It reported that ``in many cases, the \nagency doesn't even know what the drugs are or where they are.'' This \nis another example of how the Federal reimbursement system creates an \nincentive for bad actors to get around the rules.\n  In this case, those rules are the Food and Drug Administration \nrequirements for putting a drug on the market.\n  Medicaid pays until the Food and Drug Administration identifies a \ndrug or class of drugs as not approved for marketing and then takes \nformal action.\n  Under such circumstances, the Federal Government doesn't even have \nthe option to chase after the previous payments.\n  My bill would stop such payments, unless the State Medicaid Programs \nfirst verify with the Food and Drug Administration that the drug is \nbeing legally marketed.\n  Again, that may sound like common sense, but it is something that \ncan't be done without a change in the law.\n  The changes I am proposing would go a long way to deter those who \nwould defraud our health care system. It also would provide greater \nprotections to the taxpayers.\n  Fighting fraud, waste, and abuse in Medicare and Medicaid is vital to \nthe sustainability of each program. My bill will help add to the \nreforms we passed last year. It will fix some of the blatant problems \nthat incentivize and reward waste, fraud, and abuse. Over 100 million \nAmericans rely on Medicare and Medicaid for health insurance.\n  Right now, these programs, as we all know--every Member of the Senate \nknows and most of the public knows--these programs are on an \nunsustainable path. My bill takes necessary steps to move these \nprograms toward sustainability.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and help me by \ncosponsoring it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 455. A bill to promote development and opportunity with regards to \nspectrum occupancy and use, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senator Kerry, to \nre-introduce comprehensive spectrum reform legislation to modernize our \nnation's radio spectrum planning, management, and coordination \nactivities. Taking this corrective action will allow us to meet the \nfuture telecommunications needs of all spectrum users. For consumers, \nthese fixes will lead to additional choices, greater innovation, lower \nprices, and more reliable services.\n  Over the past year, there has been growing concern about a looming \nradio spectrum crisis. It is not without reason--growth and innovation \nwithin spectrum-based services have exploded over the past decade. In \nparticular, the cellular industry has been a prominent driver of this \nexpansion. Currently, there are more than 290 million wireless \nsubscribers in the U.S., and American consumers use more than 6.4 \nbillion minutes of air time per day.\n  While the foundation for wireless services has been voice \ncommunication, more subscribers are utilizing it for broadband through \nthe use of smartphones and netbooks--smartphones actually outsold \npersonal computers in the last quarter of 2010. According to the Pew \nResearch Center, 56 percent of adult Americans have accessed the \nInternet via a wireless device. ABI Research forecasts there will be \n150 million mobile broadband subscribers by 2014--a 2,900 percent \nincrease from 2007. Spectrum is so important that both the Federal \nCommunications Commission and the President have made it a priority to \nfind additional spectrum for wireless broadband so providers have the \nnecessary capacity to meet the growing demand of consumers and \nbusinesses alike.\n  There are constraints however, spectrum is a finite resource, and we \ncannot manufacture new spectrum. Making matters worse, the government's \ncurrent spectrum management framework is inefficient and has not kept \nup with technological advancements. As evidence, the Government \nAccountability Office, in a series of reports, concluded ``the current \nstructure and management of spectrum use in the U.S. does not encourage \nthe development and use of some spectrum efficient technologies.''\n  The legislation we are re-introducing today fixes the fundamental \ndeficiencies that exist in spectrum management and promotes efforts to \nimprove spectrum efficiency. Specifically, the Reforming Airwaves by \nDeveloping Incentives and Opportunistic Sharing, RADIOS, Act tasks the \nFCC and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, \nNTIA, to conduct the fundamental first step of a comprehensive \ninventory of radio spectrum and to perform much-needed spectrum \nmeasurements to determine actual usage and occupancy rates. This data \nwould provide decision makers at the FCC, NTIA, and Congress a clearer, \nmore detailed, and up-to-date understanding of how spectrum is \ncurrently being used and by whom--data essential to sound policy \ndecisions and spectrum management.\n  The bill also requires a cost-benefit analysis of spectrum relocation \nopportunities to move certain incumbent users and services to more \nefficient spectrum bands. Many legacy wireless services could employ \nnewer technologies to provide more efficient use of spectrum. The \nlegislation would also establish Wi-Fi hot-spots and allow the \ninstallation of wireless antenna systems and base stations, such as \nfemtocells, in all publicly accessible Federal buildings as well as \nstreamline Federal rights-of-way and wireless tower sitings on Federal \nbuildings. Such efforts would improve wireless and broadband coverage \nfor Americans and also result in lower costs to taxpayers since \nspectrum would be utilized more effectively by Federal agencies.\n  In addition, my bill requires greater collaboration between the FCC \nand NTIA on spectrum policy and management related issues, \nimplementation of spectrum sharing and reuse programs, as well as more \nmarket-based incentives to promote efficient spectrum use. It also sets \na deadline for the creation of the National Strategic Spectrum Plan, \nwhich will provide a long-term vision for domestic spectrum use and \nstrategies to meet those needs. While the National Broadband Plan \ntouches on several of these areas, this legislation will provide \ngreater assistance in developing the 21st Century comprehensive \nspectrum policy necessary to meet the future spectrum needs of all \nusers.\n  It should be noted the RADIOS Act is intended to complement the \nNational Broadband Plan and the recently announced Presidential \nWireless Initiative in promoting more efficient use of spectrum and \nensuring that the proper framework is in place to meet America's future \ntelecommunications needs. But it also encourages greater focus on other \nareas outside the Plan and the Initiative by promoting technological \ninnovation and more robust spectrum management.\n\n[[Page S1142]]\n\n  Senator Kerry and I envision this legislation to be a supplement to \nother legislative efforts related to spectrum. And we look forward to \nworking with our colleagues in the Senate and with all stakeholders to \nadvance comprehensive 21st Century spectrum policy necessary to meet \nthe future spectrum needs of all users.\n  Our Nation's competitiveness, economy, and national security demand \nthat we allocate the necessary attention to this policy shortcoming--it \nis the only way we will be able to avert a looming spectrum crisis and \ncontinue to realize the boundless benefits of spectrum-based services. \nThat is why I sincerely hope that my colleagues will join Senator Kerry \nand me in supporting this critical legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. RISCH (for himself, Mr. Coburn, Mr. DeMint, Mr. Lee, and \n        Mr. Johnson of Wisconsin):\n  S. 460. A bill to prohibit the Secretary of Education from \npromulgating or enforcing regulations or guidance regarding gainful \nemployment; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by my colleagues, \nSenators Coburn, DeMint, Johnson and Lee, in introducing the Education \nfor All Act. This important piece of legislation would preserve \neducational and economic opportunities for all Americans.\n  The U.S. Department of Education is proposing new ``gainful \nemployment'' rules that would deny federal financial aid to students \nwho attend proprietary colleges and vocational certificate programs. \nThese rules would disqualify students from receiving federal education \nloans if their chosen programs do not meet a complex formula comparing \nstudent debt to future earning potential. Why should students be \ndiscouraged from attending a school they want or a profession they \nchose because of Washington bureaucrats?\n  The bill I am introducing today would prohibit these regulations from \ngoing into effect.\n  The ``gainful employment'' rules could deny hundreds of thousands of \nstudents access to the training and skills development they need to \nsecure a job in today's troubled economy. There is high demand in some \nsectors for highly skilled workers and propriety schools are uniquely \nqualified to meet the training needs of these employers. It is simply \nirresponsible for the government to throw roadblocks in front of \nstudents and institutions at a time when job creation in America should \nbe the administration's number one priority.\n  Further, the ``gainful employment'' rules will disproportionately \nharm low-income and minority students. These students often depend more \nheavily on education loans regardless of the type of institution they \nattend and take longer to repay.\n  The rules would also significantly impact health care programs. \nNearly half of all health care workers are trained at proprietary \nschools. With an aging baby boom population, demand for trained health \ncare providers is already critical and will only get worse. President \nObama's health care law adds to this burden as well. We ought to be \nexpanding educational capacity for health care workers, not enacting \nregulations that threaten access.\n  In short, this legislation will preserve educational and economic \nopportunities for all Americans. I urge all of my colleagues to support \nthis bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 460\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Education for All Act of \n     2011''.\n\n     SEC. 2. GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary \n     of Education may not use any Federal funds to--\n       (1) implement, administer, or enforce the final regulations \n     on ``Program Integrity: Gainful Employment--New Programs'' \n     published by the Department of Education in the Federal \n     Register on October 29, 2010 (75 Fed. Reg. 66665 et seq.);\n       (2) issue a final rule or otherwise implement the proposed \n     rule on ``Program Integrity: Gainful Employment'' published \n     by the Department of Education on July 26, 2010 (75 Fed.

A bill to better protect, serve, and advance the rights of \nvictims of elder abuse and exploitation by establishing a program to \nencourage States and other qualified entities to create jobs designed \nto hold offenders accountable, enhance the capacity of the justice \nsystem to investigate, pursue, and prosecute elder abuse cases, \nidentify existing resources to leverage to the extent possible, and \nassure data collection, research, and evaluation to promote the \nefficacy and efficiency of the activities described in this Act; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Blumenthal, \nSherrod Brown, Casey, Gillibrand, Mikulski and Bill Nelson to introduce \nthe Elder Abuse Victims Act of 2011. This legislation creates in the \nDepartment of Justice an Office of Elder Justice, OEJ, that will \nprotect America's seniors by strengthening law enforcement's response \nto elder abuse. The OEJ will provide leadership, training materials and \nother needed information to prosecutors, law enforcement, adult \nprotective services and others, in order to build a robust \ninfrastructure to effectively address elder abuse. Additionally, the \nbill will encourage states to set up multidisciplinary teams where \ninformation and resources are shared in order to better serve the \nvictims of elder abuse.\n  The plight of vulnerable seniors is a subject of great concern. Elder \nabuse is often hidden from sight by the victims themselves. Even so, \nexperts conservatively estimate that as many as two million Americans \nage 65 and older have been injured, exploited, or otherwise mistreated \nby someone on whom they depend for care or protection.\n  As Federal policymakers, it is time that we step forward and tackle \nthis challenge with dedicated efforts and more vigorous programs that \nwill make fighting elder abuse as important a priority as ongoing \nefforts to counter child abuse.\n  We need to provide assistance to our courts, which would benefit from \nhaving access to designated staff that has particular knowledge and \nexpertise in elder abuse. Specialized protocols may be required where \nvictims are unable to testify on their own behalf, due to cognitive \nimpairments or poor physical health. And there is a great need for \nspecialized knowledge that will support successful prosecutions and \nenhance the development of case law. Today, many state elder abuse \nstatutes lack adequate provisions to encourage wide reporting of abuse \nand exploitation, more thorough investigations, and greater prosecution \nof abuse cases.\n  For the victims of elder abuse, many of whom are physically frail and \nvery frightened, we must do much more. First and foremost, we must be \nmore responsive. Not too long ago, it was difficult to even get an \nabuse case investigated. While that is starting to change, we have much \nmore work to do. Sometimes, for example, emergency interventions may be \nneeded, particularly if the older person is being harmed at the hands \nof family members or trusted ``friends.'' It may be necessary to remove \nthe older adult from his or her home to a temporary safe haven. To do \nthis, we must build a much more robust infrastructure.\n  This legislation, strongly supported by the Elder Justice Coalition, \nwill go a long way toward improving the ability of law enforcement, \nprosecutors and other government agencies to respond to abuse of older \nAmericans.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n[[Page S1143]]\n\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 462\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a grant program to enhance training and \nservices to prevent abuse in later life; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Blumenthal, \nSherrod Brown, and Casey to introduce the End Abuse in Later Life Act \nof 2011. This legislation improves the provisions in the existing \nViolence Against Women Act dealing with abuse in later life by \nenhancing direct services for victims and increasing the kinds of \nexperts who participate in multidisciplinary training programs.\n  Abuse in later life is a sad and growing problem in our society. \nExperts conservatively estimate that 14.1 percent of older Americans \nhave been injured, exploited, or otherwise mistreated by someone on \nwhom they depend for care or protection each year. This type of abuse \nis especially disturbing because the victims are often physically \nfrail, defenseless, and very frightened.\n  It is time that we take action on the Federal level to protect older \nAmericans who fall victim to physical, financial, sexual and emotional \nabuse. We can do this by training law enforcement, prosecutors, \ngovernmental agencies, victim advocates, and relevant court officers to \nrecognize and address instances of abuse in later life. This \nlegislation also encourages cross-training of these groups and \nmultidisciplinary collaborative community efforts in order to better \nserve victims.\n  By passing this legislation, we will ensure that abuse later in life \nis given the serious consideration it deserves and make great strides \nto protect one of the most vulnerable populations in America. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 464\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``End Abuse in Later Life Act \n     of 2011''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Con Res. 9\n\n       Whereas United Nations Resolution 64/169, adopted by the \n     General Assembly on December 18, 2009, designates the year \n     2011 as the ``International Year for People of African \n     Descent'';\n       Whereas the African Diaspora is expansive, spanning across \n     the globe from Latin America and the Caribbean to Asia, with \n     persons of African descent living on every continent, \n     including Europe;\n       Whereas the historical bonds and shared experiences that \n     tie the African continent with the world must be recalled;\n       Whereas the global contributions of people of African \n     descent must be recognized as a means of preserving that \n     heritage;\n       Whereas the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted \n     Resolution 64/169 with a view to strengthening national \n     actions and regional and international cooperation for the \n     benefit of people of African descent in relation to--\n       (1) the full enjoyment of economic, cultural, social, \n     civil, and political rights for people of African descent;\n       (2) the participation and integration of people of African \n     descent in all political, economic, social, and cultural \n     aspects of society; and\n       (3) the promotion of greater knowledge of, and respect for, \n     the diverse heritage and culture of people of African \n     descent; and\n       Whereas the Helsinki Final Act resulting from the \n     Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe in 1975 \n     states that ``participating States will respect human rights \n     and fundamental freedoms (. . .) for all without distinction \n     as to race, sex, language, or religion;'': Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of the designation of the \n     year of 2011 as the International Year for People of African \n     Descent;\n       (2) encourages the recognition and celebration of the \n     collective history and achievements made by people of African \n     descent;\n       (3) reaffirms the importance of inclusion and the full and \n     equal participation of people of African descent around the \n     world in all aspects of political, economic, social, and \n     cultural life;\n       (4) continues to support bilateral and multilateral efforts \n     to promote democracy, human rights, the rule of law, and the \n     eradication of poverty, hunger, inequality, and social \n     exclusion; and\n       (5) reaffirms the commitment of Congress to address racism, \n     discrimination, and intolerance in the United States and \n     around the globe.\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today at the close of Black History \nMonth to introduce this concurrent resolution that supports the \ncontinued recognition of persons of African descent throughout the year \nboth here and abroad. This resolution commemorates the United Nations \ndesignation of 2011 as the International Year for People of African \nDescent such that we can continue to honor and recognize the \ncontributions of African-Americans and others to our societies beyond \nBlack History Month.\n  On December 10, 2010, Secretary General Ban Ki-moon launched the \nInternational Year for People of African Descent to ``promote greater \nawareness of and respect for the diverse heritage and culture of people \nof African descent.''\n  We should view this year not only as an opportunity to celebrate the \ndiversity of our societies, but also to honor the vast contributions \npersons of African descent make every day to the economic, social and \npolitical fabric of our communities--be they in Africa, Latin America, \nEurope, or right here at home in the United States.\n  It is also necessary that we recognize the global impact of the slave \ntrade. As Secretary Hillary Clinton noted in her recognition of this \nyear, ``[this is a time] to remember our hemisphere's shameful history \nof slavery and to reaffirm our commitment to eradicate racism and \nreduce inequality wherever it lingers.''\n  All too often, persons of African descent in this country and abroad \nface discrimination and disadvantage. We must not only do more at home, \nbut also partner with others around the globe to address these \nproblems.\n  In the Senate, I have led efforts to strengthen the civil rights of \nAfrican-Americans and others from hate crimes prevention to voting \nrights. As Co-Chairman of the Helsinki Commission, I have worked to \nsupport the ideals enshrined in the 1975 Helsinki Final Act to \n``respect human rights and fundamental freedoms . . . for all without \ndistinction as to race, sex, language, or religion.''\n  This has included supporting efforts to raise awareness of the \nspecific situation of the estimated seven to nine million persons of \nAfrican descent in Europe following increased incidents of hate crimes, \nracial profiling, and other forms of discrimination amidst economic \ncrisis, national security, and immigration concerns.\n  As we mark the International Year for People of African Descent, I \nask that you join me in my work promoting equality, opportunity, \nunderstanding, and respect at home and around the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/02/senate-section/article/S1145-2", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1145-S1146]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 133.
