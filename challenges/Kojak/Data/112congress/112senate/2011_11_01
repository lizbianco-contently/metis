This week, Democrats introduced legislation that will put \nAmericans back to work rebuilding this Nation's crumbling \ninfrastructure. It will allow us to hire thousands of people to upgrade \n150,000 miles of roadways, thousands of miles of train tracks, and \nmodernize our Nation's runways and air traffic control systems. The \nRebuild America Jobs Act will invest $50 billion to ensure that our \nworld-class economy has world-class infrastructure and get this economy \nworking again.\n  This is not a new issue. It is something that is long overdue. A \nnumber of years ago, I conducted a hearing in the\n\n[[Page S6932]]\n\nPublic Works Committee, where we brought in mayors from around the \ncountry, from Atlanta, Washington, DC, and other places around the \ncountry. They lamented the sorry state of the infrastructure. Sadly, in \nthose approximately 10 years, nothing has been done--nothing.\n  This commonsense plan we have proposed has enjoyed broad bipartisan \nsupport in the past. Many of my Republican colleagues in the Senate \nhave spoken glowingly about what infrastructure investments could do to \nput people back to work and improve the economy in their States. Yet \nthis week Republicans have raised a hue and cry against our plan \nbecause it has millionaires and billionaires--those whose income is \nmore than $1 million--to contribute their fair share to right our \nlisting economy.\n  We don't cast a net over millionaires and billionaires, only those \nwho make more than $1 million a year. The plan would require the \nrichest of the rich in America to contribute a tiny fraction of income \nto that effort. They would pay a seven-tenths of 1 percent surtax on \nincome in excess of $1 million a year. If someone made $1.1 million a \nyear income, they would have to pay an additional $700 to put America \nback to work.\n\n  Yet my Republican colleagues adamantly oppose this fair and balanced \napproach because it would require Americans who have done better each \nyear for decades to contribute a tiny fraction more than they do now. \nThese people are the top two-tenths of 1 percent of American \ntaxpayers--two-tenths of 1 percent, the richest of the rich. Yet \nRepublicans have put the interests of these millionaires and \nbillionaires ahead of those who are desperate for work, and it has cost \nthis Nation literally millions of jobs.\n  It is important that we be clear about who these lucky few \nmillionaires and billionaires are who enjoy the protections of the \nSenate GOP. Who are they? Here is who they are: the same millionaires \nand billionaires whose annual aftertax income has increased by 275 \npercent over the last 3 decades--I repeat, 275 percent. That is not a \nfigure made up out of the blue by some rightwing or leftwing \norganization. It came from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. \nThese are the same millionaires and billionaires whose annual aftertax \nincome has increased by 275 percent over the last 3 decades.\n  Between 1979 and 2007, the bottom 20 percent of wage earners saw \ntheir wages creep up slowly--18 percent. Meantime, the top 1 percent \nsaw theirs double again and again and again, to almost a 300-percent \nincrease. The bottom 20 percent of wage earners saw theirs go up 18 \npercent. The people I have talked about--the millionaires and \nbillionaires--have gone up almost 300 percent. In fact, their share of \nthe Nation's income is higher than at any time since 1928--just before \nthe stock market crash, plunging this Nation into the Great Depression. \nTheir share of the national income has doubled since 1979. Listen to \nthis. And now they take home more than half of all the money earned \neach year in this great country, even after taxes. They take home more \nthan half the money earned each year in this country. That means this 1 \npercent now makes more than the other 99 percent combined. And they are \nnot going to allow us to proceed to create hundreds of thousands of \njobs for a tax increase of seven-tenths of 1 percent on the richest of \nthe rich? No one deprives them of their prosperity. They have worked \nhard, and it hasn't all been inherited money. We understand that. But \ntheir tremendous fortunes mean they can afford to contribute a tiny \nfraction more to shore up the economic future of our Nation.\n  John D. Rockefeller, Jr., the grandfather of Jay Rockefeller from \nWest Virginia, who serves in this body today, said:\n\n       Every right implies a responsibility; every opportunity, an \n     obligation; every possession, a duty.\n\n  Seventy-two percent of Americans, including 54 percent of \nRepublicans, support the Democrats' plan to pull this Nation out of the \nworse recession we have seen since the Great Depression by investing in \nnew roadways, runways, and railways. And 76 percent of Americans, \nincluding 56 percent of Republicans, agree the Nation's most privileged \ncitizens should contribute a little more to help pay for it. Democrats, \nRepublicans, Independents, and even the tea party favor this. They all \nbelieve in initiatives that we have proposed to jumpstart our economy, \nbut they know the money will have to come from somewhere. They know \ntough choices must be made. The world out there supports what we are \ntrying to do. The world inside this body, with the 47 Republicans who \nare stopping us with obstructionist tactics, is not allowing what \nAmerica knows they want and need.\n  Again, they believe in initiatives we have proposed to jumpstart our \neconomy. They know the money will have to come from somewhere, and they \nknow tough choices must be made.\n  Asking someone making, for example, $1.1 million to contribute a few \ndollars more every year should not be one of our tough choices; it \nshould be a no-brainer. Yet while Democrats fight for the middle class, \nit seems that Republicans will fight for the 1 percent of Americans who \nhave every resource in America to fight for themselves.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/01/senate-section/article/S6932-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6932]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Everyone in this Chamber talks\n\n[[Page S6933]]\n\nabout job growth, as we should--some of us want to do some more \nspecific things than others perhaps--but we have to ask the question: \nIf we are going to consider a 40-percent cut to rural development, how \ndoes a small town recruit a 21st-century business or support \nentrepreneurs when the best it can offer is dial-up Internet access? \nHow does a rural village in Allen County, OH, finance a $2\\1/2\\ million \nwater system without some kind of grant or loan?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I want to make sure I will have a minute to respond \nagainst the amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is correct. There is 2 minutes \nevenly divided on this amendment.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Paul] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 821 to amendment No. 738.\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be waived.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To reallocate 10 percent of the amounts appropriated for \n   capital investments in surface transportation infrastructure from \n  transportation enhancement activities to the highway bridge program)\n\n       On page 213, line 13, insert ``: Provided further, That \n     notwithstanding section 133(d)(2) of title 23, United States \n     Code, none of the funds made available under this heading may \n     be used to implement or execute transportation enhancement \n     activities: Provided further, That at least 10 percent of the \n     funds made available under this heading shall be made \n     available for the highway bridge program authorized under \n     section 144 of title 23, United States Code'' before the \n     period at the end.\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, this amendment will secure funds for \npreparing our Nation's bridges. I have stood with the President in the \nshadows of our crumbling bridges. I told the President personally that \nI would help to rebuild the bridges.\n  This amendment should be bipartisan. This amendment should be \nnoncontroversial. This amendment spends no new money and raises no new \ntaxes. This amendment simply takes funds from beautification and puts \nthem into bridges.\n  As legislators, we need to prioritize and spend money on what is most \nimportant to us. Some on the other side may like the beautification \nprojects. We like them also. But we are running a $1.5 trillion \ndeficit, and we must prioritize.\n  If we wish to fix our Nation's bridges and if we are serious about \nit, we will pass this amendment, which will immediately create a fund \nto begin fixing our Nation's bridges.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, this amendment is not about taking funds \nfrom beautification and putting them into bridges. As a matter of fact, \nwhat this amendment does is it prohibits any bridge that is a historic \nbridge from being fixed, and there are thousands of those bridges all \nover this great Nation, including the Brooklyn Bridge.\n  Second, it would tell our States they can't use these TIGR funds for \nthings they want. I know my colleague thinks it is beautification to \nhave a pedestrian or a bicycle path built. The fact is, 13 percent of \ntraffic fatalities nationwide occur because we don't have these safety \nimprovements. There were 47,000 pedestrians killed between 2000 and \n2009. That is the equivalent of a jumbo jet crashing every month. So \nthis isn't about taking money for beautification.\n  Senator Inhofe and I have worked very closely to make sure we are not \nfrivolous in what we fund.\n  Please vote this down. We have voted down a similar amendment before.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky has 3 \nseconds.\n  Mr. PAUL. Three million dollars was spent on a turtle tunnel.

Madam President, I do not think the Senate is in order. \nThis is a very important amendment. I have a bill on this amendment \nwhich is the same thing. I would ask for order.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. The EPA has banned these inhalers, even though they \nacknowledged negligible impact on the environment. My amendment just \nkeeps this rule from going into effect until the manufacturer can \ncomplete its work with the FDA to change its propellent.\n  Let's allow Americans to continue their quality of life while we \nsolve the problem. We don't need to do that this January. It will be \nsolved without the FDA enforcing this rule.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. This amendment affects the ability of people with asthma \nto purchase an inhaler that works, and the American Lung Association \nopposes this amendment. The American Thoracic Society, which is the \nexpert--these are the experts on anything to do with respiratory \ndiseases. There are 150,000 doctors who oppose this amendment.\n  I am perplexed by it because the reason we want to get away from \nthese CFCs is because Ronald Reagan signed the treaty to do away with \nthem and George W. Bush passed the rule to do away with them.\n  On behalf of the people who depend on inhalers that work right, that \ndon't use CFCs, I hope we will stand with the Lung Association and the \n150,000 doctors of the Thoracic Society.\n  I hope we will vote this down.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, how much time do I have left?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina has \n18 seconds.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Certainly, there are many doctors who want folks to come \nin and get prescriptions. There are many manufacturers who make \nprescription drugs, but let 3 million Americans access these inhalers. \nThey do not cause any problems with the environment. The EPA has \nrecognized it is negligible and the manufacturer will have this worked \nout over the next few years.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 814 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, as the leader has indicated, I will \nwithdraw this amendment at the conclusion of this colloquy, but I want \nto make sure my colleagues understand what the amendment does.\n  This amendment prohibits any funds from being used by the CFTC to \npromulgate any final rules under title VII until the agency \nsubstantiates that those rules are economically beneficial, adhere to \ncongressional intent, provide end users with a clear exemption from \nmargin requirements, and set clear bounds on the overseas application \nof derivatives requirements.\n  While there is not yet a bipartisan agreement to go forward with this \namendment at this time, there is a bipartisan list of issues that \nregulators need to address. They need to protect end users from \nburdensome margin requirements. Margin requirements proposed by \nregulators currently ignore the clear intent of Congress not to impose \nthem on end users. They need to limit the extraterritorial application \nof title VII per congressional intent in sections 722 and 764. This is \nalso being addressed in the House of Representatives. They need to \nencourage greater coordination and harmonization between the SEC, the \nCFTC, and international regulators to seek broad harmonization of \ncross-border issues, and they need to ensure that the new rules are \nsubject to robust and quantitative assessment of the costs and \nbenefits.\n  The regulators involved in our rulemaking process should know that \nCongress is going to closely monitor how they proceed, and we expect a \nchange in course. If we don't get that change in course, then we will \nneed to return to this kind of legislation.\n  I wish to thank Senator Stabenow for working with me. She and many \nother Senators across the aisle have indicated a willingness to help \ntry to achieve these objectives and to work together to try to make \nthis happen.\n  With that, I yield my time to Senator Stabenow.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Thank you, Madam President. First I wish to thank my \ncolleague for raising issues of great importance to all of us. \nFinancial regulatory reform is critically important\n\n[[Page S6935]]\n\nfor our country moving forward. Senator Crapo and I spoke earlier about \nthis amendment. We have a number of areas of shared concern and I have \ncommitted to work with him on these issues.\n  First and foremost, I agree with my friend from Idaho that we need to \nprotect our manufacturers, our rural co-ops, energy providers, and \nother companies that use financial products to manage their legitimate \nbusiness risks. These end users did not cause the financial crisis. So \nwhen we passed Wall Street reform, we included protections for them.\n  We have held several hearings in the Agriculture Committee to \nreinforce to the regulators that manufacturers and others need to be \nprotected. We will continue to do that oversight.\n  We certainly agree that as new rules are written, we need have an \nopen and transparent process. I believe the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission has created, in fact, an open and transparent process and \nhas worked to improve that process over time. They have held \nroundtables, sought public comment, and are making changes based on \nthose comments to ensure that the new rules work. But it is important \nthat Congress continues to work with the agencies to get these rules \nright. We also expect the agencies to work with each other and with \ntheir international counterparts. We need to make sure rules are robust \nand consistent across international borders, avoiding a regulatory race \nto the bottom while using ``mutual recognition'' as a guidepost. Most \nimportantly, the agencies need to create these rules in a way that \nprovides businesses with market certainty. To that end, we will be \nholding another oversight hearing in the next few weeks.\n  It is important that we continue to urge the regulators to be mindful \nof the effects that these rules will have on American businesses. It is \nalso important to remember that we passed reform because of the serious \nconsequences of the financial crisis. Millions of families lost their \nhomes, countless businesses shuttered, 8 million jobs lost. We need to \nensure that the rules are not written in a way that creates incentives \nfor banks to move their operations overseas to avoid oversight--we \nshare that concern. We definitely need to get the rules right and keep \nthe jobs here in America.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Ms. STABENOW. As I have told my colleague, I will continue to work \nwith him on these important issues.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, The amendment prohibits any funds from \nbeing used by the CFTC to promulgate any final rules under Title VII \nuntil the agency substantiates that those rules are economically \nbeneficia1, adheres to congressional intent to provide end-users with a \nclear exemption from margin requirements, and sets clear bounds on the \noverseas application of the derivatives requirements.\n\n  While there is not yet bipartisan agreement to go forward with this \namendment at this time, there is a bipartisan list of issues that the \nregulators need to address:\n  Protect end-users from burdensome margin requirements. Margin \nrequirements proposed by regulators currently ignore the clear intent \nof Congress not to impose margin on end users.\n  Limit the extraterritorial application of title VII per Congressional \nintent in Sections 722 and 764. In the House of Representatives \nbipartisan legislation was just introduced that sets clear bounds on \noverseas application of the derivatives requirements, while allowing \nregulators to stop systemically dangerous transactions intended to \nevade U.S. requirements.\n  Encourage greater coordination and harmonization between the SEC, \nCFTC, and international regulators to seek broad harmonization of \ncross-border issues.\n  Ensure new rules are subject to robust and quantitative assessment of \ncosts and benefits.\n  The regulators involved in the rulemaking process should understand \nthat Congress is going to closely monitor how they proceed and we \nexpect a change in course.\n  If the regulators ignore congressional intent and fail to adequately \nharmonize their rules with each other and with their foreign \ncounterparts, then it is my intention to revisit this amendment and \npush for a vote.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment be \nwithdrawn.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I am pleased that Senator Crapo has \nwithdrawn his amendment, No. 814. I would have opposed this amendment \nbecause it would have brought to a screeching halt the financial \nreforms Congress recently enacted to end Wall Street abuses, because it \nwould weaken capital and margin requirements to limit risk, and because \nit would add to the law multiple layers of complexity.\n  Congress enacted the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer \nProtection Act to put a cop back on the Wall Street beat. It ended the \ndecades of deregulation that helped unleash the forces of self-dealing \nand conflicts of interest that thrust our economy into the recession \nfrom which we are still digging out.\n  The Crapo amendment would have forced the key Federal banking, \ncommodities and securities regulators to stop issuing all regulations \nto implement the Dodd-Frank law until they issued a host of studies. It \nwould have buried financial reform under an unprecedented regulatory \nprocedure requiring piles of new paperwork. The new procedures and \nstudies could have required years of additional delay, when Congress \nhas already decided that financial reforms are needed now to protect \nthe public from high risk financial activities. That was reason enough \nto oppose the Crapo amendment.\n  Second, the Crapo amendment would have weakened a key set of reforms \ncontained in the Dodd-Frank Act, requiring capital and margin \nrequirements to reduce risk in the shadowy market in derivatives. Now, \njust as rules requiring increased transparency and accountability are \nstarting to become a reality, some have decided that they prefer the \nderivatives market the way it was before.\n  Some too quickly forget exactly why we need transparency, \naccountability, and reduced risk. So let me remind us all about AIG. A \nsmall unit, based in London and buried within the bowels of AIG, nearly \nbrought about the collapse of the firm, and with it, the world economy. \nThey sold a type of derivative called a credit default swap. Lots of \nthem. While they got paid for taking on the risk behind those swaps, \nthey had insufficient reserves to pay off the bets if they lost. Later, \nwhen all of those swaps went bad, they simply did not have the funds to \npay off their bets. And only AIG knew how much it owed to whom, because \nthe swaps market had no transparency. Federal regulators were \nprohibited by law from overseeing swaps.\n  Worse yet, Federal regulators could not just let AIG fail, because \nthe losses to those on the other side of their bets could have brought \nthem down as well. A global nightmare caused by one small unit of one \ncompany, allowed to run wild by selling a ton of swaps without the \nreserves to pay off the bets if they lost. So taxpayers bailed out AIG, \nand through them, the banks and companies that did business with AIG. \nIf those banks had been allowed to collapse, the financial markets \nwould have frozen. Companies would have been unable to get funds they \nneeded to operate and grow. Families would have been unable to get \nloans to fund their educations, to buy cars and homes, and live.\n  The Dodd-Frank Act was designed to prevent that nightmare from \nhappening again. It would institute new capital and margin requirements \nfor swap dealers and other major participants active in the derivative \nmarkets. Yet just as we start to restore sanity and put the financial \ncops back on the Wall Street beat, the Crapo amendment would have \nstopped the cops from doing their jobs. The amendment would have \nfundamentally undermined Dodd-Frank in two principal ways. First, it \nwould have delayed any new regulations as already described. Second, \nthe amendment would have carved out vast amounts of derivatives trades \nfrom the new protections.\n  While the amendment was written in a complex way, it seems to \nprohibit the\n\n[[Page S6936]]\n\nCFTC from imposing capital and margin requirements for a whole host of \nswaps. Let me give you an example. As I understand the amendment, it \ncould have prohibited the CFTC from using any of its funds to regulate \nderivatives involving at least one party that's a favored entity. Some \nof the favored entities are even investment firms.\n  Take, for example, the Hudson CDO that my Subcommittee on \nInvestigations examined. It was a $2 billion synthetic CDO designed by \nGoldman Sachs and then turned over to a special purpose investment \nvehicle set up by Goldman Sachs in the Cayman Islands. That company \nissued the Hudson credit default swap that allowed Goldman Sachs to bet \nagainst the very instrument it had constructed. If one of the \npurchasers of this bet was a manufacturing firm or some other type of \nspecial entity, shouldn't they also be protected?\n  For the last decade, the CFTC couldn't do anything to regulate swaps \nbecause the Commodity Futures Modernization Act explicitly exempted \nswaps from all government oversight. The Dodd-Frank Act reversed that \nill-advised policy by making swaps once again subject to federal \nregulation and oversight. The Crapo amendment would have restored some \nof those exemptions and done it in a way that is poorly designed, and \ncould have engendered years of litigation over what it meant.\n  In short, the Crapo amendment would have delayed important financial \nreforms, reduced protections against taxpayer bailouts, and crippled \nthe abilities of our regulators to set the new rules of the road. To \nme, the Crapo amendment had a pretty simple message: return to the \nfinancial deregulation that preceded, and contributed to, the financial \ncrisis of the last few years.\n  I am of the opposite view. I think that the collapse of AIG, Bear \nStearns, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Washington Mutual, and \ncountless other firms teach us a different lesson. The findings of the \nbipartisan investigation conducted by the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations tell a different story. Our financial system needs a cop \nback on the beat. I am glad that the Crapo amendment has been \nwithdrawn.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I hope everyone just listened to and \nwatched the exemplary way we are ridding ourselves of some of these \namendments. We have two more amendments and it would be great if we \ndidn't have to vote on those. I think the explanation given by the two \nSenators is an indication that progress can be made even without a \nvote.\n  I ask unanimous consent, since the amendment next in line is being \ndelayed, that we move to the Coburn amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                        Coburn Amendment No. 801\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, this is a straightforward amendment on a \nprogram that fails 70 percent of the time. We spend $35 million a year. \nIt has an abject failure rate. Only 30 percent of it results in \nanything positive happening; 70 percent of the time it does not. The \nObama administration and the Bush administration thought this program \nshould be canceled.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, only $6 million is provided for this \nprogram, but it makes a big difference for small rural communities that \nare struggling to provide air service. Air service is so important to \njobs and economic development in these regions.\n  It is important to note that there is a requirement for State and \nlocal participation in these programs, and that there is a high demand. \nNearly 300 communities across this country have benefited from this \nprogram since its establishment. Senator Hutchison has offered to \ntighten up the program to meet the concern of the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the amendment. This is critical to \nsmall rural communities.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, what the Senator from Maine just said is \nthat $4.2 million is going to be unsuccessful and $2.8 million might \nbe. The fact is that with a $1.3 trillion deficit and a $15 trillion \ndebt, we can't continue to do this no matter how great it sounds when \nit fails 70 percent of the time.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator has 1 \nminute.\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I filed this motion to recommit H.R. 2112 \nwith instructions to send this ``moneybus'' back to the Committee on \nAppropriations for one simple reason: it spends more for the same set \nof expenditures in fiscal year 2012 than it did in 2011 to the tune of \nabout $10 billion.\n  I understand there are reasons for this excess. I understand when we \nlook at individual components of the 2012 provisions there may be some \ncuts in there. But the overall picture, the entire pie, is about $10 \nbillion more than what we had in fiscal year 2011.\n  Unless we can be open and transparent with the American people and \nacknowledge the fact that we are, in fact, spending more, I think this \nis a problem. We have to get the fiscal house in order, and this is how \nit is perpetuated, when we claim we are cutting when we are, in fact, \nspending more. That is the reason for this motion to recommit. I urge \nmy colleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. This motion to recommit purports to set discretionary \nspending at fiscal year 2011 levels for these three bills. But this \nmotion is extremely misleading because increased mandatory spending \nincluded in the three bills--they are not touching that.\n  Agriculture alone would see a $7 billion cut due to increases in \nmandatory programs. If we include the emergency disaster relief, it \nwould force an additional cut of $3.2 billion. The measure before us is \nwithin our 302(b) allocation scored by the CBO and the Senate Budget \nCommittee, and it meets every requirement of the Budget Control Act.\n  I strongly urge a ``no'' vote.\n  Mr. LEE.

The firearms selected \n     do not constitute a random sample and should not be \n     considered representative of the larger universe of all \n     firearms used by criminals, or any subset of that universe. \n     Firearms are normally traced to the first retail seller, and \n     sources reported for firearms traced do not necessarily \n     represent the sources or methods by which firearms in general \n     are acquired for use in crime.\n       Sec. 517.

The results shall \n     be made available in redacted form to exclude--\n       (1) any matter described in section 552(b) of title 5, \n     United States Code; and\n       (2) sensitive personal information for any individual, the \n     public access to which could be used to commit identity theft \n     or for other inappropriate or unlawful purposes.\n       (c) A grant or contract funded by amounts appropriated by \n     this Act may not be used for the purpose of defraying the \n     costs of a banquet or conference that is not directly and \n     programmatically related to the purpose for which the grant \n     or contract was awarded, such as a banquet or conference held \n     in connection with planning, training, assessment, review, or \n     other routine purposes related to a project funded by the \n     grant or contract.\n       (d) Any person awarded a grant or contract funded by \n     amounts appropriated by this Act shall submit a statement to \n     the Secretary of Commerce, the Attorney General, the \n     Administrator, Director, or President, as appropriate, \n     certifying that no funds derived from the grant or contract \n     will be made available through a subcontract or in any other \n     manner to another person who has a financial interest in the \n     person awarded the grant or contract.\n       (e) The provisions of the preceding subsections of this \n     section shall take effect 30 days after the date on which the \n     Director of the Office of Management and Budget, in \n     consultation with the Director of the Office of Government \n     Ethics, determines that a uniform set of rules and \n     requirements, substantially similar to the requirements in \n     such subsections, consistently apply under the executive \n     branch ethics program to all Federal departments, agencies, \n     and entities.\n       Sec. 518.  None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available under this Act may be used to issue patents on \n     claims directed to or encompassing a human organism.\n       Sec. 519.

The \n     President shall terminate the requirements of a license when \n     reasons for the temporary requirements have ceased.\n       Sec. 521.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no \n     department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States \n     receiving appropriated funds under this Act or any other Act \n     shall obligate or expend in any way such funds to pay \n     administrative expenses or the compensation of any officer or \n     employee of the United States to deny any application \n     submitted pursuant to 22 U.S.C. 2778(b)(1)(B) and qualified \n     pursuant to 27 CFR section 478.112 or .113, for a permit to \n     import United States origin ``curios or relics'' firearms, \n     parts, or ammunition.\n       Sec. 522.

No funds made available under this \n     paragraph may be provided directly to lenders or homeowners \n     to discharge outstanding mortgage balances or for any other \n     direct debt reduction payments.\n       (3) The use of Mortgage Foreclosure Mitigation Assistance \n     by approved counseling intermediaries and State Housing \n     Finance Agencies shall involve a reasonable analysis of the \n     borrower's financial situation, an evaluation of the current \n     value of the property that is subject to the mortgage, \n     counseling regarding the assumption of the mortgage by \n     another non-Federal party, counseling regarding the possible \n     purchase of the mortgage by a non-Federal third party, \n     counseling and advice of all likely restructuring and \n     refinancing strategies or the approval of a work-out strategy \n     by all interested parties.\n       (4) NRC may provide up to 15 percent of the total funds \n     under this paragraph to its own charter members with \n     expertise in foreclosure prevention counseling, subject to a \n     certification by the NRC that the procedures for selection do \n     not consist of any procedures or activities that could be \n     construed as an unacceptable conflict of interest or have the \n     appearance of impropriety.\n       (5) HUD-approved counseling entities and State Housing \n     Finance Agencies receiving funds under this paragraph shall \n     have demonstrated experience in successfully working with \n     financial institutions as well as borrowers facing default, \n     delinquency and foreclosure as well as documented counseling \n     capacity, outreach capacity, past successful performance and \n     positive outcomes with documented counseling plans (including \n     post mortgage foreclosure mitigation counseling), loan \n     workout agreements and loan modification agreements.

The majority leader.\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I had a conversation with the Republican \nleader. We have a very important briefing today at 3:30, and it will be \nin the classified area of the Visitor Center. We are going to have \nSecretary Burns, General Clapper will be there, the head of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, Secretary Panetta will be there to talk about a number \nof countries around the world on which we need to focus our attention. \nI hope we have very good attendance at this meeting. It will be very \nimportant that we have Senators listen to what these gentlemen have to \nsay, so I ask unanimous consent that we be in recess today from 3:30 \nuntil 4:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the experiment we have just completed on \nthese appropriations bills has worked out extremely well. One reason it \nhas worked out as well as it has is because of Senator Kohl. Senator \nKohl has been in the Senate more than two decades, and those of us who \nhave watched him know he doesn't spend a lot of time talking, but he \nspends a lot of time getting things done, and this legislation was an \nexample of how good he is. Also, Senator Blunt--this is a new \nexperience for him, but he had been in the House for many years and was \npart of their leadership and actually hit the ground running and has \nbeen a great partner in helping us move this legislation forward. So I \ncongratulate both these fine Senators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, upon passage of this bill, I want to take a \nmoment to thank my ranking member, Senator Blunt, for his guidance and \nsupport throughout this process. He and his staff, Stacy McBride and \nMary Koskinen, were extraordinarily helpful to me and my staff as we \nput this bill together. I also thank my staff--Galen Fountain, Jessica \nFrederick, Dianne Nellor, Bob Ross, and Chad Metzler--for their \nexcellent work.\n  This is an austere bill. As I have stated before, almost every \ncategory of funding is lower than last year and much lower than the \nyear before. We have had good debate on the floor about various \nprovisions in the bill, and we have taken many votes. The process has \nbeen open and transparent. We have followed the regular order, and this \nbill was considered on the Senate floor. We can now conference this \nbill with the House and hopefully send it to the President shortly \nafter that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/01/senate-section/article/S6980-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6980-S6981]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will be \nin a period of morning business until 4:30 p.m., with Senators \npermitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n\n\n                          Passage of H.R. 2112\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I wish to take a moment to thank Senator \nKohl. The comments the majority leader made about him were certainly \nproven right in all of our relationships. I thank him for his guidance \nand encouragement throughout this process. We have had open \ncommunication and worked together to address the amendments brought \nforward by our colleagues. While we didn't agree on every single thing \nin the bill, we certainly agreed to be agreeable about that and see if \nwe couldn't produce a work product people have a right to expect of the \nSenate. So the passage of these three bills is significant.\n  I certainly wish to thank Senator Kohl's staff--Galen Fountain, \nJessica Frederick, Dianne Nellor, and Bob Ross--for their \ncontributions, and I thank my staff: Stacy McBride, Mary Koskinen, \nBrian Diffel, Zach Kinne, and Christina Weger.\n  Because this has been a process that has involved two other \nsubcommittees, I wish to express my thanks to my colleagues for their \nhard work and cooperation on the other parts of this bill: Senators \nMikulski and Hutchison and their staffs on the Commerce, Justice, \nScience Subcommittee and Senators Murray and Collins and their staffs \non the Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development.\n  The floor staff has worked hard over the course of the last several \ndays. Often, that work goes unnoticed. But managing this bill has not \nbeen easy. It was a little different from many of the appropriations \nbills that have been brought to the Senate floor, and certainly the \nfloor staff has been of tremendous help to me and to the committee \nstaff.\n  This has been a long process. A dozen amendments that affect the \nagriculture division of this bill have been accepted over the course of \nthe debate. I am glad we have had an open debate and hope we can \nswiftly move to conference with the House and send this work product on \nto the President so that we can get these appropriations processes \nstarted as close to the regular time as we possibly can, based on the \nmoment in which we find ourselves, and look forward to working with the \nAppropriations Committee as we bring other bills to the floor.\n  Again, I close my remarks on this bill by expressing my personal \nappreciation to Senator Kohl and his willingness to work with a new \nMember of the Senate in putting this product together and bringing this \nbill to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer, and I also compliment both Senators who just spoke, Senator \nKohl and Senator Blunt, for their excellent work.\n  Like everybody here, I have followed these votes and the negotiations \nand did vote, and I am encouraged by the progress made on the \nTransportation-HUD appropriations bill which the Senate has now \napproved. It funds our Nation's ongoing transportation investments. It \nalso includes crucial emergency disaster funding for Vermont and the \nother States struggling to recover from Hurricane/Tropical Storm Irene \nand other natural disasters.\n  This bill is part of the response needed from Congress by thousands \nof Vermonters and millions of other Americans. It is vital not only for \nthe economy of Vermont and other States whose roads and bridges were \ndecimated by the storm, but for the Nation's economy. I commend the \nchair, Senator Murray, and the ranking member, Senator Collins, for \ntheir hard work and dedication toward ensuring appropriate funding for \ndisaster relief, particularly in Irene's aftermath.\n  I have said many times on the Senate floor that Hurricane Irene was \ndevastating to our small State of Vermont. I was born in Vermont, as \nwere my parents, and I have never seen destruction of this magnitude. \nThe only thing that even compares are stories of floods in Vermont that \nmy grandparents used to tell me about when they were younger.\n  The flash floods caused by the storm destroyed homes and farms, \nbusinesses, bridges, and roads. Roads and structures that have stood \nfor over a century were wiped out in a matter of minutes. I \nhelicoptered over Vermont with Governor Shumlin and General Dubie, the \nhead of our Vermont National Guard, the day after our storm, and none \nof us could believe the things we were seeing. With the repair costs \nestimated to be over $100 million, our little State has been stretched \nto the limit.\n  As the rain stopped, Vermont moved immediately and we had crews \nworking to repair the damage. We didn't wait for anybody else; we just \nstarted moving--neighbors helping neighbors, our State and local \ngovernments, our National Guard, Red Cross, working together. However, \nwe do need the traditional helping hand of Federal disaster recovery \nloans and grants to help those whose lives were upturned by Irene. \nFederal disaster recovery aid has always been available to other States \nafter disasters such as this. We need it now in Vermont. This bill is \nan essential part of the work that Congress should be doing in response \nto major events such as Irene, pulling together as a Nation to heal \nthese wounds.\n\n  The Senate, as the Presiding Officer will recall, reconvened after \nLabor Day. Those of us on the Appropriations Committee worked on this \nbill and other disaster relief legislation, which have been top \npriorities for Vermont and for many other States. Many other committees \nwere involved in this important work. The Vermont delegation worked \ntogether on this bill and other Senators came together to help make\n\n[[Page S6981]]\n\nprogress week by week. One by one, we have overcome a series of \nlegislative obstacles and have been able to turn the lights from red to \ngreen.\n  Our legislative process this year has been unduly cumbersome and \nunresponsive; different than I have ever seen in the years I have spent \nhere in the Senate. However, the progress we have achieved here in the \nSenate is a testament to the determination of many in this body who \nhave been willing to set aside ideological imperatives and partisan \ndifferences to work together as Republicans and Democrats to accomplish \nthe work that the American people and our constituents expect from \ntheir government.\n  Now, in Vermont and the other New England States, winter is not just \non the horizon, it is on our doorstep. In our State last weekend, we \nhad more than 1 foot of snow in some parts. I mention this because if \nyou are going to repair roads and bridges, time is a significant \nfactor, and time is slipping away.\n  We all know that roads and bridges are the circulatory system for \ncommerce in the daily lives of living, breathing communities and their \ncitizens--where people have to go to work, school or be together with \ntheir families. With many of the Federal aid disaster programs \nunderfunded, I am especially pleased that this bill contains the $1.9 \nbillion that I and others worked to include to replenish the Federal \nHighway Disaster Relief Fund. This fund will help rebuild Vermont's \nvital roadways. These roadways are critical to rebuild our economy, \ndistribute aid, and bring people to hospitals and to schools. It is of \nthe utmost importance that this Federal aid reaches Vermont sooner \nrather than later, as our winters can be extremely harsh. I look at \nWashington, DC, which will close down with 3 inches of snow. We call \nthat a dusting in our State. Many times we have a foot of snow \novernight. Schools will still be open, commerce still goes on, but we \ncan't rebuild roads with a foot of snow on them. We have to be working \nto rebuild now and we have to be prepared to work immediately when the \nsnow stops.\n\n  I have talked with Senator Sanders, Congressman Welch, and Governor \nShumlin, who has spent every single day working on this. My wife \nMarcelle and I have driven around the State. We have talked to \ncommunity leaders, to those who have worked on disaster relief, and \nothers. It is very clear, given the mammoth, unprecedented destruction \nof this storm, certain waivers are needed to allow States to access \nfunds for repair work they need without going through all kinds of \nburdens for repairs.\n  I mention these waivers because if we are going to ensure that \nVermont and other States can promptly design and begin emergency and \npermanent repairs, we have to do it now. We put the waivers into this \nbill, and I hope the other body will understand we need them preserved. \nThis bill, an investment in America's crumbling and damaged roads and \nbridges, is a crucial step. It will help restore the economic vitality \nof our country.\n  I am also pleased the legislation includes emergency community \ndevelopment block grant funding. Right now, HUD has no funding \navailable. They cannot address the housing needs of Vermonters affected \nboth by Hurricane Irene and the flooding of this past spring. These \ndisaster recovery programs are woefully underfunded.\n  I cannot think of the number of hours that I and other members of the \nAppropriations Committee have worked on this, the evenings, the phone \ncalls, the weekends, touching base, but it is all worth it. If this \nbill will now be accepted by the other body, we can go forward and we \ncan start doing the rebuilding we need.\n  Vermont is a very special place, not just because it is my home but \nbecause of the spirit of its people. This is a State that has always \nsupported help for other States and Americans all over the country \nfacing similar disasters. We need that help now, and this bill is a \nmajor step forward for that help. I thank everybody involved with it. \nNow all we have to do is get it through the other body, get it on the \nPresident's desk, and continue the recovery work we are doing both in \nVermont and other States damaged by Irene.\n  As we talk about the money, I will not resist the temptation to \nrepeat what a Vermonter told me. I have said it before on the Senate \nfloor. We spend unlimited sums to rebuild buildings and roads and \nbridges in Iraq and Afghanistan and somebody else comes along and blows \nthem up. We build them in America for Americans by Americans and we \nAmericans will keep them safe.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/01/senate-section/article/S6981-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6981]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to inform the Senate of \nsomething that has just happened to a civics teacher in my State of \nFlorida who tried to help her students register to vote. It was nothing \nnew for this teacher, Jill Cicciarelli, to be prepping 17-year-old \nstudents for the privilege and responsibility of voting in a democracy. \nShe has been doing this for a number of years. But it turned out that \nwhen Jill organized a drive at the start of the school year to get \nstudents preregistered to vote, she ran afoul of Florida's new election \nlaw.\n  How could that be? But, sure enough, the law, which is basically an \nattempt at voter suppression, causes her to face hefty fines. For what? \nFor helping students to register to vote. As ridiculous as that sounds, \nthat is what the law says.\n  But there is more, unfortunately. There is a lot more. I met with \nJill Cicciarelli and her students last week. They are extremely \nconcerned, and they are extremely surprised that a good government \nattempt to register students so they will be ready to vote in the next \nelection has run afoul of the law. They were not happy; but, \ninterestingly, neither was their elected Supervisor of Elections in \nVolusia County who, under the law, was required to report the teacher \nand the students to the State authorities.\n  The Supervisor of Elections, Ann McFall, has now publicly, openly \ncriticized the parts of the law as being egregious and unenforceable. \nShe has done that speaking out, she has done it in an op-ed and in the \nlocal newspaper. She has been unambiguous in her criticism that not \nonly is it egregious in the substance of the law, but that the burdens \nthey place on the Supervisors of Elections are unenforceable.\n  I have written to Governor Scott. I have talked to him personally, \nasking him to support the revamping or the repeal of this law. I have \nalso just asked the Senate Judiciary Committee to conduct a \ncongressional investigation to see if Florida's law was part of an \norchestrated effort that resulted in voting law changes in 14 States \nthus far this year. These new voting laws could make it significantly \nharder for more than 5 million eligible voters in many States to cast \ntheir ballots in next year's election in 2012, and that is according to \nthe Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law.\n  Last month they completed the first comprehensive study of the impact \nof those State laws. The Florida law is probably the strongest of all \nthe 14 States. It requires third parties who sign up new voters to \nregister with the State first and then to submit applications from the \nnew voters for registration within 48 hours. For almost four decades, \nthe Florida law has been that they had 10 days in which to submit the \nnames--for four decades. Now it is within 48 hours.\n  Can anybody say with a straight face that Florida isn't taking a step \nbackwards in making it harder to vote and harder to register to vote \nand harder to have a person's vote count as they intended, especially a \nstep backwards when it involves protecting one of our most fundamental \nrights, the right to vote?\n\n[[Page S6982]]\n\n  I hope people are going to start to realize that this is not just \nhappening in Florida, but that a number of States have passed laws that \nare going to make it harder to vote and harder for people to cast their \nballots. We simply should not sit back and watch as a handful of \nlawmakers and Governors approving this legislation in those States \ncontinue to block the path of voters to the polls.\n  When we think back in history, when Lyndon Johnson was President \nthere were poll taxes and literacy tests aimed at blocking African \nAmericans from voting. President Johnson went on TV and spoke to the \nNation about passing civil rights laws for African Americans, including \nthe right to vote. He told us: ``We are going to give them that \nright.'' If he were alive today, I wonder what he would think as he \nwatched these legislatures across the country--in what the Miami Herald \nrecently called a disturbing trend--pass laws that place unnecessary \nhurdles between the voting booth and minorities, young voters and \nseniors.\n  In Florida, the so-called election reform law rapidly made its way as \na legislative bill into law this past spring despite public outcry as \nthe legislature was considering it. Here is what the law does: It \nreduces the number of early voting days from 14 to 8. Of course, it was \nexplained in the guides that the Supervisors of Elections can increase \nthe voting hours on those days. But when they do that, they have to pay \novertime, time and a half. Look at the budgets of all the States and \nthe counties. They are in distress. So they are not going to have the \nmoney to do it. So, in effect, it is reduced from 14 days for early \nvoting to 8 days.\n  Why was early voting ever instituted in the first place? Remember the \ndebacle we had in the Presidential election in Florida in the year \n2000? As a result, there was an effort to increase the number of days \nso it would make it a convenience and make it easier to vote--14 days \nconstricted to 8.\n  Oh, by the way, the 14 days goes all the way up through the Sunday \nbefore the Tuesday election. The new election law in Florida stops it \non the Saturday before the Tuesday election. Well, guess who that is \ngoing to hurt? What group do we think goes in record numbers to vote \nafter church on Sunday, the day before the Tuesday election?\n  The election laws were set up to make it easier to vote for seniors \nand for many others, so much so that it was such a tremendous success \nin the last several elections that 40 percent of all the people voted \nbefore Election Day. One can imagine the administrative help it was, \nthat only 60 percent of the people voted on Election Day. But that is \nconstricted under the theory that it was going to stop election fraud.\n  By the way, there has been very little election law fraud reported in \nFlorida and in other States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 10 minutes has expired.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. So that is a false argument, that it is going \nto cause any improvement on voter fraud. There is hardly any voter \nfraud.\n  That is one thing the new election law does. What is another thing? \nIt makes it harder if a person moves their residence to another county \nin Florida. As a matter of fact, if a person moves to another county \nand they do not register to vote in that county, but they have a voter \nidentification card that shows an address in another county in Florida \nwhere the person came from, that person will not get a regular ballot. \nThat person will get a provisional ballot. Sadly, what we know from the \nexperience of provisional ballots in Florida in the 2008 Presidential \nelection is that half of the provisional ballots were not counted.\n  Well, what group is that going to affect? Did my colleagues hear \nabout how young people and college students got so interested in \ngovernment and politics that they went to the polls in record numbers? \nWhere did they vote? A lot of them got interested while they were away \nat their colleges and universities and they registered to vote and they \nvoted in record numbers. Don't we want to encourage that? No. Not this \nelection law. This election law says when that college student shows up \nbecause they have suddenly gotten energized, and they have not \nregistered to vote in that county where they go to school, when they \npull out their voter registration card that has their parents' address \nback home in another county, they are not going to get a regular \nballot. They are going to get a provisional ballot.\n  Is this the kind of nonsense we want going on? It is happening in \nfront of our eyes, and it is happening in the State of Florida.\n  Let me tell my colleagues what else it does. It subjects voter \nregistration drives to redtape and even fines up to $1,000 per person, \nso much so that the League of Women Voters was forced to abandon its \nregistration drives after doing it in our State for 72 years. What does \nthe law do? It says: If you are going to register somebody to vote, you \nfirst have to register with the State of Florida that you are going to \nbe a third party registrar, and when you register those names you have \nto turn them in to the supervisor's office within 48 hours.\n  Why, for four decades has the law been that you had 10 days to turn \nthem in? If you don't get it in by the 48th hour and 1 minute, you are \nnow subject to fines of $50 per registration, up to $1,000 that you \ncould be fined, thus the case of the teacher at New Smyrna Beach High \nSchool, Jill Cicciarelli, who had preregistered her students and had \nheld the registrations for more than 48 hours. Of course, Jill did not \neven know about the law.\n  Listen to what the Orlando Sentinel said about it. This is about the \nnew election law:\n\n       It amounts to . . . ripping apart election laws and \n     weakening democracy.\n\n  Listen to what the Tampa Tribune said:\n\n       This bill isn't fooling anybody. It's not about clean \n     elections.\n\n  Listen to what Florida Today, a Gannett newspaper, said. It called \nthe law an ``assault on the most cherished of American rights.''\n  I see you are calling my time. I ask unanimous consent for an \nadditional 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, no State should have the right \nto make a law if it abridges people's basic rights. I have requested \nthe Department of Justice to look into that. I requested this several \nmonths ago. At this moment, I cannot tell you to what degree the \nDepartment of Justice is questioning this. They have been engaged in a \nlawsuit, because the State of Florida has sued them. The State of \nFlorida is suing them to invalidate the entire Voting Rights Act of \n1964, if you can believe that.\n  Look back in history. After being arrested for casting an illegal \nvote in the Presidential election in 1872, Susan B. Anthony, a \nschoolteacher, called it a downright mockery to talk to women of their \nenjoyment of the blessings of liberty while they were being denied the \nuse of the only means of securing that, and that is the ballot. That is \nwhat Florida's new election law and others like it around the Nation \nare, a downright mockery. Dr. King warned Americans that all types of \nconniving methods can be used to keep people from being registered \nvoters. That is what these new so-called election reform laws amount \nto, democracy turned upside down. I hope the Senate will look at this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n                        SPECIAL JOINT COMMITTEE\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, later this month, the special joint \ncommittee will be issuing its recommendations. The special joint \ncommittee was set up for us to get recommendations on dealing with our \neconomic problems and our budget deficit. I wanted to share with my \ncolleagues two points I think are critically important that I hope will \ncome out of this special joint committee.\n  First, I hope this joint committee will provide a way that we can \nadvance an agenda that will create jobs in our communities. Secondly, I \nhope this special joint committee will come forward with a \ncomprehensive and balanced approach for us to deal with our current \nunsustainable budget deficits.\n\n[[Page S6983]]\n\n  Let me talk about the first issue, creating jobs. President Obama \ncame forward with a job initiative that I do believe is entitled to \ndebate on the floor of this body and, I would hope, passage. President \nObama brought forward a bill that deals with rebuilding America so we \ncan have the types of roads and bridges and water infrastructure and \nenergy infrastructure that allow America to compete, at the same time \ncreating jobs.\n  He has offered proposals that would help small businesses, because we \nknow the small businesses represent the economic engine of America. \nWhere more jobs will be created, more innovation occurs. He understands \nthat and is encouraging us to do more to help small businesses.\n  The President's proposal deals with our men and women in the military \nservice who are coming back from Iraq, coming back from Afghanistan, to \nhave jobs available. Yesterday I was at BWI Airport as our soldiers \ncame back from Iraq and Afghanistan. They want jobs. The President's \ninitiative says, look, let's make sure we have jobs for our returning \nsoldiers. All that means is we are going to create more jobs.\n  The joint committee needs to make sure that in its recommendations we \nhave the wherewithal to move this Nation forward by creating jobs. The \nPresident's proposal has been evaluated by independent economists. Mark \nZandi, who was Senator McCain's economic adviser in his Presidential \ncampaign, points out the President's proposal would increase our gross \ndomestic product by 2 percent and create 1.9 million additional jobs.\n  The President's proposal is completely paid for. It adds nothing to \nthe deficit. I must tell you, if we are going to be able to balance our \nbudget, if we are going to be able to get our budget in better shape, \nwe have to have more jobs, less people using governmental services, \nmore people paying revenues or taxes into our system. The more people \nwho are working, the better our budgets will come into balance.\n  I know some here are saying there is a better way of doing it. Well, \ncome forward with a better way of doing it. I would challenge \nparticularly my Republican colleagues, if you have a better way, come \nforward with a proposal that includes at least 1.9 million jobs and \ndoes it without adding to the budget deficit. That is the proposal we \nhave before us.\n  I am asking the joint committee to make sure they provide in their \nrecommendations a way that we can create jobs so we can deal with our \nbudget deficit.\n  The second point I want to make is I would hope that the joint \ncommittee's recommendations would be comprehensive and balanced. Some \ncall that the shared sacrifice.\n  I know these numbers can sort of be used any way you want, but the \ngroups that have looked at this, the Simpson-Bowles group and others, \nsay, we need to reduce the deficit over the next 10 years by about $4 \ntrillion. I think that is a number we should meet. I hope the joint \ncommittee can come in with $4 trillion of deficit reduction over the \nnext 10 years. We have already done the first trillion. We did that \nwhen we raised the debt limit in August. Now we need to look at another \n$3 trillion. I would hope they would do it.\n  It starts with a realistic baseline. What does that mean? It means \nwhat numbers are we using in order to determine whether we actually get \nto that $4 trillion of deficit reduction? What baseline do we use in \norder to determine the revenue base from which we start these \ndiscussions?\n  I would suggest we make a realistic baseline. I was impressed with \nthe work of the Simpson-Bowles commission. I was impressed by the work \nof our colleagues in the Senate, the so-called Gang of Six, and I must \ntell you the overwhelming majority of my colleagues in the Senate have \nat least agreed to the basis of what the Gang of Six was working with, \nwhat they were trying to do. It uses a realistic baseline. It assumes \nthat some of the tax provisions will be extended, but not all.\n  It also assumes we have to bring in additional revenues beyond that. \nQuite frankly, the number we have been talking about is that we need \nabout $1.2 trillion outside of this $4 trillion package in realistic \nrevenues using a realistic baseline. And that can be gotten. That is \nnot so difficult to get when you realize that all of the tax \ndeductions, exemptions, and credits equal as much revenue as we bring \nin in our Tax Code.\n  Another way to say that is, if we eliminate all of the exemptions, \ndeductions, and credits, we get tax rates one-half of what our current \ntax rates are. What we are suggesting is that there are certain \nloopholes in the Tax Code that benefit special interest corporations. \nThey need to be eliminated. They need to be eliminated. Everyone has to \npay their fair share. We cannot just attack the middle-class families.\n  There was an article in the Baltimore Sun this past week which showed \nthat during this recession the number of people earning more than $1 \nmillion has grown dramatically. There have been economic studies done \nshowing that the wealthiest in America during these economic times have \ndone very well. Their incomes have grown at a faster rate than other \nAmericans, the middle-class families. The middle-class families are \nfalling behind.\n  All we are suggesting is that when we look at how we get the revenue, \nlet's make sure it is fair and we do not again penalize the middle-\nclass families. Let's make sure those who earn over $1 million pay \ntheir fair share toward this comprehensive and balanced approach.\n  That is what we are asking the joint committee to come in with, come \nin with proposals that are fair, are balanced, make sure everybody pays \ntheir fair share, including those who have done extremely well during \nthis economic recession, those who have made over $1 million of income.\n  I must tell you, everyone needs to be part of the equation. We \nunderstand that. We have to have the so-called shared sacrifice. I have \ntaken the floor before to talk about our Federal employees. Everybody \nsays, well, you know, the Federal employees have to help contribute to \nthis deficit also. Our Federal employees understand that. They already \nhave contributed. They were the first to do that with 2 years of pay \nfreezes. We are asking them to do more with less people. We have cut \ntheir budgets and we have given them more work. And we have told them, \n2 years with a pay freeze. So our Federal employees have already \ncontributed to these deficit reduction numbers. They should not be \npicked on again. I believe we can come together. We need to have a \ncomprehensive and balanced approach that allows America to create more \njobs. That is what we need to do as a nation. If we come together, I am \nconvinced it will instill confidence among the American consumers, \namong American investors, and our economy will take off. It is going to \nbe good for everyone in this Nation. I hope this month we will see the \njoint committee come in with such recommendations that will be \nbalanced, will be fair, and will allow us to create more jobs for \nAmericans.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/01/senate-section/article/S6983-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6983-S6986]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM\n\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, 11 days ago, all but four of the Republicans \nin this body filibustered a commonsense piece of legislation that would \nhave created a national commission designed to bring together some of \nthe best minds in America to examine our broken and frequently \ndysfunctional criminal justice system and to make recommendations as to \nhow we can make it more effective, more fair, and more cost-efficient.\n  This legislation was the product of more than 4 years of effort. It \nwas paid for. It would have gone out of business after 18 months. It \nwas balanced philosophically. It guaranteed equal representation among \nDemocrats and Republicans in its membership. It was endorsed by 70 \norganizations from across the country and from across the philosophical \nspectrum--from the National Sheriffs' Association, the Fraternal Order \nof Police, the International Association of Chiefs of Police, to the \nACLU, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, and the Sentencing Project.\n\n[[Page S6984]]\n\n  I must say that at first I was stunned by this filibuster at the \nhands of 43 Republicans. But on the other hand, it is impossible not to \nnotice over the past 2 years the lamentable decline in bipartisan \nbehavior in this body, even in addressing serious issues of actual \ngovernance. I say this with a great deal of regret, both personally and \npolitically.\n  I think I can fairly say there is no one in this Chamber who has \ntried harder to work across party lines. In fact, one of my Republican \nfriends joked not long ago that I was the only ``nonpolitical'' Member \nof the Senate. I spent 4 years in the Reagan administration as an \nAssistant Secretary of Defense and Secretary of the Navy. I am proud of \nthat. I consciously sought out Senators John Warner and Chuck Hagel as \ntwo of my three principal cosponsors when I introduced the post-\n9/11 GI bill.\n  I voted with the Republicans 17 times during the health care debate. \nI was the only Member of Congress in either party or in either House to \nsend a letter to President Obama, when he claimed he would come back \nfrom the climate change summit in Copenhagen with a politically binding \nagreement, stating my belief the President did not have the \nconstitutional authority to bind the American people to an \ninternational agreement without the approval of the Congress. I have \ntaken issue with this administration with respect to closing down our \nfacilities at Guantanamo. I have consistently opposed any tax increases \non ordinary earned income.\n  I took that same bipartisan approach when I introduced the criminal \njustice commission bill in 2009, obtaining the cosponsorship of a \nnumber of Republicans, including Senators Lindsey Graham and Orrin \nHatch, both of whom serve on the Judiciary Committee. The filibuster of \na commonsense measure that might assist this Nation in resolving the \nnational disgrace that now comprises our criminal justice system is a \nsad metaphor for the obstructionism that is too frequently replacing \ncommonsense leadership in our national debate.\n  We spent more than 4 years reaching out to all sides of the \nphilosophical spectrum. We worked with liberals, we worked with \nconservatives, we worked with law enforcement, we sought the views of \nmany Republicans, and we also worked in close coordination with the \nother body. Toward that end, it is interesting to note that in the last \nCongress, the House of Representatives approved the same legislation by \na voice vote. It was not even considered controversial. In fact, \nCongressman Lamar Smith, a Republican, now the chairman of the House \nJudiciary Committee, was a cosponsor of the legislation.\n  But let us speak frankly. In the aftermath of the 2010 elections and \nin anticipation of the 2012 Presidential election, the mood in this \nhistoric body has frequently become nothing short of toxic. In that \nenvironment, even this carefully developed and much needed legislation \nis suddenly considered controversial and not only controversial, it was \nalso alleged to be unconstitutional.\n  Just before the vote, Senator Coburn of Oklahoma said: ``We're \nabsolutely ignoring the U.S. Constitution if you do this.''\n  Senator Hutchison from Texas said: ``This is the most massive \nencroachment on States rights I have seen in this body.''\n  With all due respect, I am pretty comfortable with the legal \neducation I received at Georgetown University Law Center. I care about \nthe Constitution. I keep a copy of the Constitution on my desk, and I \nrefer to it frequently. I think I have a pretty good idea of what is in \nit and what is not and there is nothing in the Constitution that \nprecludes the Congress from asking some of the best minds in America to \ncome together and to give us advice and recommendations on the entire \ngamut of challenges that face our criminal justice system. Certain \nSenators may not like that idea. That is their prerogative. They may \nnot even want to hear the advice. They may not even want to believe \nthere is a problem in our criminal justice system. But to claim the \nConstitution precludes this process is nothing short of absurd.\n  In fact, our national leadership has received such advice before, \nmost notably in 1965, during the Johnson administration, which is the \nlast time we have had a comprehensive examination of our criminal \njustice system.\n  I am not alone in this judgment. Over the past 11 days, there have \nbeen a number of editorials and articles pointing out the unfortunate \nnature of this filibuster: Sunday, masthead editorial, New York Times; \nSunday, masthead editorial, Washington Post; a very observant article \nin the Politico the day of the vote; editorial, Newsday. The lead \neditorial in the Virginian-Pilot in my home State reads: ``Senate \nNegligence on Crime Reform.'' Very interestingly, an article in the \nNational Review--one of the most conservative magazines in the United \nStates--is titled: ``An Absolute Scandal.'' The first sentence of that \narticle reads: ``The insane refusal of 43 Senate Republicans to back \nthe National Criminal Justice Act.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nat the end of my remarks all these articles I have referred to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, for nearly 2 years, our legislative process \nhas too often become sidetracked by what can only be termed an \n``indiscriminate obstructionism.'' A lot of good ideas have fallen by \nthe wayside, having become hostages in the larger debate about who \nshould comprise our national leadership and how we should solve long-\nterm problems, such as our fiscal crisis. This larger debate has \naffected the willingness of many in the other party to come together \nand address a number of serious issues of governance that should be \nresolved no matter who is President and no matter how we end up \naddressing the economy. I would ask my friends on the other side of the \naisle to think hard about the overwhelming frustration across our \ncountry with the persistent failure of the Congress to address these \nkinds of issues.\n  Nowhere is the need to think creatively for the good of the country \nmore clear than where it affects our dysfunctional criminal justice \nsystem, the challenges of which threaten the safety and the well-being \nof every single community and every single American. This system will \nnot be fixed by sticking our heads in the sand and pretending not to \nsee its failings. It will only be fixed by bringing together the good \nminds of those who have dedicated years of thought and action to \nfinding answers. That is what we have been trying to do. Unfortunately, \nthat is what we were stopped from doing by this filibuster.\n  People in this country are looking for leadership, and obstructionism \nis not leadership. We will continue to pursue this effort, and I would \nask my Republican colleagues to join the unanimous position of the \nDemocratic Party as we do.\n\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From The New York Times, Oct. 30, 2011]\n\n               Editorial: Falling Crime, Teeming Prisons\n\n       Senator Jim Webb, Democrat of Virginia, has a smart \n     proposal to create a bipartisan commission to review the \n     nation's troubled criminal justice system and offer \n     recommendations for reform. The National Criminal Justice \n     Commission Act would be a valuable first step toward reducing \n     crime as well as punishment. Unfortunately, Senate \n     Republicans derailed the bill recently, with some falsely \n     claiming that it would encroach on state's rights.\n       As a means of controlling crime, America's prisons are \n     notoriously inefficient and only minimally effective, often \n     creating hardened criminals out of first-time offenders. The \n     United States has 5 percent of the world's population, yet 25 \n     percent of the world's prisoners. In the past generation, the \n     imprisonment rate per capita in this country has multiplied \n     by five. There are 2.3 million Americans in prisons and \n     jails. Spending on prisons has reached $77 billion a year.\n       While crime has gone down notably, just 10 to 25 percent of \n     the decline can be credited to the increase in imprisonment. \n     The rest is from the waning of the crack epidemic, the aging \n     of the baby boomers and other factors.\n       Even as the prison population has grown, less than half of \n     the inmates are serving time for violent crimes. Far too \n     often, prison has become a warehouse for people with drug or \n     alcohol addiction. More than half of the population has some \n     form of mental illness. Without proper addiction and \n     psychiatric treatment, many end up back in prison soon after \n     their release.\n       The incarceration rate has had a devastating effect on \n     minority communities. African-Americans, who make up one-\n     eighth of the population, now make up about 40 percent of \n     those in prison. African-American\n\n[[Page S6985]]\n\n     men have a one-in-three chance of spending a year or more in \n     prison. The trend affects whole communities, depressing \n     earnings and increasing recidivism.\n       There are, however, ways to end this cycle of \n     incarceration. This could be done by reducing sentences for \n     nonviolent offenses, ending mandatory minimum sentences and \n     cleaning up drug markets nationally. Reasonable senators \n     should support the bipartisan commission that Senator Webb is \n     calling for, which would cost only $5 million and could help \n     bring about compelling reforms.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From The Washington Post, Oct. 30, 2011]\n\n      Editorial: Shaky Arguments Block Federal Commission on Crime\n\n       The United States remains the world's leading jailer, with \n     more than 2 million individuals locked up. The annual price \n     tag is $50 billion.\n       Who are the individuals behind bars? What crimes were they \n     convicted of and what penalties did they receive? What \n     relationship is there between the rate of incarceration and \n     the drop in violent crime? Are there more effective and \n     inexpensive ways to deal with lawbreakers?\n       These and other questions would be tackled by a bipartisan \n     commission proposed by Sen. James Webb (D-Va.). Republican \n     and Democratic leaders would pick the 14 members of the \n     National Criminal Justice Commission, including experts on \n     law enforcement, prison administration, mental health and \n     drug abuse. The commission, supported by the Fraternal Order \n     of Police and the International Association of Police Chiefs, \n     would have a budget of $5 million and would issue a report \n     after 18 months,,This approach is long overdue: The last \n     comprehensive review of criminal justice was conducted \n     roughly 45 years ago during the Johnson administration.\n       Yet Mr. Webb's efforts were dealt a blow last week when \n     Republicans in the Senate blocked consideration of the \n     measure.\n       Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Tex.) criticized the proposal \n     for stomping on states' rights. Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) \n     deemed it unconstitutional. The National District Attorneys \n     Association, which opposes the measure, wrote that the \n     ``federal government should never be in the business of \n     auditing state and local criminal justice systems.''\n       These criticisms fall flat. The panel would only study the \n     policies of local, state and national law enforcement \n     entities and make recommendations about best practices. It \n     would have no power to issue mandates. The federal \n     government, which distributes federal dollars as incentives \n     for states and localities to adopt best practices, has a \n     legitimate need to know which policies work.\n       Some critics question whether a commission appointed by \n     politicians will issue fair recommendations; a nonpartisan \n     academic group may be better-suited for the task. Critics \n     also worry that 18 months--the length of time the Johnson \n     commission was up and running--is not enough time. These are \n     points that should be addressed, but they are not valid \n     arguments against conducting a review.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                     [From Politico, Oct. 20, 2011]\n\n          Republicans Block Justice Review Proposal in Senate\n\n                           (By David Rogers)\n\n       Invoking ``states rights'' and the Constitution, Senate \n     Republicans Thursday torpedoed an ambitious plan to create a \n     national blue ribbon bipartisan commission to do a top-to-\n     bottom review of the U.S. criminal justice system and report \n     back potential reforms in 18 months.\n       The 57-43 roll call--three short of the 60 supermajority \n     needed--dramatized again how politically divided the chamber \n     has become.\n       Almost identical legislation cleared the House in the last \n     Congress on a simple voice vote with Republican backing and \n     had been approved with bipartisan support in the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee last year as well.\n       Given endorsements from the American Bar Association and \n     many police and sheriffs organizations, proponents had hoped \n     to clear the 60 vote supermajority required in the Senate. \n     But under a barrage of last-minute attacks, Republican \n     support wilted. And the chief sponsor, Sen. Jim Webb (D-Va.), \n     found himself deserted by even his long time associate and \n     fellow Vietnam veteran, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.).\n       ``We're not done,'' Webb told Politico. ``There were very \n     specific answers to everything that was raised there. There \n     is no states rights issue in convening the best minds in \n     America to give you advice and observations about the overall \n     criminal justice system.''\n       ``I thought he was voting with us,'' Webb said of McCain. \n     The Arizona Republican argued in a separate hallway interview \n     that the state-rights complaint was valid and also took issue \n     with how the 14-member commission, seven Republicans and \n     seven Democrats, would be chosen.\n       Indeed, Republicans argued that the White House would have \n     too much influence, effectively creating a 9-7 majority for \n     the administration. But Webb said the specific language that \n     one set of commission seats be chosen ``in agreement'' with \n     the White House had been the exact phrasing chosen by the \n     GOP. And Republicans are specifically promised control over \n     one of the two co-chairs.\n       Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas) took the lead in the \n     GOP's attacks, describing the commission as ``an overreach of \n     gigantic proportions'' and ``not a priority in these tight \n     budget times.''\n       ``We're absolutely ignoring the U.S. Constitution if you do \n     this,'' said Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) in closing. ``We have \n     no role unless we're violating human rights or the U.S. \n     Constitution to involve ourselves in the criminal court \n     system or penal system in my state or any other state . . . I \n     would urge a no vote against this and honor our \n     Constitution.''\n       The scene was in sharp contrast with events before the 2010 \n     mid-term elections.\n       In July that same year, nearly identical legislation sailed \n     through the House with the backing of Hutchison's fellow \n     Texan, Rep. Lamar Smith--now chairman of the House Judiciary \n     Committee. Support was so strong that the bill was called up \n     under expedited proceedings and passed without any member \n     even demanding a recorded vote.\n       By contrast, just four Senate Republicans backed Webb \n     Thursday: Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Orrin Hatch \n     of Utah, Olympia Snowe of Maine and Scott Brown of \n     Massachusetts.\n       Hatch is a former Senate Judiciary Committee chairman. And \n     Graham, a close friend of McCain, is prominent as well on the \n     committee which reported a similar version of the bill in \n     January last year--also before the 2010 elections.\n       Individual Republican senators said they had come under \n     pressure from local district attorneys and judges in drug \n     courts to oppose Webb. But the Democrat countered that he had \n     strong support from the drug court judiciary and the model \n     for his proposal was the influential presidential commission \n     on crime and the judicial system in the mid 1960's led by \n     then-Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach.\n       Webb said that 40 years later it is reasonable to have a \n     second review, especially given the high incarceration rate \n     in the U.S. at a time of relatively low crime rates.\n       ``Our criminal justice system is broken in many areas,'' he \n     told the Senate in his own floor comments. ``We need a \n     national commission to look at the criminal justice system \n     from point of apprehension through reentry into society of \n     people who have been incarcerated.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                     [From Newsday, Oct. 24, 2011]\n\n               Keeler: Justice System Needs To Be Studied\n\n                            (By Bob Keeler)\n\n       If we're ever going to get a handle on why we lock up so \n     many Americans and find out if we're paying too much for too \n     little benefit, this is the time. The cut-the-deficit chorus \n     in Washington seems to have made even the law-and-order hawks \n     have second thoughts about prison costs.\n       But last week, a perfectly sensible proposal for a broad \n     examination of the nation's criminal justice system died in \n     the Senate. Sponsored by Sen. Jim Webb (D-Va.), it would have \n     done nothing more radical than create a blue-ribbon \n     commission to spend 18 months looking into the system, then \n     recommend reforms. The United States has a far higher per \n     capita rate of prisoners than the world average. If we're \n     locking up people for too long, or for the wrong reasons, and \n     if we can save billions of dollars without increasing crime, \n     it's an idea whose time has come.\n       In fact, Webb's bill enjoys broad support among law \n     enforcement groups, such as the International Association of \n     Chiefs of Police and the National Sheriffs' Association. In \n     2010, the House of Representatives passed it. And last week, \n     Webb tried to get it adopted in the Senate as an amendment to \n     an appropriations measure.\n       It got 57 votes, including four Republicans--not enough to \n     get past the 60-vote filibuster barrier. The 43 nay votes all \n     came from Republicans. And Webb was mightily miffed.\n       ``Their inflammatory arguments defy reasonable explanation \n     and were contradicted by the plain language of our \n     legislation,'' Webb said in a statement after the vote. ``To \n     suggest, for example, that the nonbinding recommendations of \n     a bipartisan commission threaten the Constitution is \n     absurd.''\n       Webb's strong words should come as no surprise. He's a \n     fighter, like the Scots-Irish forebears he celebrated in a \n     book called ``Born Fighting: How the Scots-Irish Shaped \n     America.''\n       He's a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy and a Marine \n     Corps veteran of Vietnam, where he earned the Navy Cross, the \n     Silver Star, two Bronze Stars and two Purple Hearts. Later, \n     he served as Navy secretary under President Ronald Reagan. \n     He's a prolific author, including a novel of Vietnam,``Fields \n     of Fire.''\n       So Webb is tough--not the soft liberal often associated \n     with prison reform. His passion for it goes back decades. In \n     the military, he served on courts-martial. Later, as an \n     attorney, he defended pro bono a young ex-Marine convicted of \n     murder in Vietnam. In 1984, for Parade Magazine, he went to \n     Japan to write about its justice system. ``Since then,'' he \n     wrote in 2009 in Parade, ``Japan's prison population has not \n     quite doubled to 71,000, while ours has quadrupled to 2.3 \n     million. The UnitedStates has by far the world's highest \n     incarceration rate. With 5% of the world's population, our \n     country now houses nearly 25% of the world's reported \n     prisoners.''\n       He argues that we're locking up people who don't have to be \n     in prison--like nonviolent drug offenders--but not doing \n     enough to protect the public from violent gangs and drug \n     cartels.\n\n[[Page S6986]]\n\n       Over the years, I've spent a lot of time in prison, as a \n     reporter--starting with the Attica uprising in 1971 and \n     including a prison guard strike in 1979--and as a visitor. \n     I've interviewed inmates who make me glad there are stout \n     bars and high walls between them and society. And I've known \n     sad-sacks, whose incarceration protects no one and helps no \n     one.\n       Crime is a long-term problem, but short-term legislators \n     try to solve it with fixes that don't work, but do add \n     unnecessarily to the prison population.

Jim Webb's proposal for a \n     blue-ribbon commission to examine the nation's criminal \n     justice system.\n       The proposal had bipartisan support among legislators and \n     special-interest groups ranging from the American Civil \n     Liberties Union to the Fraternal Order of Police.\n       It promised to have two co-chairs--one Republican, one \n     Democrat--and a 14-member panel evenly represented by both \n     parties.\n       It restricted itself to completing its task--a top-to-\n     bottom review of strengths and weaknesses in the federal, \n     state and local criminal justice systems, with an aim to \n     identify ways to become fairer, more efficient and more cost-\n     effective--within just 18 months.\n       And it was designed to carry out all of its work--convening \n     hearings, calling experts, analyzing data, issuing reports--\n     on a budget of $5 million.\n       Last year, the legislation rolled through the House with \n     virtually no opposition. But this week, Webb's proposal was \n     shelved after a few Republicans dropped their support.\n       Excuses varied, but Texas Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison managed \n     to articulate her opposition in a way that underscored the \n     kind of myopia that has rendered Congress, and particularly \n     the Senate, a counterproductive force in American government.\n       She described the legislation, according to Politico, as \n     ``not a priority in these tight budget times,'' a tenuous \n     claim if there ever were one. Even in tough times, spending \n     what amounts to less than a drop in the bucket (the \n     Department of Justice alone spends more than $28 billion) as \n     a means to save far more should be viewed as a financially \n     and morally prudent move.\n       Oklahoma Sen. Tom Coburn offered his own reason: Such a \n     commission would violate states' rights and the Constitution. \n     The claim is nonsense, given that the commission's intent is \n     to offer recommendations, not binding directives.\n       But those spurious arguments were sufficient to sway enough \n     Republican senators to disown the notion of improving a \n     system that, as Webb has repeatedly noted, puts four times as \n     many mentally ill Americans into prisons as into mental \n     health institutions.\n       The system accounts for 25 percent of the world's prison \n     population, even though the United States is home to just 5 \n     percent of the people. It has funneled more than $1 trillion \n     into a war on drugs that has ruined countless lives, resulted \n     in thousands of deaths and sent inmate populations soaring.\n       Perhaps the most revealing commentary on Webb's proposal--\n     and on the nation's criminal justice system and America's \n     readiness to change it--was delivered this week.\n       It originated far from the halls of Congress. It came in \n     the form of a poll, conducted by Gallup, that showed that for \n     the first time in modern U.S. history, half of Americans \n     favored the legalization of marijuana, a drug that has \n     created millions of criminals in America and cost untold \n     billions of dollars.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From National Review Online, Oct. 21, 2011]\n\n                          An Absolute Scandal\n\n                           (By Reihan Salam)\n\n       The insane refusal of 43 Senate Republicans to back the \n     National Criminal justice Commission Act. Even Sen. Tom \n     Coburn of Oklahoma, easily one of my favorite legislators, \n     covered himself in non-glory on this one by suggesting that \n     the commission might be unconstitutional, despite the fact \n     that all it established was a bipartisan panel empowered to \n     make nonbinding recommendations.\n       There were, however, four Senate Republicans who backed the \n     proposal: Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Orrin G. \n     Hatch of Utah, Olympia Snowe of Maine and Scott Brown of \n     Massachusetts.\n       Why do we need a commission? Senator Webb, the sponsor of \n     the proposal, offered a fact sheet recounting the scale of \n     the problem:\n       The United States has by far the world's highest \n     incarceration rate. With five per cent of the world's \n     population, our country now houses twenty-five percent of the \n     world's reported prisoners. More than 2.3 million Americans \n     are now in prison, and another 5million remain on probation \n     or parole.\n       Our prison population has skyrocketed over the past two \n     decades as we have incarcerated more people for non-violent \n     crimes and acts driven by mental illness or drug dependence.\n       The costs to our federal, state, and local governments of \n     keeping repeat offenders in the criminal justice system \n     continue to grow during a time of increasingly tight budgets.\n       Existing practices too often incarcerate people who do not \n     belong in prison, taking resources away from locking up high-\n     risk, violent offenders who are a threat to our communities.\n       2.3 million + 5 million = 7.3 million. Roughly 24 percent \n     of the 310 million U.S. residents are under the age of 18, \n     leaving us with roughly 235.6 million adults. So that means \n     that 3.1 percent of adults are behind bars, on probation, or \n     on parole right now. There are, of course, millions of ex-\n     offenders.\n       This population is disproportionately male and \n     disproportionately black, which means that the impact of mass \n     incarceration is particularly significant for African \n     American children. Basically, doing a bid limits your ability \n     to acquire the kind of skills you need to climb the jobs \n     ladder, in part because employers are (understandably) \n     reluctant to hire ex-offenders.\n       If we're even incarcerating five percent of these \n     individuals needlessly, we're causing a massive amount of \n     damage. Why? Apart from the collateral damage on families and \n     children, we might actually make the crime problem worse. The \n     more we incarcerate people, the less severe the stigma \n     associated with being incarcerated. And reducing the stigma \n     actually reduces the effectiveness of incarceration as a \n     deterrent.\n       Having grown up in central Brooklyn during the crack \n     epidemic, I have some familiarity with fear of crime. \n     Reducing crime should be an urgent priority, in my view. Even \n     the so-called ``great American crime decline'' has left us \n     with rates of violent crime radically higher than what we saw \n     in the early 20th century, as William Stuntz observed in his \n     last book:\n       New York is America's safest large city, the city that saw \n     crime fall the most and the fastest during the 1990s and the \n     early part of this decade. Yet New York's murder rate is 80 \n     percent higher now than it was at the beginning of the \n     twentieth century--notwithstanding an imprisonment rate four \n     times higher now than then. That crime gap is misleadingly \n     small; thanks to advances in emergency medicine, a large \n     fraction of those early twentieth-century homicide victims \n     would survive their wounds today. Taking account of medical \n     advances, New York is probably not twice as violent as a \n     century ago, but several times more violent At best, the \n     crime drop must be counted a pyrrhic victory.\n       If locking people up in increasingly large numbers were \n     really the most cost-effective way to keep our cities safe, \n     I'd be all for it. Overwhelming evidence suggests that this \n     is not in fact the case. The people who profit most from \n     today's approach to mass incarceration are not potential \n     crime victims. Rather, they are the workers--most of them \n     unionized public sector workers--who staff our prisons.\n       So yes: why would we want to study more cost-effective \n     alternatives to reducing crime when we can pour billions of \n     dollars in taxpayer money into the hands of an industry that \n     channels that money back into lobbying and political \n     advertising on behalf of longer prison sentences, all to keep \n     the gravy train going?\n\n  Mr. WEBB.

I want to say a word on another interesting issue which \ntook place today. You may have noticed that Bank of America has decided \nto withdraw its $5 fee for debit transfers. Let me tell you, the Bank \nof America, like the other banks that were going to go forward in \nimposing these fees, did not withdraw them because they were nice guys. \nThey withdrew them because the American people said ``enough is \nenough'' in terms of the greed of Wall Street.\n  Let us never forget that it was the Bank of America and the other \nhuge financial institutions on Wall Street that caused the recession we \nare in, resulting in millions of people losing their jobs, their homes, \ntheir life savings. Let us never forget that when Wall Street was on \nthe verge of collapse, it was the American people and the Fed who \nbailed them out. And now that Wall Street and the large banks are \nmaking very handsome profits, paying their CEOs some of the largest \ncompensation packages they have ever received, their thank you to the \nAmerican people was to charge them a $5 a month debit fee.\n  But do you know what happened? The American people said thanks but no \nthanks. It wasn't the Senate that turned this around. It wasn't the \nHouse that turned this around. It was the American people. I applaud \nthe people on the Occupying Wall Street campaign who focused attention \non the greed of Wall Street, and the millions of other Americans who \nhave said enough is enough.\n  The point here, which is a very profound point--which is ultimately \nwhat politics is all about--is that if the American people at the \ngrassroots level begin to stand up and fight back, profound and \npositive changes can take place in this country. If the American people \nstand up and say: No, we are not going to cut Social Security, we are \nnot going to cut Medicare, we are not going to cut Medicaid, or \neducation, but we are going to move toward a balanced budget by asking \nthe wealthiest people in this country, whose effective tax rate is the \nlowest in decades, to start paying their fair share of taxes, we can do \nthat. We don't have to cut Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid.\n  If the American people say maybe we have got to end these outrageous \ntax loopholes that allow oil companies--which are making huge profits \nright now--in some years to pay nothing in Federal income taxes, we can \nend those loopholes as well.\n  If the American people say, well, maybe before we cut programs for \nthe elderly, the sick, the children, and the poor, maybe we want to \nmake sure those companies and individuals who stash their money in tax \nhavens such as the Cayman Islands, where we lose $100 billion a year \nbecause of the tax havens--when we rally the American people and they \nstand up and say enough is enough, we can change that too.\n  So today I congratulate the American people. You did it. You took on \nthe largest financial institution in the United States of America and \nyou beat it. And that should be step one. We should go on from there. \nThe American grassroots has to continue to speak out in the fight for \nsocial justice in this country.\n  I yield the floor, and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, Bank of America made an announcement. \nThey announced they were eliminating their proposed $5 monthly fee for \nthe use of a debit card. We have kept track and I believe every bank \nacross America has said we are abandoning this approach, and it is a \ngood thing. It is an indication to me that consumers across America \nhave a much larger voice in this process today than they did even a few \nweeks ago.\n  Consumers and customers of major banks paid close attention when many \nof these banks, such as Bank of America, said they were going to charge \nthese customers $5 a month to have access to their own money in their \nchecking account. I was asked at the time: What should we do? I said: \nCustomers of these banks should vote with their feet. Start looking for \nanother bank. Find a bank or a credit union that treats them in the \nmanner they want to be treated--fairly and respectfully.\n  The message got out, and that message ended up creating a substantial \nmove of customers from some banking institutions to others. Some \nreports suggest the activity on credit union Web sites is now up 800 \npercent. The people at community banks all across America have signs in \nfront of their banks saying, for instance, the one in Georgia: We agree \ndebit cards should be free.\n  What we have at work is two very fundamental principles of our \neconomy, the free market economy--transparency so people know what they \nare being charged, and competition so they have a choice. I think those \nare the two pillars of a successful free market economy. Now the \nbanking industry, in many respects, is being introduced to it. I think \nthis is a healthy thing.\n  Prior to October 28, several large banks had announced they would \nbegin charging monthly debit fees on many of their customers' accounts, \nBank of America, $5; Wells Fargo, $3; Chase, $4; SunTrust of Atlanta, \n$5; Regions Financial of Birmingham, AL, $4. Numerous other large banks \nhad made it clear they would not charge the monthly fees, including: \nU.S. Bancorp, Citigroup, PNC, KeyCorp, USAA, and more.\n  In response to consumer reaction to their fee announcements, on \nFriday October 28 Wells Fargo and Chase announced they were abandoning \ntheir plans to charge these fees.\n  On Monday, October 31, SunTrust and Regions Financial announced they \nwould also abandon their fee plans.\n  Today, Bank of America announced it too would abandon its monthly fee \nplans.\n  Warren Buffett--a man I have come to know and respect--is an investor \nin some of these large banks, and he was asked over lunch recently to \nreact to the Bank of America $5 monthly fee. He lifted his glass of \nCoca-Cola and said it was like New Coke. It told the story that \nsometimes large companies lose touch with their consumers and their \ncustomers and make bad decisions.\n  The question is, What will come of this next? I think we ought to ask \nourselves: What have we learned from this experience over the last \nseveral weeks\n\n[[Page S6988]]\n\nand what do we hope it leads to? Certainly, we want more transparency, \ncompetition, and choice, but in order for that to happen, we need more \ndisclosures so the average customer of a bank knows what they are \ngetting into.\n  Have any of us taken the time to read the back of that monthly credit \ncard statement? As a lawyer, I can tell you that if you asked for the \nentire statement concerning fees at banks, it is over 100 pages. It is \nalmost impossible to decipher. We have to get down to the basics, where \nwe understand our relationship with these financial institutions so we \ncan choose those that serve our needs or the needs of our businesses. \nThat is why the Pew Charitable Trusts came up with a valuable \nsuggestion. They have a one-page disclosure form that lists the basic \nfees banks charge. What they are suggesting is every bank should adopt \nthis just as we have a basic box on the back of food products with \ningredients we can turn to. It shows how many calories, how much \nsodium, how many carbohydrates. We could have a basic disclosure on \nevery bank's Web site so America can go shopping. Competition, free \nmarket. I think that is a healthy thing.\n  The second thing we need to follow on is the discovery that there are \nsuch things as swipe fees. We suspected it, but we didn't know what was \ngoing on when we handed over a piece of plastic at a restaurant or \ngrocery store to buy something. It turns out every time that is swiped, \nthe retailer, the restaurant or the business, is charged. How much are \nthey charged? A variety of different amounts. Frankly, that grocery \nstore, that bookstore has no ability to negotiate that fee. It is a \n``take it or leave it'' situation. You want plastic from Visa or \nMasterCard, then you go ahead and pay this fee or else. That has \nchanged, and the world has changed with it.\n  When the Federal Reserve got the new authority October 1 to put in \nplace a reasonable swipe fee for debit cards at about 21 cents a \ntransaction, things started changing. There is a lot of money at stake. \nIf we add up all the money collected at banks across America for swipe \nfees, for debit and credit cards, it is about $50 billion a year. It is \na huge amount. We all pay it. We pay on the bottom line at the \nrestaurant or grocery store or wherever we shopping if we use plastic.\n  Now there is a 21-cent ceiling established by the Federal Reserve on \nthe debit card fees that Visa and MasterCard set on behalf of large \nbanks, and that is what caused all the reaction by the banks, saying \nthey were going to charge their customers even more because of it.\n  We need even more disclosure. For the largest banks in America, the \ntop 1 percent of banks, if we go to an ATM machine today and put in our \ncard, at some point they will usually notify us what the ATM fee is and \nwe can accept it or not accept it. I think that same kind of disclosure \nshould be made on swipe fees. On the monthly credit card statements \nacross America, we should see in parentheses next to purchases how much \nwas paid by that retailer to the credit card company and the card-\nissuing bank. I think it will be a surprise to many people as to how \nmuch they are paying every time they use plastic. I should say how much \nretailers are paying and then charging customers in higher prices \nbecause of swipe fees when they use plastic. That is more information. \nThat is more transparency. That allows us to understand the \nrelationship that, to this point, has been hidden in secret. I think \nthat is an important thing.\n\n  I have also been talking to Senator Reed of Rhode Island. He has some \nthoughts on interesting legislation he and I are working on concerning \nthe actual cost of credit card fee transactions to the banks and to the \ncredit card companies so we will have a better understanding in that \ncategory as well.\n  What we are saying is something significant has happened over the \nlast several weeks. I hope it is the beginning of a trend. One way to \nmake sure this trend continues to the benefit of consumers and families \nand small businesses all across America is to make sure Richard Cordray \nis appointed as the head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. \nThis, to me, is an agency which can continue this battle on behalf of \nconsumers. It is literally the only consumer financial protection \nagency in the Federal Government.\n  Many on the other side of the aisle don't like it. They don't believe \nin strong government oversight of these financial institutions on Wall \nStreet. I disagree. I think Americans deserve to be given the basic \ninformation about their financial transactions so, with that \ninformation, they can make their own decisions. I am not saying \ngovernment should steer them one way or the other, but at least give us \nthe basic information. Let me decide the best bank for my family. Let \nme decide the best credit card or debit card for my family or my \nbusiness. That is all we can ask.\n  Finally, let me say this: This establishment of a debit card swipe \nfee limit is a breakthrough for many retailers. When I talk to \nretailers, large and small, some of them chain stores and others just \nlocal stores, they were getting killed with this fee. It turned out to \nbe the second or third most expensive item every single month. After \npersonnel, after rent, here came the swipe fees they had to pay to \nVisa, MasterCard, and the banks that issue their card.\n  Now these retailers feel like there has been a light that has been \nshined on this process and a limit that has been established when it \ncomes to debit cards. Sadly, in some cases it has been abused. Redbox, \nwhich is a retailer of movies that most of us see--even in Springfield, \nIL--next to the drug store, where we put in $1 and take a movie home, \nhas announced they had to raise the price of their movies from $1 to \n$1.20 because of this new law. We looked into it. Here is what \nhappened. They used to be charged a lower swipe fee by the debit and \ncredit card companies, but now these companies are trying to make up \ntheir money that their bank allies are losing from this ceiling and \nthey are raising their lower swipe fee rates to unreasonably high \nlevels and passing the higher charges along to merchants like Redbox. \nSo some merchants need help.\n  The Federal Reserve has continuing jurisdiction and authority when it \ncomes to that help. I hope they will take a look at some of the \nconsequences to companies such as Redbox. I think what happened to them \nis unreasonable and unfair. I think the Federal Reserve has the \nauthority to change it.\n  So we are at a tipping point. For years, the big banks had been \nrigging the rules with a lot of fees and charges we were not even aware \nof. The consumers of America have said enough. Through a combination of \nreasonable regulation and consumers voting with their feet, we are \nbringing transparency and competition back to the financial services \nindustry. It is working and it is long overdue.\n  Consumers are now saying they will only do business with banks that \ncare about serving them instead of squeezing them. It is a good thing.\n  We have to do more things. Let's confirm Richard Cordray and let's \nget it done soon so the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau can go to \nwork to help us. Let's ensure that all bank fees are transparent, such \nas the model checking account fee disclosure I mentioned earlier from \nthe Pew Charitable Trusts. And let's ensure that all swipe fees are \ntransparent, because consumers ultimately pay those fees in higher \nprices.\n  By promoting transparency and competition, we're going to help \nrestore the balance between Wall Street and Main Street.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, I rise today to speak about the \nsignificance of the month of November, which just began. About 10 years \nago, Members of Congress decided to designate November as ``National \nAdoption Month.'' I think it was probably because November is sort of \nthe beginning of the holiday season, with Thanksgiving and then \nChristmas to\n\n[[Page S6989]]\n\nfollow in December. So it is a time when Americans from all parts of \nour country take stock, slow down, and think about how important family \nis. We saw that a little bit last night with Halloween and all the \nchildren and their parents trick-or-treating throughout our Nation. \nThen, as Thanksgiving approaches, it becomes even more significant as \nfamilies from all different walks of life gather around tables.\n  Some tables are very plentiful and others are rather sparse based on \nthe economic strength of the family. Nonetheless, many families gather \nfor these holidays.\n  It reminds us that there are over 500,000 children in our country \ntoday who are without family. They have been separated from their \nfamilies, sometimes for good cause, but it is all tragic. Children have \nto be separated from families that abuse or grossly neglect them, and \nthey have to be placed temporarily until we, as government officials \nand nonprofit organizations, can do a better job of either \nstrengthening and reuniting those children with their families and \ntrying to heal the families or trying to promote another family for \nthat child or that sibling group.\n  We do much in Congress both collectively as well as individually in \nour own way to try to bring attention to the fact that there are \norphans in America. Of the 500,000 children in foster care, about \n100,000 have had parental rights terminated because the State has \ndecided that reunification is not possible because children would be \nharmed irreparably by going back to that family. So we work to try to \nfind another family, a better family to raise children.\n  Governments do a lot of things well, but one that governments don't \ndo well is raise children. Moms and dads and parents and families and \nresponsible adults do that, not government. So these children, then, \nare in the temporary care of the government, but it is our hope they \ncan be placed as soon as possible into the loving arms of families.\n  I have met hundreds of families who have adopted, including my own. \nIt is a blessing to my husband and to me. I have just recently met a \nfamily from Minnesota. The parents already have several biological \nchildren. When they found out about the death of a woman and her \nhusband in the Philippines that resulted in nine children of that \nfamily being orphaned, they stepped up and adopted all nine of those \nchildren from the Philippines. Because of the good work of Senator \nKlobuchar and others, they were able to bring that whole sibling group \nto the United States.\n  I could go on and on and tell my colleagues the most remarkable \nstories. As Members travel around the Capitol complex this month, they \nwill be very happy to see, in the Rotunda of the Russell Senate Office \nBuilding, a very special exhibit. It is the National Heart Gallery \nExhibit.\n  About some 10 years ago, or maybe even less, some great nonprofits \ngot together and said: What can we do to help show Americans that these \nare beautiful children with lots of potential just waiting for a chance \nfor a family to call their own? As a result, photographers donated \ntheir time to take beautiful portraits of these children so they don't \nlook like just mug shots but beautiful portraits of these children, and \nsome of them are going to be on display. This is an opportunity for us \nto become more familiar with how many different kinds of children are \navailable for adoption. I say that as sensitively as I can.\n  These are children who are waiting for a family. They would love to \nbe adopted. They want to have a family forever. A person doesn't just \nneed a family until they are 18; a person needs a family forever. A \nyoung lady would like a father to walk her down the aisle when she is \nmarried or she would like her mother to show up at the baptism of her \nchild. A person would like a place to go home to even in their forties \nand fifties for Thanksgiving. So we don't think anyone is too old to be \nadopted, and everyone needs a family. So we will see pictures of these \nchildren.\n  Let me make a couple of other points about this national exhibit. It \nhas traveled around to many cities. Perhaps it has been to the \nPresiding Officer's State of New Hampshire, I don't know. We would be \nhappy to have it in Louisiana. But it is in the Nation's Capital for \nthis 10th anniversary.\n  These numbers do sound staggering: 500,000 in foster care and 100,000 \nwaiting to be adopted. Let me put it in this perspective. There are \nover 100 million children in the United States--one-third of our \npopulation--between the ages of roughly zero and 13. So 100,000 is a \nrelatively small number. There are roughly 300,000 churches in America. \nSo if just one family within three churches--just one family among \nthree churches--decided to step up and say they will take a child into \ntheir home, we would have no more orphans in the United States, which \nis our goal. Our goal is for every child in the United States and in \nthe world, if they are separated from their birth family, to find \nwithin a short period of time a home to call their own, preferably with \na relative in kinship care but, if not, somewhere in the community.\n  I don't think this is a difficult or an impossible task. It seems \noverwhelming, but when we think of the assets of the world and we \njuxtapose the assets and strengths of the world against this particular \nproblem, it is most certainly doable. If we can go to the Moon, if we \ncan explore science and space, we most certainly can put our good minds \nand senses together to figure out a way that governments can work \nbetter with nonprofits to make this happen.\n  I wish to conclude by recognizing what I believe is one of the \nextraordinary organizations in the world doing this work, and that is \nthe Dave Thomas Foundation. Many people may remember Dave Thomas as the \nfounder of Wendy's, but I remember Dave Thomas as a child who came out \nof the foster care system--or a man who came out of the foster care \nsystem; I did not know him as a child. But I can remember him--he has \npassed, of course--coming to Congress advocating on behalf of foster \ncare children, of which he was one.\n  Now, he beat the odds. Not only did he go on to be successful and go \non to create one of the most successful businesses in America today and \nperhaps even in the world, but as he has passed, his foundation carries \non that work. They have just released a wonderful report which will \ncome more into focus in the coming weeks.\n  The bottom line is that through the work of this foundation, they \nhave come up with new strategies--not complicated, quite simple, child-\nfocused, recruitment strategies that each and every one of our States \ncan employ or deploy and use without a lot more expense to see \nsignificant increases in the number of older children--particularly \nchildren with mental challenges and emotional challenges--adopted. In \nfact, they have increased, according to the study.\n  Research shows that children in foster care served by Wendy's \nWonderful Kids are 1.7 times more likely and children with mental \ndisorders are 3 times more likely to be adopted using these different \nstrategies.\n  So, in conclusion, this is National Adoption Month. We have the Heart \nGallery in the Capitol and in Washington with pictures of some of the \nmost extraordinary children. Their families may be broken, their \nfamilies may be dysfunctional, but it doesn't mean they are. It means \nthey are full of potential, ready for a family to call them their own, \nand to step up and to live up to their potential. There are many \norganizations, from this nonprofit to Wendy's Wonderful Kids, the Dave \nThomas Foundation, and hundreds of others working to solve this \nproblem.\n  So I thank my colleagues. Many have been very active this last year \nin this regard. I wanted to honor the Heart Gallery and the great work \nof the organizations that have put that together. It has made a \nmeaningful difference, making these children, through these beautiful \nphotographs, very real to all of us so we know they are not just \nstatistics but they are children with heartbeats and dreams and hopes \nand aspirations, and they would make wonderful additions to many of our \nfamilies.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, today I wish to take a few moments to \ntalk about the importance of the oversight work of the Congress. It is \na very critical function of Congress. As one of the three branches of \ngovernment, Congress is a very important pillar of our government. Our \nsystem provides for checks and balances between the three branches of \ngovernment. Not only do we in the Congress legislate, but we must make \nsure the other two branches are not overstepping their power, and that \nis the function of oversight.\n  I have been conducting oversight of the executive branch since I \nfirst came to the Senate. I take oversight very seriously. It is often \nan overlooked function for Members of Congress. It is not a glamorous \nfunction. It is a lot of hard work.\n  Some people have said recently that my oversight work is political. \nQuite honestly, people who say that are the ones who are, in fact, \npolitical or may be ignorant of what I do because I happen to be an \nequal opportunity overseer. I do not care if it is a Democrat or a \nRepublican occupying the White House; if something needs to be \ninvestigated, I am going to investigate it.\n  In 2008, I was glad to hear the President-elect talk about the most \ntransparent government ever that he was going to institute under his \nadministration. Unfortunately, up to this point, this administration \nhas been far from transparent--at least far from transparent in the way \nhe said he was going to be so transparent. If any of us thought it was \nbad before, it is worse now.\n  But my message about oversight is combined with a very important \nreminder about the rule of law, a philosophy upon which our country was \nfounded. So I would like to talk about this administration's evasive \nand disappointing response to Congress about two different policies: \nfirst, the immigration policy and administrative enforcement of that, \nand second, Operation Fast and Furious. I will first discuss \nimmigration.\n  Since the founding of our country, our immigration laws have been a \nsource of discussion. We were born a nation of immigrants and still are \nwelcoming to people coming to our country legally. We have welcomed men \nand women from diverse countries and provided protection to many who \nflee from persecution. We have been generous, and we will continue to \nbe generous. Yet we have seen our country face many challenges and have \nattempted to restrict immigration levels. The first immigration law of \n1790 tried to limit citizenship to certain individuals and institute \nwhat is called the ``good moral character'' requirement. We created \nquotas in the 1920s, to only do away with those quotas 45 years later. \nWe even provided amnesty to millions of undocumented and hard-working \npeople in the last big immigration law to pass Congress in 1986. Today, \nwe are faced with another challenge of how to deal with more than 10 \nmillion undocumented persons.\n  Congress struggles with this challenge on a yearly basis. It is \nimportant for lawmakers to bear in mind that the policies we make \nshould benefit our country in the long term and that they must be fair \nto current as well as future generations.\n  People in foreign lands yearn to be free. They go to great lengths to \nbe a part of our great country. It is a privilege that people love our \ncountry and want to become Americans. At the same time, however, we \nmust not forget the great principle upon which our country was founded, \nand that great principle is the rule of law. We want to welcome new \nAmericans, but we need to live by the rules we have set. We cannot let \nour welcome mat be trampled on, and we cannot allow our system of laws \nto be undermined.\n  As a Senator, like all of my colleagues, I took an oath of office to \nhonor the Constitution. I bear a fundamental allegiance to uphold the \nrule of law. That is why I am deeply concerned about the immigration \npolicies that are coming from this White House. The President's \npolicies may be an impermissible intrusion on Congress's plenary \nauthority over immigration law. They are pushing the envelope, and \nthere is little transparency into their actions at a time when \ntransparency was promised by this administration at the time they were \nsworn in.\n  As many of you know, last summer I exposed an internal homeland \nsecurity memo that outlines ways President Obama could circumvent \nCongress and grant legal status to millions of undocumented \nindividuals. So this is where oversight becomes very important--whether \nor not this memo is an intent to get around a law Congress passes which \nthe President of the United States, under his oath of office, has \npledged to faithfully enforce. This memo was entitled ``Administrative \nAlternatives to Comprehensive Immigration Reform.'' That title in and \nof itself kind of signifies efforts to get around law, to get around \nwhat Congress intended. Its purpose was, in their words, ``to reduce \nthe threat of removal of certain individuals present in the United \nStates without authorization.'' Now why, if you are enforcing and \nfaithfully executing the laws of the United States, would you want to \n``reduce the threat of removal of certain individuals present in the \nUnited States without authorization''? Aren't those words, ``without \nauthorization'' in and of themselves an indication that people might be \nhere illegally?\n  The memo outlined more than a dozen ways to keep individuals in the \ncountry and to provide them with benefits or protections. I, along with \nmy colleagues in the Congress, have asked repeatedly for assurances \nthat those options were not being explored. But, you know what. \nOur concerns have not been addressed. The President and the Secretary \nof Homeland Security have only said they do not plan to provide such \nbenefits to the entire population of undocumented individuals. They \nclaim they will use their discretionary authority and pursue relief on \na limited and case-by-case basis. To the extent to which it is limited \nand it is case-by-case, I confess, the law probably provides for some \nadministrative discretion because if you are going to have people come \nto this country, Congress is not going to be able to write a law that \nis going to take every instance into consideration. But I go back to \nthat title: ``Administrative Alternatives to Comprehensive Immigration \nReform.'' So there is a need to change the laws on immigration, update \nthem. So if everybody admits there is that need, why do you need \nadministrative alternatives, unless you are trying to get around what \nCongress intended?\n\n  So we are asking these questions, and yet we have no idea if it is \ntrue that they want to do it strictly on a case-by-case and very \nlimited basis because we have reason to believe we are talking about \nhundreds of thousands of people because we have no idea how many people \nare truly receiving the benefits and what standards are being used when \ndetermining that an individual is granted parole or deferred action. \nThese are the questions that, in our oversight capacity, we are asking, \nbut we are not getting very many answers, as I am going to show you \nhere.\n  Again quoting the title, ``Administrative Alternatives to \nComprehensive Immigration Reform,'' this memo from last summer also \nincluded a proposal to lessen the ``extreme hardship standard.'' Under \ncurrent law, aliens are inadmissible for 3 to 10 years if they have \nbeen unlawfully present in the United States for 180 days in the case \nof a 3-year inadmissibility or 1 year in case of 10 years of \ninadmissibility. The Department has discretion to waive the grounds for \ninadmissibility if it would result in an extreme hardship. Again, I am \nwilling to grant that there is some leeway in the law here.\n  The amnesty memo states: ``To increase the number of individuals \napplying for waivers and improve their chances of receiving them, \nCitizenship\n\n[[Page S6991]]\n\nand Immigration Services could issue guidance or a regulation \nspecifying a lower evidentiary standard for extreme hardship.'' Now, \n``extreme hardship'' ought to mean the same from administration to \nadministration, not some special definition of ``extreme hardship'' \nbecause we have a President who maybe wants to find some way of getting \naround the immigration laws because he does not want to work hard \nenough to get immigration reform passed through the Congress.\n  Proponents argue that this redefinition of ``extreme hardship'' is \nneeded for family unity and that the 3-year and 10-year bars are overly \nburdensome. Well, Congress did not consider the 3- and 10-year bars to \nbe overly burdensome or we would not have put them in the law in the \nfirst place. If this standard is lessened, an untold number of \nundocumented individuals will be able to bypass the 3-year and 10-year \nbars that are clearly laid out in the Immigration and Nationality Act. \nMy concern is that this policy, if implemented, is a blatant way to \ncircumvent Congress and the law to keep as many undocumented aliens in \nthe United States as possible.\n  It is difficult to ascertain if this change or any other proposal \nfrom the amnesty memo is being considered by the Secretary, so I asked \nthe Secretary about this very proposal when she testified before the \nJudiciary Committee about 2 weeks ago. She admitted that existing \nimmigration law is difficult, but the Secretary would not deny that \ndiscussions about changing the standards are even taking place.\n  Well, what about the memo to which I referred? Frankly, she refused \nto comment about the proposal during the hearing. Indeed, she said she \nwas focused on exercising enforcement functions, which gets me to my \nnext issue.\n  A year after the 2010 amnesty memo circulated, we learned that the \nhead of Immigration and Customs Enforcement--and we use the acronym \n``ICE'' for that--which is the agency responsible for enforcing the \nlaw, apprehending and deporting undocumented people in this country, \ndirected his agents to use ``prosecutorial discretion'' on those with \nwhom they come in contact. What does this mean? In June of this year, \nAssistant Secretary Morton released a memo directing ICE officers to \nexercise prosecutorial discretion and to consider the alien's length of \npresence in the United States, the circumstances of the alien's arrival \nin the United States, particularly if the alien came as a young \nchild. Also, take into consideration the alien's criminal history, the \nalien's age, whether there was service in the military, and whether \nthey came here to pursue education in the United States.\n\n  On August 19 of this year, Secretary Napolitano announced an \ninitiative to establish a working group to sort through an untold \nnumber of cases currently pending before the immigration review office \nand also before the Federal courts to determine if they can be \n``administratively closed.'' This gets into big numbers. There are more \nthan 300,000 cases pending before the Executive Office of Immigration \nReview. The Secretary claims this process will allow them to direct \nresources at higher priority cases.\n  This memo and initiative outlined by the Secretary are concerning, \nespecially to those of us who said our country is based on the rule of \nlaw. These policies seem to contradict that very important philosophy \nunderlying our whole system of law.\n  On September 26 of this year, I led 18 of my Senate colleagues in \nsending a letter to President Obama expressing dissatisfaction with \nthese prosecutorial discretion policies. We said this administration \nwas encouraging undocumented aliens to come forward in hopes of relief. \nThis letter to the President is part of our constitutional \nresponsibility of oversight. It is going to the President of the United \nStates, who said he was going to have the most transparent \nadministration ever in the history of the country. So wouldn't you \nthink we would get a lot of answers?\n  We asked the President to rescind the June memo and end the \ninitiative outlined in August, and requested that he make the Secretary \navailable to all Members of the Senate to explain how his immigration \npolicies are consistent with the rule of law. It is a very simple \nprocess: Have one of your Cabinet people come here and explain it all \nto us.\n  Do you know what the President did? He asked a bureaucrat from the \nDepartment to respond to us on his behalf. The letter from this \nbureaucrat didn't address any points we made in our letter and shows a \ncomplete disregard for the concerns we raised. I tell a lot of people \nin both Republican administrations and Democratic administrations that \nI am overseeing--doing my constitutional responsibility of oversight. \nThe longer you stonewall, when the truth comes out, the more egg you \nare going to have on your face. That is going to be true in this \ninstance as well.\n  This is what we expect from the administration. We have many \nunanswered questions about this prosecutorial discretion initiative. \nFor example, how many cases will the working group sort through? You \ncan quantify that pretty easily. What standards will be used for \nadjudicating cases? In the rule of law, you ought to be able to tell us \nwhat the process is and what the standard is. Will those already \nordered removed be considered for relief? In other words, if somebody \nhas already figured out you ought to be removed from this country, is \nsomeone going to step in and say, no, maybe you don't have to be \nremoved? Will those with a criminal conviction be eliminated from \nconsideration for discretion? We ought to know if you commit a crime in \nthis country, besides coming here illegally, will you be removed or \nwill you be given some discretion--what you call prosecutorial \ndiscretion? How much in taxpayer money will be expended for this \neffort, and when will the working group finish its work? Will the \nDepartment of Homeland Security keep the committee apprised and provide \ndetailed information on who is granted a benefit, including work \nauthorization? What will happen to individuals who have their cases \n``administratively closed''?\n  Congress passes the laws, the President takes an oath to faithfully \nexecute those laws, and we have a constitutional responsibility to make \nsure that what Congress intended is carried out. We are not saying that \nmaybe Congress's intent isn't being carried out. We want questions \nanswered to determine whether they are being carried out. These are \npretty simple questions to the President. We ask for the Secretary to \ncome and answer these questions, and that doesn't happen. We get a \nletter back from some low-level bureaucrat who doesn't even answer the \nquestion.\n  How far can you go, and be morally and ethically correct, as \nPresident of the United States, saying at the time you were sworn in \nthat you are going to have the most transparent administration this \ncountry has ever seen, and then you stonewall Congress on simple \nquestions such as this policy that you want to carry out, called \nprosecutorial discretion?\n  We await answers and can only hope they will be more transparent \nabout these policies than on the amnesty memo--assuming we get answers \nto our questions.\n  The future of our country hinges, in part, on the policies this \nadministration is making behind our backs. Congress has a role to play. \nThat is not my position; that is the position of our Constitution.\n  We need more sunshine in our government in Washington on amnesty and \nnumerous other issues, including one of my oversight investigations \nthat involves a Federal law enforcement operation that went critically \nwrong.\n  I am now turning to Fast and Furious. This program was a multiagency \neffort, run by Federal prosecutors in Arizona and supervised by \nofficials in the Justice Department headquarters here in Washington, \nDC.\n  The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, or ATF, \nencouraged U.S. gun dealers--federally licensed gun dealers--to keep \nselling guns to people known to be transferring weapons to third \nparties. These buyers are called ``straw purchasers.'' There were lots \nof reasons for the gun dealers--federally licensed gun dealers--to be \nsuspicious of this operation. The straw buyers were purchasing the kind \nof assault rifles preferred by the Mexican drug cartels. They \nrepeatedly bought dozens of weapons at a time, and then returned days \nor weeks later to buy dozens more. They paid with paper bags full of \ntens of thousands of\n\n[[Page S6992]]\n\ndollars in cash and bought very expensive, high-powered .50 caliber \nsniper rifles.\n  All of this was plenty of cause for the dealers to report the sales \nto the ATF as suspicious, and then stop making the sales in the future. \nBut the ATF had even more reason to be suspicious than the gun dealers \nhad.\n  The Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, had tipped off the ATF \nabout the activity of the ringleader, using information from a wiretap \nin a related drug trafficking case. The ATF knew that some of the straw \nbuyers were on food stamps, or unemployed, so a legitimate explanation \nfor all the cash was very unlikely.\n  Most important, the ATF knew that the straw buyers' guns ended up at \ncrime scenes in Mexico just days or weeks after being bought in the \nUnited States. ATF knew all this information from the beginning of the \ninvestigation in late 2009.\n\n  As early as January of 2010, the DEA wiretaps had even collected \ndetailed information about who the ringleader was selling guns to, and \nthat information was available to the ATF. Yet our government allowed \nthe ring of straw buyers to grow and operate freely for about a year.\n  Starting in late 2009, agents who later blew the whistle on the \nmishandling of the case were ordered to merely watch and record what \nthe straw buyers were doing but not arrest them. The agents were not \nallowed to stop the straw buyers or even to question them. The agents \nwere not even allowed to continue following the guns once they were \ntransferred to unknown third parties or stash houses. Surveillance was \nsimply abandoned.\n  These details were apparently not provided to gun dealers, even \nthough these gun dealers cooperated with the ATF from the very \nbeginning. The government installed hidden cameras in at least one \nstore, and dealers notified ATF each time one of the straw buyers came \nin for another purchase of guns.\n  By March of 2010, the ATF had gathered evidence that the intent of \nthe straw buyers was to transfer these weapons to criminals and to \nMexican drug cartels. The ATF applied for wiretap authority and \nsupplied all the necessary details to the Justice Department in \nWashington. Yet it was not until December 15, 2010, that a single one \nof the straw buyers was arrested.\n  Was it just by coincidence or was it for some other reason that the \nday of the first arrest was the day that U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian \nTerry was murdered? Two of the weapons bought right under the ATF's \nnose nearly a year earlier turned up at the murder scene.\n  Within a day, the straw buyers of those two guns were finally \narrested. The other straw buyers were indicted a few weeks later, in \nJanuary 2011.\n  ATF agents who knew the ugly truth blew the whistle. The \nwhistleblowers made sure that Congress and the Terry family were fully \ninformed.\n  I started asking questions, and I have been asking questions ever \nsince. But getting answers out of a Justice Department which is \nstonewalling is like pulling teeth. At first, the Department explicitly \ndenied the allegations in writing, and officials implied it was all \nhogwash, in a widely attended briefing for Senate Judiciary Committee \nstaff.\n  But then the evidence started coming out. Document by document, \nwitness by witness, the truth became so clear that it was no longer \ndeniable. An internal briefing paper explicitly said that the strategy \nof the case was to ``allow the transfer of firearms to continue to take \nplace.''\n  E-mails proved that a gun dealer had prophetically worried that the \noperation could lead to the death of a Border Patrol agent. But ATF and \nDepartment of Justice officials reassured the dealers that cooperation \nwas still necessary. They falsely assured the dealer that there were \nsecret methods of stopping the guns before they went south.\n  The House Oversight Committee issued subpoenas and held two hearings. \nMy staff worked with them on two staff reports detailing the testimony \nand the documents we have gathered. The Justice Department stepped in \nand tried to control the flow of information, but we continued to \nreceive documents and information from confidential sources.\n  The Justice Department provided documents from the ATF files, but \nuntil yesterday very few documents from the Department of Justice \nfiles. The Department waited to deliver them until Halloween, to \nproduce the first substantial batches of documents from the Department \nof Justice, even though we asked for documents at the beginning of the \nsummer.\n  They also waited until the night before the head of the Criminal \nDivision, Lanny Breuer, was set to testify before the Judiciary \nCommittee to provide 652 pages of documents. Mr. Breuer also admitted \nto knowing all about gunwalking in what is referred to as Operation \nWide Receiver as far back as April 2010. We have to go through these \nnew documents to see what they contain. The first smaller batch of \ndocuments included several memos to Attorney General Holder that \nappeared to contradict the Attorney General's earlier claim that he had \nnever heard of Fast and Furious until sometime in April of this year.\n\n  The documents also show that Attorney General Holder's current chief \nof staff received a detailed briefing 18 months ago, in March of 2010. \nHe was the Acting Deputy Attorney General at the time, so, obviously, \nthe No. 2 person in the Justice Department.\n  The Deputy Attorney General even took detailed handwritten notes on \nthe presentation. However, Attorney General Holder says he didn't know \nanything about it until after the controversy became public. That is \nalso what Mr. Breuer said today as well.\n  I know the Attorney General was at least aware of the whistleblower \nallegations on January 31 of this year because I personally handed him \ntwo letters about the issues in my office on that very day. As for \nexactly what else he knew and when, his statements will have to be \ntested against the rest of the evidence as we continue to investigate.\n  Included in the documents released recently were e-mails between \nsenior Justice Department officials that explicitly talked about ``gun \nwalking,'' and these memos were dated October 2010. ``Gun walking'' is \na term the whistleblowers use for sitting by and not stopping the guns, \neven though the guns could have been stopped and people arrested. These \nsenior Justice Department officials were discussing whether the head of \ntheir criminal division should attend upcoming press conferences on \nFast and Furious and Wide Receiver.\n  That second case is the one Mr. Breuer admitted to knowing about \nyesterday, where ATF had walked guns even before Fast and Furious. \nTheir concern was over how tricky the press conference could become \nbecause of the guns that were walked.\n  You know, it is kind of common sense. If you can't talk about it in a \npress conference, you probably shouldn't be doing it in the first \nplace.\n  So these memos will show they clearly anticipated the controversy \neven 2 months before Agent Terry was murdered and before the \nwhistleblowers came to me about it. This makes the initial false \ndenials even more outrageous.\n  Some have seized on the reference to a case from the previous \nadministration that suggests that gun walking was nothing new and that \nour investigation is partisan. Now, let me be clear: There is nothing--\nabsolutely nothing--partisan about my desire to get to the bottom of \nFast and Furious. My motivation is to make sure nothing like this ever \nhappens again, that the Terry family gets the truth about their son's \nmurder, and also the untold number of Mexican citizens who may have \nbeen victims of this operation as well ought to be righted.\n  During my testimony before the House committee, I asked the Members \nto put aside politics and just listen to the Terry family because they \nwere going to testify later on, and also to listen to the \nwhistleblowers as they testified that very day. But some people see \neverything through the lens of their own politics. Rather than listen \nto the evidence, they want to blame the second amendment for Agent \nTerry's death. Whoever pulled the trigger is the one to blame, not the \nsecond amendment. That is the person who should be brought to justice. \nThe straw buyers who illegally bought the guns and the government \nofficials who stood by and watched them do it all need to be held \naccountable.\n  So that is the story of Fast and Furious so far. But what does it \ntell us about the rule of law in this great\n\n[[Page S6993]]\n\ncountry we call America? When we talk about the rule of law, we are \nusually referring to the idea that government should make decisions \nconsistently and those decisions be made according to law. Those \ndecisions should be based upon some neutral principle rather than on \nsomeone's personal whims or bias. Those decisions should apply to \neveryone equally without allowing a lot of discretion for government \nofficials to pursue their own agendas. In short, we should be ruled by \nlaws, not men.\n  Our government gets its authority from the consent of the governed. \nRepresentatives elected by the people write the laws, and the executive \nbranch enforces them. However, over the years, our government has grown \nso big and so complex it is hard to hold government officials \naccountable for how they apply the law. In Fast and Furious it has \ntaken us months to sort out responsibility because of this problem. \nThere are dozens of bureaucrats pointing fingers and shifting blame. \nThere are dozens of lawyers parsing words and shuffling paper.\n  At the end of the day, what we know is that several people in \ngovernment decided not to enforce the law--the law they took an oath to \nfaithfully execute. These people believe it was within their discretion \nto allow straw purchasers to operate, despite all the evidence the law \nwas being broken. In most other field offices, obvious straw buyers \nwere stopped, questioned, and arrested but not in Phoenix, AZ.\n  As one of the whistleblowers put it: Operation Fast and Furious \nrepresented a ``colossal failure of leadership'' at every level that \nwas aware of it.\n  Just what each official knew at each level in each agency is \nsomething that needs to be clear before our investigation is complete. \nFor the rule of law to function properly, there needs to be \nsupervision, accountability, and consistency. Remember the transparency \nthe President promised? Transparency leads to accountability. \nGovernment officials must know their discretion to play around in gray \nareas of the law has limits. It is the job of elected leaders to \nenforce those limits on behalf of the people who elect them. But there \nare so many officials and so many decisions that accountability seems \nhard to impose.\n  The President himself recognized this in the context of Fast and \nFurious back in March of this year. When the President was first asked \nabout Fast and Furious on Spanish-language television, he was pressed \nabout how he could not have known about it--kind of the very same \nquestions we are asking the Attorney General. He was asked: How could \nyou not have known about it? The free press in America asked the \nPresident how he could not have known about Fast and Furious, and by \nthen it was 3 months after a Border Patrol agent had been murdered and \nillegally sold guns had appeared at the scene of the murder.\n  This is how the President responded on Spanish-language television.\n\n       This is a pretty big government, the United States \n     Government. I've got a lot of moving parts.\n\n  Mr. President, exactly. That is the problem. Government needs to be \nlimited, government needs to be focused, and government needs to be \nconstrained by the rule of law.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday, in Cleveland--the \nlargest metropolitan area and the second largest city in my State--I \nwas part of, for want of a better term, a celebration of a public \nhealth victory for our country. I met on Halloween with Jeff \nWeidenhamer, chairman of Ashland University's chemistry department and \na leader in consumer safety issues.\n  That name may ring a bell with some of my colleagues because I have \nmentioned his work on the floor of the Senate in addressing the very \nreal public health disaster, in some cases, afflicting our children \nbecause of lead-based paint on many imported toys, especially those \nimported from China.\n  Back in the fall of 2007 and the spring of 2008, Dr. Weidenhamer \nidentified a number of products that were highly contaminated with lead \npaint. As part of an Ashland University freshman chemistry class \nproject, he sent some of his students to Dollar Stores to buy \ninexpensive plastic Halloween toys in the fall of 2007 and inexpensive \nEaster toys and ornaments in the spring of 2008.\n  Of the 97 products he tested, 12 of them were highly contaminated \nwith lead paint--or about one in seven. These were products such as \ncandy buckets, drinking cups, and fake teeth. Some of those plastic \nteeth the children, obviously, put in their mouths. It is what they are \nmade for, I guess. The levels of lead contamination in them were much \ntoo high. And there were other Halloween props. Many were products \nbought at leading national retailers.\n  It was clear that our trading system, our regulatory system, and our \ncorporations failed basic consumer and public safety standards. We \nthink nothing, and our companies, apparently, thought nothing of what \nmight be in the products they were buying from China that were \ninexpensive, that looked good in terms of Halloween and Easter, and \nthat our children would use.\n  Dr. Weidenhamer, after collecting these products, went to work, and \nso did we. I commend especially Senator Pryor, who worked tirelessly in \n2008 on legislation to, if you will, revamp the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission through the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act to \nensure the CPSC had the resources and funding necessary to carry out \nits critical mandate.\n  Mr. President, how many times have we heard in the body of this \nChamber, in the House of Representatives, during a Republican \nPresidential debate that government is too big; that we have to get \ngovernment out of our lives and that government can't do anything \nright? Well, this was a case with the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission--and with this legislation, the Consumer Product Safety \nImprovement Act--where the government's involvement, the regulatory \nprocess, actually got it right.\n  This year--not long ago--Dr. Weidenhamer sent out his students again. \nObviously, this hasn't undergone rigorous scientific analysis, but it \ntells us how things are moving. I believe they tested some 75 products \nthis year, and they found not one containing lead.\n  We know what lead does to a child if that child chews on a piece of \nold crumbling wood containing lead-based paint--found particularly in \nold homes that are beginning to decay, and particularly inner-city kids \nand Appalachian kids. We know that lead in children's bloodstreams \narrests their brain development. Children who ingest lead--and these \nare mostly low-income children or children exposed to these Halloween \nkinds of toys--can often suffer retardation or their brains do not \ndevelop as quickly as they should.\n  So this was a huge victory. Again, this legislation hasn't done \neverything we want, but I hear so often people dismissing any \nregulation as job killing. When we hear a conservative politician--\nusually enthralled to corporate America--talking about regulation to \nthe largest corporations that outsource jobs, we can bet the term \nbefore it is ``job killing.'' How about putting the term ``lifesaving'' \nbefore regulation, such as lifesaving regulation that makes a \ndifference in a child ingesting lead?\n  How about lifesaving regulation that has cleaned up our air and \ncleaned our drinking water? How about lifesaving regulation when it is \nthe prohibition on child labor worker safety rule? Instead, it is job-\nkilling regulation every time. Clearly, that is not the way it has \noften worked. But then we see, after my Republican colleagues too often \nwant to weaken these safety rules, as they have tried to do, House \nRepublicans have tried to cut more\n\n[[Page S6994]]\n\nthan $3 million from the Consumer Product Safety Commission.\n  So we have this new law in effect that can literally save children's \nlives and make children more healthy and help their brain development, \nin effect, in Eugene, OR, and Columbus, OH, but if we cut back on the \nenforcement of these laws by cutting these agencies and taking away \nemployees who inspect these, who force these companies--who make sure \nthese companies are doing the right thing and not selling lead-based \ntoys to American children, what have we? And that is really \nunfortunate. The cuts would take us back to the very reason Congress \npassed and President Bush--a Republican President--in those days signed \ninto law the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act in the first \nplace.\n  We know there are plenty of government regulations that we should \nreexamine and in some cases pull back or reform or repeal, but it just \nseems my conservative colleagues don't know the difference between \nregulations that might actually affect jobs and regulations that \nclearly protect the public health and clearly protect the public \nsafety.\n  We know the Senate will prepare to debate the fiscal year 2012 \nfinancial services and general government appropriations bill later \nthis week. I call on my colleagues to support funding for the Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission. We know what that does. We know it saves \nlives. We know it makes a difference in the lives of our children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/01/senate-section/article/S6994-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         VICTOR F. STEWART, JR.\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I rise on a more somber note. A \nlongtime friend of mine, Victor F. Stewart, Jr., from O'Leary, OH, died \nthis week at the age of 85. He was a counselor to me, he was a teacher, \nand he was a friend. He was someone who mentored me and so many other \npeople in our county and our State. He dedicated his life to his \ncommunity and to his country. He leaves behind 10 children and family \nand friends. He leaves public servants behind him whom he counseled \nabout life, politics, and public service.\n  Vic was a child of the Great Depression. He was born in the 1920s. He \nwas a child of the New Deal. He believed in loyalty and frugality. He \nbelieved in a citizen's responsibility to vote and to be a citizen.\n  As I said, he was the father of 10--6 daughters and 4 sons. His wife \nHelen survives him, and he was married to her for 62 years. I remember \ngoing to Vic and Helen's 50th wedding anniversary and the number of \nchildren and grandchildren and friends in the community, and the love \npeople felt and extended to both him and Helen was a sight to see.\n  Vic was a city councilman. He was mayor of O'Leary. He served in the \nU.S. Army in World War II. He was always a team player. He was a \nCatholic Youth League basketball coach, a Little League coach, a high \nschool third baseman, and, again, a mentor to young people in politics, \nbaseball, sporting activities, and especially to his children.\n  He was a Democratic Party chair in Lorain County for many years. He \nwalked and met with President Kennedy, President Johnson, and President \nCarter when they were in Lorain County. He credits President Johnson \nwith so much of what we all should credit our government for doing: the \nCivil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act, the passage of Medicare, the \nantipoverty initiatives of the Johnson Great Society program.\n  When I think about what our government can do in partnership with the \nprivate sector, that is what brought us Medicare, that is what brought \nus safe drinking water, that is what brought us civil rights, and that \nis what brought us Head Start, many of them passing in the mid-1960s, \npassage of legislation from which our country still benefits.\n  Many of the young people sitting in front of us today will benefit \nfrom the Pell grants that came out of the Higher Education Act. Senator \nWhitehouse spoke to a group of us today about a forum he did at the \nUniversity of Rhode Island and what those Pell grants mean to some of \nthe professors there who were able to go to college because of the Pell \ngrants, some of the young students there who can afford college because \nof the Pell grants, and some older people who went back to school \nbecause of these Pell grants and got an opportunity to further their \neducation as middle-aged parents. Vic Stewart was part of all that.\n  Vic Stewart believed that the role of government in our communities \ncould make a difference in people's lives, especially working families. \nSo while he met with President Carter and President Kennedy and \nPresident Johnson, his heart was always in the community. He cared most \nabout working families, poor kids who didn't have the opportunities of \nsome more privileged people in O'Leary or Lorain or anywhere else in \nour county. That is what I admired about Vic.\n  I was so appreciative of the wisdom he would impart to me when we \nwould get together several times a year at breakfast or lunch and just \ntalk about what I was doing and what he was doing, and he was always so \nhelpful that way. He offered his no-nonsense advice with a touch of \nhumor and compassion and a healthy dose of common sense.\n  He understood the value of a hard day's work. He lived his life \nguided by that devotion to God. He was a devout Roman Catholic. To \nfamily--he was a terrific father and husband to Helen. Friends--he \ncounted so many of us as people who were close to him and his love of \ncountry. We will never forget his warmth and his wit and his wisdom.\n  He always looked to the whole community, not just the privileged. He \nwas sickened by this power of Wall Street and this huge executive \ncompensation, these huge salaries and bonuses that too many in our \nsociety on Wall Street and other places have taken.\n  His heart was always with the middle class, working families. He \ntaught integrity, especially to young people. That is why I owe Vic \nStewart so much. We have lost a true friend, we have lost a teacher, \nand we have lost a mentor who made a difference in the lives of so many \nof us. We mourn for Vic Stewart, Jr. We think of Helen. We think of the \nsons and daughters whom Vic and Helen have taught so well and raised so \nwell over the last five-plus decades.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/01/senate-section/article/S6994-2", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6994-S6997]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REBUILD AMERICA JOBS ACT\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, if we pass the Rebuild America Jobs \nAct, we will immediately invest $50 billion into our transportation \ninfrastructure and generate hundreds of thousands of good jobs and \nestablish a national infrastructure bank which will generate even more \ngood jobs. We need these jobs during the current period of high \nunemployment, and upgrading our crumbling infrastructure will spur \nlong-term job growth in addition to the immediate employment benefits. \nSo I strongly support this bill and I hope our colleagues can be \nbrought around as well.\n  The Rebuild America Jobs Act is one piece of the larger American Jobs \nAct which, when Leader Reid brought it to the floor, all 47 Senate \nRepublicans chose to filibuster instead of allowing us to begin \ndebating and, if they wished, improving the jobs legislation. That \nfilibuster blocked President Obama's plan to cut payroll taxes for \nevery single American worker, and it blocked his plan to offer business \nowners generous tax breaks to hire new workers and grow their \nbusinesses. Economists estimated that the American Jobs Act would \ncreate nearly 2 million jobs--1.9 million jobs. Perhaps for that \nreason, many pieces of the bill have received wide bipartisan support \nin the past. Indeed, just last December, similar job-creating \nprovisions were included in the Job Creation and Tax Cuts Act, which \nreceived 81 votes in the Senate.\n  The jobs bill that Republicans blockaded was fully paid for through a \n5.6-percent surtax on income in excess of $1 million. In other words, \nthe only tax increase in the bill is a provision that pays for job \ncreation in this country by\n\n[[Page S6995]]\n\nhaving millionaires and billionaires who continue to enjoy the record \nlow tax rates brought on by the Bush tax cuts pay a little more and \nonly on their income over $1 million. There is no increase on the first \nmillion.\n  A recent study by Citizens for Tax Justice showed that the surcharge \nwould only apply to the richest one-fifth of 1 percent of U.S. \ntaxpayers, leaving the taxes of more than 99 percent of all Americans--\nif my math is right, 99.8 percent of all Americans--unchanged.\n  The Rebuild America Jobs Act, which is one piece of the full jobs \nbill, is paid for with a much smaller 0.7-percent surtax on income \nabove $1 million. Having one-fifth of 1 percent of the wealthiest \nAmericans pay less than 1 percent more in income taxes, and only on \nincome above $1 million of income, hardly seems unreasonable to support \nhundreds of thousands of jobs for middle-class families in this \neconomic climate.\n  As we try again and again to advance jobs legislation in the Senate, \nthe supercommittee we established in the Budget Control Act is at work \non recommendations to cut the deficit. Getting the most fortunate and \nwell-compensated Americans to start paying a fair share in taxes ought \nto be a logical component of any deficit reduction plan--at least under \na theory that we should have a progressive Federal tax system. That is \na tax system in which we pay higher rates of tax the more money we \nearn.\n  In theory, we have a progressive Federal tax system, but, in fact, do \nwe? We are often told that the wealthiest Americans are already \nshouldering too great a share of our tax burden. Earlier this year, one \nof the candidates, a leading candidate for the Republican Presidential \nnomination, told NBC that ``the top 1 percent of income earners pay \nabout 40 percent of all taxes into the Federal Government.''\n  That sounds like a lot--the top 1 percent pay 40 percent of all \ntaxes. Let's look at some data to see if the theory proves correct. The \nUrban Institute and the Brookings Institution, two very respected \norganizations, estimate that the total share of Federal taxes paid by \nthe top 1 percent of taxpayers is, in fact, 22.7 percent--not 40 \npercent. Remember that for a moment, 22.7 percent is the amount of \nFederal taxes the top 1 percent of income earners pay.\n  If we take a look at the long-term trends in income and taxation, it \nis revealing. According to the Congressional Budget Office, between \n1979 and 2006, the total effective Federal tax rate for the top 1 \npercent of households fell. The tax rate went down almost 6 points, \nfrom 37 percent to 31.2 percent. Over the same period, that group, the \ntop 1 percent, went from earning 10 percent of the Nation's income to \n22.8 percent. The amount of the Nation's income that the richest 1 \npercent earn in this country climbed over that period from 10 to nearly \n23 percent. They claimed an additional 13 percent of the Nation's \nincome.\n  Go back to the number. The Urban Institute and Brookings Institution \nestimate that the total share of Federal taxes paid by the top 1 \npercent of taxpayers is 22.7 percent, but the share of income the top 1 \npercent takes is 22.8 percent. That is not a progressive tax system. \nThey may be paying a lot in taxes, but it is proportionate almost \nexactly to what they are taking out of the economy in income. The \nrelative burden of the extremely wealthy in this country is going \nsteadily down, not up, and it has just crossed to the point where it is \nno longer progressive.\n  There is a tale of two buildings that may help explain why. This is \nthe first of the two buildings. This is the Helmsley Building in New \nYork City. It is on Park Avenue. It is a lovely, wonderful place--a \ngreat building. Not surprisingly, some very successful and well-\ncompensated people live there.\n  It is also a big building. It is so big it has its own ZIP Code. \nBecause it has its own ZIP Code and because the Internal Revenue \nService calculates and provides information about income by ZIP Code, \nwe can learn quite a lot about the occupants of this wonderful \nbuilding. What we know from the latest IRS information that I have been \nable to find is that the very well-compensated and successful \nindividuals and corporations that call this building home actually paid \na 14.7-percent tax rate in 2007. That rate is lower than the Bureau of \nLabor Statistics tells us is what the average New York City janitor or \ndoorman or security guard pays. So at least in this building the \nfabulously successful and well-compensated occupants of the building \nwho live in those wonderful apartments on Park Avenue are paying a \nsignificantly lower tax rate in real life than the actual men and women \nwho are their janitors, who are their doormen, who are their security \nguards.\n  It is not just some fluke about the Helmsley Building. We all \nremember Leona Helmsley saying it is the little people who pay taxes. \nThere is no ghost of Leona Helmsley making that true in this building; \nit is true across the board. Each year, the Internal Revenue Service \npublishes a report consolidating the tax returns of the highest \nincome 400 Americans and they publish that data. They do not get around \nto it very quickly, but in May they published the most recent data on \nthe top 400 taxpayers in America for 2008. In 2008, the top 400 earners \ntook home an average of $270 million each. They earned more than one-\nquarter of a billion dollars each that year, which is wonderful. That \nis the kind of country we are. One can make a real fortune here. But \nwhere it gets a little sketchy is that, on average, those 400 extremely \nhighly compensated Americans actually paid into the Treasury of the \nUnited States at an average Federal tax rate of just 18.2 percent on \nadjusted gross income--18.2 percent.\n\n  We have spent time on the Senate floor debating whether the top \nincome tax rate should be 35 percent or 39.6 percent. That is not what \nthey pay. The top 400 income earners, the $\\1/4\\ billion-a-year crowd, \npay actually, on average, just 18.2 percent. This means the 400 highest \nearning individuals in the Nation, in 2008, just like the occupants of \nthis Helmsley Building, were paying rates lower than or equivalent to \nwhat regular working families pay.\n  If we went back to the Bureau of Labor Statistics and pulled out the \ninformation for the Helmsley Building but about the janitors, the \ndoormen and about the security guards and we look to see who else in \nAmerica is paying an 18.2-percent tax rate--if a person is a single \nfiler they are paying an 18.2-percent tax rate in this country if they \nmake $39,350 a year. Where I come from in Rhode Island, the Bureau of \nLabor Statistics says that is about what a truck driver makes--$40,200 \nis what a truck driver makes; $39,350 is what it takes to put a person \nin the income bracket where they are paying the same tax rate into our \nTreasury as the 400 members of the $\\1/4\\ billion-a-year club.\n  The choice is very clear. Instead of moving forward on a jobs plan \nthat independent economists agree will create millions of American jobs \nin the near term, we are facing an opposition that is fighting to make \nsure people making $\\1/4\\ billion a year pay lower Federal tax rates \nthan regular working, middle-class American families.\n  That is the story of the first building, the Helmsley Plaza. This is \na different building. This is the Ugland building. It is called Ugland \nHouse. It doesn't look like much, but it is near the lovely aquamarine \nbeaches of the Cayman Islands. What is interesting about this little \nbuilding is that 18,000 corporations claim they are doing business \nhere. That is not a very big building. The notion that 18,000 \ncorporations are doing business out of this building--that gives a \nwhole new meaning to the phrase ``small business.'' But there is no \nreal business going on here. The business that is going on here is \nfunny business, under the Tax Code.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We have a 10-minute time limit and the Senator \nhas consumed 9 minutes.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I ask consent for 3 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. The companies doing business here are not real \ncompanies; they are phony-baloney shell corporations that are designed \nto hide assets and to play games with the tax system. This income never \neven makes it into the 18.2 percent of the Helmsley Building. This gets \nhidden away completely.\n  When our tax system is rigged so it permits billionaires to pay lower \ntax rates than truck drivers and allows the wealthiest to avoid taxes \nby hiding assets in phony offshore corporations,\n\n[[Page S6996]]\n\nsomething is not right. With multitrillion dollar budget deficits \nthreatening our Nation's prosperity, we have to do something to make \nour tax system more fair for regular Americans.\n  I have been working on legislation which would ensure that \nmillionaires and billionaires pay an effective tax rate at least as \nhigh as is paid by middle-class families. This would require all \ntaxpayers with income over $1 million a year, indexed to inflation, to \npay at least a 25-percent rate. A 25-percent rate is the marginal rate \nmiddle-class taxpayers currently pay on income, from about $34,000 of \nincome to about $84,000 of income, depending on the size of the family \nand the deductions they get. It seems fair to me to ask people at the \nhighest end of the income spectrum to pay at least the tax rate middle-\nclass families in the $34,000-to-$84,000 range actually pay. It simply \ndoesn't make sense to have the wealthiest abusing these tax gimmicks to \npay lower tax rates than middle-class families. So whether it is Leader \nReid's surtax or my proposal, I hope we can act to ensure that the most \nsuccessful Americans actually pay their fair share of our national tax \nburden to restore our Nation to its economic strength.\n\n  I thank my distinguished colleague from Michigan for her courtesy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, first, I wish to thank my good friend \nand colleague from Rhode Island for his important words on the floor \nand for indicating that millions and millions of middle-class families \nand small businesses in this country expect us to figure out a way to \nmake sure the tax system is fair and we have the opportunity for \neveryone to be able to be successful in this country and know they have \na fair chance to make it and that the rules are not rigged for just a \nfew folks. So I wish to thank the distinguished Senator for his \ncomments and for his leadership and pointing out some very important \nthings for the majority of Americans and small businesses across the \ncountry.\n  I rise to speak about a very important issue that will be coming \nbefore us for a vote that directly relates to jobs. As the Chair knows, \nthat is a pretty big issue for me in Michigan. We have over 11 percent \nunemployment. I am laser focused on creating jobs and growing the \neconomy because I think it is absolutely critical for us to get out of \ndebt. We are not going to get out of debt with more than 14 million \npeople out of work, and we are not going to be able to move forward in \na way that allows families and businesses to succeed in America if we \nare not able to turn this economy around and create jobs.\n  Following World War II, our country created a system of roads and \nbridges and railways and airports unlike any in the world. In fact, \ncountries are now looking to duplicate what we have done. In the \ndecades that followed, this important infrastructure served as the \nfoundation of our economic growth and prosperity, being able to move \ncommerce and people from one place to another, and we grew. Now that \ninfrastructure has fallen into disrepair. Not surprisingly, we need to \nbe doing some things to be able to rebuild and make sure our bridges \nare safe and to be able to move forward in a global economy and have \nthe ability to compete because we have an infrastructure that is worthy \nof the 21st century.\n  More than one-quarter of our Nation's bridges are either structurally \ndeficient or obsolete. Think about that, one out of four. If I am \ndriving down the road, I don't think I want to bet that one-out-of-four \nprobability that the bridge I am driving over with my children or my \ntwo beautiful grandchildren is safe. I think families want to know \nevery bridge is safe, every road is safe, and that they are not going \nto put their families in jeopardy as they are driving on our roads and \ncrossing our bridges.\n  In Michigan, we have 1,400 bridges that are deficient--more than 13 \npercent of Michigan's bridges. Motorists in Michigan are no stranger to \nbad roads. I can tell you as somebody who has the wonderful honor of \nrepresenting Michigan, a very large State, I spend much time on the \nroad, as do my brothers in their work, and my family is on the road as \nwell. We can tell you every year the freezing and thawing wreaks havoc \non our roads and every year our roads are full of potholes. I certainly \ncan speak from experience about the expense of fixing a car when one \ndrives over and falls into one of those big potholes.\n  Even our Republican Governor, Rick Snyder, says we need to invest in \ninfrastructure. He recently said:\n\n       Michigan's infrastructure is living on borrowed time. We \n     must reinvest in it if we are to successfully reinvent our \n     economy.\n\n  I couldn't agree more. I wish to commend the Governor for those words \nand for his focus and his administration's focus on investing in our \nroads and our infrastructure.\n  We are sitting in traffic and paying the price at the pump because we \nhave fallen behind in maintaining and improving our physical \ninfrastructure as a country to be able to move across town or across \nthe State or across the country. If we don't invest to fix our \ncrumbling roads and bridges and airports now, the costs will only go \nup, as we know. Failure to act now will cost nearly 1 million Americans \ntheir jobs. Those are a lot of people. Those are a lot of families. \nThose are a lot of mortgages. Those are a lot of families figuring out \nwhether they are going to be able to put food on the table and send \ntheir kids to college. There are 1 million American jobs in jeopardy. \nIt will cost our economy nearly $1 trillion over the next 10 years if \nwe do not act. We have the opportunity to act and we have the \nopportunity to act right now. We can invest in rebuilding our \ninfrastructure and it will, in turn, rebuild our economy and create \njobs.\n  The Rebuild America Jobs Act is an opportunity to turn the corner and \nto head in the right direction. Not only will it upgrade 150,000 miles \nof roadway, improve thousands of miles of train track, and modernize \nour Nation's runways and air traffic control systems, but it will also \nput hundreds of thousands of people to work. This is a win-win. The \nRebuild America Jobs Act will provide desperately needed repair funds \nand will provide the seed money for a national infrastructure bank that \nwill attract private sector capital to help fund a broad range of new \ninvestments. This is such an important idea to be able to provide seed \nmoney, to be able to track the private sector, private capital, to be \nable to invest, to be able to leverage the dollars that American \ntaxpayers put in and be able to address all our roads and bridges and \nother infrastructure needs in a way that creates jobs.\n  It will have a very big impact on my great State of Michigan. The \nplan will make immediate investments in Michigan that could support at \nleast 11,700 local jobs that are so critical to us right now as we are \ncoming out of this huge jobs deficit hole we have been in for too long. \nThe plan to rebuild our infrastructure and put Americans back to work \nhas bipartisan as well as strong support from the private sector. The \npresidents of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Republican Mayors \nand Local Officials Coalition have both supported the infrastructure \ninvestments we are talking about. This approach has strong bipartisan \nsupport.\n  Simply put, the Rebuild America Jobs Act will fix our crumbling \ninfrastructure, put hundreds of thousands of people back to work at the \nsame time. It will not add a dime to our deficit, and the American \npeople support it. So this is a win-win. Why will it not add a dime to \nour deficit? Because we pay for it in a way that I think is very \nreasonable and very fair. We are asking those who are most blessed \neconomically in our country, those who earn over $1 million a year, to \npay less than 1 percent, .7 percent, on any $1 they earn above the \nfirst $1 million of income. So they would be asked to have basically \na surcharge to contribute to creating jobs and investing in the future \nof America, rebuilding America--jobs that cannot go overseas, jobs in \nrebuilding America.\n\n  This can be done for less than a 1-percent surcharge, not on the \nfirst $1 million they earn but on the $1 that comes after or the $2 or \nthe $5 or the $10 or the second million. It is anything above $1 \nmillion where we are asking those in our country who are in a position \nto be able to help instead of going back to middle-class families, \nworking families, senior citizens, people who have been hurt so hard in \nthis recession for so long. Instead of asking them\n\n[[Page S6997]]\n\none more time to be the ones to carry the burden, we are, instead, \nasking those who have had success, who have been blessed financially, \nand who have benefited from this great country, whether it was with \nwhat was done to support Wall Street, whether it was other ways in this \ncountry, for them to be a part of the solution with less than 1 percent \non any dollars earned above $1 million. I think this is a reasonable \nand fair approach.\n  This is about jobs. We are talking about the Rebuild America Jobs \nAct, putting people back to work, doing something that is incredibly \nimportant for our country and will grow the economy, create jobs, \nrebuild communities, and help our country move forward.\n  I urge my colleagues, when we have the vote, to move forward on this \nbill and that we all join in what has been a bipartisan set of issues \nof infrastructure investment and rebuilding America. I hope we will see \nthat in the vote that will be coming in the next couple days.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I thank and commend my distinguished colleague from \nMichigan for those very eloquent remarks on behalf of an act that I too \nrise to support. I thank the Presiding Officer for his very eloquent \nand persuasive comments earlier in this debate on the Rebuild America \nJobs Act and the need for this Nation to focus on the increasing trend \nin inequality and a very troubling absence of focus on the compelling \nobligation we have to rebuild America at this point in our history, to \nrebuild our roads and bridges and ports and airports and schools.\n  The Rebuild America Jobs Act would provide $50 billion very directly \nto rebuilding our roads and bridges and railroads and airports, and \nthat is a pressing need for America, but equally as pressing and \nimportant are the people hurting and struggling all across the country. \nPeople are struggling to find jobs, to stay in their homes, to keep \ntheir families together, and those struggles ought to be heard and seen \nin this Chamber, on this floor, at this moment in our history. They are \nAmericans who played by the rules and who are now out of work, out of \nsupport, and soon, sadly, out of hope.\n  For much of our time recently, we have been mired in the politics of \ndeficit and debt, and that is not to say those subjects are \nunimportant. I believe in fiscal responsibility. I believe in cutting \nour debt, restraining spending, and cutting the deficit. But deficit \ncutting cannot be used as an excuse to gut the social safety net we \nhave labored hard to create over 75 years. It cannot be used to ignore \nthe needs of people struggling to find work. It cannot be used as a \nreason to neglect our critical infrastructure in this country and the \nsad and serious defects we now find in it.\n  One powerful and proven means to cut the deficit and the debt is to \ncreate jobs and enable economic recovery. What matters most to the \nAmerican people now is jobs, work, employment, going back to work, back \nto good jobs, earning a living for the sake of not only their economic \nwell-being but their respect and self-worth, their dignity. More is at \nstake here than simply a paycheck. It is the social fabric of our \ncommunities, our country, our families. That is why it ought to be a \npriority. Right now, investing in infrastructure in those roads and \nbridges and ports and airports is one of the most immediate job \ncreators available.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has found that returning to full \nemployment would reduce the deficit by 25 percent. That is way more \nthan the politically charged and severely damaging cuts offered by many \nof my colleagues across the aisle. Thankfully, we have a plan to put us \non the path to full employment, and it is called the Rebuild America \nJobs Act. This bill would put America back to work immediately by \nrebuilding our ailing infrastructure.\n  There is no question about the need. The American Society of Civil \nEngineers recently rated America's infrastructure and they gave us a D. \nAccording to the nonpartisan organization Transportation For America, \nFairfield County in my home State of Connecticut has the fourth highest \nnumber of motorists using structurally deficient bridges among all the \nmetropolitan areas nationwide. That is an indictment not of Connecticut \nbut of our Nation, and so is the fact that over 9 percent of \nConnecticut's bridges are considered structurally deficient. \nNationwide, in fact, the numbers are even worse. One in four of our \nNation's bridges is either structurally deficient or obsolete. No one \nwants another tragedy such as the one we experienced in Connecticut. It \nis called the Mianus River Bridge collapse. It killed three people. It \nparalyzed the roadways in and around the bridge for months.\n  It cost millions of dollars. It led to litigation that spanned years. \nThe bridge's collapse almost 30 years ago prompted a major \ninfrastructure effort in Connecticut focusing on repair and \nreconstruction to make our bridges and roads more safe and secure. We \nneed not await the kinds of tragedies we saw 30 years ago in \nConnecticut and more recently in other States involving bridge \ncollapses and other tragedies that show the deficiencies and \nunacceptable defects in these roads and bridges.\n  The need is clear. At a time when civil engineers across the country \nare calling for vast improvements in our national infrastructure, the \nmeasure before this body would accomplish exactly that goal. It would \nprovide aid for States to be spent at their discretion and flexibility \nas to the projects but not as to the purpose. The purpose would be \nroads, bridges, airports, railroads.\n  This bill would invest $50 billion in upgrading and repairing 150,000 \nmiles of road, laying or maintaining 4,000 miles of train tracks, and \nrestoring 150 miles of runways at our Nation's airports. It would also \nprovide seed money--and this purpose is important--for a national \ninfrastructure bank that will attract private sector capital to fund a \nbroad range of nationally significant projects, going beyond the ones \nthat would be immediately supported by the $50 billion in this measure. \nThat national infrastructure bank would be capitalized at $10 billion, \nbut it would attract money from private investors to do far more than \nwould be enabled by the initial seed money.\n  This is a bipartisan measure, long supported by Senators Kerry and \nHutchison. I am proud to have joined them as a cosponsor, and I thank \nthem for their leadership. I thank Members on the House side, including \nmy colleague, Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, for supporting this measure \nover the years.\n  A national infrastructure bank would leverage private capital and \npublic capital to fund a broad range of nationally significant \ninfrastructure projects all around the country--in Connecticut and \nelsewhere. These funds would provide an immediate boost for our \neconomy. It is estimated, in fact, that for every $1 spent on these \nroads, bridges, and other infrastructure projects, our gross domestic \nproduct would be increased by about $1.59--for every $1, an increase of \n$1.59 in gross domestic product. We are talking about investment. We \nare talking about investment in America's future, in Connecticut's \npresent as well as its future, because people in Connecticut would go \nback to work, back to jobs, back to livelihoods that give them dignity \nand self-respect.\n  With so many people out of work and a dire need for that kind of \ninvestment, common sense says we ought to pass this bill, we ought to \ndo it now, without delay, and we ought to do it on a bipartisan basis. \nThere is nothing Republican or Democratic about investment in roads or \nbridges or airports or railroads to make them safer, more secure, more \nefficient.\n  I ask my colleagues, regardless of party, to stand with us and \nmillions of Americans who are out of work, to come together and find a \nway to pass the Rebuild America Jobs Act. Let's pass this bill now. \nLet's do it together, without any more delay. People are continuing to \nstruggle and seek work, and this bill is the right thing for America. \nIt is the right thing for Connecticut. Let's do it now.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/01/senate-section/article/S6997-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6997-S6999]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          INTERNATIONAL TRADE\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I wish to speak about the \nrecent trade votes that the U.S. Senate had over the last several \nweeks. I believe that bilateral trade agreements should\n\n[[Page S6998]]\n\nbe based on the premise that by growing economic ties with foreign \ntrading partners our nation levels the playing field on which our \ncompanies and workers compete. Trade agreements should also be a means \nto growing a relationship with established allies that share our \ncommitment to democratic values in an effort to work toward achieving \ncommon goals. Over the past several weeks, the U.S. Congress has \nweighed in on several pieces of legislation that--on balance--keep \nfaith with these goals.\n  Before I speak to each of the free trade agreements, I would like to \nreflect on the currency exchange rate oversight reform bill that the \nU.S. Senate considered just before the pending free trade agreements. \nIt is important to note that playing by the rules is an important \nelement of fair and free trade, and it is a theme I will address \nseveral times today in my remarks. The concerns of many Coloradans who \nboth supported and opposed this currency legislation were fundamentally \nbased on fairness. Both sides understand that intentionally undervalued \nforeign currencies hurt the competitiveness of American exports. I \nsupported currency reform legislation because any country that is \nintentionally undercutting American companies and workers through the \nmanipulation of its currency, especially if it had agreed to play by \nspecific rules, must be held accountable. That is common sense--and a \nmatter of fairness. This legislation will allow the United States to \nclearly identify fundamentally misaligned currencies and initiate \npurposeful efforts to work bilaterally and multilaterally to seek \ncorrective action. We must work in the interest of American \nmanufacturers--and American workers--that rely on a level playing field \nto succeed, while also engaging our trade partners to work \ncollaboratively to resolve these important concerns. I believe that \nthis currency-related legislation, which passed the U.S. Senate in a \nbipartisan manner, will send the appropriate signal that we expect our \ntrade partners to live up to our shared commitment to compete fairly in \nthe global marketplace.\n  More recently, the U.S. Congress considered free trade agreements \nwith Korea, Panama, and Colombia. We enjoy good diplomatic \nrelationships with each of these countries and the United States has a \nparticular interest in maintaining strong diplomatic and economic ties \nto these countries given our shared values on the international stage. \nMore importantly, the Obama administration, in consultation with \nCongress, has been able to incorporate pragmatic and responsible ways \nto address the outstanding concerns raised with each agreement. While \nthese free trade agreements are not perfect, I supported the passage of \nall three after studying each one carefully, and hearing from a wide \nrange of Coloradans.\n  Regarding the Korea free trade agreement, the new concessions that \nprotect America's auto industry in addition to reductions in tariffs \nfor U.S. products and strong protections for intellectual property and \nlabor rights solidified my support for the agreement.\n  Over the last several months the Obama administration worked with the \nKorean government to gain concessions that will help American \nmanufacturers compete in the Korean market, Asia's fourth largest \neconomy. For example, the Koreans have committed to immediately reduce \ntheir eigh percent tariff on U.S.-built passenger cars, including \nelectric vehicles and plug-in hybrids, to four percent and immediately \nreduce their ten percent tariff on trucks to zero. After 5 years, \ntariffs on U.S.-made motor vehicles, including electric cars and plug-\nin hybrids, will be reduced to zero. In addition, we have strengthened \nsafeguards that will prevent any large influx of Korean cars into the \nU.S. market to protect against unintended effects of the removal of \ntrade barriers. These new concessions won the support of both the U.S. \nauto industry and the United Auto Workers.\n  With regard to agricultural products, Colorado producers will benefit \nfrom increased market access in Korea through the reduction of existing \ntariffs on wheat and corn. Existing 40 percent tariffs on certain beef \nproducts will be phased out over 15 years and the United States will \nengage continuously with Korea to plan the removal of other tariff \nbarriers. When I hosted the Korean Ambassador, Han Duk Soo, in Colorado \nin April of this year, I made it clear that Colorado agricultural \nproducers expect a reasoned approach to removing restrictions and other \ntrade barriers that are in conflict with international sanitary \nstandards and sound science. I am very hopeful that this agreement will \nhelp Colorado producers build a relationship of trust with Korean \nconsumers so that they come to understand the high quality of Colorado \nbeef and the well-justified pride that our State feels about its beef.\n  Autos and agricultural products are just a few areas where American \nproducers will gain better access to the Korean market. Overall, the \nU.S. International Trade Commission estimated that tariff cuts alone to \na variety of U.S. goods could amount to an increase of $10 billion to \n$11 billion of U.S. goods exports alone. This will help produce a much-\nneeded boost to the U.S. economy. This agreement also includes \nprovisions related to labor and the environment that are the strongest \nstandards to enforce domestic environmental and labor laws included in \nany trade agreement. It also includes robust protections for \nintellectual property rights that will set a new benchmark to protect \nAmerican-made ideas.\n  In addition to supporting opportunities for American exports, the \nagreement will enhance America's relationship with a strong partner \nthat is committed to democratic values on the Korean Peninsula. More \nthan 60 years after the Korean war, this trade agreement will serve to \nfurther strengthen bilateral ties in a region of growing strategic \nvalue to the United States. As a member of the U.S. Senate Armed \nServices and Intelligence Committees, this was another important factor \nin my support of the Korea free trade agreement.\n  Similarly, the Panama free trade agreement, like its Korean \ncounterpart, is aimed to help grow the U.S. economy. In the Panama \nagreement, we have also included enforceable mechanisms to protect the \nenvironment and the rights of Panamanian workers. To address financial \nand tax concerns and further support labor protections, the United \nStates worked bilaterally with Panama to institute robust legal reforms \nthat protect against the country being used as a tax haven while \nfurther enhancing labor protections in Panama. The United States and \nPanama have worked collaboratively to strengthen tax transparency in \nsupport of curbing illicit financial transactions associated with money \nlaundering activities. Notably, due to its positive actions, Panama was \nremoved from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development \n``Gray List'' of countries that have agreed to, but not yet adopted an \ninternational tax transparency standard.\n  These improvements to the Panama free trade agreement will be \nincorporated along with reductions in tariff barriers that will improve \naccess to the Panamanian market for U.S. goods and services. Again, \nthis should give a boost to American business at a time when our \ngovernment should be doing everything it can to help grow our economy.\n  Currently, U.S. industrial goods face an average tariff of seven \npercent in Panama and U.S. agricultural goods face an average tariff of \n15 percent, while most of Panama's products enter the United States \nduty-free. After implementation of this agreement, more than 87 percent \nof U.S. exports of consumer and industrial products to Panama will \nbecome duty-free immediately, with remaining tariffs phased out over \nten years. Almost half of U.S. agricultural exports will also benefit \nfrom immediate duty-free treatment, with most of the remaining tariffs \nto be eliminated within 15 years. Of particular importance for Colorado \nis beef, which will see an immediate removal of a 30 percent tariff for \nprime and choice cut beef, and wheat, which will lock in its already \ntariff-free treatment.\n  As Panama embarks on a historic $5 billion infrastructure project to \nrevamp and expand the Panama Canal, American businesses will be better \nsituated to compete for opportunities in the Panamanian market as a \nresult of this free trade agreement. Additionally, this agreement will \nenhance our strong relationship with Panama, which serves as a major \ninternational\n\n[[Page S6999]]\n\ntrade thoroughfare for the United States and the world.\n  And finally, the Colombia free trade agreement, which was a vote that \ntook even greater deliberation.\n  Colombia is a strong U.S. ally in Latin America and is a critical \nregional and global partner. Colombia's market is the third largest for \nthe United States in Latin America and U.S. producers have been losing \nmarket share quickly as the Colombians strengthen economic ties with \nCanada, the European Union and the Mercosur countries of Argentina, \nBrazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. As other countries facilitate trade with \nColombia, American producers have faced continued tariffs on goods \nexported to Colombia, while Colombian goods face few tariffs into the \nUnited States. Currently, the average U.S. tariff on the few Colombian \ngoods subject to a tariff is 3 percent. Colombia's average tariff on \nU.S. exported goods is 12.5 percent. This agreement will increase \nmarket access for U.S. goods and services in Colombia by immediately \neliminating duties on 80 percent of U.S. exports to Colombia, with all \nremaining tariffs eliminated within 10 years.\n  These numbers show why American businesses have been eager to level \nthe playing field with foreign competitors that have benefited from \npreferential tariff treatment in Colombia. Still, there have been long-\nstanding concerns with Colombia's history of violence and its human \nrights record, issues that deeply concern not only me, but many \nColoradans. I have looked to Colombia and supporters of this agreement \nto make the case that adequate progress has been made to determine if \nthe United States should move forward with a trade agreement at this \ntime.\n  The Colombian and U.S. governments, as well as organizations that \nhave opposed and supported the agreement, acknowledge the problematic \nrecord Colombia has had on human rights and labor protections. Most \nagree that progress has been made, though many disagree to what extent \nthat progress has improved labor conditions and lessened human rights \nviolations. After meeting with groups on both sides of this debate, I \nconcluded that maintaining the status quo was not the best answer. \nLeaving things as they are now would not create any more incentives for \nColombia to maintain or further cultivate its commitment to resolving \nissues of violence. Nor do I believe that the status quo would \nstrengthen the ties with this key ally in South America. I ultimately \nbelieve that the recent labor and legal reforms in Colombia represent \nconcrete steps in the right direction. The commitment of Colombia's \npolitical leadership to improving its record is also an indication that \nColombia can move beyond its past. The primary objective is for our two \ncountries not only to maintain the shared goal of reducing violence and \nprotecting workers' rights, but also to become stronger economic \npartners, enabling American business to compete in Colombia's market on \na level playing field with our international competitors. Both of these \ngoals help justify moving beyond the status quo.\n  Let me be clear: we must continue to work collaboratively with the \nColombian government to ensure that the appropriate steps are taken \ntoward responsible and meaningful reforms. A meaningful step in this \ndirection is President Obama's commitment to allow the agreement to \nenter into force only when Colombia has sufficiently met predetermined \nbenchmarks. These benchmarks include efforts to increase protection of \nlabor activists, enforce core labor rights and reduce impunity for \nperpetrators of violence against union members. Additionally, the \nunderlying agreement includes strong labor provisions that protect the \nright to organize, the right to bargain collectively, and to provide \nprotections against forced labor, child labor, and employment \ndiscrimination.\n  These changes may not all happen overnight, but we can ensure that \nwhat remains to be fixed will be supported by our strengthened economic \nrelationship and the social and economic incentives for Colombia to \nmaintain a positive trajectory in reducing violence. Does the passage \nof this agreement mean that all of the ills facing Colombia will be \ncured? I make no such assumption, and I know it will take work and \ndiligent oversight. The burden will be on the Colombian government to \nfollow through on promised reforms and ensure they have the intended \neffect. It will also be up to this administration to ensure that the \nbenchmarks laid out in its labor action plan are met to the greatest \nextent possible and that Colombia continues to meet these goals. \nFinally, it will be up to Congress to provide ongoing oversight to \nensure everyone is meeting their responsibilities. I, for one, will be \nwatching.\n  In addition to these agreements, I note briefly that Congress came \ntogether in a bipartisan manner to reauthorize a robust Trade \nAdjustment Assistance Program that will assist workers, firms and \nfarmers to retrain and retool so they can better compete in the global \neconomy. This was a necessary precursor to my support of these three \nfree trade agreements.\n  In sum, the free trade agreements with Korea, Panama, and Colombia, \nwhile not perfect, present strong opportunities for Colorado and U.S. \nbusinesses while also including some of the most robust labor and \nenvironmental provisions that we have ever had in a trade agreement \nwith any country. Trade issues are never clear cut, but simply put, \ntrading with our neighbors and partners can help our economy when we \nset the terms fairly and find balance. By helping to ensure that our \ntrading partners play by fair rules, and by opening foreign markets for \nU.S. products, the United States is better positioned to win the global \neconomic race.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/01/senate-section/article/S6999-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6999]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         JOHANSON CONFIRMATION\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, last night the Senate confirmed David \nJohanson as a member of the International Trade Commission. I would \nlike to take a moment to congratulate David on his confirmation. The \nITC administers the Nation's trade remedy laws and provides Congress \nwith independent analysis and information on matters relating to \ninternational trade. I am confident that the International Trade \nCommission will benefit greatly from David's intelligence, experience \nand extraordinary work ethic.\n  David has served as International Trade Counsel to the Senate Finance \nCommittee since 2003, first under the leadership of Senator Grassley \nand now with me as ranking member. With his help, the committee \naccomplished much in those 8 years. Under President Bush, we renewed \ntrade promotion authority and worked together to pass trade agreements \nwith 14 countries agreements that helped to grow the U.S. economy, \nincrease exports, and create American jobs. We also used that trade \npromotion authority to negotiate and pass our trade agreements with \nSouth Korea, Colombia and Panama.\n  Much of the focus of David's work on the Finance Committee has been \non agricultural issues. These are often some of the most contentious \nissues in international trade, but David proved himself to be a \ntireless and effective advocate for U.S. exports. With his help, this \nCommittee was able to reopen important international markets for \nAmerican agricultural products, including the critical Chinese market.\n  In closing, David will bring 15 years of experience in the field of \ninternational trade law, an extraordinary work ethic, meticulous \nattention to detail and pragmatic creativity to his new role as a \nmember of the International Trade Commission. We wish him well on this \nnext phase of his career and thank him for all of the great work that \nhe has done in the U.S. Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/01/senate-section/article/S6999-2", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6999-S7000]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       FORT MONROE NATIONAL PARK\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

I welcome the President's \ndecision to use his authority under the Antiquities Act to protect this \nspecial place by declaring it a national monument and the country's \n396th National Park unit. A National Park Service presence will ensure \nthat we can properly preserve this historic, natural and recreational \nresource for the benefit of present and future generations.\n  On this important occasion, I recognize the effort that has gone \ntowards establishing a National Park unit at Fort Monroe. I have been \nfortunate to\n\n[[Page S7000]]\n\nwork with a bipartisan, Federal, State and local group that includes \nSenator Jim Webb, Congressmen Scott Rigell, Bobby Scott, Rob Wittman \nand Randy Forbes, Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell and his \nadministration, the Fort Monroe Authority, the city of Hampton and \nMayor Molly Ward, State and local elected officials, conservation \npartners such as the National Trust for Historic Preservation and the \nNational Park Conservation Association, individual advocates and \ncitizen groups including the Citizens for a Fort Monroe National Park, \nand many others who have been committed to this effort. I thank \nSecretary Salazar and the National Park Service for their work and \ntheir visits to Hampton this summer to hear firsthand the overwhelming \npublic support that exists for this new National Park Service site. Now \nthat we have solidified a National Park Service role, it is critically \nimportant that the city, the region, and the Commonwealth continue to \nwork together to make the most of this tremendous opportunity to \nshowcase Fort Monroe's incredible place in our nation's history.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \nsesquicentennial of the 17 original counties created by the Colorado \nTerritorial Legislature in 1861. These counties celebrate this \nsignificant milestone today, November 1, 2011.\n  Congress established Colorado Territory on February 28, 1861, and the \nterritory's first legislative assembly convened on September 9, 1861.\n  The 17 original counties--Arapahoe, Boulder, Clear Creek, Costilla, \nDouglas, El Paso, Fremont, Gilpin, Guadalupe, shortly thereafter \nrenamed Conejos, Huerfano, Jefferson, Lake, Larimer, Park, Pueblo, \nSummit, and Weld counties were established by the territorial \nlegislature within the present boundaries of the State of Colorado.\n  From the snow-covered mountains of Summit County to the farm lands of \nthe San Luis Valley, these original counties established the foundation \nfrom which the most beautiful State in our country grew and developed.\n  Colorado became the 38th State of the Union on August 1, 1876, under \nPresident Ulysses S. Grant, and became known as the Centennial State.\n  Over the past 150 years, counties had their boundaries revised, new \ncounties were created, and some were abolished, and today, the State of \nColorado has 64 counties, each one with its own unique history, \ngeography, and cultural heritage.\n  I take this time today to congratulate Colorado on the 150th \nanniversary of our State's first 17 counties and to recognize all of \nColorado's 64 counties for their vital contributions to our great \nState.\n  As we welcome this milestone in the history of Colorado, we can no \ndoubt look forward to another promising and prosperous 150 \nyears.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/01/senate-section/article/S7000-2", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7000-S7001]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING DR. WANGARI MAATHAI\n\n Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, 2 months ago, on September \n25, 2011, Dr. Wangari Maathai of Kenya, the first African woman to \nreceive a Nobel Peace Prize, passed away after her fight with ovarian \ncancer. She was a woman of firsts, of force, and of foresight. She was \na woman who empowered millions of African women with hope and \nopportunity.\n  Born on April 1, 1940, in Nyeri, Kenya, to peasant Kikuyu farmers, \nWangari Muta Maathai, at the urging of her older brother, attended \nprimary school at a time when it was rare for women to receive an \neducation. Her father worked for a White landowner who forced him to \nsell all his crops to him at whatever price was offered. From an early \nage, Dr. Maathai possessed a deep and abiding love and respect for \nnature. As a child, she spent time at Kanungu--an underground stream \nthat flowed close to a sacred fig tree, and she would till fields with \nher mother, once saying, ``I grew up close to my mother, in the field, \nwhere I could observe nature.''\n  She went on to secondary school where she graduated at the top of her \nclass. In 1964, she was awarded a scholarship to attend Mount St. \nScholastica College in Atchison, KS, where she graduated with a biology \ndegree. She pursued her master's of science at the University of \nPittsburgh. From there, she continued her studies in both Germany and \nKenya where she earned her doctorate in veterinary anatomy from the \nUniversity of Nairobi. She was the first woman from East or Central \nAfrica to earn a doctorate degree, and also the first woman to hold a \nprofessorship at the University of Nairobi's Department of Veterinary \nAnatomy which she later chaired another first for a woman.\n  Through the force of personality, she reinforced the links between \npoverty and health, economic security, and environmental \nsustainability. Returning to Kenya from her studies abroad, she saw how \ndeforestation and planting of cash crops had stripped the land of \nresources, causing animals and plants to disappear. The result was a \nlack of food, water, and rampant erosion. The effect was particularly \ndevastating for women who were not only the family caretakers, but as \nsubsistence farmers, depended [S3]upon the land for their livelihood.\n  In 1977, Dr. Maathai had the foresight to establish the Green Belt \nMovement which sought to combat the aggressive deforestation occurring \nin Kenya. Asked about her efforts, she once said, ``It occurred to me \nthat some of the problems women talked about were connected to the \nland. If you plant trees you give them firewood. If you plant trees you \ngive them food.'' While many derided her efforts, this Movement, made \nup mostly of women, has planted more than 30 million trees across \nAfrica and helped approximately 900,000 Kenyans develop and sustain \ntheir ability to care for themselves and their families.\n  The Green Belt Movement would spread across the continent. Dr. \nMaathai inspired the development of the Pan African Green Belt Network. \nHer efforts have resulted in Tanzania, Uganda, Malawi, Lesotho, \nEthiopia, and Zimbabwe starting their own reforestation efforts. The \nMovement not only emphasizes the relationship between the people and \ntheir land, but also empowers women in the areas of family planning, \nreproductive health, nutrition, food security, and leadership \ndevelopment.\n  Dr. Maathai's environmental work eventually permeated the realm of \npolitics. As a proponent of civic responsibility, she entered politics \nwith the understanding that ``the message for Africans is that the \nsolutions to our problems lie within us.'' As an advocate for the poor \nand under-represented, Dr. Maathai suffered not only political taunts \nbut also physical violence at one point being brutally beaten by police \nand at another time, a victim of a tear gas attack. Throughout the \n1990s, Dr. Maathai was repeatedly arrested, imprisoned, and threatened \nfor exercising her rights.\n  Despite physical threats and political setbacks, in December of 2002, \nshe was elected to Kenya's National Assembly and was appointed the \nDeputy Minister for Environment, Natural Resources, and Wildlife. She \nwas also instrumental in the creation of Kenya's Bill of Rights. She \nwent on to serve as the Presiding Officer of the Economic, Social, and \nCultural Council ECOSOCC, of the African Union, as well as Goodwill \nAmbassador to the Congo Basin Forest Ecosystem.\n  As the author of multiple publications, Dr. Maathai garnered many \nawards including the 1989 WomenAid International Women of the World \nAward, the 1991 Goldman Environmental Prize, the 1991 United Nation's \nAfrica Prize for Leadership, the 1993 Edinburgh Medal, the 2001 Juliet \nHollister Award, the 2003 WANGO Environment Award, and the 2004 Sophie \nPrize. She has received numerous honorary degrees from a wide array of \ninstitutions including: Yale University; Williams College; University \nof California at Irvine; and Morehouse University. In 2005, she was \nhonored by both Time Magazine and Forbes Magazine as one of the 100 \nmost influential people in the world and as one of the 100 most \npowerful women in the world, respectively. She was also a United \nNations Environment Programme Global 500 Hall of Fame recipient. In \n2006, Dr. Maathai\n\n[[Page S7001]]\n\nwas awarded France's highest honor, the Legion d'Honneur, by French \nPresident Jacques Chirac.\n  During her acceptance speech of the 2004 Nobel Peace Prize, Dr. \nWangari Maathai said:\n\n       In the course of history, there comes a time when humanity \n     is called to shift to a new level of consciousness, to reach \n     a higher moral ground. A time when we have to shed our fear \n     and give hope to each other. That time is now.\n\n  Whether she was advocating for the right of women or for the \nimportance of protecting and developing the environments in which they \nlive, Dr. Maathai's legacy of service advocating a message that one has \nthe power to change the lives of many--remains.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/01/senate-section/article/S7001-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7001]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING EDWARD L. LOPER, SR.\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I would like to set aside a moment \nto reflect on the life of artist and educator Edward L. Loper, Sr. From \nthe time he started painting at age three until his death at age 95, \nthe Wilmington, DE native known as Ed inspired many to see the world \ndifferently through his art. He was a truly gifted man who dedicated \nhis life to his craft and educating the next generation of painters.\n  Ed Loper was born on April 7, 1916, in Wilmington, DE. As a child, \nhis creativity came out when he picked up a brush and painted the \nobjects and pictures around him. As a young adult, he honed his craft \nby going to the Philadelphia Art Museum every Saturday to study the \npaintings housed there, examining the brush strokes and techniques of \nthe great painters that came before him.\n  He graduated in 1934 from Howard High School where he had been an \nAll-State football and basketball player. Later, it was a chance \nencounter with Albert Barnes, an entrepreneur and art collector from \nPhiladelphia, that helped him develop his painting style. Barnes \ninvited him to join classes at his museum, but Loper could not afford \nto do so at the time. Years later, Loper took advantage of this \nopportunity, attending classes there for 10 years.\n  He made his love for painting into his profession and worked at the \nWorks Progress Administration as a painter. In the beginning of his \ncareer, Ed faced discrimination because he was a black artist in a \nsegregated society, but his work ultimately prevailed beyond society's \nprejudices. In 1937, he was the first black artist to have a painting \naccepted to a juried show at the Wilmington Society of the Fine Arts, \nnow the Delaware Art Museum.\n  His paintings focused on landscapes, still life, and portraits, and \nhe is known for his use of vibrant and rich colors to create complex \nscenes. He gave visual meaning to the world he knew: city streets, \ntenements, railroad trestles, marshes, coal yards and pool rooms.\n  Ed turned to a career in art education and first shared his passion \nfor painting with his students at Delaware's Ferris School. Then, in \n1942, he began to teach at the Allied Kid Company. He also taught at \nthe Jewish Community Center, the Delaware Art Museum, Lincoln \nUniversity, the Delaware College of Art and Design, and at his own \nstudio in his later years. Some of his students studied with him for \ndecades.\n  He was married to Janet Neville-Loper who resides in Wilmington. His \nson, Edward Loper Jr., is also a painter. He was also the father to \nKenneth Loper, Tina Sturgis and the late Jean Washington and Mary \nBrower. One of the last things Ed painted was the door to their \nkitchen, where he illustrated some of their travels to China and \nEurope.\n  Ed's talent for color broke the mold of his time, and his passion for \nteaching others to see through color was unsurpassed. He changed the \nlandscape for black artists and paved the way for others who came after \nhim. He leaves us with the lasting legacy of his work, which currently \ncan be seen in the major permanent collections of the Philadelphia Art \nMuseum; the Delaware Art Museum; the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, \nDC; Howard University; the Museum of African American Art in Tampa, FL; \namong others. Today I commemorate Edward L. Loper, Sr., his life and \nhis outstanding artistic legacy. It was truly a privilege to know him, \nto have been one of his neighbors for a time, and to be the proud owner \nof one of his extraordinary paintings.\n Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I wish to honor the work of a \ndistinguished Delawarean who, though known for his paintings, will long \nbe remembered for a contribution to our State that extends much farther \nthan the reach of his brush.\n  Edward J. Loper, Sr., saw the world a little differently than the \nrest of us, and he spent his lifetime trying to let us in on the \nsecret. He had such a rich appreciation of color that he was once \ndescribed as the ``Prophet of Color.'' He was a great talent and a \ngreat teacher. He captured the beauty and vibrancy of Delaware with \nmemorable style, bold brushwork and an engaging palette.\n  One of his paintings--a scene from the Wawaset Park neighborhood of \nWilmington--hangs in my office. It perfectly captures the vivid \ncontrast in color and creative use of light for which he has become so \nwell known. It tells the story of a bright fall day, subtly emphasizing \nthe reds and yellows of the fall foliage to innocently capture the \nheightened visuals of the season.\n  That he was an African American defined his struggle but not his art. \nHe painted landscapes, street scenes and still lifes, and always with \noil paints. He didn't like being confined to a studio, and would insist \non painting his subjects in person.\n  Once, in his youth, he won a painting competition and proudly showed \nup to the ceremony to collect his award. It turned out, he was the \nfirst African American to have won the award and those in the room were \naghast. Most wouldn't shake his hand. It wasn't the first time Ed Loper \nhad been stung by discrimination, nor would it be the last.\n  Though Ed first picked up a brush at age 3, it was when he went to \nwork at a division of the Works Progress Administration during the \nGreat Depression that he really learned to paint. He was later hired by \nJeannette Eckman, who was in charge of the Federal Arts Project, and \nmuch of his artwork would go on to be housed in the National Gallery of \nArt in Washington, D.C. He couldn't be tied down to any one particular \nstyle and a wide range of artists, including Van Gogh, Van Ruisdael, \nCorot, El Greco, Cezanne, Picasso, Pollock, Tintoretto, Titian, and \nVeronese, are said to have inspired him.\n  Loper once said, ``Once you learn to see as an artist, the world will \nnever look the same again.'' For 60 years, he taught hundreds of \nstudents to see the world differently. He had a reputation for being \ntough on his students, but each one earned a greater appreciation for \nthat which Loper pursued his entire life: ``real art.''\n  He leaves behind a great legacy, not only in the works that adorn the \nwalls of homes and galleries around the world, but in the constellation \nof artists he nurtured. He will be greatly missed by his family and the \ncommunity he called ``home.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/01/senate-section/article/S7001-2", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7001-S7002]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR. HENRY GIVENS JR.\n\n Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, today I congratulate Dr. Henry \nGivens, Jr. on his retirement and to thank him for his many years of \nleadership and service to the field of education. For over 50 years, \nDr. Givens has been a champion of higher education and has fought to \nimprove the lives of Missouri's students. It is my pleasure to honor \nhim today.\n  A native of St. Louis, MO, Dr. Givens attended public schools and \nreceived his bachelor's degree from Lincoln University, a master's \ndegree from the University of Illinois, and his doctorate degree from \nSaint Louis University. Dr. Givens began his career in education as a \nfifth and sixth grade teacher in the Webster Groves School District in \nsuburban St. Louis. After his work with the Webster Groves School \nDistrict, Dr. Givens became the principal of the first prototype magnet \nschool, Douglas Elementary School in St. Louis, MO. Under Dr. Given's \nguidance, Douglas Elementary faculty debuted revolutionary teaching \ntechniques that are now standard classroom practices, helping to \nmodernize Missouri's school systems.\n  In 1973, Dr. Givens continued to break new ground when he became the \nfirst African-American assistant commissioner of education for the \nState of\n\n[[Page S7002]]\n\nMissouri. Dr. Givens spent 5 years in that position before becoming \npresident of Harris-Stowe University in 1979. When he first assumed \nleadership, Harris-Stowe State College offered one degree--elementary \neducation--and had only one building. During Dr. Givens' 32 years as \npresident of Harris-Stowe, the university expanded and upgraded \nfacilities, tripled student population, and added 13 new degree \nprograms. Dr. Givens' determined leadership shaped Harris-Stowe into \nthe outstanding university it is today.\n  In addition to his accomplishments in the field of education, Dr. \nGivens is affiliated with numerous national and local professional and \nsocial organizations and has received over 125 awards and recognitions \nfor his service to his community. President Obama recently appointed \nDr. Givens to the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Capital \nFinance Advisory Board, and Dr. Givens has served as the chairman of \nthe Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Statewide Celebration Commission for \nMissouri since its inception in 1986.\n  It is my pleasure to honor Dr. Givens today. His dedicated leadership \nhas improved the quality of the educational experience for Missourians. \nHe has undoubtedly touched the lives of many and improved the quality \nof the community at large.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the Senate join me in congratulating and \nhonoring Dr. Henry Givens, Jr.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/01/senate-section/article/S7002-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7002-S7003]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           TRIBUTE TO MAJOR GENERAL WILLIAM HOWARD McCOY, JR.\n\n Mrs. McCASKILL.

He leaves a legacy of tremendous leadership \nand genuine concern for the soldiers and civilians of the U.S. Army. \nFurthermore, he attributes his success to the loving support of his \nwife Mrs. Jill McCoy and his children. General McCoy may have only \nspent several assignments in Missouri, but his career embodies classic \nMissouri values: love of country and family; selfless service; ``show \nme''--or, in other words, speaking with one's actions not words; and \nbeing humble. I wish Major General McCoy and his family the very best \nin retirement and I congratulate Major General McCoy on a fabulous \ncareer of service to our Nation and to the cause of freedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/01/senate-section/article/S7003-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7003]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO DR. DORIS JONES WILSON\n\n Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me in \nhonoring the work of Dr. Doris Jones Wilson, a music legend and icon in \nthe St. Louis, MO community. For over 65 years, she has worked as an \ninstructor, arranger and performer of music from every genre. Dr. \nWilson's retirement marks just one more wonderful milestone in a life \nof service. It is my pleasure and privilege to ask the Senate to pause \nfor a moment to honor Dr. Wilson today.\n  Dr. Wilson is a beloved member of the St. Louis community. She first \nearned a bachelor of music education degree from Lincoln University in \nJefferson City, MO. She continued her education at Washington \nUniversity in Saint Louis earning a master of arts in teaching and \nlater a doctor of education in music education. Following her studies, \nDr. Wilson went on to become a professor of music and director of the \nConcert Chorale of Harris-Stowe State University in St. Louis. Dr. \nWilson recently retired from her position as minister of music for the \nWest Side Missionary Baptist Church in St. Louis.\n  Dr. Wilson has received numerous awards and commendations over the \ncourse of her career that recognize the exceptional impact her work as \na musician, teacher and choral director has had on the music community. \nI was so humbled to learn that this previous September, the Kennedy \nCenter featured a special performance of one of her most popular \narrangements, ``Even Me.'' This is only one in a long list of honors.\n  In 2004, Hampton University awarded her the Living Legend Award of \nMinisters and Choir Directors. She received the Missouri Arts Award \nfrom the Missouri Arts Council in 1998 and the Excellence in Teaching \nAward from Emerson Electric in 1997. In 1994, Dr. Wilson was honored \nwith the Stellar Performer Award from the St. Louis American newspaper \nfor outstanding leadership in music education. That same year the \nBahamas Department of Tourism wrote Dr. Wilson a letter of commendation \nfor Concert Choral Performance. In 1981, Dr. Wilson was awarded the \nGold Medal for Concert Choral at the International Music Festival.\n  As a Representative of the great State of Missouri and a resident of \nSt. Louis, I am proud and humbled by the life and career of Dr. Wilson. \nI have no doubt that she has touched the lives of many students with \nher wonderful gift and spirit. The education and wisdom that she has \npassed on as a music educator will live on in the work her students do \nand the people they become. I truly believe that the impact her work \nhas had on the St. Louis community is immeasurable.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the Senate join me in congratulating and \nhonoring Dr. Doris Jones Wilson on her retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/01/senate-section/article/S7003-2", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7003]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/01/senate-section/article/S7003-3", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7003]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/01/senate-section/article/S7003-4", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7003]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT RELATIVE TO THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY RELATIVE \n TO THE ACTIONS AND POLICIES OF THE GOVERNMENT OF SUDAN AS DECLARED IN \n            EXECUTIVE ORDER 13067 OF NOVEMBER 3, 1997--PM 31\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. CARDIN (for himself, Mr. Wicker, and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 1776. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to expand the \nOperation Hero Miles program to include the authority to accept the \ndonation of travel benefits in the form of hotel points or awards for \nfree or reduced-cost accommodations; to the Committee on Armed \nServices.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Hotels for \nHeroes Act. Next week is Veterans Day and we owe it to our military men \nand women to support them every day but especially in their time of \nneed. Today, military families are facing enormous challenges, not just \nemotionally, but financially. The legislation I am introducing will \nhelp more families to be with their loved ones as they recover from \ninjuries and illnesses sustained defending our country and our way of \nlife.\n  This bill expands on the popular Hero Miles program created in 2003 \nby my Maryland delegation colleague, Congressman Dutch Ruppersberger. \nThe Hero Miles program authorizes the Department of Defense to accept \ndonated frequent traveler miles to provide free round-trip airfare to \nmilitary members recovering at military or Veterans Administration, VA, \nmedical centers as a result of injuries sustained in overseas \nconflicts. The program also enables family and friends to visit injured \ntroops while they are being treated. The Fisher House Foundation \nadministers the program. The Foundation is a non-profit best known for \nits network of comfort homes built on the grounds of major military and \nVA medical centers.\n  The bill that I am introducing today would expand the program to \nallow the Department of Defense to accept the donation of hotel points \nin addition to airline miles. Congressman Ruppersberger has introduced \na companion bill in the House of Representatives. Here in the Senate, I \nam proud to have bipartisan support for this bill: Senator Wicker is \nthe lead co-sponsor.

Res. 29. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States relating to contributions and \nexpenditures intended to affect elections; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an \namendment to the United States Constitution to address our country's \nbroken campaign finance system. Joining me in this effort are my \ncolleagues Senators Bennet, Harkin, Durbin, Schumer, Merkley, \nWhitehouse, Begich, and Shaheen.\n  As we head into another election year, we are about to see \nunprecedented amounts of money spent on efforts to influence the \noutcome of our elections. With the Supreme Court striking down the \nsensible regulations Congress has passed, I believe the only way to \naddress the root cause of this problem is by first amending the \nConstitution.\n  Such an amendment is not a new idea. Constitutional amendments to\n\n[[Page S7008]]\n\ngrant Congress broad authority to regulate the campaign finance system \nhave been introduced many times in the past, and most had bipartisan \nsupport. But last year's Supreme Court decision in Citizens United v. \nFEC places a new emphasis on the need for Congress to act.\n  Citizens United was a victory for special interests at the expense of \nthe average American. It held that corporations deserve the same free \nspeech protections as individual Americans, enabling them to spend \nfreely from their corporate treasuries on campaign advertising. It also \ngave rise to so-called Super PACs, which can raise and spend unlimited \nfunds to campaign for or against candidates.\n  We saw in the last election the initial impact of the Citizens United \ndecision, but it is about to get much worse. A New York Times editorial \non September 18 summed it up pretty well.\n  That piece, entitled ``How the Big Money Finds a Way In,'' stated \nthat:\n\n       Companies, unions, and other interest groups poured about \n     $300 million into campaign ads in the 2010 Congressional \n     elections after the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision \n     open the sluices to unlimited spending by independent groups. \n     That will look like a trickle compared with the gusher coming \n     in 2012.\n\n  While the Citizens United decision sparked a renewed focus on the \nneed for campaign finance reform, the Court laid the groundwork for a \nbroken system many years ago. In 1976, when the Court held in Buckley \nv. Valeo that restricting independent campaign expenditures violates \nthe First Amendment right to free speech, it established the flawed \nprecedent that money and speech are the same thing. Since then, our \nNation's policymakers are all too often elected based on their ability \nto raise money or the size of their personal fortunes, rather than the \nquality of their ideas or dedication to public service.\n  These decisions, among others, demonstrate the Court's willingness to \nrule broadly and ignore longstanding precedent to declare our campaign \nfinance laws unconstitutional. Because of this, I believe that the only \nway to truly fix the problem is to first amend the Constitution to \ngrant Congress clear authority to regulate the campaign finance system.\n  Our proposed amendment is similar to bipartisan proposals in previous \nCongresses. It would authorize Congress to regulate the raising and \nspending of money for federal political campaigns, including \nindependent expenditures, and allow states to regulate such spending at \ntheir level. It would not dictate any specific policies or regulations. \nInstead, it would allow Congress to pass campaign finance reform \nlegislation that withstands constitutional challenges.\n  I understand how difficult amending the constitution can be, but also \nbelieve that momentum is growing to reign in the out of control \ncampaign spending. Just because getting a constitutional amendment \nthrough Congress and ratified by the States is extremely difficult, it \ndoesn't mean we shouldn't try. We know our Founders did not intend for \nelections to be bought and paid for by undisclosed donors operating \nthrough secretive organizations--that is the antithesis of democracy \nand we must do everything possible to address the problem.\n  The only way to restore the democratic nature of our election system \nis to fundamentally change it. That can only be done after the \nConstitution is amended to allow such changes. Many of my predecessors \nunderstood this and spent years championing the cause. Senator Fritz \nHollings introduced bipartisan constitutional amendments similar to the \none we introduce today in every Congress from the 99th to the 108th. \nSenators Schumer and Cochran introduced one in the 109th Congress.\n  Those were all before the Citizens United decision, but Senator \nHollings has continued to call for an amendment since his retirement. \nJust last October, he wrote a piece for The Huffington Post titled \n``Money is a Cancer in Politics.'' In that article he wrote:\n\n       Like a dog chasing its tail, Congress has tried for thirty-\n     five years to control spending in federal elections, only to \n     be thwarted by the Supreme Court intent on equating speech \n     with money. To return to Madison's freedom of speech, \n     Congress needs to pass a Joint Resolution amending the \n     Constitution to authorize Congress to limit or control \n     spending in federal elections.\n\n  Our constituents' faith in the election system has been fundamentally \ncorrupted by big money from outside interest groups. It is time for \nCongress to take back control of the campaign finance system by passing \na constitutional amendment that will allow real reform.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint \nresolution and an article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 29\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, That the \n     following article is proposed as an amendment to the \n     Constitution of the United States, which shall be valid to \n     all intents and purposes as part of the Constitution when \n     ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several \n     States within seven years after the date of its submission by \n     the Congress:\n\n                              ``Article--\n\n       ``Section 1. Congress shall have power to regulate the \n     raising and spending of money and in kind equivalents with \n     respect to Federal elections, including through setting \n     limits on--\n       ``(1) the amount of contributions to candidates for \n     nomination for election to, or for election to, Federal \n     office; and\n       ``(2) the amount of expenditures that may be made by, in \n     support of, or in opposition to such candidates.\n       ``Section 2.

Congress shall have power to implement and \n     enforce this article by appropriate legislation.''.\n\n               [From the New York Times, Sept. 17, 2011]\n\n                    How the Big Money Finds a Way In\n\n                          (By Eduardo Porter)\n\n       Companies, unions and other interest groups poured about \n     $300 million into campaign ads in the 2010 Congressional \n     elections after the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision \n     opened the sluices to unlimited spending by independent \n     groups. That will look like a trickle compared with the \n     gusher coming in 2012.\n       Gov. Rick Perry's supporters have created a group called \n     Make Us Great Again, which plans to spend up to $55 million \n     to help him win the Republican presidential nomination. \n     Unions and other supporters of Democrats, too, are starting \n     to funnel money into independent groups like Priorities USA \n     Action, which has raised $3.2 million for the presidential \n     race and plans to raise much more.\n       These groups, which are not supposed to coordinate with \n     candidates' campaigns or the political parties, are called \n     Super PACs, but the label doesn't much matter. The point is \n     that in the past several years outside groups--using various \n     types of financing vehicles--have accounted for a growing \n     share of the money spent in federal elections.\n       The first chart shows the steady rise in total spending in \n     federal elections in both presidential and nonpresidential \n     years over the last decade. Over that time, money spent by \n     outside groups jumped to 8 percent of the total from less \n     than 1 percent, while party spending declined as a share.\n       The second chart shows how spending by independent groups \n     has morphed with each new campaign finance law and judicial \n     ruling. What's constant is the ability of fund-raisers to put \n     more cash into elections. The 2002 McCain-Feingold law put an \n     end to the unlimited ``soft money'' donations by \n     corporations, unions and wealthy individuals to party \n     committees, which used it to pay for ``issue'' ads that often \n     attacked or supported candidates. When soft money went away, \n     donors simply channeled money for such ads to other vehicles, \n     including 527 committees, like Swift Boat Veterans for Truth.\n       In 2007, the Supreme Court blew aside spending restrictions \n     (weak as they were) by ruling that corporations, unions and \n     other groups could spend unlimited amounts up to Election Day \n     on ``issue'' ads that mentioned a candidate's name, as long \n     as they did not explicitly urge a ``vote for'' or ``vote \n     against'' a candidate. Soon after that, 501(c) groups (like \n     trade associations, unions and social welfare advocacy \n     groups) became the vehicle of choice; unlike other types of \n     groups, they are allowed to collect unlimited anonymous \n     donations.\n       The Citizens United decision eliminated the biggest \n     remaining restriction by allowing independent groups to pay \n     for campaign ads that explicitly endorsed or opposed a \n     candidate. Big donors responded in the 2010 election by \n     launching Super PACs like American Crossroads, which raised \n     $26.6 million to help Republicans, and America's Families \n     First Action Fund, which raised $7.1 million to help \n     Democrats. And they created 501(c) ``social advocacy'' groups \n     like Crossroads GPS to offer secrecy to campaign donors.\n\n[[Page S7009]]\n\n       The legal changes of the last decade have contributed to \n     the flood of money in the political process. Corporate \n     campaign donations through 5o1(c)s and Super PACs hit around \n     $140 million in 2010 from zero in 2006, according to \n     estimates by the Center for Responsive Politics. For interest \n     groups and wealthy individuals, the shifts have meant more \n     direct influence in elections. For American democracy, the \n     effect may well be disastrous.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/01/senate-section/article/S7009-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7009]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 308--DESIGNATING NOVEMBER 27, 2011, AS ``DRIVE SAFER \n                                SUNDAY''\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON (for himself, Mr. Pryor, and Mr. Chambliss) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I am hopeful that we will not have to have a \nvote on this matter. This is to protect us so if we cannot work out \nsomething we will have a vote Thursday morning. I hope we can work out \nsomething to have a vote on this most important measure. It is very \nimportant. This is a piece of legislation that the entire population of \nAmerica supports by a ratio of some 76 percent. Republicans support it; \nDemocrats support it; Independents support it. The only people in\n\n[[Page S7010]]\n\nthe world who do not support it are Republicans here in the Senate. So \nI hope we can work out something and move to this and it would be \nunnecessary for us to have to have cloture invoked or try to have \ncloture invoked.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/01/senate-section/article/S7010-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7010]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. REID.
