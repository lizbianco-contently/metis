Mr. President, I rise today to thank Rabbi Baruch Frydman-\nKohl for his invocation this morning and welcome him and his beloved \nwife Josette to the Senate.\n  Rabbi Baruch's father Jack and my father Max were brothers and \nEuropeans during the First World War. Both were exiled to Siberia. \nLater, after my father immigrated to America, he helped Jack and his \nfamily come to Milwaukee.\n  Baruch is the Anne and Max Tanenbaum senior rabbi of Best Tzedec \nCongregation, the largest synagogue community in Canada. The focus of \nhis rabbinate has been family education, lifelong learning, and care \nfor the housebound, hospitalized, and homeless. Beyond the synagogue, \nthe rabbi is the president of the Toronto Board of Rabbis and recently \norganized the Path of Abraham mission to bring Jews, Christians, and \nMuslims to the Holy Land to explore the challenges of three religions, \ntwo nations, and one land.\n  Baruch's list of accomplishments and credentials is as impressive as \nit is long.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KOHL. I will just add to this list his place in my heart as a \nbeloved cousin, valued friend, and welcomed reflection of all about our \nfathers that was\n\n[[Page S7128]]\n\nstrong, smart, and good. I thank the rabbi for his time and attention \nto the Senate today.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                       Rabbi Baruch Frydman-Kohl\n\n       Baruch Frydman-Kohl is the Anne and Max Tanenbaum Senior \n     Rabbi of Beth Tzedec Congregation, the largest synagogue \n     community in Canada. The focus of his rabbinate has been a \n     commitment to family education, life-long learning and care \n     for the housebound, hospitalized and homeless. Rabbi Baruch \n     initiated the development of a ``synaplex'' of innovative \n     ritual and educational opportunities to encourage more \n     participation in synagogue life.\n       Beyond the synagogue, the Rabbi is the President of the \n     Toronto Board of Rabbis and recently organized the Path of \n     Abraham mission to bring Jews, Christians and Muslims to the \n     Holy Land to explore the challenges of three religions, two \n     nations and one land. He serves on the Board of UJA \n     Federation of Toronto, has served on the Executive Committee \n     of the Rabbinical Assembly, and as past president of two of \n     its regions. He was awarded a Coolidge Fellowship to pursue \n     research in an inter-faith community at the Episcopal \n     Divinity School at Harvard University. The Rabbi received his \n     doctorate in Jewish Philosophy from the Jewish Theological \n     Seminary and is a Rabbinic Fellow of the Shalom Hartman \n     Institute of Jerusalem. Rabbi Frydman-Kohl is the author of \n     scholarly articles in the area of Jewish philosophy and \n     mysticism.\n       Rabbi Baruch's father, Jack, and Senator Kohl's father, \n     Max, were brothers and young teenagers during the First World \n     War when they were caught between the Austrian-Hungarian \n     Empire and Czarist Russia. They were taken captive and sent \n     to exile in Siberia. Later, after Max's immigration to \n     America, he helped to bring Jack and his family to Milwaukee. \n     Through their love and care for each other, the two brothers \n     enabled each other to survive war and to build a new life in \n     America.\n       Rabbi Baruch is married to Josette. They are the parents of \n     Yakov (married to Sarah), Rafi and Amir and the doting new \n     grandparents of Ilana Adi.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is a remarkable short history, very \namazing how wonderful our country is.

Mr. President, it took 4 months, but Republicans are \nfinally realizing their way back from the fiscal cliff has been right \nin front of them all along. In July the Senate passed legislation to \ngive economic certainty to 98 percent of American families and 97 \npercent of small businesses, to every American making less than \n$250,000 a year. For 4 months we have been one vote away from a \nsolution to this looming crisis. For 4 months House Republicans have \nrefused to act. Instead, they have held the middle class hostage to \nprotect the richest 2 percent of taxpayers--people who have enjoyed a \ndecade of blooming income and shrinking tax bills.\n  One has to admire the President, who went out and campaigned on this \nissue. He did not in any way walk away from the issue. He said: That is \nhow we are going to get our fiscal house in order. And independents by \na huge margin, Democrats by a huge margin, and 41 percent of \nRepublicans support what the President asks us to do.\n  So now reasonable Republicans--I think it is very important--are \ncoming around to what Democrats have said all along: Let's reassure \nmillions of Americans that taxes will not go up by $2,200 a year on \nJanuary 1; that is, those people who are the middle class of America.\n  Prominent Republicans are calling on Speaker Boehner to end the \nsuspense for millions of these American families. Yesterday Republican \nCongressman Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a veteran in the House of \nRepresentatives, urged his caucus to pass the Senate's legislation \nkeeping taxes low for those making less than $250,000 a year. That \nwould pass by an overwhelming margin. All the Speaker has to do is let \nit come up for a vote. I would bet a lot of his Republicans would vote \nfor it. I would bet a majority of his Republicans would vote for it. \nVirtually every Democrat would vote for it. They only need 218. There \nare 435 Members in the House. We also noted yesterday that Republican \nCongressman Tim Scott of South Carolina, who is noted for his \nconservatism, admitted yesterday that if the Speaker brought our bill \nto a vote, it would surely pass. So it is time the House Republican \nleadership listened to the will of the American people--Independents, \nDemocrats, and Republicans--and also the advice of the reasonable \nmembers of their own caucus. The way out of this standoff is clear. Yet \nwe are left wondering how long Republicans will force middle-class \nfamilies to wait and to worry.\n  Unfortunately, resolving the standoff will not resolve every conflict \nover the fiscal future. We have to end wasteful tax breaks for the \nrichest Americans. We agree. We agree with the majority of Americans. \nWe are serious about reducing the deficit. It will take a balanced \napproach. Last year we successfully worked across party lines to cut $1 \ntrillion worth of spending we could not afford. Even our Republican \ncolleagues acknowledge budget cuts alone will not solve our fiscal \nchallenges. We can argue over whether to give more wasteful handouts to \nthe wealthy. They can do that tomorrow. We can discuss balanced, \nresponsible ways to reduce our deficit tomorrow. But let's take care of \nthe middle class today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/29/senate-section/article/S7128-2", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7128]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, throughout the week, I have raised \nquestions about the President's level of seriousness and engagement \nwhen it comes to resolving the short- and long-term fiscal challenges \nwe face. I have done this because, as I have said repeatedly, the \nPresident is the key to success in all of these discussions. So I am \nhoping that when Secretary Geithner comes up to the Capitol today, he \nbrings a specific plan from the President that the two parties could \nagree to for the good of the country. I hope to hear the \nadministration's specific plans for protecting jobs and promoting \neconomic growth for middle-class Americans, while reducing the debt by \nstrengthening entitlements, reducing Washington's spending, and \npreventing a tax hike on every American taxpayer.\n  Up until now, the White House has preferred talking points and an \nappeal to the hard left to a serious discussion about how we fix the \neconomy, reduce the Federal debt, and return the country to a path of \ngrowth and prosperity for all. They are stuck on the same old tired \nslogans, and it is really completely counterproductive. So this morning \nI would like to address one of these recurring talking points in a \nlittle more detail in the hope that the White House puts it aside and \nstarts talking in a way that suggests they are actually serious over \nthere about finding a solution. I am referring to the oft-repeated \nassertion by the White House and reporters alike that those of us who \ninsist on not raising income tax rates on anybody are doing so to \n``protect the rich.'' I assure you, that has absolutely nothing to do \nwith it. Check the polling data. The super-rich vote for the Democrats. \nWe are not insisting on keeping tax rates where they are to protect \nsome tiny sliver of the electorate; we are insisting on keeping tax \nrates where they are first and foremost to protect jobs and because we \ndo not think government needs the money in the first place.\n  The problem, as I have said, is not that Washington taxes too little, \nbut it is that it spends too much. But if more revenue is the price \nDemocrats want to exact for supporting other necessary reforms, then we \nshould at least agree that we do it in a way that does not cost jobs \nand disincentivize work, as we all know raising rates would do.\n\n[[Page S7129]]\n\n  A lot of people around here seem to have forgotten that we are still \nin the middle of a jobs crisis. I can tell you that lots of folks are \nhurting in my State of Kentucky. National unemployment is still just a \nhair below 8 percent, and millions of Americans are still looking for \nwork.\n  So if it is an iron law of economics that you get less of what you \ntax, why on Earth would we want to raise taxes on work? Rates matter \nbecause they affect behavior. The higher the tax rate, the higher the \ndisincentive to work. This isn't just Republican orthodoxy, it is basic \neconomics. As the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office recently put \nit, ``Increasing revenues by raising marginal tax rates on labor would \nreduce people's incentive to work and therefore reduce the amount of \nlabor supplied to the economy.''\n  That is the CBO, not the Republican National Committee. They go on to \nsay over at CBO, it would, by itself, ``decrease output in the medium \nand long term.''\n  In the middle of a jobs crisis, that is the last thing we ought to be \ndoing. Shouldn't we at least agree on that? The negative effect raising \nrates has on labor is so widely acknowledged that the Joint Committee \non Taxation actually has models that incorporate the effects of doing \nit. They also know that higher rates increase the incentive to shelter \nincome from taxation. When rates are higher, the people paying them try \neven harder to keep the government from taking what they earn.\n  In short, raising rates means less labor, less investment, and more \nincentive for the wealthy to waste money in an attempt to shelter what \nthey have earned. We can quibble about the magnitude of these effects, \nbut everyone agrees they exist.\n  The problem is particularly acute for those thinking about taking a \nsecond job in a household, which in many cases unfairly targets married \nwomen looking to supplement the family income or someone considering a \npromotion or starting a new venture.\n  Instead of raising rates, Republicans have proposed capping \ndeductions through tax reform instead. If the only way to get Democrats \nto agree to progrowth tax reform and meaningful entitlement reform is \nthrough more revenue, a smarter way to do it is by capping deductions. \nCapping deductions, or tax expenditures as some people call them, is a \nfar less painful, more economically sound, way of closing deficits. The \nCongressional Budget Office agrees. As the Congressional Budget Office \nrecently put it:\n\n       Increasing revenues . . . by broadening the tax base would \n     probably have a smaller negative effect, or even a positive \n     effect, on the amount of labor supplied.\n\n  The White House likes to say you can't come up with a realistic plan \nto reduce the deficit without raising tax rates. It is not true. Not \nonly are there plenty of ways to do it, there are ways to do it that \nminimize the disincentive to work, and they can be found right in the \nPresident's own budget. In the President's own budget he proposes three \ndifferent ideas that, combined, dwarf the $442 billion revenue his own \nTreasury estimates he could grab from increasing two rates. All of them \ncap the amount that higher income Americans can deduct from their \nincome taxes, and all of them do it in a way that is far less damaging \nthan raising those tax rates while protecting middle-class taxpayers.\n\n  Look, I don't like any of these ideas. They all hurt somebody. The \ngovernment spent way too much money as it is. Frankly, I don't think \nthe Democrats are any more interested in using new revenue to lower the \ndeficit now than they have ever been. But don't tell me you have to \nraise rates to do it. It is not true. The longer Democrats keep saying \nit, the longer it is going to take to come up with an agreement.\n  The only reason Democrats are insisting on raising rates is because \nraising rates on the so-called rich is the holy grail of liberalism--\nthe holy grail of liberalism. Their aim isn't job creation; they are \ninterested in wealth destruction--not job creation but wealth \ndestruction.\n  The President needs to realize that he wasn't elected President of \nthe hard left wing of the Democratic Party. He was elected President of \nthe United States. He is the steward of the Nation's finances. He has a \nresponsibility to everyone to work out an agreement, and that means he \nhas to come up with something that can get through a Republican House \nof Representatives.\n  We are waiting on the President. We can still get there, but he is \ngoing to have to lead. He can start by putting the campaign talking \npoints on the shelf. I know that whacking the rich works politically. \nIt worked pretty well for him in his campaign; I get it. But the \nelection is over, and it is time to lead.\n\n\n                         Tribute to Tom Jurich\n\n  Mr. President, yesterday was an extremely happy day for my alma \nmater, the University of Louisville, and I want to talk today about an \nextraordinary individual who has achieved an incredible success at my \nuniversity over the last 15 years. It has been my privilege during my \ncareer to get to know a number of people in all walks of life who have \nbeen highly successful. However, I am hard pressed to think of a more \nconspicuous example of success than what Tom Jurich has accomplished \nfor the University of Louisville in athletics in the last 15 years. \nMembership in the ACC, announced yesterday, is the culmination of his \nextraordinary leadership.\n  Tom Jurich has for 15 years served as the athletic director for the \nUniversity of Louisville, and yesterday it was announced that UofL, as \nI indicated, will be joining the Atlantic Coast Conference. The ACC \nwill be a great home for UofL and the school's commitments to \nacademics, groundbreaking research, and top-ranked athletic teams.\n  Under Tom Jurich's leadership, student athletes at UofL have been \nmaking and breaking records and stirring excitement deep in the hearts \nof Cardinal fans all across Kentucky and all over the world. Since \njoining the Big East Conference in 2006, Cardinal teams have won 50 \nchampionships, with 10 of those in the 2011-2012 season alone, 10 \nchampionships just this year.\n  Our men's basketball team ranks No. 2 in the Nation in total \nattendance records. Our women's basketball team ranks No. 2 in the \nNation for average attendance per game. I think it is safe to say \nCardinal fans love their basketball.\n  Tom Jurich masterminded the hiring of legendary men's basketball \ncoach Rick Patino, who has led the Cardinals to three Big East titles \nand two Final Fours, including one last season. Now ranked in the top \nfive nationally, this year's Cardinal team is well poised to make \nanother run for the Final Four.\n  Tom was also responsible for hiring head football coach Charlie \nStrong, a legend in the making, who has revitalized the Louisville \nfootball program by leading the Cardinals to two bowl games and a share \nof the Big East championship in his short tenure there. Now in Coach \nStrong's third year, the Cardinals are 9-2 and have been ranked in the \ntop 10 nationally this year and have a chance to win the Big East title \nin a nationally televised game against Rutgers tonight.\n\n  Under Tom Jurich's tenure, Cardinal teams have been brought home \nchampionships in sports as diverse as baseball, field hockey, men's \nsoccer, women's soccer, volleyball, men's cross country, men's golf, \nwomen's golf, softball, men's swimming and diving, women's swimming and \ndiving, men's tennis, women's indoor track, and men's and women's \noutdoor track and field, an extraordinary list of accomplishments.\n  Tom Jurich has grown the school's physical facilities to be, in my \nview, the best in the country. Under his leadership the men's and \nwomen's basketball teams began playing in a new state-of-the-art KFC \nYum! Center in downtown Louisville in 2010. It is an arena equal to any \ncollege basketball facility, college or professional, in our country.\n  Under Tom Jurich, an expansion of Papa John's Cardinal Stadium was \ncompleted in 2010, giving UofL football fans one of the best stadiums \nin the country in which to watch a game, seating 55,000. Tom Jurich \nalso oversaw the construction of an extensive sports park that includes \nnew softball and field hockey stadiums, a soccer field surrounded by a \ntrack, fitness trail, and playground.\n  Tom has increased participation for women's athletics, upgrading \nfunding and support staff for existing women's programs and adding four \nnew women's sports: softball, golf, rowing, and lacrosse. He \ntransitioned field hockey and women's soccer and baseball to\n\n[[Page S7130]]\n\nfully funded programs. For his accomplishment, he received the Citizens \nfor Sports Equity 2000 Sports Leadership Award.\n  For his success as an athletic director, Tom was honored as the \nLouisvillian of the Year in 2005 by the Louisville Urban League, and he \nwas nationally recognized in 2007 as Street & Smith's Sports Business \nJournal and Sports Business Daily Athletic Director of the Year. The \nuniversity also recognized his enormous contribution to the institution \nby appointing him vice president for athletics in 2003.\n  Yesterday, the totality of Tom Jurich's accomplishments was \nrecognized when the ACC voted unanimously to accept the University of \nLouisville as its newest member. This is an exciting time for Cardinal \nsports fans. We relish the opportunity to play in the strongest league \nin the Nation and show that Cardinals are able to compete and beat \nanybody.\n  To my good friends from the fine States such as North Carolina, \nVirginia, New York, Pennsylvania, Florida, Indiana, Georgia, \nMassachusetts, and South Carolina, I say ``look out.''\n  I have been pleased to get to know Tom well over the years, as well \nas his wife Terrilynn and their wonderful family. I don't think I have \never met anybody who has done a better job building an enterprise than \nhe has, given what he had when he came to the university in 1997, and \nthen look at it today. He has built an athletic department that boasts \na budget in the top 20 in the country, championship football and \nbasketball teams, record-setting men's and women's basketball \nattendance at our new downtown arena, and enormous success for all the \nother school sports that may not get as much attention but are just as \nvital to the students and the community in Louisville. He has done all \nthis while increasing academic success for student athletes with a \nrecord 21 of 23 Cardinal athletic teams producing a 3.0 or higher \ngrade-point average in the most recently completed semester.\n  It is a truly extraordinary accomplishment. I am proud of my friend \nTom Jurich and what he has done. I want to extend to him my heartiest \ncongratulations from the Senate floor.\n  Go Cards.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                              Fiscal Cliff\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the need to \naddress entitlement reform as part of the impending fiscal cliff.\n  I am not just going to talk about the macro issue, I am going to talk \nabout specifics on a way that we can at least do one entitlement \nreform, Social Security, and make a difference for the long-term future \nof Social Security and the millions of Americans who depend on it and \nhave earned it.\n  It is so important that it be part of the discussion today. So much \nof our short-term consequences and needs for the fiscal cliff have \ndominated the discussion. Well, that is okay; we are 1 month away, \nafter all, from dire circumstances. However, we cannot avoid talking \nabout the long term because that is what we have been doing that has \ncaused us to reach a fiscal cliff. We need to look at entitlements. \nAccording to Medicare trustees, for instance, Medicare paid $35 billion \nmore to beneficiaries than it took in last year in payroll taxes, and \nits trust funds will be depleted 12 years from now if we don't act to \nsave Medicare in a responsible way.\n  The other issue that is not being talked about very much at all is \nSocial Security. In 2010 and 2011, Social Security expenditures, the \nbenefits paid to retirees and the disabled, exceeded payroll tax \nrevenue for the first time since 1983. So as a practical matter, we \nknow the Federal Government is borrowing to pay the Social Security \nneeds of today.\n  Last year, 2011, the Social Security trustees reported that with \nbenefits paid continuing to exceed payroll, the trust funds would be \ndepleted in 2036, after which the program would have a net unfunded \nobligation through the end of Social Security's 75-year valuation \nwindow, and that net unfunded obligation would be $6.5 trillion. After \nreading the trustees' report last year, I drafted the Defend and Save \nSocial Security Act to preserve and strengthen Social Security for 75 \nyears. The longer we delay, the longer and more painful the fix will \nbe.\n\n  I keep hearing Members of Congress, and even the President, saying \nSocial Security is off the table; we are not going to talk about it \nwhen we are talking about the fiscal cliff. That is an astonishing \nstatement for the President and Members of Congress to say, that we are \nnot going to talk about 56 percent of the spending in this country, \nthat it is off the table, because that is what mandatory spending is--\n56 percent of our spending in this country on an annual basis. Of that, \nlet's take out Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, which is 44 \npercent of the total spending of our country.\n  According to the Social Security trustees--1 year after the 2011 \nreport--the Social Security trust fund reserves, because we waited 1 \nyear to do anything about it, will now be depleted in 2033. That is 3 \nyears earlier than was estimated just 1 year ago. And the unfunded \nobligation for the 75-year window has now grown to $8.6 trillion.\n  So we can see what happens with just 1 year of delay to the security \nof Social Security and the capability to keep it going. In 21 years, if \nwe don't do something there will be severe cuts or severe increases in \ntaxes that will be automatic. Without any act of Congress, they will be \nautomatic. Talk about a fiscal cliff now, think about the cliff Members \nof Congress will face then because we didn't do our job in addressing \nthis issue when the solutions were there in a relatively clear glide \npath that would be relatively unnoticed in most households.\n  Let me lay out what will happen: There will be a 25-percent automatic \ncut to the retirement payments and the disability payments that are \ngoing out now in Social Security. That would be an average of $308 per \nmonth.\n  The Social Security trustees put it straight out there. They have two \nideas to shore up Social Security right now: One is to immediately and \npermanently increase the combined payroll tax on employees and \nemployers from 12.4 percent to 15.01 percent. That would be a one-fifth \nincrease in the payroll taxes that are, in the norm, being paid today.\n  The other alternative they suggested is to cut core benefits right \nnow by $200 per month. They said that would do it--$200 per month in \ncuts to Social Security checks.\n  I don't think anyone in America believes that is feasible or even \ndesirable--either of those options. So what can we do? We can act now. \nWe can reform Social Security without cutting core benefits and without \nincreasing taxes on people who are working today.\n  I introduced a new version of my Defend and Save Social Security Act \nafter the 2012 report came out from the trustees, and it covers the 75 \nyear window and the shortfall of $8.6 trillion which is estimated, and \nit doesn't raise taxes on the people working today.\n  Here is what it does: It increases the age of retirement very \ngradually. When I introduced my bill just last year, it wouldn't have \naffected anyone who was 58 years old or older. But in just that 1 year, \nbecause the deficits in Social Security payments going out have \noccurred, today it is 59 years of age. No one 59 years of age or older \nwould be affected. For everyone else it would be a very slow increase \nof 3 months per year. For instance, the normal retirement age would \nreach 67--going from 66--by 2019, 68 by 2023, 69 by 2027, and 70 by \n2031. The early retirement age would be increased to 63 by 2019 and 64 \nby 2023.\n  The second point: The COLA--the cost-of-living adjustment--would be \nreduced slightly when inflation is 1 percent or more. Inflation has \naveraged about 2.5 percent, so there would be a COLA, but it would be \nabout $12 less if inflation is kicking in above 1 percent.\n  There would be no core benefit cut at all, just a slightly smaller \nCOLA increase if inflation goes up, and then we would have a secure \nsystem. It would be a system that would last 75 years. We would not \nhave the $8.6 trillion added to our deficit and no core benefits would \nbe cut.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 more minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, let me just say that is not the only \nthing we could do. We could change the cost\n\n[[Page S7131]]\n\nof living to the chained consumer price index. That would be OK. It \nwouldn't get us as much of a deficit reduction over 75 years--a chained \nCPI--but it would get us at least into a better position if we \nincreased the age rate.\n  I just want to give a note of history. When President Reagan was \nfacing the same issue, and the Senate was one-party dominated and the \nHouse the other, he got together with House Speaker Tip O'Neill, and \nthey formed a commission which started the increase in age that we have \ntoday because people were living longer and they were working longer. \nWe can do the same thing President Reagan and Tip O'Neill did, because \nour government is a similar configuration, by coming together and \nacknowledging that people are living longer and are working longer.\n  We can make accommodations for people who are in particularly \nphysically strenuous jobs. I think all of us understand people in those \njobs may not be able to work as long. We can do those things and fix \nthis issue in a responsible way. Let's do it now. One more year is \ngoing to make it that much worse. We have added $2.1 trillion to the \ndeficit in just 1 year. We can do this.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona for giving me the \nextra 2 minutes to say let's do it now. In fact, the Senator from \nArizona has been a cosponsor of my bill to fix Social Security. We \ncannot address the fiscal cliff without talking about entitlements and \nmandatory spending, which is 56 percent of our spending. Anybody can do \nthe math on that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, first, let me thank my colleague from Texas \nfor her leadership on this and so many other issues that we have worked \non over the years. One of my regrets in leaving the Senate is that I \nwill not be able to work with her, and she has said the same thing \nabout me. We will be off doing something else, but we are not going to \ngive up on some of the fights we have been engaged in during these \nyears.\n  I want to just begin where my colleague left off, about the meaning \nof this fiscal cliff and what is being proposed as alternatives to \ngoing over the fiscal cliff. I was interested this week that the \nPresident has embarked on what one newspaper referred to as ``the \nfiscal cliff campaign trail.'' We have seen the pictures. He is out \nspeaking as if the campaign were still going on, and the centerpiece of \nhis pitch--and I heard him say it on TV again last night--is that the \nHouse of Representatives should pass a bill that was passed in the \nSenate related to 2001 and 2003 income taxes.\n  The President is a constitutional scholar, and he served in the \nSenate. He knows that can't be done. It is unconstitutional. The \nConstitution requires that all revenue measures must be initiated in \nthe House of Representatives. That is one reason the bill got through \nthe Senate, because everybody knew it couldn't pass. It was simply a \nstatement by our Democratic colleagues. It wasn't serious legislation. \nBut if we look at the legislation itself, we begin to see why \nRepublicans are so opposed to what the President is proposing--because \nof the job-killing policies contained in that bill the President would \nask the House of Representatives to pass.\n  What are we talking about specifically? I don't like to get into this \nkind of detail very often, but somebody has to at some point just \ndiscuss the actual facts of what this bill would do. It would raise the \nmarginal income tax rates from 33 percent to 35 percent in the fourth \nbracket, and in the fifth bracket from 36 percent to 39.6 percent--\nalmost 40 percent.\n  Well, what is the problem with that? Let's start with the fact that \n53 percent of all income from so-called flowthrough businesses is \nsubject to these higher tax rates. That is because most small \nbusinesses are not corporations. They are called flowthrough entities--\nsubchapter S corporations, limited partnerships, and those kinds of \nentities that pay their income taxes as if they were individuals. So \nthey are governed by the top two marginal rates.\n  Well, they are governed by all the marginal rates of the income-tax \ncode. So when we raise those rates, we are raising taxes on much of \nsmall business income. In fact, almost 1 million small business \nowners--940,000 to be exact--would be hit by the higher taxes caused by \nthe President's proposal. That is an average, by the way, of well over \n18,000 per State of the Union.\n  What else would it do? It goes directly to business taxes, such as \ncapital gains taxes. It raises that from 15 to 20 percent, which is why \nwe are seeing a lot of activity right now taking advantage of the lower \nrate, and we are going to find virtually none of that after this rate \nis increased to 20 percent. It is one of the reasons we will go back \ninto recession, as the Congressional Budget Office has pointed out.\n  It also raises taxes on qualified dividends from 15 percent, where it \nis today. The problem of raising taxes on qualified dividends is, as \nthe Wall Street Journal has reported over and over again, that \ncompanies that are paying dividends are dumping them all right now so \nthey will all be paid out before the end of the year.\n  If you are a retired teacher or a retired fireman or have a pension \nand you are counting on your investments to pay dividends in the \nfuture, forget it. Once the dividends rate goes back up, corporations \nare not going to plow their earnings back into dividends to the \nshareholders as they do today. But these don't even tell the whole \nstory because, of course, once you are taxed as a corporation--and this \npertains just to the corporations, not the flowthrough entities I \nmentioned--you are doubled-taxed if you also pay a dividend or you have \na capital gain. You have to pay not only your corporate income tax but \nthe tax on the gain, or the individual pays the tax on the dividends \nthat are paid out by the corporation.\n  So we already have the fourth highest integrated capital gains and \ndividends rates in the industrialized world at over 50 percent. Why \nwould we want to make ourselves even less competitive by raising these \ntaxes? We would fall even further behind our international competitors \nwith the second highest capital gains rate, 56.7 percent.\n  Talk about a blow to the economy--which is the way the President put \nit 2 years ago when he decided not to raise all of these rates. Of \ncourse, we all agreed with him on that. It would be an even bigger blow \nto the economy to do so today. Our growth rate today is less than it \nwas 2 years ago when the President himself said these very policies he \nis advocating would be a blow to the economy.\n  The last thing I would mention, everybody knows about the death tax. \nWe have forgotten about what would happen with the death tax. The death \ntax rate would go to 55 percent, up from 35 percent today. A lot of \npeople think 35 percent is way too much and would like to see it \neliminated. I would. But think about this. You would only have $1 \nmillion of the farm or the business or the estate exempted from the \ntax. After that, over half--55 percent--of everything you have worked \nfor all your years would have to go to Uncle Sam, leaving your heirs \nfrequently with the requirement of selling off all or part of the \nbusiness or the farm, whatever it is, in order to pay for the estate \ntax.\n  It would increase the number of estates hit by the death tax from \n3,600 this year to over 55,000 next year. There would be 24 times more \nfarm estates that would be hit, 13 times more small businesses, 15 \ntimes more taxable estates.\n  This is not good for our economy, and it is not good for our \nfamilies. The estate tax raises about 1 percent of all the tax revenue. \nTo hurt the small businesses again by raising this death tax rate is \njust unconscionable.\n  People need to stop and think. This is not just about hitting the \nrich; this is about hitting small business folks, the very people we \nanticipate will create the jobs coming out of the economy.\n  Let's turn to job creation issue for just a second. Ernst & Young, \nthe respected accounting firm, released a study recently that estimated \nthe long-run effects of a plan very similar to the Senate bill that the \nPresident is advocating--the top two rates increasing, combined with \nthe ObamaCare tax rates taking effect, all of this together, that study \nfound that 710,000 jobs would be lost just as a result of this, 710,000 \njobs.\n  The President likes to brag every now and then that we have an \nincrease\n\n[[Page S7132]]\n\nof 100,000 or 115,000 jobs in a month. Here is 710,000 jobs they say \nwould be lost just from the increase in these tax rates. Our gross \ndomestic product would decline by $200 billion, and wages would fall by \n1.8 percent.\n  I know these statistics make our eyes glaze over sometimes, but these \nare the facts; these are the results. And poorer families and a weak \neconomy and a lot of joblessness are the result.\n  To put these numbers into perspective, 42 business organizations \nrepresenting tens of millions of American employees--including those in \nwholesaling, air conditioning, retail, franchising industries, and \nothers--recently sent a letter to the congressional leadership urging \nCongress not to raise income taxes during negotiations over the fiscal \ncliff and instead to pursue comprehensive progrowth tax reform.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in the Record at \nthe end of my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KYL. I will conclude by quoting one sentence from it.\n\n       We call on Congress to avoid raising marginal tax rates on \n     employers, either as part of negotiations over the fiscal \n     cliff, or as part of a larger effort to reform the tax code. \n     Instead, Congress should seek to enact comprehensive tax \n     reform that simplifies the tax code and encourages economic \n     growth for both passthrough businesses and corporations.\n\n  As I said, the passthrough entities are those small businesses, and \nthe corporations are those that pay under the corporate tax rate. So I \nthink the data, as well as the voices from employers around the \ncountry, make it clear that the Senate bill, combined with the tax \nincreases from ObamaCare, would have a devastating effect on economic \ngrowth and our ability to create jobs.\n  What should we do instead, just to summarize? I think the better \napproach is the one the Republicans have been proposing. We actually \nhave a plan, as opposed to the administration's plan--the only part of \nwhich I can discern is to pass the Senate bill, which raises tax rates. \nOur plan is to avoid the tax rate increases that would otherwise \nautomatically occur on January 1 and commit to tax and entitlement \nreform that raises revenue through economic growth, eliminates wasteful \ncredits and deductions and loopholes, and cuts spending in the future.\n  Recall that, in 1986, President Reagan signed into law a historic tax \nreform bill that lowered corporate and individual tax rates and \neliminated a lot of loopholes. It wasn't a perfect bill, but the 1986 \nreform package can serve as a guide for revenue-neutral tax reform \nmoving forward. Cutting our corporate tax rate--which had a combined \nrate of 39.2 percent as the highest in the industrialized world--would \ndramatically boost American competitiveness and improve our standard of \nliving.\n  Many studies have found that lowering our corporate rate will \nincrease growth, including one which found that cutting the corporate \ntax rate by 10 percentage points can increase the annual growth rate by \naround 1.1 percent. Since we are only a little over 1.1 percent as it \nis, cutting it by that much would have a dramatic impact.\n  Comprehensive tax reform also means lowering tax rates on \nindividuals, including the 95 percent of passthrough entities that file \nas individuals.\n  The Reagan tax reform also provided relief for businesses that are \nnot structured as C corporations. During Ronald Reagan's 8 years, 20 \nmillion new jobs were created. More specifically, after tax reform \nbecame law, inflation and unemployment fell.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed an \nadditional 1 minute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KYL. If we are interested in growth, Congress must avoid raising \ntax rates in the lameduck session and instead pursue tax reform, which \nsends a signal to the world that we are open for business.\n  Short of going off the fiscal cliff entirely, passing the Senate tax \nincrease instead of pursuing these progrowth and fiscal reform ideas is \nthe worst idea on the table. Raising the top two marginal rates would \nreverse longstanding tax policy and hit nearly 1 million business \nowners in the process, and it would eliminate over 700,000 jobs.\n  So if the President is genuinely interested in economic growth and \nhigher tax revenues that come from it, he should drop his demands for \nthe Senate bill and listen to the growing bipartisan consensus that \nhigher taxes hurt growth and lower taxes help create jobs and \nprosperity.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                November 27, 2012.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Capitol Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Capitol Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Hon. John Boehner,\n     Speaker of the House, U.S. House of Representatives, Capitol, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. House of Representatives, Capitol, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Congressional Leadership: As organizations \n     representing millions of pass-through businesses employing \n     tens of millions of workers, we strongly urge Congress to \n     pursue comprehensive tax reform that lowers rates on all \n     forms of business income while enacting significant \n     entitlement reforms that put the federal budget on a \n     sustainable fiscal path.\n       Congress faces two fiscal challenges in the near future. \n     First, it will need to take action on the ``fiscal cliff'' of \n     expiring tax provisions and automatic spending cuts. Second, \n     it will need to raise the debt ceiling.\n       In taking on these challenges, we call on Congress to avoid \n     raising marginal tax rates on employers, either as part of \n     negotiations over the fiscal cliff, or as part of larger \n     effort to reform the tax code. Instead, Congress should seek \n     to enact comprehensive tax reform that simplifies the tax \n     code and encourages economic growth for both pass-through \n     businesses and corporations.\n       Raising rates on individuals and employers will harm hiring \n     and investment now and into the future. According to the \n     Congressional Budget Office, allowing top tax rates to rise \n     to their pre-2001 levels and beyond will result in 200,000 \n     fewer jobs early next year. Ernst & Young has estimated that \n     the impact of these higher tax rates will be to reduce long-\n     term employment levels by more than 700,000, while also \n     lowering overall investment and suppressing wage levels.\n       The prospect of higher marginal tax rates is already having \n     an adverse impact on the economy. According to the National \n     Federation of Independent Businesses, two-thirds of business \n     owners cite the uncertainty over future fiscal policy as \n     making it more difficult for them to grow their businesses \n     and increase employment. At the same time, the rate of \n     business creation is at its lowest level in two decades.\n       Although some have asked Congress to enact corporate-only \n     reform in the coming year, there is no economic or political \n     justification for reform that lowers marginal tax rates on \n     corporations while raising either marginal or effective tax \n     rates on the 95 percent of businesses structured as pass-\n     through entities who employ more than half of the U.S. \n     workforce.\n       Finally, we are eager to see Congress enact permanent, \n     comprehensive tax reform, but this alone will not solve the \n     long-term fiscal imbalance. The Trustees to Social Security \n     and Medicare have made clear that, absent reform, these \n     programs are unsustainable. While Congress should commit to \n     tackling comprehensive tax reform, it is also imperative that \n     Congress agree to develop a long-term plan to address \n     America's entitlement programs as well.\n       Simply put, we need to reform our tax code and we need to \n     reform our entitlements.\n           Sincerely,\n         Air Conditioning Contractors of America, American Council \n           of Engineering Companies, American Farm Bureau \n           Federation', American Foundry Society, \n           American Supply Association, American Trucking \n           Association, AMT--The Association For Manufacturing \n           Technology, Associated Builders and Contractors, \n           Associated Equipment Distributors, Associated General \n           Contractors of America, Automotive Aftermarket Industry \n           Association, Financial Executives International, Food \n           Marketing Institute, Heating, Air-conditioning & \n           Refrigeration Distributors International, Independent \n           Insurance Agents & Brokers of America, International \n           Foodservice Distributors Association, International \n           Franchise Association, Metals Service Center Institute, \n           National Apartment Association, National Association of \n           Convenience Stores, National Association of Wholesaler-\n           Distributors.\n         National Automobile Dealers Association, National Beer \n           Wholesalers Association, National Electrical \n           Contractors Association, National Federation of \n           Independent Business, National Grocers Association, \n           National Lumber and Building Material Dealers \n           Association,\n\n[[Page S7133]]\n\n           National Marine Manufacturers Association, National \n           Multi Housing Council, National Restaurant Association, \n           National Retail Federation, National Roofing \n           Contractors Association, National Small Business \n           Association, National Utility Contractors Association, \n           Printing Industries of America, Professional Beauty \n           Association, S Corporation Association, Service Station \n           Dealers of America & Allied Trades, Tire Industry \n           Association, Truck Renting and Leasing Association, \n           United States Chamber of Commerce, Wine & Spirits \n           Wholesalers of America.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I appreciate Senator Kyl's comments, and \nI share them. We are going to miss the most knowledgeable fiscal tax \nexpert in the Senate, and his long career includes time on the Finance \nCommittee. I thank Senator Kyl.\n  I want to express some reservations about the negotiations that have \nbeen going on, as I understand it from reading the paper, involving the \nfiscal cliff.\n  Over the last 2 years, Congress and the President have held an \nendless series of negotiations. There have been Gangs of 6 and 8, a \nsupercommittee of 12, talks at the Blair House and the White House. But \nthe only thing these secret talks have produced is a government that \nskips from one crisis to the next. Everything has been tried but open \nproduction of a 10-year plan from this Senate that is required by law, \nthat would allow us to openly debate and discuss concretely the \nfinancial challenges we face today.\n  All of this secrecy allows the President to position himself as being \nin favor of a balanced plan--which is what he says: I favor a balanced \nplan--while the only comprehensive proposal, to my knowledge, he has \nactually laid out was in January or February of this year when he laid \nout his budget. Of course, it was voted down unanimously. In both the \nHouse and the Senate not a single person voted for it. But he did lay \nout a financial plan for the country. He put it on paper.\n  Basically, it increases taxes to fuel more spending. That is what the \nplan did. It increased taxes $1.8 trillion and increased spending $1.4 \ntrillion over the agreement we just reached under the Budget Control \nAct in August, a year ago.\n  So we reached agreement on 10 years of spending limits in August, a \nyear ago. Then January, 6 months later, he proposes a budget that would \nincrease taxes $1.8 trillion and spending that would increase another \n$1.4 trillion over that BCA baseline: tax and spend. Not taxes to \nreduce deficits but taxes to fund new spending. That is why the budget \nputs us on track to have $25 trillion in total debt at the end of 10 \nyears--another almost $10 trillion in debt added to the current debt \nlevel.\n  Insofar as I can see, that tax-and-spend policy remains his goal \ntoday. The White House isn't planning to raise taxes to reduce the \ndeficit. It raises taxes, under their plan, to expand government. That \nis not acceptable. I don't believe Congress will accept such a deal if \nthat is what is going on in these secret negotiations.\n  President Obama campaigned on tax increases just on the wealthy, just \non raising their rates, just only $800 billion in tax increases. But \nnow the White House is demanding $1.6 trillion in tax increases. Don't \nthe American people have a right to see where those taxes fall, who \nthey will impact, and how much they are?\n  Shouldn't the President lay out his plan? He is the President of the \nUnited States and the only person who represents everybody in the \ncountry. Will that remain a secret? Will it just be revealed to us on \nthe eve of Christmas or the eve of the new calendar year? We will be \nasked to vote for or to ratify like lemmings, I suppose.\n  The White House has repeatedly asserted they believe in $2.50 in \nspending cuts for every $1 in tax hikes, which does not reflect \nsufficient spending cuts. But if the White House now wants $1.6 \ntrillion in new taxes, where are the $4 trillion in spending cuts? Have \nthose been laid out? Do we know what they would be? And this is over 10 \nyears. These spending cuts would be very achievable if we put our minds \nto it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to have the full 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank my colleagues for their courtesy.\n  In fact, the President has given speeches calling for more spending. \nOn Tuesday, he gave a speech in which he said he wants to use the tax \nhikes to ``invest in training, education, science, and research.''\n  When you are in a deep hole and you are borrowing almost 40 cents of \nevery dollar you spend, shouldn't you constrain yourself and not start \nnew programs? Or if you start a new, needed program, shouldn't you \nreduce some less valuable program to pay for it instead of just taxing \nto create more programs?\n  Not once in the speech did he discuss entitlements. That is the \nlargest item in our government, entitlements. Not once did the \nPresident of the United States discuss with the American people the \nproblem that Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid are on an \nunsustainable path and are at great risk. Shouldn't the President \nhonestly talk to the American people about that?\n  He didn't discuss our $16 trillion debt and how the Debt Commission \nhe appointed indicates that we are on an unsustainable path, heading to \na fiscal crisis. He did not discuss the economic catastrophe that could \noccur if we don't get off this unsustainable path.\n  The President should lead on these things. I don't think this is a \npartisan complaint. I am saying the President of the United States \nshould be discussing with the American people the great danger of our \ntime: the debt.\n  The President will go out to the press and use the buzz words that \nsay he has a balanced plan or a responsible path to deficit reduction. \nBut where are the spending reductions? What is the plan?\n  It seems to me the plan is to talk in general, to meet in secret day \nafter day, week after week, the deadlines getting closer, the fiscal \ncliff getting closer. Then, under threat of panic, force through some \ndeal that maintains the status quo: more taxes, more spending, more \ndebt. And it will be presented to the Senate in a way that, if it is \nnot adopted immediately, the country will be in great fiscal \ndanger. This process needs to be taken out of the shadows. We need \npublic debate, and then people would know the facts that are now being \nhidden from us, hidden from Members of Congress. We don't know what is \ngoing on. The latest article in Politico today said the deal--the so-\ncalled deal has been negotiated by the Speaker of the House and the \nPresident. Not even Harry Reid is in the meetings, apparently--\ncertainly not the Members of the Senate or the Members of the House of \nRepresentatives.\n\n  If we had a public debate, people would discover that according to \nthe CBO, mandatory spending is going to increase nearly 90 percent over \nthe next 10 years. To get the country under control requires some real \ntough focus, but it does not mean we are going to have to cut spending \ndramatically, just reduce the growth of spending. Expenses on welfare \nare particularly interesting. Mandatory spending, that is, the \nentitlement programs of all kinds, is set to automatically increase 90 \npercent over the next decade. That is over half of our budget. We \nalready spend $2.3 trillion on mandatory costs today in our budget--\nthis year we will spend 2.3 trillion--but we will spend $4.12 trillion \nin the 10th year from now. Those are the projected growth patterns we \nare on. This is a huge increase, and we do not have the money.\n  People would also learn from public debate that welfare costs are now \nthe single largest item in the budget, exceeding Medicare--larger than \nMedicare, larger than Social Security, larger than the defense budget. \nWe spend enough on these poverty programs to send every household \nbeneath the poverty line in America a check for $60,000, each family. \nThat is how much we are spending. The President's plan apparently would \nnot deal with that at all. Indeed, the Budget Control Act of 15 months \nago that was passed explicitly failed to address some of the biggest \nitems in that budget.\n  I do not see how we can support a plan that does not at least begin \nto reform these programs and improve their operation. Is this going on \nin the secret talks? Are they talking about it or, like the Budget \nControl Act, is this off-\n\n[[Page S7134]]\n\nlimits, not to be discussed? Will welfare reform be a part of the \nframework of the settlement that will be dropped on the Senate? We do \nnot know.\n  Meanwhile, the President demands more taxes and refuses to do \nanything about waste, really. I have not seen any strong management \nleadership from this White House that gives me confidence that we \nshould send more money. There are lavish conferences, duplicative \nprograms, billions in refundable tax credits being mailed every year to \nillegal aliens or children not even in the United States--billions from \ntheir own department, the reports tell us. No one is managing this \ngovernment effectively. Why should the American people send one more \ndime in taxes to Washington when we will not reform and manage the \nmoney we are already getting from them? The American people should not \nsend more money to this dysfunctional government. They should insist \nthat we fix what is going on here first.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to share \nthese remarks. I ask for 1 additional minute to wrap up.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank my colleagues.\n  I would say I am concerned about the nature of these secret talks, \nthe fact that the Senate is really not participating. From the reports, \nit is only the Speaker and the President of the United States \ndiscussing it, and that appears to be--from what I picked up--to be \ntrue. Apparently, the majority leader is not intimately involved, the \nchairman of the Budget Committee is not involved, and the chairman of \nthe Finance Committee is not involved. These are Democratic leaders in \nthe Senate, certainly not Republican leaders in the Senate.\n  The Senate is a great institution. We ought to be engaged, and the \nengagement of the Senate allows the American people to know what is \nhappening. They are entitled to that. I really believe we can do \nbetter. We must do better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I return to the floor of the \nSenate to urge all of us here to extend the production tax credit for \nwind energy. This is a crucial tax credit that supports an industry \nthat employs literally tens of thousands of workers across our entire \ncountry. Our failure in the Congress to quickly extend this job-\ncreating credit has already halted further development and jeopardized \nthe future of this industry and the good-paying jobs that come with it.\n  The PTC, as it is known, the production tax credit, has been a major \ndriver of wind power development because it literally leverages \nbillions of dollars in investment, which then in turn creates thousands \nof jobs. But here in the Congress we have gone back and forth \nrepeatedly between extending it and retiring it. This on-again/off-\nagain status has contributed to a boom-bust cycle that threatens the \nfuture of this industry and our energy security in turn. It is time for \nus to act, act now, and extend the PTC so the wind industry and its \nemployees can have a secure and prosperous future.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to talking about your State, New \nMexico. You know I come to the floor every day to talk about the \nimportance of the PTC, and I focus on an individual State when I come \nto the floor. Today I would like to talk about New Jersey.\n  New Jersey's wind industry will suffer without an extension of the \nPTC. Its industry is in the early stages of development, but the Garden \nState is already making real progress in becoming a manufacturing \ncenter for wind. While it is a manufacturing center that is building \nthe turbines and blades, it is also taking a leading role in developing \ncoastal wind power and then harnessing the offshore wind potential we \nknow exists in the oceans off of New Jersey. An environmental review \ninitiative by the Interior Department has paved the way for the sale of \nwind energy leases off the coast of New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, and \nVirginia in the Outer Continental Shelf. Several coastal projects are \nunder way in the Garden State, including in South Jersey off the coast \nof Cape May, down here in the southern part of New Jersey. New Jersey \nis also home to the first coastal wind farm in the United States, the \nJersey Atlantic Wind Farm. There are five turbines at that wind farm. \nThey are producing a total of 7.5 megawatts, which is enough energy to \npower 2,000 homes.\n  Like my Home State, like the home State of the Presiding Officer, New \nJersey knows we need an all-of-the-above energy strategy to improve our \nenergy security. My colleagues from New Jersey, Senator Menendez and \nSenator Lautenberg, have been fighting to accelerate the transition to \nrenewable domestic energy. Both have been champions for extending \ncrucial tax credits such as the PTC. They know these credits help both \nNew Jersey consumers and New Jersey businesses install and utilize \nenergy from the wind.\n  The wind energy industry supports close to 500 New Jersey jobs, many \nof which are located at the 9 manufacturing facilities that make \ncomponents for wind turbines. Those facilities are located in the green \ncircles shown here on the map of New Jersey. The current level of wind \nproduction in New Jersey has helped the State reduce its carbon \nemissions by some 1,500 metric tons every year.\n  I want to return to the point I make every day I come to the floor to \ntalk about the production tax credit. If we do not extend it, the \nmanufacturing sector in New Jersey and many other States will literally \nwither. If we do not extend the PTC, we risk sending our energy jobs \noverseas. This is flatout unacceptable.\n  The wind production tax credit has strong support from a broad array \nof industry groups. Let me share some of those groups with my \ncolleagues and with the viewers. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has \nendorsed the extension, as well as the Governors' Wind Energy \nCoalition, the National Governors Association, and the American Farm \nBureau Federation, among a number of other groups that support this \nextension.\n  Think of it this way: Wind energy is made-in-America energy that \nbolsters U.S. manufacturing. It creates good-paying American jobs, and \nit puts us on the path to energy independence. I urge my colleagues, I \nask my colleagues of both parties to stand with me and stand for \nAmerican manufacturing and made-in-America energy. Our wind energy \nindustry and our energy security are depending on it. We need to extend \nthe PTC as soon as possible. It is that simple. The PTC equals jobs. \nLet's pass it as soon as possible.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of the National \nDefense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013. I wish to commend the \nwork of my colleagues on the committee, particularly Chairman Levin, \nwho is here, and Ranking Member McCain, for their incredible diligence, \ndedication, and commitment to the men and women of our Armed Forces.\n  For 50 consecutive years, the Senate has passed a Defense \nauthorization bill, and I hope very much that we will soon be able to \nsend the President a bill for his signature consistent with that record \nof faithful service to those who\n\n[[Page S7135]]\n\nserve us so faithfully. We owe it to our servicemembers and to the \nNation to quickly but very deliberately pass this legislation and send \nit forward to the President. We made tough decisions putting this bill \ntogether--especially in these difficult economic times--but I am \nconfident this bill provides a budget that allows the DOD to combat \ncurrent threats, plan for future threats, and to provide for the \nwelfare of our extraordinary men and women in uniform.\n  I wish to note a few issues in this legislation.\n  First, we have endeavored to make improvements to the Military \nLending Act, which Congress passed in 2006 in order to protect Active-\nDuty servicemembers and their families from some types of high-cost \nloans and unfair credit practices. The Military Lending Act imposed a \n36-percent annual percentage rate cap on certain types of consumer \ncredit extended to servicemembers. Our intention was to protect Active-\nDuty servicemembers and their families from high-cost loans and unfair \ncredit practices. Unfortunately, lenders have been finding ways to \ncircumvent these regulations. For example, some payday lenders have \nmade superficial changes to the structure of their loans, styling them \nas ``open-end'' credit or setting the terms slightly longer than the \nregulations to get around the rules under the Department of Defense of \nwhat constitutes ``consumer credit.''\n  I am pleased that provisions I added to the underlying bill address \nsome of these problems with targeted changes to improve how this law is \nimplemented. In particular, it removes definitional loopholes to ensure \nthat payday and car title loans, whether structured as closed-ended or \nopen-ended credit, are subject to the 36-percent cap and other \nprotections of the MLA. Let me underscore the 36-percent cap. We are \ntalking about a very generous rate of return on these loans to lenders, \nparticularly in the context of very low rates across the economy. It \nalso requires the DOD to review its MLA rules periodically and to \nconsult with financial regulators biannually to determine if new credit \nproducts are harming servicemembers and should be covered by the \nMilitary Lending Act protections.\n  The bill has been strengthened by the recent passage of an amendment \noffered by Senator Mark Udall to remove a provision in the Senate Armed \nServices Committee-reported bill that would have limited the ability of \nthe Department of Defense to purchase alternative fuels, such as \nadvanced biofuels. I voted against this provision in the committee and \njoined my colleagues in urging a vote for this amendment. Reducing our \ndependence on oil requires a smart, balanced, and responsible energy \npolicy, one that involves all government agencies, including the \nDepartment of Defense. I am pleased that the Department of Defense will \nretain the flexibility to pursue alternative fuel technologies that not \nonly help them achieve their mission but also help our country reduce \nour dependence on oil.\n  In addition, Senator Hagan has offered an amendment to remove a \nprovision that would prohibit the DOD from being able to enter into \ncontracts for the planning, construction, or retrofitting of plants and \nrefineries to produce advanced biofuels. I opposed this provision in \nthe committee and encourage my colleagues to support Senator Hagan's \namendment.\n  I am also working on a few amendments I would like to mention. One \nwould provide further consumer credit protections for servicemembers, \nanother would limit the increases of out-of-pocket prescription drug \ncosts, and a third would create a pilot program to allow nonprofits to \napply for grants to rehabilitate and modify homes for disabled \nveterans.\n  My amendment No. 3014 would further improve the Military Lending Act \nprovisions in the underlying bill by strengthening its enforcement. \nDuring the past 5 years, we have learned that enforcement rules \nprovided in the MLA are not up to the task. Currently, if a lender \nviolates the Military Lending Act, it is a criminal misdemeanor, with \nviolators to be fined as provided for in title XVIII or up to 1 year \nimprisonment or both. Criminal liability attaches only for knowingly \nviolating the statute.\n  My amendment will clarify that all Federal agencies that enforce \nFederal credit laws can enforce the Military Lending Act. In addition, \nit will ensure that State attorneys general and State credit regulators \nwho license and supervise many of the lenders who lend to our \nservicemembers and their families can enforce the Federal law \nprotections provided by the Military Lending Act. I believe our service \nmen and women need a full panoply of protection not just from the \nDepartment of Defense but from every Federal agency involved in these \nissues, including State and local agencies. I honestly believe that \nState and local officials, particularly where there are major \ninstallations, vigorously want to protect the rights and the benefits \nof our men and women in uniform, and they should have that opportunity.\n  Comprehensive and fair enforcement of the Military Lending Act is \ncritical to Active-Duty servicemembers and their families. My amendment \nis supported by the Fleet Reserve Association, the Military Officers \nAssociation of America, the National Association of Consumer Advocates, \nthe Military Justice Project, the National Military Family Association, \nAmericans for Financial Reform, the Center for Responsible Lending, the \nConsumer Federation of America, the National Consumer Law Center on \nbehalf of its low-income clients, and the U.S. PIRG. All of these \nagencies recognize the need to protect our men and women in uniform.\n  I have joined with Senators Rubio, McCaskill, and Whitehouse to \nintroduce amendment No. 3017 to curb the out-of-pocket prescription \ndrug costs proposed for TRICARE beneficiaries. The Department of \nDefense has proposed an increase in prescription drug copayments for \nTRICARE beneficiaries. In some cases, copayments could almost double or \neven triple. For example, under the proposal, out-of-pocket costs for a \nbrandname drug picked up at a local pharmacy would more than double, \nincreasing from $12 to $26. Ensuring the fiscal soundness of TRICARE is \ncritical, but we should limit the burden on beneficiaries in our \nefforts to shore up the program.\n\n  This amendment would curb the out-of-pocket prescription drug costs \nproposed for TRICARE beneficiaries. For instance, instead of paying $26 \nfor a brandname drug, a TRICARE beneficiary would pay $17 at a retail \npharmacy, a $5 increase from last year as opposed to a $14 increase. \nDOD would be prohibited from instituting dramatic increases in \nprescription drug copayments in future years. Copayments could only \nincrease at the rate of the annual cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA.\n  To protect beneficiaries from out-of-pocket increases, the amendment \nproposes to achieve the necessary savings by requiring the Secretary to \nenroll beneficiaries age 65 and older with maintenance medication--that \nis, medications for chronic conditions--in a 5-year mail order pharmacy \npilot program. Beneficiaries would be eligible to opt out of the mail \norder program after 1 year if they felt it did not adequately meet \ntheir needs.\n  To ensure TRICARE beneficiaries have access to their prescription \nmedications, they would be able to secure an initial 30-day fill at a \nlocal retail pharmacy. And the amendment ensures that they will not be \ndenied a maintenance medication at a retail pharmacy if they ever find \nthemselves running low and in need of a quick refill.\n  The amendment would expressly prohibit the Secretary from including \nmedications for acute care needs in the mail order pilot program, as \nwell as medications dispensed to residents of long-term care \nfacilities. The Secretary would also have the discretion to exempt \nother medications and other populations.\n  This amendment is supported by the Military Coalition, a group of 30 \norganizations representing more than 5.5 million members of the uniform \nservices--active, Reserve, retired, survivors, veterans--and their \nfamilies.\n  My third amendment, No. 3165, which is identical to the Housing \nAssistance for Veterans Act that I recently introduced, would create a \nnew pilot program at the Department of Housing and Urban Development \nthat would provide home rehabilitation and modification for veterans \nwho are low income or disabled and who own their homes or are living in \nthe owner-occupied home of a family member.\n\n[[Page S7136]]\n\n  This amendment fills a crucial gap because it would serve all \nveterans with disabilities, regardless of the severity of the \ndisability and whether the disability is service connected or not.\n  With this amendment, eligible veterans would have the opportunity to \nrenovate and modify their existing homes by installing wheelchair \nramps, widening doors, re-equipping rooms, and making necessary \nadditions and adjustments to existing structures--all so these homes \nare more suitable and safer for our veterans.\n  I hope we can work together to consider these amendments, and other \namendments that have been proposed by my colleagues.\n  As for the underlying bill, I wish to point out a few more of its \nhighlights.\n  The bill authorizes a 1.7-percent across-the-board pay raise and \nreauthorizes over 30 types of bonuses and special payments for our men \nand women in uniform.\n  It authorizes the Secretary of Defense to carry out a research \nprogram with community partners to enhance DOD efforts in research, \ntreatment, education, and outreach on mental health, substance use \ndisorders, and traumatic brain injury in Guard and Reserve members, \ntheir families, and their caregivers--a provision which I worked on \nwith Senator Ayotte to have included in this bill. We have an \nincredible problem with respect to returning veterans, active-duty \npersonnel, and their families in addressing their mental health \nchallenges, and unless we fully engage all the resources across this \ncountry, we will not be able to successfully meet the needs of these \nyoung men and women. We hope this amendment will help in that regard.\n  The legislation also extends authorities to continue several ``train \nand equip'' programs to assist foreign militaries in counterterrorism \nand counternarcotics missions. This is one of the emerging and critical \nroles that in the future we must embrace and support.\n  Additionally, the legislation authorizes $5.7 billion for the \nAfghanistan Security Forces Fund to build the capacity of the Afghan \nArmy and police so those forces can continue to take the security lead \nthroughout Afghanistan. Once again, this is a central foundation to our \nplans to withdraw the vast majority of our forces by 2014.\n  This year once again I had the honor of serving as the chairman of \nthe Seapower Subcommittee, alongside Senator Wicker, my colleague from \nMississippi, the ranking member. Working together, our subcommittee \nfocused on the needs of the Navy, the Marine Corps, and strategic \nmobility forces. We put particular emphasis on supporting marine and \nnaval forces engaged in combat operations, improving efficiencies, and \napplying the savings to higher priority programs.\n  Specifically, the bill includes the required funding for two \nVirginia-class submarines, provides multiyear procurement authority to \nthe Navy to purchase the next block of submarines, authorizes the Navy \nto use incremental funding to buy an additional Virginia-class \nsubmarine in fiscal year 2014, and provides an additional $777.7 \nmillion in advance procurement for that second boat in 2014.\n  The bill also approves the funding for other major programs, \nincluding the DDG-1000, the Aircraft Carrier Replacement Program, the \nDDG-51 Aegis destroyer program, the Littoral Combat Ship, the Joint \nHigh Speed Vessel, and the P-8 maritime patrol aircraft.\n  I am particularly pleased about the funding for the Virginia-class \nsubmarines and the DDG-1000, which so many Rhode Islanders help to \nbuild.\n  We also included language that would permit the Navy to use multiyear \nprocurement authority to buy the V-22 Osprey aircraft and the Arleigh \nBurke-class destroyers so we can procure these platforms as efficiently \nas possible.\n  I want to offer my particular thanks to Senator Wicker, the other \nmembers of the Seapower Subcommittee, and our staffs who have done an \nextraordinary job through their diligence, their dedication, and their \nprofound commitment to the men and women, particularly, of the Navy and \nthe Marine Corps.\n  We have a good bill before the Senate. I urge adoption of the \namendments I have discussed, and I would urge very quickly and very \ntimely the passage of the legislation so we can once again send the \nDefense authorization bill to the President for his signature.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/29/senate-section/article/S7136-1", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7136]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown of Ohio).

The senior Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, before Senator Reed leaves the floor, I \nwant to first thank him for his comments about myself and Senator \nMcCain and the other members of our committee. Senator Reed of Rhode \nIsland has and will continue to make--and, hopefully, for many decades \nto come--an extraordinary contribution to the work of this body. I have \nseen it firsthand on the Armed Services Committee where he is the \nchairman of the SeaPower Subcommittee, but way beyond that. He brings \nan experience and a thoughtful commitment to this work which is second \nto none, and it is incredibly valuable to every member of our committee \nto have him as a member of the committee. I cannot express how grateful \nI am for that, and I cannot exaggerate how grateful I am for his \npresence and for his work.\n  Mr. REED. If I may simply say that I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, in a few minutes I hope to be able to lay \nout a roadmap for our work here--at least for the next couple hours. We \nhope to be able to deal with a modified Kyl amendment as well as \ndispose of, we hope, an Ayotte amendment and a Hagan amendment. There \nwill be debate with each of those, and this is just tentative because I \nwant to discuss this, obviously, with Senator McCain. But if this works \nout, there could be a couple votes in an hour or so. But, again, I am \nnot announcing that; I am just sort of giving as early a warning as I \ncan to our colleagues as to what is at least a likely prospect at this \ntime. But, again, that is going to have to await the presence of \nSenator McCain, with whom I am working so closely on this matter.\n  So with that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I wish to talk this morning about an \namendment I had intended to offer but I am not going to be offering \ntoday because there is an important portion in the House Armed Services \nCommittee that covers my concerns. That was the amendment I had drafted \nthat is cosponsored by Senators Lieberman and Collins. I appreciate \ntheir support.\n  My amendment would establish an east coast ballistic missile defense \nsite to make sure the east coast of our country is protected from \nmissile threats. Let me describe why I thought it was very important. \nMy amendment would have established both a study on three potential \nlocations for an east coast missile defense site, an environmental \nimpact study, and a plan for deployment of that site.\n  Where we are right now, unfortunately, is we have Iran, and no one \ndisagrees that Iran has an active ballistic development program. They \ncan already reach Eastern Europe. Many analysts believe Iran will be \nable to develop the capacity to strike the mainland United States with \nan ICBM by 2015. Our existing missile defense sites right now that \nprotect this country have the capacity--if, for example, North Korea \nwere to launch an ICBM toward the west coast, we would have an \nopportunity for two shots at that missile to protect our country.\n  In other words, if the President of the United States got an awful \ncall that a missile was coming from North Korea toward the western \ncoast of our country, he would have an opportunity to have one shot, a \nlook, and then a shot to take that missile down to protect our country; \ntwo shots to take the missile down.\n  But as it stands right now, when it comes to the east coast of our \ncountry, including the Capital, Washington, DC, the center of our \ngovernment where we stand right now, my home State of New Hampshire, \nNew York, all those population centers, if Iran were to develop the \ncapacity to have an ICBM, where we are today is we would only get one \nshot at that missile if it were to be shot at the eastern coast of the \nUnited States instead of a shoot, look, shoot that we have if North \nKorea were to shoot a missile toward the western part of our country.\n  I think this is deeply troubling. We should be developing that \ncapacity to make sure our country is fully protected.\n  I would like to address others who have looked at this. This year the \nNational Research Council recommended an additional ballistic missile \nsite in the United States in the Northeast to more effectively protect \nthe Eastern United States and Canada, particularly against Iranian ICBM \nthreats should they emerge. That is, of course, because some analysts \nbelieve they could develop that capacity as soon as 2015.\n  The markup coming out of the House Armed Services Committee already \ncontains language and authorization for the actual establishment of an \neast coast missile site. That is one of the reasons I will not be \noffering my amendment today to conduct this study on environmental \nimpact and also planned deployment because the House version already \ncontains a requirement that an east coast missile defense site be \ndeveloped.\n  Some would say--in fact, one thing I would like to address is that we \nmay hear from the administration that they are working on a hedging--\nand a different hedging strategy--to make sure the east coast is \nprotected. And that hedging strategy would be plans to deploy the SM-3 \nBlock IIB missile in Poland. But where we are today with the SM-3 Block \nIIB shows why it is important for us to use technology that already \nexists to protect the east coast; that is, because the SM-3 Block IIB \nis only a plan on a piece of paper. It doesn't exist yet, and there \nhave been concerns relayed about its development and, in fact, the \ndevelopment of the SM-3 Block IIB has already been delayed to 2021, \nwhich does not meet where we are with the potential that Iran could \ndevelop ICBM capacity by 2015. It just would not work.\n  But what we do know is that we already have technology that exists, \nand if we were to deploy a missile defense site now on the east coast, \nthat we would get the opportunity to have a look, shoot, look on the \neast coast were Iran to launch a missile toward the east coast of our \ncountry.\n  We only need to look at what happened recently in the conflict with \nHamas, the missiles that were being shot into Israel and the Iron Dome \nsystem to understand the importance of missile defense. Now, that is a \nsystem that focuses on short-range missiles, but we all saw the number \nof civilians that could be protected by the capacity of having a robust \nmissile defense system, and I can't imagine why we wouldn't want to be \nin the position to make sure the east coast of our country would be as \nprotected as the west coast when it comes to an emerging threat from \nIran.\n  There is no question that the more we hear about the behavior of \nIran, the more troubled we should be as a country. Not only do they \nhave a robust missile development program, but we all know they are \nalso making efforts to acquire the capability of having a nuclear \nweapon.\n  Now is the time for us to act, not to find ourselves in 2015 with no \nplans as to how to deploy an east coast missile defense site to make \nsure the east coast of our country has the same protection as the west \ncoast. Now is the time to act because, in addition, in 2012 in the \ndefense authorization, we asked the administration to submit a plan to \nus as to how they would hedge, a hedging strategy to make sure the east \ncoast was as protected as the west coast.\n  They have yet to submit that plan, and so now is the time for us to \nmake\n\n[[Page S7139]]\n\nsure we go forward with technology that already exists to ensure that \nthe east coast of our country is protected.\n  I cannot imagine the President of the United States being in a \nposition as we go forward in our country where, if a missile were \ncoming from Iran toward our Capital, he would be told we only have one \nshot to take that missile down versus if a missile were coming to the \nwest coast of our country in L.A. from North Korea, that we would have \ntwo shots to take that missile down.\n  We want to make sure our country is protected. The threat from Iran \nis a very real threat. That is why I was going to offer this amendment, \nto make sure we had a study, an environmental impact analysis and a \nplan that the Department of Defense could use to deploy an east coast \nmissile defense site.\n  But my colleagues in the House, including Representative Turner, have \nalready addressed this issue directly with the requirement contained in \nthe House mark of the Armed Services Committee. I think it is very \nimportant what they have done.\n  I thank the Chair very much for giving me the opportunity to speak \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. First, I would like to speak to the Senator's amendment. I \nwant to compliment her, commend her and her other cosponsors--Senator \nLieberman, Senator Collins, and others--in their effort to bring \nattention to what is clearly a great need that is going unmet. I agree \nthe House's action is very important to begin to move this process \nforward.\n  The Senator's amendment is even less specific than the action taken \nby the House. We are going to need a study of the environmental impacts \nand evaluate possible locations. It is going to have to be done. It \nseems to me to make sense that this amendment would begin that process, \nand so I support that very strongly.\n  I would also like to speak to some of the military requirements which \ngo to the fundamental question of whether we are going to move forward. \nIf the Senator does not want to speak further right now, I would like \nto speak to that issue.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Yes. Thank you.\n  Mr. KYL. All right. Mr. President, as I said, this particular \namendment doesn't require that the administration actually establish a \nsite for an east coast defense, but I do believe such a site would \nprovide an important and critical measure of protection for the east \ncoast of the United States and also those in the southeastern part of \nthe United States.\n  This has become more important due to the cancellation of earlier \nplans to deploy long-range ground-based interceptors in Poland. That is \nwhat it originally was going to provide, full protection for the United \nStates. That would have provided what is called an ``early shot'' or a \nshot early in the trajectory of a missile coming from someplace--for \nexample, the Middle East--toward the United States.\n  In conjunction with the missile defense sites that we already have in \nAlaska and in California, a site further to the east would provide what \nis called a multiple-shot opportunity or an ability in the event that \nthere was more than one missile or one had to distinguish between \ndecoys or one of our first missiles wasn't effective in reaching its \ntarget; it would give us, in effect, a second chance to shoot down the \nmissile, which is always what we want to do in planning these kinds of \nmissile defense systems.\n  In fact, this was the actual rationale for, the actual basis for the \nthird site deployment in Poland, to improve protection of the United \nStates, while at the same time affording protection for our European \nallies against longer range ballistic missile threats from the Middle \nEast.\n  This is a critical point. We are involved in missile defense not just \nto protect our allies, say, in Europe but also to protect the homeland \nof the United States of America. But the current administration's plan \nseems to be oriented toward protecting allies in Europe and not \nstrengthening the protection of the people in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  The administration says it can cover the ballistic missile threat \nfrom the Middle East with the current inventory of 30 ground-based \ninterceptors. First of all, I seriously disagree with that assessment. \nIn any event, there is no way to know if that can be done for sure.\n  Let me cite the President's own Ballistic Missile Defense Review \nreport, which says:\n\n       Looking ahead, it is difficult to predict precisely how the \n     threat to the U.S. homeland will evolve, but it is certain \n     that it will do so.\n\n  So you can't say based upon what happened a couple of years ago, or \nthe deployment of the ground-based interceptors, that only 30 of them, \nbear in mind, are going to protect our homeland at all.\n  Now how does the administration then plan to make up for what it has \ndone in terms of canceling programs that further develop the so-called \nGround-Based Interceptor. Well, it plans to compensate for this loss of \noriginal Ground-Based Interceptor deployments with something that is \ncalled the IIB missile, the SM-3 Block IIB.\n  That is a missile that would be deployed in Poland, for example, but \nthe problem is there is no SM-3 Block IIB missile. That is something \nthat is in the minds of some scientists. It is on vu-graphs. There are \npictures of what it might look like, but there is no such missile.\n  Indeed, without discussing classified material here there is no way \nto know whether we are actually even going to be able to develop such a \nmissile. In fact, its development, rather, has already been delayed to \nthe year 2021.\n  Now, think about it. Think about it. This is 2012, and we wouldn't \neven begin developing such a missile for another 9 years? This is \nsomething way off into the future, if it works, and there is no \ncommitment to deploy it and, indeed, the President has already talked \nwith President Medvedev of Russia about further flexibility in \ndesigning our missile defense system. It is no secret that this is \npotentially on the chopping block, notwithstanding the commitments of \nthe President earlier to deploy it.\n  The NRC has, in fact, recommended that there be an interceptor site \non the east coast of the United States as a possible substitute for \nthis Block IIB. This concern has been raised before, and the \nadministration has yet failed to provide a hedging strategy that the \nfiscal year 2012 NDAA required. So we have known of this deficiency, \nthe fact that the GBI system is not adequate, the fact that the SM-3 \nBlock IIB system may never be deployed. We have asked for a hedging \nstrategy.\n  So what do we do if none of this works, if we don't go forward with \nit? We don't have that even if the law has required it.\n  What this amendment does is to shine an even brighter light on the \nconcern that I have had for a long time, which is why the \nadministration hasn't provided sufficient resources and attention to \nour missile defense efforts to protect the homeland of the United \nStates. That is precisely what this would do. Sure, it would help with \nregard to our friends in Europe, but the primary point of this is to \nprotect the American people. What is wrong with that?\n  Some examples that lead to my concern are that in his first budget, \nthe President reduced funding for the ground-based system. That is the \nGround-Based Midcourse Defense System that is also known as the \nnational missile defense system, by $500 million, $\\1/2\\ billion. Then \nanother billion dollars was reduced between his fiscal year 2011 and \nfiscal year 2012, 5-year budget plans. So they have taken an enormous \namount of money out of the development of the system that was supposed \nto protect the United States. The President cut back the number of \nGround-Based Interceptors for the defense of the homeland.\n  Originally, under the Bush administration, it was going to be 44. \nWell, that is a pretty small number when you stop to think about it, \nbut they have cut it back to 30. Then in addition they subsequently \ncancelled the 10 GBI interceptors that we were going to send to Poland \nfor defense of Europe as well as the United States.\n  So they have not only cut back on the funding for the development of \nthe program, they have cut back on the actual number of the \ninterceptors that we have already developed.\n  Third, the President curtailed any significant development and \nmodernization of the GMD system, and he\n\n[[Page S7140]]\n\ncancelled the Multiple Kill Vehicle Program, which was intended to be a \nsignificant upgrade to the current Kill Vehicle. The current design is \nover 20 years old.\n  When we talk about a kill vehicle, of course, we are talking about \nwhat is on the nose of the missile that goes up, the interceptor \nmissile, how it intercepts the ballistic missile in flight, how it \nfinds it, how it triggers the final phase of the intercept, and how it \nactually impacts the offending missile.\n  The technology has improved dramatically since the 20 years that has \nelapsed from the design of the original kill vehicle of the GBI. First \nof all, they have reduced funding for the program. Secondly, they have \ncut back the number of missiles in the program. Third, they have \nstopped the development of the next generation of the real business end \nof the missile, the kill vehicle, so that it can't improve with \ntechnology and improve to meet the evolving threats of those that are \ndeveloping missiles against us.\n  Remember, countries such as Russia, for example, have extraordinarily \nsophisticated multiple-entry vehicles with decoys and other technology \nto try to evade a missile defense that the United States has produced. \nIf we don't develop our technology and deploy it to keep up with these \ndevelopments, we are not going to have an effective system.\n  Over the next 5 years the administration intends to spend $20 billion \non regional missile defense compared with only $4 billion for homeland \nmissile defense. So we are going to provide protection for our allies--\nEuropean allies and so on--but only $4 billion over the next 5 years. \nThat is about $1 billion a year on a system that is critical for the \nprotection of the United States.\n  I would ask my colleagues to recall the Missile Defense Act of 1999, \ngoing all the way back then, which requires the United States to build \na missile defense system capable of protecting our Nation against \nlimited ballistic missile attacks from rogue nations and protect \nagainst any accidental and unauthorized launches from any source. We \nneed to ensure our homeland missile defense system is as robust as \npossible, and a missile defense site on the east coast may be one of \nthe best means for accomplishing this.\n  In other words, of course, we are concerned about North Korea or \nIran, but there are a couple other countries in the world that may not \nwish us any harm but that have extraordinarily capable systems--I speak \nspecifically of China and Russia. We have always wanted--and the law \nrequires us--to provide protection against the kind of unauthorized or \naccidental launch that can occur. This is not an idle concern. We spend \nenormous amounts of time and energy and money trying to make sure these \nextraordinarily lethal weapons are never launched by accident or by \nsome unauthorized event. That is one of the reasons for a missile \ndefense system, to ensure that kind of accident never would result in \nharm to the United States. Of course, what they are also worried about \nis, if that ever happens, then there is the question of retaliation. \nHow do we know this is not intentional? How do we know we shouldn't \nretaliate?\n  Wars can be started almost by accident, and the best protection \nagainst that is a missile defense system that can ensure no harm is \ndone even if there is such a launch. In the meantime, we can find out \nwhether this is real, whether we need to respond, whether we need to \nstart another war. That is the benefit of a missile defense system.\n  It is beyond me why the administration reduces the funding, cuts back \nthe numbers, and kills the advanced technology we could put into our \nsystem to protect the people of the United States of America. I \nunderstand the difficult choices that have to be made in a time of \nausterity, but we are not talking about extraordinary amounts of money. \nThe amendment of the Senator from New Hampshire simply calls for a \nstudy of the location of the site and what the impact of that would be. \nThat is the first step in deciding where to put this additional bit of \nprotection.\n  I think this is a priority. To oppose just the idea of investigating \nhow we are going to be proceeding, especially with the little bit of \nmoney that entails, is difficult to understand. It is not too much to \nask. We have a moral responsibility to protect our people. It makes \nstrategic sense because of the exposure of our American homeland to \nthese long-range missile threats and because of the critical \nvulnerability we have right now.\n  The commander of NORTHCOM, the military entity with responsibility \nhere--General Jacoby--told Congress last March:\n\n       No homeland task is more important than protecting the \n     United States from a limited ICBM attack . . . we must not \n     allow regional actors, such as North Korea, to hold U.S. \n     policy hostage by making our citizens vulnerable to a nuclear \n     ICBM attack.\n\n  That is part of the problem. There are some people in the United \nStates who actually believe it would be beneficial for the United \nStates to be vulnerable to a missile attack from another country. They \nactually believe that would be advantageous. The reasoning is rather \nweird, but it goes something like this: If we develop defenses that \ncould protect the American people, then other countries will want to \ndevelop even more effective systems that can try to override those \ndefenses, and that puts us into a spiral of arms development that would \nbe very costly.\n  One can argue that theory, but there are a couple things wrong with \nit. First of all, recall this was the argument used against getting out \nof the ABM Treaty to enable the United States to develop an \nantiballistic missile defense. It was going to create this big arms war \nbetween then-Soviet Union and the United States. It didn't. Both sides \nhave reduced our warheads. One of the reasons why is because it is so \nexpensive, and the Soviet Union, now Russia, realized we could have \ndriven them into bankruptcy. It is one of the reasons--one of the \nreasons--Russian officials have cited for the collapse of the Soviet \nUnion. They knew Ronald Reagan meant it when he said he was going to \ndevelop a missile defense system. They knew they couldn't spend enough \nmoney to overcome it or, if they tried, they would go into bankruptcy. \nIt is expensive.\n  I don't necessarily think we have to fear a new expensive arms race \nbecause there are very intelligent people in other countries, such as \nRussia, for example, who appreciate the fact that would be a fools's \nerrand. They may want to threaten, but they are not going to do it \nbecause they can't afford it any more now than they could back in the \ndays of the Soviet Union. They know the United States has the resources \nto trump whatever they do come up with. That is the first point.\n  But the second point is the moral one. Is it moral for leaders who \nhave responsibility for the national security of the American people to \ndeliberately--knowing this is the case--leave them vulnerable to an \nattack that could kill millions of Americans at a time? If we have the \nmeans of avoiding that result, we should. We do. We have that means. It \nmay require a little bit more money. It may require not cutting back \nthe number of interceptors we have deployed. It may require continuing \nwith the advancement of technologies we know are out there. It may \nrequire siting missiles in a country of Europe, on Aegis cruisers or on \nthe east coast of the United States. We know how to do all these \nthings.\n  Is it moral for leaders of the United States to leave our people \ndeliberately vulnerable to an attack by others when we know we have the \nmeans to prevent it, and there is a cost-benefit that obviously favors \nthe deployment of an additional site of ground-based interceptors?\n  I think for the Senator from New Hampshire to propose that we begin \nlooking at where a new site might be and determine what the \nenvironmental impacts of that are as a complement to what the House of \nRepresentatives has already done in passing the bill that says we need \nto move forward is a perfectly reasonable step, and I commend her and \nthe other cosponsors of this amendment for bringing this matter to the \nattention of the Senate and to the people of the United States. This is \npart of our responsibility to our constituents and all the other \ncitizens of our great Nation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I just to want follow up on the remarks \nof my colleagues Senator Kyl and Senator Ayotte.\n  Last year, I asked for and obtained language in the Defense bill that \nwould\n\n[[Page S7141]]\n\nrequire the Defense Department to report on the effectiveness and need \nand ramifications of a hedging strategy for the United States, and that \nwas due within 75 days of the bill being passed. My understanding is \nthe Defense Department produced that analysis and they sent it to the \nWhite House as early as last spring and it has not been produced.\n  So now we have the House having passed language that actually funds \nmoving forward with a hedging strategy on an American-based system to \ngive us a layered defense, which I think is probably necessary but \nbecause we have not gotten a report from the Defense Department it is \nhard to know. I would first say it is not acceptable that we have not \nreceived that report. It has gone on too long. I guess I and Congress \nhave been too reticent in insisting that it be produced.\n  I would say to the Defense Department and the administration, we \nexpect that report to be produced. I don't want to cause trouble in \nyour world, but it has been made, it has been sent forward, and it is \ntime to have it come to the people's representatives who have to make \ndecisions about how we are going to defend America. I will be using the \nvarious rights I have as a Senator to move that forward.\n  I wish to quote from a story in today's Washington Times, referring \nto a statement made by Mr. Fereidoun Abbasi, who is Iran's nuclear \nchief. The article states: ``Iran will step up its uranium enrichment \nprogram by sharply increasing the number of centrifuges used to make \nnuclear fuel.''\n  There are some people still saying we don't know if Iran wants to go \nforward with a nuclear weapon. How could this possibly be? They have \nbeen subjected to the most rigorous sanctions that are damaging their \neconomy. Yet in today's paper their nuclear chief says they are \naccelerating their plans to go forward. There is no doubt about what \nthey are doing. I wish it weren't so. I truly wish it weren't so. I had \nhoped they would change their mind. Maybe they will change their mind, \nbut it is false to say they haven't made up their mind and they are not \ngoing forward to build a nuclear weapon. That is so plainly obvious I \ndon't know how anybody could ever suggest otherwise. The only question \nis, Can we somehow bring to bear enough pressure on them to get them to \nchange their mind? There is a long article about that in today's paper.\n  I was pleased Chairman Levin and both Democratic and Republican \nmembers of the Armed Services Committee produced a unanimous bill. \nSenator McCain, Senator Levin, both fine, wonderful leaders of our \ncommittee, and every member all signed off on the legislation. I think \nthat speaks well for our committee. They also approved this language \ndealing with the failure of the Department to produce the hedging \nreport--and it has a number of fact-finding points in it which I will \nshare with my colleagues:\n\n       The Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, has \n     testified to Congress that . . . ``Iran already has the \n     largest inventory of ballistic missiles in the Middle East, \n     and it is expanding the scale, reach, and sophistication of \n     its ballistic missile forces, many of which are inherently \n     capable of carrying a nuclear payload.''\n\n  That is President Obama's National Intelligence Director, and he is \nthe man to make the final opinion on that for the President. Let me \nquote additional language from the committee:\n\n       The 2012 Annual Report to Congress on the Military Power of \n     Iran by the Department of Defense states that, in addition to \n     increasing its missile inventories, ``Iran has boosted the \n     lethality and effectiveness of its existing missile systems \n     with accuracy improvements and new submissions payloads.''\n\n  Also in the report:\n\n       North Korea warned the United States in October 2012 that \n     the United States mainland is within reach of its missiles.\n\n  I will wrap up, since I can't talk much longer anyway. We have to \nrecognize the grim fact there are very dangerous countries with nuclear \nweapons--North Korea--or are rapidly developing them--Iran--capable of \nputting them on missiles and that have missile systems already. So \nNorth Korea has a missile system they believe can reach the United \nStates right now. We need to be sure our defense system is sufficient. \nI wish it weren't so, but that is the way it is. I think the Defense \nDepartment understands this.\n  I think the administration says it does, and we are doing some good \nthings to be prepared for that. However, we have to confront this \nquestion of an east coast site, and we need this report. I believe we \nare going to need additional layered defenses, and we might as well \nprepare to do it. In the scheme of the entire investment in our \nnational defense, it won't be the kind of expenditure that will break \nthe defense budget. It is something we can work into our defense \nbudgets.\n  I thank Senators Ayotte and Kyl for their comments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, we are waiting for Senator Cornyn to come \nto the floor, and he will be speaking on the modified Cornyn amendment. \nWe also are waiting for Senator Inhofe to come to the floor, and he \nwill be speaking on a Hagan amendment. Then we would expect, after a \nfairly short amount of debate--perhaps 10 minutes but not set yet--by \neach of them, perhaps a minute or two by the sponsors of the amendment, \nparticularly in the case of the Hagan amendment, to describe the \namendment, we would then go to a rollcall vote on both of those \namendments. That is the plan. It is not yet in a UC agreement formally \nbecause we want to make sure we are protecting the Senators in terms of \nthe length of time they need to describe either their opposition to the \nHagan amendment in the case of Senator Inhofe or their support of the \nCornyn amendment in the case of Senator Cornyn.\n  We hope Senator Klobuchar will now be recognized for a few minutes to \ndescribe a couple of amendments she has filed. She is not going to call \nthem up at this point, but this would be a period for her to describe \nthose two amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I thank Senator Levin and Senator \nMcCain for their leadership, including their leadership on this very \nissue last year when the Defense Authorization Act was on the floor. \nLast year we made some improvements.\n  Here is the issue. According to the Veterans Affairs Administration, \na full one in five female veterans at VA facilities across the country \nsays she has had an issue with sexual assault or harassment. In 2010 \nthe Department of Defense cited more than 3,000 reports in the \nmilitary. We know that the vast majority of our soldiers are law-\nabiding and would not engage in this kind of behavior, but this is \nclearly an issue, and we have seen an increase.\n  I would like to again take the time to recognize Senator Levin and \nSenator McCain, who last year supported the inclusion of the amendment \nthat I introduced to preserve records of military sexual assault in the \n2012 National Defense Authorization Act. Until that time, it was really \na patchwork of rules for each branch of the military as far as how long \nthose records would be preserved. Thanks to the support of every woman \nSenator, we were able to get this changed, and so now these records are \npreserved.\n  But there are still some additional changes that can be made. Those \nare the amendments that I submitted. There is a records retention \namendment--and I am working with the chairman and ranking member on \nthis issue--that once again tackles this issue. Unfortunately, not all \nrecords are being stored for 50 years, as was our agreement last year. \nDocuments filed in a restrictive reporting setting are stored for just \n5 years, and this amendment changes that.\n  Our second amendment, No. 3103, addresses another area of records \nretention, and its purpose is to target the issue of repeat offenders. \nAs we all know, sex offenders are often repeat offenders, and what this \ndoes is target it and makes clear that only substantiated charges of \nsexual offenses would be preserved in the permanent personnel file of \nthe perpetrator.\n\n[[Page S7142]]\n\n  The third amendment, No. 3104, involves sexual assault reporting and \nexpands the data the Department of Defense reports on sexual assault \nincidents in the military.\n  The fourth amendment, No. 3105, tackles one of the key precursors to \nsexual assault--sexual harassment.\n  The fifth and final amendment involves the disposition of sexual \nassault cases. It makes a statement about what the U.S. policy should \nbe regarding the disposition of sexual assault charges in the military.\n  All of these requests came from women in the military. My office has \nbeen working with these women. They signed up to serve. They performed \ntheir service well and honorably. In the course of their service, if \nthey experienced an assault that could have been prevented, an assault \nthat would not have been experienced had they not volunteered for the \nservice, then our country owes them the basic decency of ensuring them \na fair trial, fair access to health benefits, and the promise of \njustice. That is the goal of our amendments.\n  I appreciate the leadership of Senator Levin and Senator McCain in \nnot only working with me last year to dramatically alter this policy so \nthese records are now preserved for 50 years but for working this year \non improvements to that policy once again.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I request that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded for a point of inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. It is my understanding that the chair has an amendment \nthat is going be considered at the present time, and my question is, \nAre we ready to go into that? Is the Presiding Officer going to be able \nto do that from up there?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator would yield, we thank him for noting that.\n  Senator Hagan did have an opportunity last night to go into her \namendment, and she was willing to do that at that time. We understood \nthat, of course, the Senator would like an opportunity to speak against \nthe Hagan amendment, which is the opportunity that is being provided \nnow, and then I think it would be appropriate for someone to take \nSenator Hagan's place at the Presiding Officer's position so she can \nspeak for a few minutes in support of her amendment after the Senator \nhas completed. If the Senator could give us an idea about how long he \nexpects?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Not more than 7 or 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I was not here when the Presiding \nOfficer spoke last night; however, I am familiar with the amendment \nthat is here.\n  Let me share with some of the Members here. I hope they don't look at \nthis amendment as just part of the amendment that was defeated \nyesterday.\n  We talked about biofuels. There are a lot of people here who are \nsupportive of biofuels. I am supportive of biofuels. In fact, we are \nvery active in Oklahoma right now in developing various biofuels. We \nare one of the leaders in the Nation, and we actually have a lot of \nplants located in my State of Oklahoma. This is not that issue. It is \nnot whether you believe biofuels is something we are working toward in \nthe future. We are. We all know that. This is whether we should take \nour very scarce defense dollars--in this case, the dollars that would \notherwise go to the Department of Navy--and put them into subsidizing \nthe private sector in building these plants.\n  What we are looking at now is to either retrofit or build biofuel \nrefineries. This is interesting because right now I have a list of \nabout 100 different biofuel plants--many of which are in my State of \nOklahoma--that are not subsidized by the Federal Government, and there \nis no reason for these to be subsidized by the Federal Government. This \nis something that can be done.\n  If you look at the Navy and the problems they are having right now, I \nthink people realize their operation and maintenance funds are \nstretched to the maximum. They have readiness problems right now. They \nhave a higher op tempo than they have had in the past. And I think it \nis important for people to understand that if you keep giving away $170 \nmillion here and more there, that is coming out of O It is coming \nout of our readiness. Right now, if you talk to any of the higher \nlevels in the Navy, they will say they have never been in this \nsituation before. They have already had readiness problems over the \npast few years, with more than one-fifth of the ships falling short of \ncombat readiness and fewer than half of their deployed combat aircraft \nbeing mission-ready at any given time.\n  I urge us to reconsider whether we should be in the business of \nbuilding these plants or retrofitting them because this is something we \nhaven't done before.\n  Now, Energy and Agriculture are doing it currently. Yesterday I stood \non the floor and talked about how we are taking over the responsibility \nof the Department of Energy. We are trying to make the decisions as to \nhow we are going to do this. Should we be developing the progress of \nthe biofuels--which we are doing in the State of Oklahoma without any \nFederal Government assistance--or should we be defending America with \nthese dollars? Now, Energy, yes, they are going to spend money on this, \nand the Department of Agriculture is certainly currently spending money \non it, but we have not been doing it.\n  I understand that the Presiding Officer, who is the author of this \namendment and who is from North Carolina--and I am reading now from one \nof the Web sites, from a newspaper there saying that a private company \nbacked by the U.S. Department of Agriculture will build a $130 million \nbiofuel refinery in Sampson County, with an estimated 300 jobs there. \nThey talk about what they may be doing through the Department of \nDefense. ChemTex was awarded a $3.9 million grant in June to convert \nmore than 4,000 acres across 11 counties to begin producing miscanthus \nand switchgrass and biofuel conversions. The USDA, which is supposed to \nbe doing this, estimates that farmers will see a net revenue increase \nof $4.5 million in growing and selling grass.\n  I come to two conclusions on this. One is, as I just read, they are \nalready doing it now in the State of North Carolina. They are already \npaying, subsidizing these plants. That is their job, to evaluate and \ndecide whether to subsidize these biotech plants or whether that should \nbe a function of the Department of Energy.\n\n  When we look at these--I asked my staff before this--we didn't have \nnotice, to my knowledge--I asked my staff on the floor to tell me \nwhether there are any of these plants currently being subsidized in any \nway by the Department of Defense. His answer was no, after a very \ncursory look.\n  We do have the DOE and DOA, Department of Agriculture and Energy, \ndoing that. I hope everyone here will look at this. I will actually \njoin the author of this amendment in encouraging the Department of \nAgriculture and Department of Energy to look carefully at this, as well \nas some of our plants in my State of Oklahoma. On this list I am going \nto submit as part of the Record, there are about 100 plants scattered \nthroughout the country, including my State of Oklahoma. We need to look \nat those and evaluate those and make the determination is this a \nfunction government should perform? If so, wouldn't it be more logical \nto do it as we are doing it today, through the Department of \nAgriculture and the Department of Energy and not use our scarce \nreadiness--in this case Navy--dollars that are desperately needed to \nsubsidize this?\n  I retain the remainder of my time. I know the Senator who is offering \nthe amendment may want to make some comments. Maybe not. But I urge my \ncolleagues to stop and realize this is something brandnew, having the \nDepartment of Defense do a function that has heretofore been done by \nthe Department of Agriculture and Department of Energy, and keep it \nthat way.\n  When the appropriate time comes, I will ask for the yeas and nays on \nthe amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the next\n\n[[Page S7143]]\n\namendment in order to be called up is the Cornyn amendment, No. 3158; \nthat after the Cornyn amendment is reported it be in order for Senator \nHagan or designee to call up her amendment, No. 3095; that there be up \nto 10 minutes of debate equally divided between the chairman and \nranking member or their designees prior to votes in relation to the \namendments in the order offered; finally, there be no amendments in \norder to either amendment prior to the votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That means we would be voting on the amendment of Senator \nCornyn first, the amendment of Senator Hagan second.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. That will take approximately 30 minutes? Before the vote?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I think Senator Cornyn only needs about 5 minutes. We have \ncleared that amendment. There is support for it.\n  Senator Hagan only needs, I believe, 5 minutes. That means that in \nabout 10 minutes----\n  Mr. McCAIN. Ten minutes we will be ready to vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Unless there are others who wish to speak. A couple of \nvotes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3158\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I thank the distinguished chair of the \nArmed Services Committee and ranking member for their work with us on \nthis important amendment.\n  The Veterans' Administration defines a backlogged claim as one that \nhas been pending for more than 125 days. Scandalously, there are \n600,000-plus backlogged claims in the Veterans' Administration system \nand about two-thirds of all pending claims are backlogged.\n  There has been a lot of attention, particularly in my State and \nacross the country, by veterans to this unacceptable situation. In my \nState we have currently at the Veterans' regional office in Texas a \nState agency called the Texas Veterans Commission that is working with \nboth the Waco office and other field offices in Houston and elsewhere \nto clear these backlogs. The Texas Veterans Commission is doing \noutstanding work, working on a voluntary basis to help make sure \nveterans file fully developed claims which shortens the processing time \ndramatically. The goal of the Texas Veterans Commission is to reduce \nthe backlog of VA claims in Texas by 17,000 in 1 year.\n  You can see from the size of the problem this is an important first \nstep but it is only that, a first step. The purpose of my amendment is \nto provide this useful model across the country, to require a plan from \nthe Veterans' Administration to deal with this backlog. I am confident \nthat Members will have no trouble voting for this amendment because I \nam sure they have heard what I have heard from my constituents about \nhow outraged and upset they are at the current backlog of claims.\n  In order to capitalize on the successful model we have implemented, \nthis amendment would require the Veterans' Administration to report to \nCongress with a plan to address the claims backlog through partnerships \nbetween the Veterans' Administration and other entities including State \nveterans affairs offices and county veterans service offices, similar \nto the Texas Veterans Commission operation in my State. The purpose, of \ncourse, is to eliminate the current backlog of claims and ensure that \nnew claims are fully developed when they are submitted, all with the \npurpose of making sure that we keep our commitments to veterans who \nhave made great sacrifices serving our country, that we will keep our \ncommitments to them, that we will keep our promises once they return \nhome having suffered the wounds of war, both seen and unseen.\n  I ask the support of my colleagues on this important amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent to set aside all pending amendments and call \nup Cornyn amendment No. 3158.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Cornyn] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3158.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to submit to \n   Congress a plan to reduce the current backlog of veterans claims)\n\n       At the end of subtitle H of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1084. PLAN TO PARTNER WITH STATE AND LOCAL ENTITIES TO \n                   ADDRESS VETERANS CLAIMS BACKLOG.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Department of Veterans Affairs defines any claim \n     for benefits under laws administered by the Secretary of \n     Veterans Affairs as backlogged if the claim has been pending \n     for 125 days or more.\n       (2) According to the Department, as of November 24, 2012, \n     there were 899,540 pending claims, with 604,583 (67.2 \n     percent) of those considered backlogged.\n       (3) The Department's data further shows that, on November \n     22, 2010, there were 749,934 claims pending, with only \n     244,129 (32.6 percent) of those considered backlogged.\n       (4) During the past two years, both the overall number of \n     backlogged claims and the percentage of all pending claims \n     that are backlogged have doubled.\n       (5) In order to reduce the claims backlog at regional \n     offices of the Department of Veterans Affairs located in \n     Texas, the Texas Veterans Commission announced two \n     initiatives on July 19, 2012, to partner with the Department \n     of Veterans Affairs--\n       (A) to assist veterans whose claims are already backlogged \n     to complete development of those claims; and\n       (B) to help veterans who are filing new claims to fully \n     develop those claims prior to filing them, shortening the \n     processing time required.\n       (6) The common goal of the two initiatives of the Texas \n     Veterans Commission, called the ``Texas State Strike Force \n     Team'' and the ``Fully Developed Claims Team Initiative'', is \n     to reduce the backlog of claims pending in Texas by 17,000 \n     within one year.\n       (7) During the first two months of these new initiatives, \n     the Texas Veterans Commission helped veterans complete \n     development of more than 2,500 backlogged claims and assisted \n     veterans with the submission of more than 800 fully developed \n     claims.\n       (8) In testimony before the Subcommittee on Disability \n     Assistance and Memorial Affairs of the Committee on Veterans' \n     Affairs of the House of Representatives on September 21, \n     2012, Diana Rubens, Deputy Under Secretary for Field \n     Operations of the Veterans Benefits Administration, indicated \n     that the Department of Veterans Affairs has experienced \n     positive outcomes in projects with the Texas Veterans \n     Commission, stating that both Veterans Service Organizations \n     ``and state and county service officers . . . are important \n     partners in VBA's transformation to better serve Veterans.''.\n       (9) At the same hearing, Mr. John Limpose, director of the \n     regional office of the Department of Veterans Affairs in \n     Waco, Texas, testified that the ``TVC is working very, very \n     well'' with regional offices of the Department in Texas, \n     calling the Texas Veterans Commission a ``very positive story \n     that we can branch out into . . . all of our stakeholders.''.\n       (b) Report.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 60 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs \n     shall submit to Congress a plan to reduce the current backlog \n     of pending claims for benefits under laws administered by the \n     Secretary and more efficiently process claims for such \n     benefits in the future.\n       (2) Contents.--The report required by paragraph (1) shall \n     include the following:\n       (A) A summary of all steps the Secretary has taken thus far \n     to partner with non-Federal entities in support of efforts to \n     reduce the backlog described in paragraph (1) and more \n     efficiently process claims described in such paragraph in the \n     future, including two previous initiatives by the Texas \n     Veterans Commission, namely the 2008-2009 Development \n     Assistant Pilot Project and the 2009-2011 Claims Processing \n     Assistance Team.\n       (B) A plan for the Secretary to partner with non-Federal \n     entities to support efforts to reduce such backlog and more \n     efficiently process such claims in the future, including the \n     following:\n       (i) State and local agencies relating to veterans affairs.\n       (ii) Organizations recognized by the Secretary for the \n     representation of veterans under section 5902 of title 38, \n     United States Code.\n       (iii) Such other relevant government and non-government \n     entities as the Secretary considers appropriate.\n       (C) A description of how the Secretary intends to leverage \n     partnerships with non-Federal entities described in \n     subparagraph (B) to eliminate such backlog, including through \n     increasing the percentage of claims that are fully developed \n     prior to submittal to the Secretary and ensuring that new \n     claims are fully developed prior to their submittal.\n       (D) A description of what steps the Secretary has taken and \n     will take--\n       (i) to expedite the processing of claims that are already \n     fully developed at the time of submittal; and\n\n[[Page S7144]]\n\n       (ii) to support initiatives by non-Federal entities \n     described in subparagraph (B) to help claimants gather and \n     submit necessary evidence for claims that were previously \n     filed but require further development.\n       (E) A description of how partnerships with non-Federal \n     entities described in subparagraph (B) will fit into the \n     Secretary's overall claims processing transformation plan.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3095\n\n  Mrs. HAGAN. I call up amendment No. 3095.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mrs. Hagan], for herself, \n     Mr. Johnson of South Dakota, Mrs. Murray, and Mr. Udall of \n     Colorado proposes an amendment numbered 3095.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To strike the prohibition on biofuel refinery construction)\n\n       Strike section 2823.\n\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senators \nShaheen, Collins, Schumer, Stabenow, Whitehouse, Coons, Udall of New \nMexico, and Tester as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I spoke about this bill last night at \nlength. I want to give a brief summary today of this amendment.\n  This bipartisan amendment would remove provisions from the underlying \nbill that prohibit the Department of Defense from participating in a \nprogram with the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Energy \nand private industry to develop advanced biofuels refineries. It is a \n1-to-1 match. As the largest single consumer of fuel in the world, the \nDOD uses approximately 120 million barrels of oil each year, spending \nover $17 billion in fiscal year 2011. This dependency on a single \nsource of energy leaves our military readiness at risk. When the price \nof oil goes up $1, it costs the Navy an additional $30 million. We are \nlooking at an investment here of $170 million by the Department of the \nNavy. Last year alone, this additional fuel cost forced the Navy to pay \nan additional $500 million more because the price of fuel was $1 \nhigher.\n  Our senior military leaders recognize the importance of diversifying \nthe fuel supply with advanced biofuels. The Navy Secretary Mabus, Chief \nof Naval Operations ADM Johnathon Greenert, and Marine Corps Commandant \nGEN James Amos wrote to the Armed Services Committee about this.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have their letter printed in the Record at \nthe conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mrs. HAGAN. They write that:\n\n       The demand for fuel in theater means we depend on \n     vulnerable supply lines--the protection of which puts lives \n     at risk. Our potential adversaries, both on land and sea, \n     understand this critical vulnerability and seek to exploit \n     it. The Navy and Marine Corps have been aggressively \n     evaluating how both energy efficiency and alternative sources \n     of energy can provide tactical benefits to our expeditionary \n     forces.\n\n  If you look back in history, the Navy's leadership on energy \ninnovation is nothing new. It was the Navy that shifted from sailing \nships to steam-powered ships in the middle of the 19th century, steam \nto oil in the 20th, and pioneered nuclear power in the middle of the \n20th century.\n  In the 1950s, the Defense Production Act, which is the same entity \nthe Department of the Navy, Department of Energy, and Department of \nAgriculture are working under, played a critical role in the \ndevelopment of nuclear-powered submarines and the commercial nuclear \npower industry.\n  Yesterday the Senate approved Senator Udall's amendment having to do \nwith the cost of fuel and being able to invest in biofuels. With strong \nbipartisan support this amendment passed. However, our work is not done \nin this area. It is critically important that we approve this amendment \nso the Navy can continue working with the Department of Agriculture and \nthe Department of Energy to spur the development of advanced biofuels \nrefineries capable of producing cost-competitive drop-in biofuels for \nour military.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                       Department of the Navy,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 9, 2012.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: We are concerned that certain \n     legislative provisions adopted by the Senate Armed Services \n     Committee may restrict the Department of the Navy's ability \n     to improve its exposure to the price volatility of petroleum-\n     based fuels.\n       The ability to use fuels other than petroleum will increase \n     our flexibility and reduce the services' vulnerability to \n     rapid and unforeseen price changes, which can negatively \n     impact readiness. A $1 change in the price of a barrel of \n     oil, for example. results in an approximately $30 million \n     change in the Navy budget. In addition to alternative fuels, \n     operational and tactical energy efficiencies improve the \n     endurance of our forces, reduce dependence on a vulnerable \n     logistics tail, and in the end, lower total ownership costs. \n     Shore energy efficiency improves the resilience of our \n     facilities and conserves resources that can be reapplied to \n     enhance readiness.\n       The demand for fuel in theater means we depend on \n     vulnerable supply lines--the protection of which puts lives \n     at risk. Our potential adversaries, both on land and at sea. \n     understand this critical vulnerability and seek to exploit \n     it. The Navy and Marine Corps have been aggressively \n     evaluating how both energy efficiency and alternative sources \n     of energy can provide tactical benefits to expeditionary \n     forces by reducing their dependence on external fuel \n     supplies, as is the case at many Combat Outposts in Helmand \n     Province today. We are quickly incorporating these promising \n     technologies into regular procurement.\n       Our military knows how to innovate in areas crucial to our \n     national defense. GPS, the internet. and much of modern \n     medical and surgical procedures owe their existence to \n     military innovation. The Navy has been a leader in energy \n     innovation, moving from wind to coal, coal to oil, and then \n     nuclear power. Our modest investment to qualify and partner \n     in developing alternative sources of energy such as wind, \n     solar, and advanced biofuel, is a continuation of our long \n     tradition of American ingenuity to provide greater energy \n     security.\n       In accordance with Department of Defense Policy. the \n     Department of the Navy is pursuing assured access to enemy \n     with a balanced approach that includes the flexibility to use \n     alternate sources of energy. History highlights that over-\n     reliance on a single critical resource jeopardizes \n     operational success and thereby degrades energy security.\n       We request your support in enabling the Department to \n     pursue a judicious, balanced and diversified energy \n     portfolio. This course of action will enhance combat \n     capability, reduce costs and improve the security of energy \n     supplies for our forces.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jonathan W. Greenert,\n       Chief of Naval Operations.\n     James F. Amos,\n       Commandant of the Marine Corps,\n     Ray Mabus,\n       Secretary of the Navy.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. With reference to the Udall amendment yesterday, I want \nto make sure our colleagues note this is not the Udall amendment. This \nis something different. This would mean for the first time we would be \nspending our DOD dollars, very scarce dollars--in this case the \nDepartment of the Navy--to build refineries or retrofit refineries. \nThat has not been done before. As I said to the Senator from North \nCarolina when she was presiding: This is a function that has always \nbeen performed by the Department of Energy and the Department of \nAgriculture. In my State of Oklahoma we have several of these \nrefineries and potential refineries and retrofits that are needed. \nHowever, we went through the proper channels, the Department of \nAgriculture and the Department of Energy. So if we vote for this \namendment, it will be the first time we are using our readiness dollars \nto do something the DOA and the DOE are supposed to be doing. That is \nwhat distinguishes the difference between the two.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I come to the floor today \nin\n\n[[Page S7145]]\n\nstrong support of amendment No. 3095 offered by Senator Hagan to strike \nsection 2823 from the National Defense Authorization Act.\n  Section 2823 would severely limit the Department of Defense's ability \nto use alternative fuels to enhance our Nation's national security. \nThis section would needlessly prohibit the Department of Defense from \nentering into a contract to plan, design, refurbish, or construct a \nbiofuels refinery or any other facility or infrastructure used to \nrefine biofuels unless such planning, design, refurbishment, or \nconstruction is specifically authorized by law.\n  Under the authorities of the Defense Production Act, DPA, the \nDepartment of Defense has created the Advanced Drop-In Biofuels \nProduction Project. This initiative is focused on creating a public-\nprivate partnership that will provide incentives for private sector \ninvestment in cost-competitive, advanced biofuels production \ncapability. This initiative requires at least a one-to-one cost share \nwith private stakeholders.\n  In furtherance of this initiative, in August 2011, the Department of \nNavy, the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Energy signed \na memorandum of understanding to invest $510 million, equally shared \namong them, for investments in the joint construction or retrofitting \nof plants and refineries to produce advanced biofuels. Now is not the \ntime to prevent this important program from continuing. Before this \nproject can be finalized, the President has to determine that this is \nessential to the national defense. Only then will it go forward. I am \nconfident that this requirement in the DPA will ensure that only the \nmost important projects for our national security will go forward.\n  As chairman of the Banking Committee, which has jurisdiction over the \nDPA, I believe it is misguided to limit the authority of the Defense \nDepartment to continue with this project. As the largest single \ncustomer of oil in the world, the Department of Defense spent $17 \nbillion in fiscal year 2011 on fuel. This dependency on a single source \nof energy forces the Department of Defense to reallocate funding from \nother critical needs when oil prices spike. An increase of $1.00 in the \nprice of oil costs the Department of Defense over $100 million. Last \nyear alone, spikes in oil prices required the Navy to pay an additional \n$500 million on higher fuel costs.\n  The renewable fuels industry has played an important role in \naddressing our energy needs. Unfortunately, section 2823 would hinder \nour Nation's ability to promote renewable energy sources within our \ncountry. By striking this provision, we will allow the Defense \nDepartment to retain its authority to take essential steps to diversify \nthe energy sources available to our military. I believe that energy \nsecurity is an essential part of national security.\n  I thank Senator Hagan for offering this amendment. I urge all my \ncolleagues to support this important amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3158\n\n  Under the previous order, the question is on agreeing to amendment \nNo. 3158 offered by the Senator from Texas, Mr. Cornyn.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Between the first and second votes we are having now, we \nwill have an announcement as to the next part of this roadmap. I hope \nall Senators who wish amendments to be considered will come between and \nduring these votes to Senator McCain and myself and our staffs to \ndiscuss other amendments which are out there and which there is \ninterest in pursuing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays were previously ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

I thought it was going to be four, but it can \nonly be two at the moment that we would take up immediately after \nSenator Baucus speaks.\n  I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that following Senator \nBaucus's remarks we then turn to Senator Merkley, who will call up \namendment No. 3096 on Afghanistan, and following him Senator Portman, \nwho will call up amendment No. 2995, and I do not have the subject of \nthat amendment. I ask unanimous consent that be the order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we will try to get time agreements on those \ntwo amendments.

I ask unanimous consent to modify the consent agreement \nthat the Senators from New Hampshire, Ms. Ayotte and Mrs. Shaheen, have \n15 minutes equally divided following the remarks of Senator Baucus.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I wish to take a moment to shine the light on a dark \ntopic in my home State of Montana.\n  On Sunday I read something that hit me in the gut. The Billings \nGazette reported that during 2010 at least 210 Montanans committed \nsuicide. That is according to the Montana Department of Health and \nHuman Services. That was 2010. In 2011 that number was 225. Another \n5,600 Montanans attempted to kill themselves last year. That is a \nstartling average of about 15 per day. In a State with roughly 1 \nmillion residents, that is nearly twice the national average.\n  We in Montana have a saying that I think is quite accurate. Montana \nis really one big small town. We know each other, only about 1 or 2 \ndegrees of separation. You know what. If you ask if we know Uncle Joe, \nwe all know each other. We know somebody who knows someone very close \nto us. We know each other's families.\n  These numbers are devastating. Among the victims of suicide in \nMontana are children, parents, neighbors, friends, and sadly many are \nalso our military veterans who return home only to be held behind an \ninvisible enemy line known as PTSD.\n  In Montana, we are a proud home to more veterans than nearly any \nother State per capita. We also had more Montanans volunteer for \nservice after 9/11 than anywhere else in the country per capita. There \nare nearly 300 Montanans serving in Afghanistan today. We are proud of \nthese men and women, and we are grateful. We take our responsibility to \nhonor them very seriously. So the statistics are all the more alarming. \nThey are very important.\n  In 2011 a report from the Center for a New American Security found \nthat from 2005 to 2010, all across the country a servicemember took his \nor her life almost every 36 hours.\n  Matt Kuntz, the executive director of the Montana chapter of the \nNational Alliance of Mental Illness, has described Montana's suicide \nepidemic as a public health crisis. Matt knows all too well that behind \neach and every one of those numbers is a family and community \ndevastated by the loss. Matt is a veteran himself. In 2007 he lost his \nstepbrother, an Iraq war veteran. I know Matt, and I knew his \nstepbrother. He lost his stepbrother to suicide. His stepbrother was so \nscared, so frightened to go back to Iraq after serving three or four \ntours of duty. He knew--he said to Matt: If I go back, I know I am \ngoing to die. So many of my friends and buddies have died. I know if I \ngo back, I am going to die too.\n  That caused him to be very depressed, and it caused his suicide. So \nmy friend Matt took action. He dedicated himself to raising awareness. \nLargely because of Matt's dedication, the Montana National Guard led \nthe way with a successful pilot program to increase screening of \nveterans both before and after deployment. That is natural in Montana \nbecause, as I said earlier, we are really one big small town. We know \neach other, we want to take action, and we want to get results.\n  I was proud to champion particularly the 2010 Defense authorization \nbill that took the Montana National Guard model, which we developed in \nMontana. With the DOD Defense bill, it is now implemented nationwide. \nNow every branch of the military has implemented screenings. We started \nscreening before kids go over, as soon as they come back, 6 weeks later \nafter they are back, another 6 months later after they are back, just \ncontinually screening, personal screenings. Thousands of health care \nproviders have been trained under this legislation and, most \nimportantly, thousands of servicemembers are now getting personal and \nprivate one-on-one attention from a trained health care provider.\n  There is still a lot more to be done, and I am proud we took steps to \nadvance the ball yesterday by passing the Mental Health ACCESS Act as \nan amendment to the current bill. I applaud Senator Murray for her work \non the measure, and I am proud to be a cosponsor. This provision \ncreates comprehensive standardized suicide prevention within the DOD. \nIt expands eligibility for VA mental health services to family members \nof veterans. It creates more peer-to-peer counseling opportunities, and \nit requires the VA to establish accurate, reliable measures for mental \nhealth services.\n  When duty calls, we in Montana answer proudly. This is about taking \ncare of these men and women just as they have taken care of us. These \npeople put their lives on the line in the name of our State, our \ncountry, and our freedom. We have a responsibility to try to do all we \ncan to help them return to their families and live a reasonable, \nhealthful life back at home. Too many Montanans are suffering in \nsilence, as in other parts of the country.\n  Thank you for the opportunity to bring a voice to this important \ncause. Thank you, Matt, and thank you all for taking action in the \nSenate to further our efforts to give servicemembers and veterans the \ncare and support they deserve.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/29/senate-section/article/S7146-1", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7146-S7148]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING WARREN B. RUDMAN\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to come to the floor today, \nalong with my colleague from New Hampshire, Senator Ayotte, to honor \nthe life and service of a distinguished former Member of this Senate \nand a proud son of New Hampshire, Warren B. Rudman.\n  Senator Rudman was widely and deservedly hailed in both life and now \nin his death as a public servant who reached across party lines to get \nthe job done for his country and his State. Warren Rudman didn't do \nthis out of weakness, he acted so because of the strength and courage \nthat marked his entire life. An Army combat veteran of the Korean \nconflict, Warren Rudman earned a Bronze Star Medal. He was an amateur \nboxer. As the attorney general for the State of New Hampshire, he was\n\n[[Page S7147]]\n\na ferocious prosecutor. His memoir was aptly entitled ``Combat.''\n\n  As a Senator, Warren Rudman relished taking on big battles. In the \n1980s, he joined with Senators Fritz Hollings and Phil Gramm to tackle \ndeficits. If the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act had been followed by \nsubsequent Congresses, we would not be struggling today to reduce \nmassive deficits.\n  He didn't shrink from holding a President of his own party \naccountable either, when he served on the congressional panel \ninvestigating the Iran Contra affair. Nor was he reluctant to hold his \nfellow Senators accountable when he chaired the Senate Ethics \nCommittee.\n  Warren Rudman's public service did not end after he left the Senate. \nMost notably, he cochaired with another former Senator, Gary Hart, a \nnational security commission that correctly predicted a terrorist \nattack within America's borders.\n  Warren Rudman was always blunt and outspoken. During the Iran Contra \nhearings he said to Oliver North:\n\n       The American people have the constitutional right to be \n     wrong. And what Ronald Reagan thinks or Oliver North thinks \n     or what I think or what anybody else thinks matters not a \n     whit.\n\n  He said he left the Senate because Congress was ``stuck in the mud of \nstrident partisanship, excessive ideology, never-ending campaigns.'' \nThat was how he saw Congress 20 years ago. Obviously, he was very aware \nof what was happening in this body.\n  But it was his more quiet work that Warren Rudman was most proud of. \nHis greatest achievement, he said, was his behind-the-scenes efforts to \nget David Souter, another son of New Hampshire, nominated to serve on \nthe Supreme Court.\n  Sometimes forgotten is Senator Rudman's authorship and successful \npush to enact the Small Business Innovation Research Program, which to \nthis day still enables small businesses to compete for Federal research \nand development awards.\n  Warren B. Rudman lived a long and full life. His service graced the \nSenate, and to the end he had New Hampshire granite in his veins.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I join my colleague from New Hampshire, \nSenator Shaheen, in paying tribute to and honoring the life and legacy \nof Warren Rudman. Warren Rudman was a Senator from New Hampshire whose \nintellect, courage, and conviction brought great honor to this \ninstitution.\n  Warren Rudman embodied the very best of New Hampshire: frugal, \nfiercely independent, and totally committed to the common good. He \ndidn't aspire to be a politician, but when he saw his country was \nheaded in the wrong direction, he stepped up to serve, and his focus \nwas always doing the right thing for our country and the people of New \nHampshire.\n  It wasn't the first time Warren Rudman had been called to duty. He \nhad already distinguished himself in the U.S. Army, serving as a combat \nplatoon leader and company commander during the Korean War. It was \nthere that he saw the horrors of war and became convinced of the need \nfor American military supremacy and strength. For his brave service he \nwas presented the Bronze Star.\n  Following his return home, Warren Rudman settled in Nashua, his \nhometown--also my hometown--where he raised his family. After \ncompleting law school, Warren entered private practice, where he \nremained until he was called to serve once again--only this time he was \nrecruited to bring his energy and ideas to New Hampshire State \ngovernment. Warren quickly proved himself as Governor Peterson's chief \nof staff. Then, at age 39, he was appointed to serve as New Hampshire's \nattorney general.\n  I am very proud to have also served as New Hampshire's attorney \ngeneral. In my view, Warren Rudman is probably the greatest attorney \ngeneral to serve in New Hampshire's history. He modernized the office \nof the attorney general to meet the needs of a changing State. He was a \ntough-on-crime attorney general who personally tried criminal cases.\n  Warren Rudman earned a reputation for standing firm on principle even \nwhen it wasn't popular. It was perfect practice for the battles he \nwould later fight in Washington on behalf of the people of this \ncountry.\n  Warren ran for the Senate in 1980 because the issues he cared about \nwere being neglected. He believed in a strong national defense and he \nsaw the Nation's fiscal situation careening dangerously off course. He \nwas worried about the threat that presented to our country's future.\n  As a first-term Senator, Warren Rudman truly made his mark, and that \nis certainly not easy to do. But it showed his character, his \nleadership, and his persistence because Warren Rudman's name will \nforever be linked with his landmark effort to rein in Federal spending. \nThe Gramm-Rudman legislation was born of the bold idea the Federal \nGovernment shouldn't spend beyond its means. When it was signed into \nlaw, annual deficits were $200 billion. Imagine how much better off we \nwould be if we had heeded Warren Rudman's warnings and truly followed \nthrough on the work he did in this body.\n  Warren's zeal for responsible government went beyond reducing \nspending. As a former prosecutor, he was seen by his colleagues as \nsomeone who was committed to fairness, truth, and independence. When \nthe Iran Contra scandal erupted in 1986, the Senate moved to \ninvestigate and Warren Rudman was selected to serve as the committee's \ntop Republican. At the outset, he made one thing clear, and that always \nguided Warren Rudman in everything he did. This is what he said:\n  ``I consider myself an American first and a Republican second.''\n  That was a commitment he kept, helping to lead a nonpartisan inquiry \nthat pursued the facts. He saw himself as asking tough questions on \nbehalf of the American people and he expected answers. With the Nation \nin turmoil, Warren Rudman stood firm for the rule of law. His rigorous \ncommitment to uncovering the truth brought credit to this body and \ngreat pride to the people of New Hampshire.\n\n  Of course, representing their interests was always Warren Rudman's \ntrue passion. Warren Rudman had New Hampshire in his blood and he \nbrought New Hampshire common sense to Capitol Hill. While Warren was at \nthe center of some of the most consequential debates in Washington, he \nalways put his constituents first. In fact, legislation he authored to \nhelp small businesses continues to benefit entrepreneurs to this day in \nthe Granite State.\n  Shortly after arriving in the Senate, the first bill he introduced on \nbehalf of the State of New Hampshire and our country was a bill called \nthe Small Business Innovation Research Act, which was aimed at \nbolstering small high-tech companies in New Hampshire and across the \nNation. To this day, the SBIR Program continues to help small defense \nand technology companies through competitive grants, and it has been a \nvery important program. That was the idea of Warren Rudman the day he \ncame to the Senate, which is so impressive, and Senator Shaheen and I \nhave proudly worked together across party lines to make sure this \nimportant program continues to be effective.\n  Warren Rudman will be remembered as a statesman, someone who loved \nhis country and wanted to make it better. In bidding farewell to the \nSenate in 1992, he expressed gratitude for the opportunity to serve \nwith such talented colleagues in this esteemed body. He also expressed \nhis hopes for the future of this body, and this is what he said: ``It \nis a very special place, with very special people, and I hope in the \ncoming years the institution can coalesce to bring those talents \ntogether in a bipartisan way to do what is good for America.''\n  As our country continues to face great challenges, may all of us \nremain mindful of Warren Rudman's wise words and the powerful example \nhe set for this body. Granite Staters throughout all New Hampshire \nmourn his loss, but we will never forget his legacy as an esteemed \nrepresentative of the people of New Hampshire and someone who always \nput America first.\n  Mr. LEAHY. It was a pleasure and an honor for this Senator to serve \nside by side with the late Senator from New Hampshire, Warren Rudman.\n\n[[Page S7148]]\n\n  As we in New England knew and, of course, as the people of New \nHampshire, and we neighbors in Vermont, especially knew--he was a \nskilled and accomplished legislator. He was a credit to this body. He \nwas a catalyst for reform. He always kept his word. What was most \nimportant to me personally is that he was a good and close friend. We \ntraveled together, we worked together, and we never let our different \npolitical parties get in the way of doing things that helped our part \nof the country or our country at large.\n  I think he was shaped by his experience as well as by his Yankee \norigins. An Army combat infantry commander, he saw much action during \nthe Korean conflict before coming to the Senate. He had been a widely \nrespected attorney general from New Hampshire.\n  Senator Rudman embodied the characteristics that many of us call the \nold school of Senate values. We served together on the Appropriations \nCommittee. We often worked together on national issues, as well as on \nbehalf of our two adjoining States. As I said earlier, I quickly \nlearned that when Warren Rudman gave his word, you could count on it.\n  He served during a time when Senators would readily put aside party \naffiliations to work together. When progress required compromise, as it \nusually does, he was able to help chart the way forward to accommodate \ndifferent viewpoints and interests. Regrettably, that kind of \nbipartisanship at this point in the Senate's history is too rare, and I \nthink we have to work to recapture it.\n  In the can-do Yankee spirit, he took on difficult challenges and \nstuck with them. From national security and foreign affairs to budget \npolicy, he dug into pressing and often prickly issues, and he made a \ndifference.\n  Well after his retirement from this body--a voluntary retirement--he \ncontinued to serve the country he loved so deeply. Well before the \nattacks on our Nation of September 11, 2001, he and former Senator Gary \nHart headed a national advisory panel investigating the threat of \ninternational terrorism. The sobering conclusions they reached about \nour susceptibility to terrorist attacks were prescient, but largely \nforgotten, until 9/11.\n  When I was asked to serve on the advisory board of the Warren B. \nRudman Center for Justice, Leadership and Public Policy at the \nUniversity of New Hampshire, of course I was pleased to accept. His \nlegacy will be reflected well at the Rudman Center, just as his legacy \nof service and accomplishment will continue to be reflected and \nappreciated in this body.\n  Madam President, as I say this, it seems perfectly fitting that the \ndistinguished senior Senator from New Hampshire is presiding: The \nSenate, and the Nation, are better for Warren Rudman's service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/29/senate-section/article/S7148-1", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7148-S7206]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2013--Continued\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3096, as Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

COMPLETION OF ACCELERATED TRANSITION OF UNITED \n                   STATES COMBAT AND MILITARY AND SECURITY \n                   OPERATIONS TO THE GOVERNMENT OF AFGHANISTAN.\n\n       (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the President should, in coordination with the Government of \n     Afghanistan, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) member \n     countries, and other allies in Afghanistan, seek to--\n       (1) undertake all appropriate activities to accomplish the \n     President's stated goal of transitioning the lead \n     responsibility for security to the Government of Afghanistan \n     by mid-summer 2013;\n       (2) as part of accomplishing this transition of the lead \n     responsibility for security to the Government of Afghanistan, \n     draw down United States troops to a level sufficient to meet \n     this goal;\n       (3) as previously announced by the President, continue to \n     draw down United States troop levels at a steady pace through \n     the end of 2014; and\n       (4) end all regular combat operations by United States \n     troops by not later than December 31, 2014, and take all \n     possible steps to end such operations at the earliest date \n     consistent with a safe and orderly draw down of United States \n     troops in Afghanistan.\n       (b) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be \n     construed to recommend or support any limitation or \n     prohibition on any authority of the President--\n       (1) to modify the military strategy, tactics, and \n     operations of United States Armed Forces as such Armed Forces \n     redeploy from Afghanistan;\n       (2) to authorize United States forces in Afghanistan to \n     defend themselves whenever they may be threatened;\n       (3) to attack Al Qaeda forces wherever such forces are \n     located;\n       (4) to provide financial support and equipment to the \n     Government of Afghanistan for the training and supply of \n     Afghanistan military and security forces; or\n       (5) to gather, provide, and share intelligence with United \n     States allies operating in Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to be able to present this \namendment in this Chamber. I appreciate that my lead cosponsor Rand \nPaul and nine other Senators have signed on to sponsor this amendment.\n  This amendment is designed to help draw down the war in Afghanistan \nin a timely and responsible manner. It is time to bring home our sons \nand daughters, our brothers and sisters, our husbands and our wives as \nquickly and as safely as possible and put an end to America's longest \nwar.\n  We went to Afghanistan with two objectives: destroy al-Qaida training \ncamps and hunt down those responsible for 9/11. Our capable American \ntroops and NATO partners have accomplished those goals. Afghanistan is \nno longer, and has not been for years, an important hub for al-Qaida \nactivity. Al-Qaida has robust operations in a number of nations around \nthe world, including Yemen and Somalia, but not in Afghanistan.\n  American forces have also accomplished the second objective: \ncapturing or killing those who attacked America on 9/11. So it is time \nto put an end to this war.\n  Simply put, we are currently in the midst of a nation-building \nstrategy that is not working. It simply makes no sense to have nearly \n70,000 troops on the ground in Afghanistan when the biggest terrorist \nthreats are elsewhere.\n  Our President recognizes this fact and has committed to a steady \ncourse of drawing down troop levels and handing over security \nresponsibilities to the Government of Afghanistan. In contrast, the \nHouse-passed version of this bill calls for keeping at least 68,000 \ntroops in Afghanistan through the end of 2014.\n  Let me give some details about what this short amendment does. It is \na sense of Congress resolution that the President should undertake all \nappropriate activities to accomplish his stated goal of transitioning \nthe lead responsibility for security to the Government of Afghanistan \nby midsummer 2013.\n  This is the President's goal, and our team has been working to make \nthis happen; second, as a part of accomplishing this transition of lead \nresponsibility for security to the Government of Afghanistan, drive \ndown United States troops to a level sufficient to meet this goal.\n  Third, as previously announced by the President, continue to draw \ndown U.S. troop levels at a steady pace through the end of 2014; and, \nvery importantly, end all regular combat operations by the U.S. troops \nby not later than December 31, 2014, and take all possible steps to end \nsuch operations earlier if it can be done in a manner consistent with a \nsafe and orderly drawdown of U.S. troops.\n  This amendment very clearly sets out that it is not to be construed \nthat we are recommending or supporting any limitation or prohibition on \nany authority of the President to modify the military strategy, \ntactics, and operations of the U.S. Armed Forces as such Armed Forces \nredeploy from Afghanistan. It also clearly notes that we are not \ninterfering in any way with the\n\n[[Page S7149]]\n\nability of the United States to authorize forces in Afghanistan to \ndefend themselves whenever they may be threatened or to attack al-Qaida \nforces wherever such forces are located. Moreover, we are not limiting \nin any way the provision of financial support and equipment to the \nGovernment of Afghanistan for the training and supply of Afghan \nmilitary and security forces, nor are we interfering with the gathering \nof intelligence.\n  Essentially, the amendment boils down to this: Mr. President, you \nhave laid out a course to end this war, and we support you in this \neffort and encourage you to continue this effort and, if conditions \nallow, to accelerate the pace.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have looked at the amendment by the \nSenator from Oregon. He has made some modifications that I think are \nappropriate, and this side has no objection. I understand, however, \nthat he will insist on a recorded vote, which is his right. But I see \nat this time no objection to the amendment as he describes it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I appreciate the partnership of my \ncolleague from Arizona.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2995\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \nmeasure be set aside, and I call up amendment No. 2995.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. Portman] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2995.\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To enhance authorities relating to the admission of defense \n    industry civilians to certain Department of Defense educational \n                       institutions and programs)\n\n       At the end of subtitle E of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1048. ENHANCEMENT OF AUTHORITIES ON ADMISSION OF DEFENSE \n                   INDUSTRY CIVILIANS TO CERTAIN DEPARTMENT OF \n                   DEFENSE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Navy Defense Product Development Program.--Section \n     7049(a) of title 10, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in the second sentence, by inserting ``or professional \n     continuing education certificate'' after ``master's degree'';\n       (2) in the third sentence, by striking ``125 such defense \n     industry employees'' and inserting ``250 such defense \n     industry employees''; and\n       (3) in the last sentence, by inserting before the period at \n     the end the following: ``or an appropriate professional \n     continuing education certificate, as applicable''.\n       (b) United States Air Force Institute of Technology.--\n     Section 9314a(a) of such title is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (1), by inserting ``or professional \n     continuing education certificate'' after ``graduate degree'';\n       (2) in paragraph (2), by striking ``125 defense industry \n     employees'' and inserting ``250 defense industry employees''; \n     and\n       (3) in paragraph (3), by inserting before the period at the \n     end the following: ``or an appropriate professional \n     continuing education certificate, as applicable''.\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, this amendment is intended to expand the \nopportunities for defense industry employees to attend or participate \nin Department of Defense educational institutions and programs.\n  Specifically, the amendment will broaden the existing statute that \nauthorizes defense industry employees to obtain a master's degree at \nDefense Department schools, such as the Naval Postgraduate School, by \nalso allowing them to obtain professional continuing educational \ncertification.\n  Having key members of the defense industry exposed to the unique \ncourses offered at these institutions is a win-win for the Federal \nGovernment. The industry pays the tuition and covers all costs \nassociated with their attendance, and in the process our defense \nindustry partners gain greater expertise in the military application of \nengineering and science, as well as acquisition and program management \nexpertise.\n  Again, I believe this is a win-win for the government, and I ask for \na voice vote of the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will suspend.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I don't know of any further debate on this \nside on the Portman amendment. We support it, and we have no objection \nto it going to a voice vote at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2995) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. AYOTTE.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\nAmendments Nos. 2948, 2962, 2971, 2986, 2989, 3085, 3110, 3166, 2981 En \n                                  Bloc\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wish now to call up a list of nine \namendments, which have been cleared by myself and the ranking member, \nby Senator McCain: Webb amendment No. 2948, Sessions amendment No. \n2962, Inhofe amendment No. 2971, Casey amendment No. 2986, Murray \namendment No. 2989, Vitter amendment No. 3085, Coburn amendment 3110, \nManchin amendment No. 3166, and Boxer amendment No. 2981.

Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nconsider these amendments en bloc, the amendments be agreed to, and the \nmotions to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments were agreed to, as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2948\n\n (Purpose: To extend the authority to provide a temporary increase in \n   rates of basic allowance for housing under certain circumstances)\n\n       At the end of subtitle A of title VI, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 602. EXTENSION OF AUTHORITY TO PROVIDE TEMPORARY \n                   INCREASE IN RATES OF BASIC ALLOWANCE FOR \n                   HOUSING UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES.\n\n       Section 403(b)(7)(E) of title 37, United States Code, is \n     amended by striking ``December 31, 2012'' and inserting \n     ``December 31, 2013''.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2962\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of Congress on the submittal to Congress \nof the homeland defense hedging policy and strategy of the Secretary of \n                                Defense)\n\n       At the end of C subtitle of title II, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 238. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE SUBMITTAL TO CONGRESS OF \n                   THE HOMELAND DEFENSE HEDGING POLICY AND \n                   STRATEGY REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Section 233 of the National Defense Authorization Act \n     for Fiscal Year 2012 (Public\n\n[[Page S7150]]\n\n     Law 112-81; 125 Stat. 1340) requires a homeland defense \n     hedging policy and strategy report from the Secretary of \n     Defense.\n       (2) The report was required to be submitted not later than \n     75 days after the date of the enactment of the National \n     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, namely by \n     March 16, 2012.\n       (3) The Secretary of Defense has not yet submitted the \n     report as required.\n       (4) In March 2012, General Charles Jacoby, Jr., Commander \n     of the United States Northern Command, the combatant command \n     responsible for operation of the Ground-based Midcourse \n     Defense system to defend the homeland against ballistic \n     missile threats, testified before Congress that ``I am \n     confident in my ability to successfully defend the homeland \n     from the current set of limited long-range ballistic missile \n     threats'', and that ``[a]gainst current threats from the \n     Middle East, I am confident we are well postured''.\n       (5) Phase 4 of the European Phased Adaptive Approach (EPAA) \n     is intended to augment the currently deployed homeland \n     defense capability of the Ground-based Midcourse Defense \n     system against a potential future Iranian long-range missile \n     threat by deploying an additional layer of forward-deployed \n     interceptors in Europe in the 2020 timeframe.\n       (6) The Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, \n     has testified to Congress that, although the intelligence \n     community does ``not know if Iran will eventually decide to \n     build nuclear weapons'', it judges ``that Iran would likely \n     choose missile delivery as its preferred method of delivering \n     a nuclear weapon''. He also testified that ``Iran already has \n     the largest inventory of ballistic missiles in the Middle \n     East, and it is expanding the scale, reach, and \n     sophistication of its ballistic missile forces, many of which \n     are inherently capable of carrying a nuclear payload''.\n       (7) The 2012 Annual Report to Congress on the Military \n     Power of Iran by the Department of Defense states that, in \n     addition to increasing its missile inventories, ``Iran has \n     boosted the lethality and effectiveness of its existing \n     missile systems with accuracy improvements and new \n     submunitions payloads'', and that it continues to develop \n     missiles that can strike Israel and Eastern Europe. It also \n     states that ``Iran has launched multistage space launch \n     vehicles that could serve as a testbed for developing long-\n     range ballistic missiles technologies'', and that ``[w]ith \n     sufficient foreign assistance, Iran may be technically \n     capable of flight-testing an intercontinental ballistic \n     missile by 2015''.\n       (8) Despite the failure of its April 2012 satellite launch \n     attempt, North Korea warned the United States in October 2012 \n     that the United States mainland is within range of its \n     missiles.\n       (9) The threat of limited ballistic missile attack against \n     the United States homeland from countries such as North Korea \n     and Iran is increasing.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that--\n       (1) the homeland defense hedging policy and strategy report \n     required by section 233 of the National Defense Authorization \n     Act for Fiscal Year 2012 is necessary to inform Congress on \n     options to protect the United States homeland against the \n     evolving ballistic missile threat, including potential \n     options prior to the deployment of Phase 4 of the European \n     Phased Adaptive Approach to missile defense; and\n       (2) the Secretary of Defense should comply with the \n     requirements of section 233 of the National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 by submitting the \n     homeland defense hedging policy and strategy report to \n     Congress.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2971\n\n   (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate on the protection of \n Department of Defense airfields, training airspace, and air training \n                                routes)\n\n       At the end of subtitle H of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1084.

SUBCONTRACTOR NOTIFICATIONS.\n\n       Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d)) \n     is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(13) Notification Requirement.--An offeror with respect \n     to a contract let by a Federal agency that is to be awarded \n     pursuant to the negotiated method of procurement that intends \n     to identify a small business concern as a potential \n     subcontractor in the offer relating to the contract shall \n     notify the small business concern that the offeror intends to \n     identify the small business concern as a potential \n     subcontractor in the offer.\n       ``(14) Reporting by Subcontractors.--The Administrator \n     shall establish a reporting mechanism that allows a \n     subcontractor to report fraudulent activity by a contractor \n     with respect to a subcontracting plan submitted to a \n     procurement authority under paragraph (4)(B).''.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2989\n\n(Purpose: To extend the authority of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs \n   and the Secretary of Labor to carry out a program of referral and \n    counseling services to veterans at risk of homelessness who are \n                transitioning from certain institutions)\n\n       At the end of subtitle H of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1084.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, briefly I was just going over the list of \namendments that have been filed. I urge my colleagues who want those \namendments considered to come over and state their intention and we \nwill move forward with the amendments. I keep hearing from my staff \nthis Senator is not ready yet, that Senator is not ready yet. I hope \nthey come over, we get these amendments in order and we will dispose of \nthem as soon as possible since we are looking at a rather late evening \nthis evening, and even tomorrow.\n  We need to move these amendments. I hope my colleagues will cooperate \nby coming over prepared to offer those amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator from West Virginia wishes now to speak on the \nMerkley amendment. Then it is our intention to move to a vote on the \nMerkley amendment.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 3096\n\n  Amendment No. 3096 would express the Sense of Congress in support of \nthe President's stated goals for transitioning the security lead to the \nAfghanistan and end the U.S. combat mission in Afghanistan by no later \nthan December 31, 2014. The Sense of Congress supports the goals of: \nAccomplishing the President's stated goal of transitioning the lead \nresponsibility for security to the Government of Afghanistan by mid-\n2013; as part of that transition, drawing down U.S. troops to the \nminimum level required to meet that goal; continuing the drawdown of \nU.S. troop levels at a steady pace through the end of 2014; and ending \n``all regular combat operations'' by U.S. troops by not later than the \nend of 2014, and earlier to the extent consistent with a safe and \norderly drawdown of U.S. troops in Afghanistan.\n  The Merkley amendment is consistent with President's plans for \ndrawing down U.S. troops in Afghanistan, and it is consistent with our \nbest chances for success in securing Afghanistan.\n  It expresses this body's support for the President's transition goals \nwhich include the handover to Afghan security forces of primary \nresponsibility for security throughout Afghanistan by mid-2013 and the \ncompletion of the security transition process by the end of 2014.\n  Transitioning to Afghan forces in the lead is the roadmap to security \nin Afghanistan. It challenges the Taliban narrative that commanders \nneed to defend Afghanistan from foreign troops seeking to occupy their \ncountry. As Afghan officials recently told me, when they realize they \nare fighting their fellow Afghans in the Afghan Army, some mid-level \nTaliban commanders have decided to put aside their arms and seek to re-\nintegrate into Afghan society.\n  The Afghan people want to see their own Afghan Army soldiers and \nAfghan police personnel providing security for their communities. A \nrecent public opinion poll in Afghanistan found that the overwhelming \nmajority of the Afghan people have moderate or high confidence in the \nAfghan Army--93 percent. The Afghan police are also gaining the \nconfidence of the Afghan people--82 percent confidence.\n  Afghan security forces have shown they are willing to fight. So far \nthis year, Afghan soldiers and police have suffered more casualties--\nwounded and killed--than have U.S. and coalition forces.\n  As Afghan security forces assume more and more responsibility for the \nsecurity lead between now and the end of 2014, NATO and coalition \nforces will gradually step back into a supporting role and then an \noverwatch role.\n  The Merkley amendment reaffirms the President's plan to end U.S. \ncombat operations in Afghanistan by not later than the end of 2014. \nThis is also what was agreed by coalition partners at the NATO Summit \nin Chicago in May, when the U.S. and its allies declared, ``By the end \nof 2014, when the Afghan Authorities will have full security \nresponsibility, the NATO-led combat mission will end.'' They also \nagreed to begin planning a new post-2014 training mission, which ``will \nnot be a combat mission.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment of my \ncolleague, Senator Merkley from Oregon, his amendment on Afghanistan. I \nknow we all have good ideas. We all have input here. We all have our \nown personal opinions. But it is time to bring our troops home from \nAfghanistan. They have been there since October 7, 2001. They have \ndefeated al-Qaida, they have killed Osama bin Laden, and it is time to \nbring them home.\n  Mr. President, 66,000 American combat troops still remain in \nAfghanistan. President Obama plans to reduce that number by ``a steady \npace'' until they are moved completely out by the end of 2014. I would \nprefer a faster pace, as many of my colleague would, but as long as it \ndid not jeopardize the safety of troops, because I think that is the \nmost important thing we do. After all, the war has already surpassed \nthe Vietnam war, your area and mine, Mr. President, as the longest in \nAmerican history. It has already cost us dearly; more than 2,000 \nAmerican troops have died for the cause and many thousands more have \nbeen maimed and more than $500 billion has been spent just in \nAfghanistan.\n  Even so, I support the bipartisan amendment sponsored by Senator \nMerkley. It backs the President's current plan to end combat operations \nin Afghanistan by the end of 2014, but I support it because it also \ncalls for a quicker transition of security operations from U.S. forces \nto Afghan security forces. Instead of the end of 2014, the amendment \nurges the transition to take place in the summer of 2013, this coming \nyear. That, hopefully, would bring a quicker end to the U.S. \ninvolvement in combat in Afghanistan. This amendment merely expresses \nthe sense of the Senate. It is not binding on President Obama and it \nwill not affect any negotiations between Washington and Kabul on \nwhether a residual force of U.S. military advisers in Afghanistan would \nbe there after 2014.\n  U.S. forces went to Afghanistan in pursuit of those who planned and \nordered the September 11 terrorist attacks on the United States that \nkilled over 3,000 of our citizens. With valor and courage they drove \nfrom power the Taliban, which had given bin Laden a base from which he \ncould launch horrific attacks on innocent American civilians. They \ncaptured, killed, or brought to justice the leader of al-Qaida and \neventually they tracked down bin Laden himself and made sure he would \nnever, ever harm another American.\n  After more than 10 years, more than 1,900 American lives, and more \nthan $500 billion, it is time to bring our warriors home to a hero's \nwelcome, time to focus our resources on rebuilding America, not on \nrebuilding Afghanistan. I have said many times on this floor, if you \nhelp us build a new road or bridge in West Virginia, help us build a \nschool for our children, we will not blow it up or burn it down.\n  It is time to help rebuild America for this great country and bring \nour heroes back to a hero's welcome.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S7152]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we are now going to proceed to a vote on \nthe Merkley amendment. As I indicated, the amendment expresses the \nsupport of this body for the transition goals of the President, \nincluding the handover to Afghan security forces of primary \nresponsibility for security throughout Afghanistan by mid-2013, the \ncompletion of the security transition process by the end of 2014--and \nof course that has to do with the completion and transition. That is \nnot necessarily by any means a withdrawal of all troops but it is the \nintent that all combat forces be withdrawn by the end of 2014. I \nemphasize it is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution.\n  After the disposition of the Merkley amendment, we then intend to \nmove to the Whitehouse amendment. The Whitehouse amendment has been \ncleared by the chairman and ranking member of the committee of \njurisdiction. However, there is a desire to debate and have a rollcall \non that amendment. We are asking Senator Whitehouse to be prepared \nimmediately after this vote to call up formally and debate his \namendment and any opponent or opponents of the amendment to be prepared \nto debate it at that time. So it is our intent--and I ask unanimous \nconsent--that immediately following the vote on the pending Merkley \namendment, we then move to the Whitehouse amendment, and following the \ndisposition of the Whitehouse amendment we then move to the Coburn \namendment No. 3109, which will require debate, and, hopefully, we can \nwork out a time agreement with Senator Coburn during this vote.\n\n  Finally, we are urging Senators who have amendments we have not yet \naddressed that they intend to press, or hope they can press, to meet \nwith us during this vote so we can continue to make progress on this \nbill. We will be in tomorrow unless by some wonderful events we are \nable to finish this bill tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I agree with the unanimous consent \nrequest----\n  Mr. Levin addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am sorry, I say to my friend from Arizona. We have to \nwithdraw that unanimous consent request on amendment No. 3109 at this \ntime. I want to try to see what the problem is. There is an objection \nto my request on this side. We are going to try to work out those \nobjections during this rollcall vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I have to object on this side. Senator Coburn wants the \nsame privilege every Senator has; that is, to bring up his amendment. \nIf someone objects to that, I hope that Senator will come down and \nobject in person because this is holding up the progress of the bill. \nSo if there is a Whitehouse amendment that is agreed to, then a Coburn \namendment certainly should be allowed as well.\n  So we have to object to the unanimous consent request. Hopefully, \nduring the vote on the Merkley amendment we can work out some \nagreement.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We understand Senator Merkley is on his way and wishes to \nspeak for a minute on his own amendment, so I note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of my amendment \nNo. 3096 to express the sense of Congress on the accelerated transition \nof U.S. combat and military security operations for the Government of \nAfghanistan.\n  Our President has laid out a course of action that involves putting \nAfghan troops in charge of the operation in Afghanistan. This amendment \nfully supports the schedule the President has laid out. Furthermore, it \ncalls upon the President to explore every opportunity to see if that \nschedule can be accelerated; that we can, with security for our troops \nand appropriateness for our mission, withdraw at a faster pace.\n  The two main objectives in Afghanistan were to take out the al-Qaida \ntraining camps and to proceed to pursue those responsible for 9/11. We \nhave effectively pursued those missions. Al-Qaida is now much stronger \naround the rest of the world. A counterterrorism strategy that is \nappropriate in the rest of the world is appropriate in Afghanistan and \nit should be pursued. But the newly adopted mission of nation building \nin Afghanistan has gone terribly off the track and put our troops at \ngreat risk. We need to endorse the President's strategy and end this \nwar--the longest war the United States has ever experienced.\n  I ask for the support of my colleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Missouri (Mrs. \nMcCaskill) and the Senator from Oregon (Mrs. Wyden) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom South Carolina (Mr. DeMint), the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nHeller), and the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Kirk).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 62, nays 33, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 210 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--62\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Bingaman\n     Blumenthal\n     Boxer\n     Brown (MA)\n     Brown (OH)\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Coons\n     Corker\n     Durbin\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Grassley\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Hoeven\n     Inouye\n     Johnson (SD)\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Lee\n     Levin\n     Lugar\n     Manchin\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Moran\n     Murray\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Paul\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Thune\n     Toomey\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n\n                                NAYS--33\n\n     Alexander\n     Ayotte\n     Barrasso\n     Blunt\n     Boozman\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coats\n     Coburn\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     Enzi\n     Graham\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Johnson (WI)\n     Kyl\n     Lieberman\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Portman\n     Pryor\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Rubio\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Vitter\n     Wicker\n\n                             NOT VOTING--5\n\n     DeMint\n     Heller\n     Kirk\n     McCaskill\n     Wyden\n  The amendment (No. 3096) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I move to lay that motion upon the table.\n  The motion to lay upon the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, what we wish to do now is move to Senator \nBlumenthal's amendment which has been cleared and I believe can be \nvoice-voted. I think that is the current situation.\n  Then as soon as that is done, I hope we will have an announcement as \nto where we go next. With the cooperation of one Senator, whom I do not \nsee on the floor, we may be able to go to Senator Whitehouse's \namendment, but I cannot quite announce that yet because we have to find \nthat Senator and make sure that is not objected to. I would hope the \nchair would now recognize Senator Blumenthal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3124, as Modified\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague, \nthe chairman of the Armed Services Committee, as well as the ranking \nmember, Senator McCain, for their leadership on this issue and ask \nunanimous consent that my amendment 3124 be made\n\n[[Page S7153]]\n\npending, as modified with the changes that are at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Blumenthal] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3124, as modified.\n\n  The amendment No. 3124, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title VIII, add the following:\n\n        Subtitle F--Ending Trafficking in Government Contracting\n\n     SEC. 891.

MONITORING AND INVESTIGATION OF TRAFFICKING IN \n                   PERSONS.\n\n       (a) Referral and Investigation.--\n       (1) Referral.--If the contracting or grant officer of an \n     executive agency for a grant, contract, or cooperative \n     agreement receives credible information that a recipient of \n     the grant, contract, or cooperative agreement; any subgrantee \n     or subcontractor of the recipient; or any agent of the \n     recipient or of such a subgrantee or subcontractor, has \n     engaged in an activity described in section 106(g) of the \n     Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (22 U.S.C. \n     7104(g)), as amended by section 893, including a report from \n     a contracting officer representative, an auditor, an alleged \n     victim or victim's representative, or any other credible \n     source, the contracting or grant officer shall promptly refer \n     the matter to the agency's Office of Inspector General for \n     investigation. The contracting officer may also direct the \n     contractor to take specific steps to abate an alleged \n     violation or enforce the requirements of a compliance plan \n     implemented pursuant to section 894.\n       (2) Investigation.--Where appropriate, an Inspector General \n     who receives credible information that a recipient of the \n     grant, contract, or cooperative agreement; any subgrantee or \n     subcontractor of the recipient; or any agent of the recipient \n     or of such a subgrantee or subcontractor, has engaged in an \n     activity described in section 106(g) of the Trafficking \n     Victims Protection Act of 2000 (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)), as \n     amended by section 893, pursuant to a referral under \n     paragraph (1) or otherwise, shall promptly initiate an \n     investigation of the matter. In the event that an Inspector \n     General does not initiate an investigation, the Inspector \n     General shall provide an explanation for the decision not to \n     investigate.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Very simply, this amendment involves commonsense \nreforms that will ensure the performance of overseas contracts, paid \nfor by our taxpayers, involving money in this very Defense budget, \nconsistent with the values that we hold dear as Americans.\n  The Department of Defense has a special responsibility to lead in \npreventing human trafficking overseas, as this amendment would do. It \nis not only a matter of humane and moral values, it is a matter of \ngetting value for the dollars we spend in protecting our national \nsecurity.\n  The United States has and ought to have a zero-tolerance policy \nagainst government employees and contractor personnel engaging in any \nform of human trafficking. These values are transcendent of party \nlines, of any other interests. I am very proud to offer this amendment, \nin fact, with strong support across the aisle, led by my colleague \nSenator Portman who has joined me in forming a human trafficking caucus \nto lead the way on these issues. This amendment is the result of \nefforts we have led and very simply represents the most comprehensive \nlegislative effort ever undertaken in the Congress to stamp out human \ntrafficking in overseas contracting.\n  I am happy to yield to my colleague from Ohio, Senator Portman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from \nConnecticut in offering this amendment, which is modeled on the \nbipartisan legislation we introduced in March along\n\n[[Page S7154]]\n\nwith a number of Senators on both sides of the aisle.\n  We also recently joined to form a Senate caucus to end human \ntrafficking, and I appreciate the chair and ranking member today for \nallowing this amendment to move forward.\n  The aim of this amendment is pretty simple. This amendment ensures \nthat our contingency contracting dollars are spent in a manner that is \nconsistent, as Senator Blumenthal said, with our deeply held values as \na country. This is particularly important in the context of wartime \ncontracting and reconstruction work.\n  This amendment comes from the work that both DOD and State Department \nIGs have done. The inspectors general have told us we lack sufficient \nmonitoring to have the kind of visiblity we need under the labor \npractices by our contractors and subcontractors who rely on a lot of \nthird-party nationals to do overseas work.\n  It also comes from the Wartime Contracting Commission, which has \nreported what is described as evidence of the recurrent problem of \ntrafficking in persons by labor brokers or subcontractors of \ncontingency contractors. The report concluded that existing \nprohibitions on such trafficking have failed to suppress it.\n  One of the commission members, a former Reagan and Bush \nadministration defense official, testified before our committee, saying \nthose findings were, in his assessment, just the tip of the iceberg. So \nI think this legislation is appropriate. It directly affects this issue \nthat has been raised now by the IG and by the Wartime Contracting \nCommission. This is a commonsense approach to it.\n  Broadly defined, we believe this will help to deal with the human \ntrafficking issue that has been identified. It deals with recruiting \nworkers to leave their home countries based on fraudulent promises, \nconfiscating passports, limiting the ability of workers to return home, \ncharging workers so-called recruitment fees that consume more than a \nmonth's salary, just to name some of the abuses that have been \nidentified.\n  I think it should be clear that the overwhelming majority of these \ncontractors and subcontractors are law abiding, but we need to be sure \nthese abusive labor practices are dealt with. This legislation will do \nso. I thank my colleague for raising it today. I am proud to join him \nin cosponsoring the legislation.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I think we are now willing to proceed to \ndisposition on the Blumenthal amendment. I don't know if anyone wants \nto speak further on that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment No. 3124, as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent to set the pending amendment \naside for the consideration of amendment No. 2972.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator----\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I wonder if we could ask unanimous \nconsent at this point to take up the Inhofe amendment. We know of no \nobjection to it. Rather than setting any amendment aside, just simply \nsend it to the desk.\n  Is the amendment at the desk? Just call up the amendment, if the \nSenator would.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2972\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 2972.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma (Mr. Inhofe) proposes an \n     amendment No. 2972.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of Congress that the bugle call commonly \nknown as ``Taps'' should be designated as the National Song of Military \n                              Remembrance)\n\n       At the end of subtitle H of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1084. SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT THE BUGLE CALL COMMONLY \n                   KNOWN AS TAPS SHOULD BE DESIGNATED AS THE \n                   NATIONAL SONG OF MILITARY REMEMBRANCE.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the bugle call commonly \n     known as ``Taps'' should be designated as the National Song \n     of Military Remembrance.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, this is something that I know will be \naccepted by both sides, by every Member in here. It is a request by all \nthe associations, the veterans and all the others. It is something I \nwasn't familiar with until fairly recently, and that is, in July of \n1862, following the Seven Days Battles, Union GEN Daniel Butterfield \nand bugler Oliver Wilcox Norton created ``Taps'' at Berkeley Plantation \nin Virginia.\n  This is something we are all familiar with, those of us who served in \nthe military. We know what ``Taps'' is. It is a big deal to a lot of \npeople, but it has never had an official designation. We have an \namendment now that would be a sense-of-the-Senate that would designate \nthe bugle call commonly known as ``Taps'' to be designated as a \nnational military song of military remembrance. The reason I think it \nis significant to do it is it raises the song known as ``Taps'' to a \nnational level of significance, specifically for the military veterans \nas a tribute when played during military funerals and ceremonies. This \nis a request of various veterans organizations, and I would ask that it \nbe adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We know of no objection to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2972) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I move to lay the motion on the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I would now ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Udall of Colorado be recognized for 5 minutes to speak as \nthough in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I thank the chairman and \nranking member of the Armed Services Committee for the recognition. I \nam a proud member of that committee, and I am also a member of the \nIntelligence Committee. From those vantage points, I am well aware of \nthe threats that face our country.\n  Our military and our intelligence communities have to be prepared to \ncounter threats from a wide range of enemies and bad actors. As we all \nknow, our national security community is decisively engaged against \nthose who would do us harm. When we capture those who are plotting \nagainst us, we are swiftly bringing them to justice by trying and \nconvicting those terrorists in civilian courts and, when appropriate, \nin military commissions.\n  This is a flexible strategy that has empowered our terrorism \ncommunity to help keep Americans safe since 9/11, and those brave men \nand women who spend every waking hour defending this country have been \nsuccessfully using our laws to pursue terrorists around the globe. But \nlast year Congress changed some of those laws, against the wishes of \nour military and intelligence communities. Those detainee provisions \nlast year suggest that our military should shift significant resources \naway from their mission and to instead act as both a domestic law \nenforcement agency and jailer with respect to terrorist suspects. They \nalso call into question the principles we as Americans hold dear, \nbecause they could be interpreted as allowing the military to capture \nand indefinitely detain American citizens on U.S. soil without trial.\n  I joined our highest ranking national security officials in warning \nmy colleagues about the dangerous change\n\n[[Page S7155]]\n\nthat such policies would make and I urge us not to pass them. We have \nto get our detainee and counterterrorism policies right, but \nunfortunately I believe the policies that were enacted last year \ncomplicate our capacity to prosecute the war on terror and in the \nprocess erode our Nation's constitutional principles, both of which \nconcern all of us.\n  I have been working with the administration to ensure that those \ndetention policies are not harmfully interpreted, but the law itself \nremains a problem. Several of my colleagues, including the Senator from \nKentucky and the chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, \nSenator Feinstein, have suggested changes to the law that will help \nrepair the flawed policies enacted last year.\n  I have also crafted my own legislation working with the ranking \nmember on the House Armed Services Committee, Congressman Adam Smith \nfrom Washington, to repair some of the harm that I believe was done in \nlast year's NDAA. I filed that bill to this year's NDAA as amendment \nNo. 3115, along with the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, \nSenator Leahy.\n  Senators Feinstein and Paul have a slightly similar but different \napproach, created as a result of the detainee provisions passed last \nyear. There are efforts under way to assure that whatever path we take \nforward is supported by the greatest numbers possible, and I look \nforward to being part of those important discussions.\n  I know we addressed this issue in part last year, but in speaking \nwith other Members I know there is a renewed interest in getting our \ndetention policies right, both from the view of counterterrorism \neffectiveness and constitutional protection. I believe both security \nand freedom are critically important, and I don't think we have to \nchoose one over the other.\n  I thank my colleagues for remaining diligent in addressing the \ndetention policies that remain a concern, because Americans must remain \nengaged on this issue.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nThune be allotted 7 minutes to speak on an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I am working with the managers of the \nbill to try to address concerns they might have on an amendment I have \nfiled at the desk and hope to get accepted. But I wish to speak to it \nnow, if I might.\n  Essentially, the amendment is just a sense of Congress regarding the \nFederal Government's use of spectrum, and, in particular, spectrum use \nof the Department of Defense. Spectrum is a very important resource to \nthe Department of Defense, and it is a very important resource to the \nprivate sector.\n  Unfortunately, spectrum is becoming a scarcer and scarcer resource, \nand it is increasingly necessary for there to be better and more \nefficient management of this scarce resource. Demand for spectrum is \nsharply rising due to the growing advanced network of communication \ndevices that rely on spectrum to transmit and receive information. The \nrise of mobile devices, such as smart phones and tablets, the iPhone \nand iPad over the past few years, are the reason for this sharp rise in \ndemand for spectrum.\n  According to a recent study by Cisco, last year's mobile data traffic \nwas eight times the size of the entire global Internet in 2000. The \nCisco study predicts that global mobile data traffic will increase \neighteenfold between 2011 and 2016 at a compound annual growth rate of \n78 percent, reaching 10.8 exabytes per month by 2016.\n  The rise in the smart phone and the tablet has contributed \nsignificantly to our Nation's economy. The Nation's mobile \ncommunications industry, by one estimate, directly or indirectly \nsupports 3.8 million jobs, contributing $195.5 billion to the U.S. \ngross domestic product, and driving $33 billion in productivity \nimprovements in 2011.\n  With all that has gone wrong with our economy over the past several \nyears, it is important that we as policymakers nurture the growth of \nthe economy, especially where growth is already happening and, in fact, \nis exploding. We need to enact smart progrowth policies relating to \nspectrum. I know the spectrum issue isn't easy to understand or to \nmanage, but it is crucial we seek to better manage this scarce \nresource, and where it is possible to allocate more of the scarce \nresource to the private sector where it can create jobs and grow the \neconomy.\n  That is the reasoning and purpose behind my amendment. The Federal \nGovernment controls the vast amount of spectrum for its own use. It is \nprobably not all as efficiently managed as it could be. Undoubtedly, a \nsufficient amount of this spectrum could be made available to help \ncreate jobs and grow the economy.\n  One of the low-hanging fruits we can deal with almost immediately is \nthe band of spectrum known as the 1755-to-1780 megahertz band. This \nspectrum is particularly well suited for reallocation to commercial use \nbecause it is identified internationally for commercial mobile services \nand is used for that purpose throughout most of the world. This 1755-\nto-1780 band is also immediately adjacent to existing domestic wireless \nspectrum and would fit seamlessly into the current mobile broadband \nspectrum portfolio allowing for more immediate equipment development \nand deployment.\n  There is no reason for further delay in the reallocation of the 1755-\nto-1780 band for commercial use. This band was identified for \ncommercial broadband use internationally at the 2000 World Radio \nCommunications Conference over 10 years ago. Despite the international \ndesignation of the band for advanced wireless use, it is still \nallocated domestically for government use, heavily by DOD. The National \nTelecommunications and Information Administration, or NTIA, the agency \nwhich is responsible for all government spectrum, issued studies and \nreports in 2001, 2002, and 2010 that addressed use of the band for \ncommercial use but took no action. The spectrum was also identified in \nthe National Broadband Plan as potentially available for reallocation.\n  In March 2012, NTIA released its latest report assessing the \navailability of the band. Unfortunately, the 2012 NTIA report contains \nno firm deadline for action and no clear path to making the band \navailable for commercial use. It contemplates a potential 10-year \ntimeframe and potential shared use of spectrum but defers any formal \nrecommendation regarding reallocation until the completion of still \nfurther study.\n  Had NTIA acted when the first band was allocated internationally for \nadvanced wireless use, the band might already be available for \ncommercial services. Without a firm deadline DOD is unlikely to agree \nto reallocation, and the prospects for reallocating the 1755-to-1780 \nmegahertz band for commercial use remain slim.\n  That is why my amendment urges the President to direct Federal users \non that 1755-to-1780 band to prepare, not later than May 31, 2013, a \nreallocation plan that includes the cost of relocating from this band, \nand urges the Federal Communications Commission to reallocate this band \nto commercial use.\n  I hasten to add that it is important the cost of relocating the band \nshould be verifiable and transparent. The report for the underlying \nbill requires the Government Accountability Office to determine if the \ncost of vacating or sharing the 1755-to-1780 band is sufficiently \ncaptured in estimates. I look forward to the GAO's report on this \nissue.\n  There are those who may voice concerns about how this impacts our \nnational security. I take a back seat to no one in being pro-military. \nI sat on the Armed Services Committee for 6 years. I have an Air Force \nBase in my State that I care deeply about. It is important to \nunderstand that existing law provides ample protection to DOD for the \nrelocation to replacement spectrum.\n  There are those concerned about the cost to DOT to relocate. The law \nrequires DOT relocation costs be covered\n\n[[Page S7156]]\n\nby the Spectrum Relocation Fund, which is funded through the proceeds \nof the auction of the band to commercial licensees. If the auction does \nnot raise 110 percent of the relocation cost, the auction would be \ncanceled, assuring that incumbent users are made whole. Moreover, as \npart of the U.S. Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, \nCongress expanded the scope of funding from the relocation fund to \ninclude the cost of planning for relocation.\n  I am confident the Pentagon and the larger Federal Government can \nmore efficiently manage its spectrum holdings and make available \nadditional spectrum to help grow our economy and create jobs.\n  I hope, Madam President, that we can work this out to have it \nincluded as part of the Defense authorization bill. I certainly believe \nit is an amendment that is important with regard to the issue I \nmentioned, which is the reallocation and relocation of spectrum in this \ncountry to allow for multiple uses--obviously, important private \ncommercial uses--out there and an enormous demand, a demand that is \nadding significantly to our economy and creating jobs for literally \nthousands and millions of Americans.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that we proceed \nto the Gillibrand amendment, that there be 20 minutes debate on the \namendment, and that it be equally divided between Senator Gillibrand \nand Senator Coburn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3058, as Modified\n\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 3058, as \nmodified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mrs. Gillibrand], for herself, \n     Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Brown of \n     Massachusetts, Mr. Begich, and Mr. Menendez, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3058, as modified.\n\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle A of title VII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 704.

Madam President, I rise today on behalf of the \n30,000 military families who have loved ones with disabilities, \nincluding those on the autism spectrum. Sadly, thousands of these \nAmericans suffering from autism and other developmental disabilities \nare not receiving the treatment that best practices has determined they \nneed.\n  For example, military families with children on the autistic spectrum \nare receiving fewer services than their civilian governmental \ncounterparts across the country, many of whom have been rightfully \naided by laws passed in over 60 percent of our States, representing \nover 75 percent of the American population.\n  Autism places such tremendous strain on our families--health strains, \nfinancial, and emotional. They take such tolls. I want to share briefly \njust a couple of the stories I have heard from struggling military \nfamilies. They have done everything we have asked of them as a nation, \nbut now they can't even provide for their children.\n  One veteran was severely wounded in Iraq while heroically serving his \ncountry. His injuries were such that he was forced to retire. Because \nhe is retired, his autistic son Shane was no longer able to receive the \napplied behavioral therapies that were recommended. The wait list for \nthe Medicaid waiver services where he lives was 9 years. So Shane's \nfamily had to sell their home to pay the roughly $5,000 per month out \nof pocket for the ABA treatment he so desperately needs.\n  The money is running out for their family, and they do not know what \nto do. But they want to do what is best for their son. Without this \nrelief, we risk allowing brave military families just like this one to \nfall through the cracks.\n  Another story: A marine on Active Duty serving in Iraq and \nAfghanistan three times has maxed out all his ABA therapies to treat \nhis 11-year-old autistic son Joshua. Joshua is nonverbal and his safety \nis a key concern for his family. So Joshua is prescribed 35 hours of \nABA therapy per week. Because of the severity of Joshua's symptoms, the \nfamily is basically faced with the impossible decision of either \nforegoing the recommended care the doctor has prescribed for their son \nor paying these bills out of pocket for as long as they are actually \nable.\n  I don't believe this should ever happen to our military families. I \ndon't believe it should happen to any child, and that is why I am \nintroducing my amendment to require TRICARE to cover the recommended \nABA therapies that a doctor prescribes. It would be a matter that is \nconsistent with the best practices across this country and in the rest \nof the Federal Government.\n  Our children need this kind of support--Shane and Joshua need this \nkind\n\n[[Page S7157]]\n\nof support--and we should be standing by our men and women who serve in \nthe military because they stand by us. Every parent who has a child \nwith autism or another disability faces challenges to ensure their \nchild has access to the treatments they require. For these military \nfamilies, the challenges are even greater and often compounded by \nfrequent deployments overseas, the frequent moves to different bases \nacross State lines, and sometimes significant gaps in their coverage.\n  Today, TRICARE coverage of ABA is severely limited. It is capped at \n$36,000 per year for an Active-Duty member, which falls far below what \nis medically recommended for so many of these children.\n  This care is limited to Active-Duty servicemembers only. Guard and \nReserve families receive intermittent care, and children of retirees \ncan't even get coverage at all. As a consequence, military \nservicemembers often must turn to State Medicaid Programs to help \nprovide these services to their children. But the problem is that these \nservices are often unavailable because of long--years--wait lists. In \nMaryland, for example, the wait list is 7 years, essentially \neliminating ABA coverage during the early developmental years when a \nchild needs it most. The wait list in Virginia is 10 years long.\n  Even more remarkable than TRICARE not covering these treatments is \nthat the Office of Personnel Management has determined that such \ntreatments may be covered as medical therapies for Federal civilian \nemployees. A recent court decision, which the DOD is still reviewing \nand may appeal, determined that TRICARE must cover these treatments. \nBut this decision is being applied under the most narrow definition in \nthe interim, limiting the potential pool of providers. This amendment \nrequires TRICARE to provide coverage and deliver services in a manner \nthat is consistent with the best practices, thereby improving access to \ncare for our military families and aligning the TRICARE policy with \ncoverage that is basically available to anybody else in the civilian \nsector.\n  I believe we have a duty to stand by our military families. We have \nto address this difficult medical issue. We ask so much of our men and \nwomen who serve in the military. We must support their families. This \namendment simply fulfills that promise.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, first, I wish to announce that I agree \nwith the assessment of the Senator from New York in terms of the \ntreatment that should be offered. I have no problems with that. I think \nshe is right. There are a lot of other things in TRICARE that aren't \nright. And what the Senator from New York is doing is admirable, but \nthere is a portion of it that is not.\n  With the modification to her amendment, she has now raised the total \ncost of this amendment over the next 10 years to $1.9 billion. And it \nis true that she has managed to insert with some excess funds that will \nbe spent before the end of the year that won't be there by the time the \nmoney for this is used to pay for it. So she does meet that standard, \nbut she doesn't meet the standard for the next 10 years.\n  So we are in the midst of this large discussion about how we are \ngoing to get out of this fiscal mess. I take her at her word that she \nreally does want to reform TRICARE and fix it. But realize that TRICARE \nhasn't had a premium increase since 1995, and all it would take to pay \nfor this is a $2-per-month increase in premiums for those on TRICARE. \nAnd it is just TRICARE Prime; it is not TRICARE Standard and TRICARE \nFor Life. It is just $2. Madam President, $550 per year covers your \nwhole family, with no deductibles and no copays right now. It hasn't \nbeen increased since 1995.\n  So one of the things we ought to do is we ought to work to bring \nTRICARE standards up to make sure they meet the needs of everybody. I \ndon't disagree with that. But the other thing we ought to do is we \nought to pay for it. Now, where is the money going to come from to pay \nfor this, this very well-intentioned and proper thing? The way it is \nwritten now by the Senator from New York, this will come out of the \noperations and maintenance fund. So the very father of an autistic \nchild will have less flight time, less drill time, less shooting time, \nless preparation time to go out and be a warfighter. And as we think \nabout the 10-percent across-the-board cut that is coming or the $500 \nbillion that is proposed to come out of the Defense Department, none of \nit is going to come out of TRICARE.\n  So what we ought to do is we ought to fix these things, but we ought \nto fix them without digging our hole deeper.\n  Before Secretary Gates left, he said the biggest thing that is eating \nthe lunch in the Defense Department is the department of health within \nit that manages the health care because we have not done an appropriate \njob of having a slight rise in premiums to cover some of the tremendous \nbenefits. Nobody else in the country gets the benefits we give with \nTRICARE--nobody--$550 a year per family, $275 if you are single, and no \ncopay and no deductible. All it would take is $24 a year by our TRICARE \nPrime to pay to make sure that the people with disabilities and the \npeople with autism have the appropriate therapies and they are covered \nunder TRICARE.\n  So I would ask my colleague from New York if she would mind \nwithdrawing her amendment, to be voted on later, that I might be able \nto offer a second-degree amendment and maybe in that way or another way \npay for this out of things that we know are going on, that we could \nfind $1.9 billion over the next 10 years to actually pay for the cost \nof this over the next 10 years. We didn't have time to do that \nbeforehand. I don't know if she would be willing to do that. But there \nis no way you should justify taking another $1.9 billion out of the \noperation and maintenance program for our troops to health care. We \nought to eliminate something that doesn't take away from their training \ntime, flying time, shooting time, or sailing time. We ought to be \ntaking it from somewhere else, but that is where this is going to come \nfrom.\n  I applaud what she is doing. She is right about fixing the problem. \nShe is totally opposite of what we should be doing in terms of paying \nfor it, and I would offer to work in good faith in the next hour to try \nto come up with a second-degree amendment that would be acceptable to \nmy colleague and to the chairman and ranking member of this committee \nthat would actually pay for it.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 5 minutes for Senator Coburn and 6 \nminutes for Senator Gillibrand remaining.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield 2 minutes to me?\n  Mr. COBURN. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, there is no one I know of in this body \nat any time who would not want to assist and provide the best care, \nespecially for our disabled children who have autism. It is one of the \nmost compelling stories any of us have ever heard. But I think it is \nalso important for us to recognize that when we continue to add on \nbenefits without a hearing, without any scrutiny, without balancing \nwhere they are in the array of priorities we have, and without paying \nfor them--it seems to me that in the budget we have and the \nexpenditures we have, to just say, as the distinguished Senator from \nNew York just stated, that we will address it next year, we will get \nthat taken care of--we all know the hardest thing around here is to \nfind funds for programs.\n  So I appreciate more than I can say the dedication of the Senator \nfrom New York on this issue, but here we go again--we are going to now \nbestow another entitlement that is not paid for. With all due respect, \nI say to the Senator from New York, why don't she give us something to \npay for it with? Why don't she come up with an offset that would then \nnot have us increase the debt by $1.9 billion? We are now adding a cost \nof $1.9 billion in the name of one of the most humane and compelling \ncauses any of us know. But don't we have an obligation to the \ntaxpayers? We have an obligation to the taxpayers to say that we are \ngoing to take care of these special needs Americans but we are going to \npay for it. Instead, we are going to lay an additional\n\n[[Page S7158]]\n\nburden on the taxpayers of America which someday is going to have to be \npaid for--someday. It may not be in this bill, but someday it is going \nto have to be paid for.\n  Obviously this amendment is going to pass, but I would love to see \nthe Senator from New York tell us how we are going to pay for it. I \ndon't think that is an outrageous demand.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. I thank my colleagues for their statements of \nsupport for meeting the needs of the children who do suffer from autism \nand other developmental disorders, and I do appreciate and believe \ntheir sincerity in wanting to make sure they are covered with the \ntreatments they need.\n  I think we can work together to reform the TRICARE system. It is one \nthat has not had the kind of reform it needs. But this is just an \nauthorization for 1 year to meet the needs of these kids now because I \ndon't want to wait until we figure it out and figure out the rest of \nthe program.\n  In addition, we did have a hearing. We had scientists and doctors and \nthose who are medical professionals come to testify in front of the \nArmed Services subcommittee. Through that testimony we established that \nthe only reason the DOD wasn't covering this was because they believed \nit was an educational program. And what we established and what the \nmedical literature says is that it is actually a medically necessary \ntreatment in the same way you would give a child who is sick a \nmedicine.\n  I want to address the needs of these kids now. I will commit to \nworking with the Senators to reforming TRICARE so we can actually pay \nfor programs over the long term and reform it in a way that is \nconsistent with the benefits our troops so desperately need.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, might I ask through the Chair the \nSenator from New York if she would consider for a short period of time \nwithdrawing her amendment and allowing me to develop a second-degree \namendment that would actually pay for this so that we would accomplish \nher goal--and I think all of our goals--of making sure the proper \ntreatment is there but won't handicap the armed services in terms of \ndelayed training, less training, less flying time? Because it is going \nto come out of the operations and maintenance funds. I wonder if she \nwould do that with the assurance of the chair and the assurance of the \nranking member and chairman of the committee that the amendment would \nstill be considered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. I urge my colleagues to take a more lengthy time to \nconsider how to reform TRICARE and pay for this program than just 1 or \n2 hours.\n  I would like to pass this amendment now. Right now operations and \nmaintenance has $174 billion a year in it. This is $45 million for 1 \nyear just to get the treatments in place for these families. In 1 \nyear's time, we will have more accountability and transparency on what \nthe real cost is. This is just an estimate. So what we want to do is be \nable to have more facts and then go to reform the TRICARE system \nproperly, and I commit to Senators that I will work with you on that. \nThis is only authorized for 1 year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I believe it was Ronald Reagan who said \nthat the closest thing to eternal life here on Earth is a government \nprogram.\n  Again, the complaint that we continue to hear from our constituents \nis that we have mortgaged our children's and our grandchildren's \nfutures. And to somehow say, well, we are only authorizing this program \nfor 1 year--does the Senator from New York really believe that once we \nstart treating children with autism, we are going to terminate that \nprogram? Does she really believe that? Of course not. Of course not.\n  We have an obligation to the men and women, the citizens of this \ncountry whom we have saddled with a $16 trillion debt to find ways to \nsacrifice ourselves fiscally to pay for worthwhile programs. So I \nsupport a second-degree amendment from the Senator from Oklahoma, which \nis his right. It is his right to do so. And I don't see how we fulfill \nour obligation to our citizens by continuing to authorize and \nappropriate expenditure of their tax dollars without a way to pay for \nit except to take it out of our taxpayers' pockets.\n  That is not right. That is not right. The Senator from New York knows \nit is not right for us, no matter how worthy the cause, for us to \ncontinue this continued spend, spend, spend, debt, debt, debt that the \nAmerican people are saddled with. I probably will not be paying for the \nnational debt but my kids will, my grandkids will. Can't we for once \nsay: Look, this is a worthwhile program, we all support taking care of \npeople with autism, and here is how we are going to pay for it. That \nwould be a unique experience around this body.\n  I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COBURN. I yield the remaining portion of my time.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. I yield my time.\n  Mr. COBURN. I think my colleague from New York would like to ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. I request a voice vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is there anyone seeking the yeas and nays?\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. I request a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. I think we ought to have a recorded vote on this since we \nare not paying for it and we are taking $1.9 billion out of the O \nbudget of the Defense Department. I ask we have a recorded vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Yes. That would be great. I am willing to take a voice \nvote, and I believe it is going to be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Ohio seek recognition?\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I do seek recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2956\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and call up amendment No. 2956.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report the \namendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. Portman], for himself and Mr. \n     Akaka, proposes an amendment numbered 2956.\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To require a report on Department of Defense efforts to \nstandardize educational transcripts issued to separating members of the \n                             Armed Forces)\n\n       At the end of subtitle F of title V, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 561. REPORT ON DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE EFFORTS TO \n                   STANDARDIZE EDUCATIONAL TRANSCRIPTS ISSUED TO \n                   SEPARATING MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES.\n\n       (a) Report Required.--Not later than 90 days after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall \n     submit to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and \n     the House of Representatives a report on the efforts of the \n     Department of Defense to standardize the educational \n     transcripts issued to members of the Armed Forces on their \n     separation from the Armed Forces.\n       (b) Elements.--The report required by subsection (a) shall \n     include the following:\n       (1) A description of the similarities and differences \n     between the educational transcripts issued to members \n     separating from the various Armed Forces.\n       (2) A description of any assessments done by the \n     Department, or in conjunction with educational institutions, \n     to identify shortcomings in the transcripts issued to \n     separating members in connection with their ability to \n     qualify for civilian educational credits.\n       (3) A description of the implementation plan for the Joint \n     Services Transcript, including a schedule and the elements of \n     existing educational transcripts to be incorporated into the \n     Transcript.\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, this is a pretty simple amendment. It has \nto do with correcting a problem that we have found in Ohio and around \nthe country. Amendment No. 2956 simply calls on the Secretary of \nDefense to work to standardize the educational transcripts of \nseparating servicemembers. I appreciate Senator Akaka's leadership and \ncosponsorship of this amendment.\n  It is an important issue to a lot of our veterans as they are seeking \nto pursue their educational opportunities after being in the service. \nIf they seek to use the GI bill or other benefits to further their \neducation after taking off the uniform, they sometimes find they have \nan issue of getting credit for work they have done in the service.\n  Each servicemember is issued a transcript upon leaving Active Duty. \nThe transcript equates military training and instruction to academic \ncredits. Colleges and universities then use these transcripts to award \ntransfer credit to veteran students.\n  Unfortunately, there is a significant difference in the types of \ntranscripts issued by each of the military services. As a result, two \nveterans from different services who took the exact same military \ncourses could receive significantly different academic credit at the \nsame school. If we multiply that across all the services, all of our \nveteran students, and across all the colleges and universities in this \ncountry, we end up with some real issues. We end up with many veterans \nlosing out on credit they deserve, as well as very well-intentioned \ncolleges and universities spending a lot of time and resources trying \nto make sense of all these differences to help this process for \nveterans. It often falls on the Veterans Service Offices in these \nschools, and as my colleagues know, these Veterans Service Offices \nshould be spending their time assisting veterans with their transition \nto academic life, which is sometimes a challenge.\n  Ohio has been leading on this issue and has organized public and \nprivate schools, our State board of regents, and even the Ohio National \nGuard to try to bring some sense to this. That has been helpful, but it \nwould be far easier and far better to standardize the military \ntranscripts themselves. It would avoid, again, a lot of the issues, a \nlot of the bureaucracy.\n  The Defense Department has recognized some of these issues, and I \nthink they have started down the path of developing a joint services \ntranscript. This is an important first step, and through this amendment \nwe seek an understanding of those requirements and their implementation \nplan for this kind of initiative, should it be in place, in order to \nsee it on a path to a swift and thorough resolution.\n  So I think this is one that, again, as the chairman was asking, could \nbe voice-voted. I hope it will be.\n  So, Mr. President, I ask for a voice vote on the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there any further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2956) was agreed to.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if we could get a unanimous consent that Senator \nCasey be allowed to proceed as in morning business to comment on filed \namendments for--I am sorry, was it 10 minutes?--10 minutes. I ask \nunanimous consent that Senator Casey be allowed to proceed as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about our Nation's \nmilitary in light of the legislation we are considering. I commend \nChairman Levin and Ranking Member McCain and all those who are working \non it. I just have some comments on a number of amendments and a few \nissues.\n  For more than a decade now our Nation has been at war. In that time \nperiod, the men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces have courageously \nserved in Afghanistan and Iraq, assisted communities after disasters, \nand continued to provide stability across the world. As the military \ndraws down from foreign engagements and strategic directions are \nreassessed, the Senate should do the same with regard to these issues.\n  Unlike previous debates on the National Defense Authorization Act, \nthis year the bill before us seeks to clarify the role of the military \nfor the next decade or more.\n  We are being asked to evaluate how large our military needs to be as \nwe assess our near- and long-term threats. We are being asked to \nevaluate what equipment and resources this fighting force will need to \nkeep the peace and to combat new aggressors, all while we are being \nasked to evaluate programs we have introduced over the past decade to \nsupport our servicemembers and their families.\n  There are just a couple issues that are relevant to this debate, one \nwhich has particular significance for southwestern Pennsylvania. This \nis with regard to the military's force structure. I have been alarmed \nat two proposals submitted by the Air Force as it seeks to restructure.\n  In Pennsylvania, the Air Force has sought to eliminate the Pittsburgh \nAir Reserve Station where approximately 1,500 Reservists and civilians \nare committed to serving our Nation. After numerous briefings and \nhearings, the Air Force has yet to provide us--to provide my office and \nI think other offices as well--with a thorough analysis of several of \ntheir proposals. These proposals, as presented, have failed to reflect \nthe low overhead costs, efficiencies, and the value of the 911th \nAirlift Wing.\n  For example, the 911th has developed an aircraft maintenance program \nthat has resulted in more aircraft availability days while saving the \nDepartment more than $42 million over the last 5 years. The Air Force \ncontinues to reiterate that they must find savings in this tight budget \nenvironment.\n\n[[Page S7160]]\n\nIf this is true, I am not convinced the closing of one of their most \nefficient bases meets this objective of cost savings.\n  I am also disturbed to see how the Air Force Reserve continues to be \ntreated during this process. While the Guard and Active components have \nbeen mostly protected, the Air Force Reserve, including the 911th in \nPittsburgh, has borne the brunt of these proposed cuts. Therefore, I am \npleased Chairman Levin and the members of the Armed Services Committee \nhave worked to prevent the Air Force from moving forward with these \nproposals in fiscal year 2013.\n  I ask other colleagues to join Senators Begich, Gillibrand, and me on \namendment No. 2952 that seeks to prevent the military from using a \nbackdoor BRAC process to substantially reduce or close bases, \nespecially without justifying to Congress their intentions. On behalf \nof Pennsylvania's Air Force Reserve, I will continue to fight for a \nreasoned and balanced restructuring of the Air Force.\n  The second issue I wish to raise is the so-called TAA Program. We \nknow our long-term strategic interests must also secure the future of \nservicemembers and veterans alike. Today, I have introduced an \namendment that provides assistance to our servicemembers and their \nfamilies. It is amendment No. 2297, the Transition Assistance Advisors \nProgram, the so-called TAA Program.\n  It seeks to make permanent and increase the numbers of transition \nassistance advisors in every State. These advisors coordinate resources \nfor the Reserve component members and their families to help these \nindividuals navigate the myriad of service programs provided by the VA, \nTRICARE, veterans service organizations, and other supporting agencies.\n  These advisors are considered a force multiplier by the National \nGuard Bureau. The TAA assistance advisors enhance the Bureau's outreach \ncapabilities, serve as a vital link between servicemembers and the \nbenefits to which they are entitled. In the last 2 years, since this \ninitiative was launched, 62 of these advisors have reached more than \n194,000 veterans and their families. Yet 62 advisors can only do so \nmuch. All too often, I hear from my National Guard constituents and \ntheir spouses about how confusing it is to navigate military procedures \nand benefits, especially as they go on and off duty every 2 years.\n  Our citizen soldiers have answered the call to serve our Nation in \ntimes of need. Should we not be doing everything we can to help them \nnavigate these complicated measures when they return home? I think the \nanswer to that question is a resounding yes.\n  Last year, Congress authorized end strengths of 464,900 guardsmen and \nwomen in the Army and Air National Guard. On average, this comes to an \naverage of 1 transition assistance advisor--just 1--per 7,498 \nservicemembers and their families, obviously not enough advisors to \nhelp our families.\n  I believe this ratio does a disservice to citizen soldiers and to \nairmen as well as others and their families. I ask my colleagues to \nsupport and strengthen this program as our veterans of Iraq and \nAfghanistan try to reintegrate back into their lives. I thank Senators \nLeahy, Blumenthal, Tester, Mikulski, and Wyden for cosponsoring this \nimportant amendment.\n  Finally, my last issue. This involves women in Afghanistan. In \naddition to making important adjustments to the size and strength of \nour military, the authorization act also helps to shape strategic \npriorities in critical regions. In Afghanistan, we are reducing the \nU.S. presence and transitioning security responsibilities to Afghan \nforces. It is critical this process protects the gains that have been \nmade over the last 10 years, particularly with regard to the rights and \nopportunities of Afghan women and girls. I am concerned that as our \ninternational forces draw down, extremists threaten to once again \nrestrict Afghan women's mobility and opportunities for participation in \npublic life.\n  Women who are active in public life face serious threats to their \npersonal safety in Afghanistan. Girls have been the targets of \nextremist violence simply for going to school. We all know the story \nthat was written about the acid thrown in the face of two young girls. \nThat was repeated numerous times across the country. Afghan forces are \nnot doing enough to counter these influences and protect women in their \ncommunities. This just does not threaten Afghan women and Afghan girls, \nit threatens the success of the security transition in Afghanistan that \nwe are paying for, that we have invested in, that our fighting men and \nwomen have fought and died for.\n  We know that when women's security deteriorates, it can be an early \nindicator of a worsening security condition overall. I am very \nconcerned that if we neglect women's security in Afghanistan during \nthis transition period and if we stand by while women are forced out of \npublic life and have their voice silenced by extremists, we will see a \nless stable and a less secure Afghanistan in 2014 and beyond.\n  That is why Senator Hutchison and I have introduced the Afghan Women \nand Girls Security Promotion Act and offered it as an amendment to the \nNational Defense Authorization Act. We are proud to be joined by \nSenators Mikulski, Feinstein, Gillibrand, Murkowski, Snowe, Lautenberg, \nCardin, and Boxer.\n\n  Here is what the legislation does: It requires the Department of \nDefense to produce a plan--just a plan--to produce a plan to promote \nthe security of Afghan women and girls during the transition process, \nincluding monitoring and responding to changes in women's security.\n  Second, the Department of Defense must work to improve gender \nsensitivity and responsiveness among Afghan national security forces \npersonnel. Third, it increases recruitment and retention of women in \nthe Afghan national security forces. It will also require that the \nDepartment of Defense report on the implementation of this strategy and \nits results in semiannual reports that are filed.\n  When I last visited Afghanistan, leading a CODEL in August of 2011, I \nwas privileged to meet with a group of Afghan women leaders. I was \nimpressed and inspired--that is an understatement--inspired by their \ndetermination to continue to fight for women's rights even in the face \nof extraordinary oppression and violence.\n  One member of Parliament, Fawzia Kofi, lost her father and her \nhusband as a result of her family's involvement in politics. But she is \nstill determined to be a leader in protecting women's rights and \nadvancing Afghanistan's democratic development. She and her colleagues, \nalong with women across Afghanistan, are prepared to do whatever it \ntakes to make sure their rights are protected and that they have a \nvoice in their country's future. Supporting them is not only in line \nwith our American values, it is critical to discouraging extremism and \nlaying a foundation for a peaceful future in Afghanistan.\n  I am glad several of my colleagues have joined us as cosponsors in \nthis important amendment. I hope we can see more support as we move \nforward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, the chairman has asked me to \nmanage the bill in the meantime while he is working out with the \nleadership a list of amendments.\n  Seeing no other Senator who wants to speak at this point, if I may, \nthen I will talk about an amendment that would be offered in the \nfuture.\n  I am going to offer an amendment to repeal the offset in the \nDepartment of Defense and the VA benefits for military widows and \nwidowers. The standalone bill, S. 260, has widespread support from \nmilitary organizations and has 51 cosponsors in the Senate. This is the \nninth time that I have and will bring this amendment to the Defense \nAuthorization Act.\n  It has passed the Senate six times over the past decade, including \nlast year by voice vote. The Senate has supported eliminating this \noffset for years. I hope this body will remain steadfast in its support \nfor military widows and survivors.\n  The Presiding Officer will recall in a number of addresses that \nPresident Lincoln gave he spoke of the responsibility the government \nhas to take care of the veteran and his widow and orphans. That is an \ningrained principle within the law. That is an ingrained\n\n[[Page S7161]]\n\nprinciple as we uphold the finest fighting force in the world, which is \nour military.\n  What this amendment does is it addresses the longstanding problems \nfaced by those survivors of people who are killed in action or whose \ndeath is related to the service in the military. The requirement for \nthe dollar-for-dollar reduction of the Department of Defense Survivor \nBenefit Plan--it is an annuity--is offset by the amount of dependency \nand indemnity compensation that is received from another department, \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  The Survivor Benefit Plan from the Department of Defense is an \noptional program for military retirees offered by the Department of \nDefense. Military retirees pay premiums out of their retirement pay to \nensure that their survivors will have adequate income upon that \nservicemember's death. That is an insurance plan paid for by the \nmilitary retiree.\n  On the other hand, the Dependency and Indemnity Compensation is a \ncompletely different survivor benefit. It is administered by the VA. \nWhen military service caused the servicemember's death, either due to \nservice-connected disability or illness or Active-Duty death, surviving \nspouses are entitled to a monthly compensation. Most recently that has \nbeen $1,154. That comes from the VA. That is as a result of death with \na service-connected disability or illness or Active-Duty death.\n  Now, of the 270,000 survivors that are receiving, under the insurance \nplan, the Survivor Benefit Plan, about 54,000 of those widows and \norphans are subject to the offset.\n  According to the Defense Actuary, 31,000 survivors' SBP, the \ninsurance plan, is completely offset by the dependency and indemnity \ncompensation, meaning that the widow or the widower must live just on \nthe DIC, which is $1,154. Well, that is simply not fair because if you \nengage in an insurance contract and you pay premiums to give you a \ncertain return upon the happening of an event--in this case, the death \nof a retired military member--then that contract ought to be offered. \nBut because this has been an expensive item in the past, what has \nhappened over the years that this Senator has been trying to eliminate \nthis offset is we have whittled it down but not completely done the \ncomplete offset. The fact is that the group of people affected, the \ngroup of widowers or widows, is getting smaller and smaller and \ntherefore is going to cost less. I know of no purchased annuity plan \nthat would deny payout based on the receipt of a different benefit, \nwhich is the case here.\n  Retirees bought into the SBP, the insurance plan, in good faith, \nthese military families planned for the future, and the government \nfailed to hold up its end of the bargain.\n  The military has a longstanding tradition never to leave a comrade \nbehind, but that is what we are doing to the military survivors, the \nwidows and the orphans. We are not taking care of those who are left \nbehind.\n  We must meet our obligation to the widow and the orphan with the same \nsense of honor as was the service their loved one rendered. We must \neliminate this SBP-DIC offset. It is the right thing to do, and it is \ngoing to cost a lot less than when I tried this 11 years ago, but there \nwill be costs. But we have to start by setting the policy of what is \nright.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, just in the lull here--and if there is any \nlegislative business to take place, I will immediately give up the \nfloor--I wish to make the point that I am so proud to be in this \nSenate, so proud to have been here for a long time now. I came here in \n1993. There were 2 women, then we went to 6 women, and now we are going \nto 20 women. I have seen changes, I have seen good things, and I have \nseen rough things.\n  I have to say one of the things that keeps coming up continually here \nis folks trying to use these debates on bills to add irrelevant \namendments, amendments that have nothing to do with the topic at hand.\n  I think we all agree that defending our Nation is our No. 1 priority, \nand therefore having a defense authorization bill is very important. I \nam sure we don't agree with every single sentence of this bill, but in \ngeneral we all want to make sure that our military is prepared, that \nthey are paid well, that they get good benefits. We must ensure we have \na strong military that can meet every threat. Again, we are going to \ndisagree on what all that means, but at least when we legislate, we \nought to make sure that when we offer amendments, they are either \nnoncontroversial and committee chairs have signed off if they are in \ntheir jurisdiction or we shouldn't offer them.\n  The reason I rise today is that we may be facing two environmental \nriders on this bill, and I want to go on record as saying I am not \ngoing to let that happen. Now, if colleagues want to override and stay \nhere through the night and the weekend, that is fine, but I am going to \nbe staying right here because one of these amendments would say that \nthe EPA, under the Toxic Substances Control Act, could never regulate \nthe ingredients in ammunition. This means they could never regulate \nlead and they could never regulate perchlorate. Lead and perchlorate \nkill, they harm, they do damage to the thyroid, to brain development, \nand to the behavior of children. Pregnant women are harmed.\n  So I am not going to allow an environmental rider to get onto this \nfloor and pass this Senate when we are doing a defense bill which is \nmeant to protect our people. I can tell you right now, you don't put a \nharmful environmental rider in the Defense bill when you are trying to \npass a bill to protect our people, not make it easier for them to be \nexposed to dangerous lead, dangerous perchlorate, and other chemicals. \nThere is a place and a time to do those amendments, and that would be \non a relevant bill, a bill that comes out of the Environment Committee. \nThat is fine. We can debate it then and have a vote when everyone \nunderstands the ramifications.\n  Now there is threat here to have another environmental rider that \ndeals with coal ash, the regulation of coal ash. What does that have to \ndo with the military bill? Zero. The components of coal ash are a huge \ndanger to people. We have seen the coal ash pile up and get loose. In \nthe East, it just goes down in a rainstorm and destroys whole \ncommunities. There is an environmental rider waiting to be offered that \nwould weaken the EPA's ability to go to that threat and get rid of it.\n  I am very distressed, and I am sure you can hear it in my voice. I \nknow there are differences around here, but I take my job seriously. As \nchairman of the Environment Committee, my job is to protect the public \nhealth from toxins such as lead, perchlorate, and the amazing \ncollection of chemicals in coal ash that kill and harm and maim.\n  I know people want to get this bill done, and, believe me, I want to \nget this bill done. I have several amendments in this bill that are so \nimportant, and I thank colleagues on both sides of the aisle, \nparticularly Senator Cornyn and Senator Snowe, who helped me with an \namendment that would say that if someone has been convicted of a sexual \nassault, they can no longer join the military. That is in this bill. \nThat is very important.\n  We have other amendments we have worked on, and I thank Senator Levin \nand Senator McCain. They have reached out to the committee chairs, and \nthey have said: Look, we are trying to protect your jurisdiction. They \nhave now said they have no agreement that our jurisdiction will be \nprotected.\n  As much as I don't want to sit here and stand guard, I am going to do \nit because I think that is my role and that is my job.\n  I thank you, Mr. Chairman, for this moment to express the reason I \nhave been on the floor all afternoon and will continue to be on floor \nuntil we adjourn this evening.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S7162]]\n\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we are now going to turn to an amendment of \nSenator Whitehouse which has been cleared. We have worked to make sure \neverybody understands that he is going to proceed to the amendment. And \nthen I understand there is not going to be a need for rollcall vote on \nit.\n  I ask the Senator from Rhode Island, about how much time does he \nbelieve he would need on his amendment before we hopefully voice vote?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I would say just 2 or 3 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. But I do believe that the Senator from Oklahoma \nwishes to respond.\n  Mr. LEVIN. And I appreciate that.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 10 minutes on \nthe Whitehouse amendment, equally divided between Senator Whitehouse \nand Senator Coburn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, may I ask the chairman if he wishes \nthe amendment called up now and made pending or are we simply going to \nhave discussion on it?\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator, we expect now, will be calling up his \namendment. And may I, though, correct what I said before. It is \npossible that there will be a need for a rollcall vote on the \nWhitehouse amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3180\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be set aside in order to call up amendment No. 3180.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Whitehouse] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3180.\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to dispense \nwith further reading of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank Chairman Levin and Ranking\n\n[[Page S7163]]\n\nMember McCain for their patience and persistence in allowing us to get \nto this vote. I think once I have discussed the bill for a moment, it \nmight not seem as though it would have required much patience or \npersistence to get here, but it did. They have been very kind and very \nattentive, and I appreciate it.\n  The history of this amendment is that it began as a bill in the \nSenate. This bill passed out of the Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions Committee by unanimous consent. An identical bill passed \nthrough the House of Representatives under suspension. So in many \nrespects it is noncontroversial.\n  I also thank Chairman Harkin and Ranking Member Enzi of the HELP \nCommittee for their help getting it through the HELP Committee \nunanimously and for clearing it for a vote here today on the floor.\n  The bill at this point has nearly 60 cosponsors. It has 18 Republican \ncosponsors, and I thank them individually and by name: Senators Blunt, \nBoozman, Brown of Massachusetts, Chambliss, Cochran, Collins, Crapo, \nGrassley, Heller, Hutchison, Isakson, Kirk, Lugar, Moran, Murkowski, \nRubio, Snowe, and Wicker, in addition to all my Democratic cosponsors.\n  This is a bill that also has the support of the American Cancer \nSociety, the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network, the Lung Cancer \nAlliance, and the American Association for Medical Research, as well as \nthe American Association of Medical Colleges.\n  What the bill does is asks that the National Institutes of Health \nconvene and evaluate a discussion about what we call recalcitrant \ncancers. This actually began as a pancreatic cancer research bill, but \nit became apparent that there were some other cancers that we group now \nas what we call recalcitrant cancers in that they have not responded to \ntreatment and research, and they remain cancers for which there has \nbeen little progress and survivability. And because they are so deadly \nand so lethal, we are trying to direct a little more attention out of \nNIH toward research on these cancers.\n  For me, this has a personal component, as I know it does for many \npeople who have been touched by pancreatic cancer. My mom died of \npancreatic cancer, and I have a number of friends who have been touched \nby it in their families as well.\n  I know the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma has opposition to \nthis. If he would like to state his piece, I will be delighted to yield \nthe floor so he may do so now. I hope at the conclusion of his remarks \nwe could move this by a voice vote rather than calling all of our \ncolleagues back for another vote. But if he objects to that, then that \nis within his prerogatives.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, we have made remarkable progress in this \ncountry in terms of research into diseases. Since Francis Collins and \nhis great work on the genome complex became successful, the way we \nresearch disease has totally changed. I have my favorite aunt who died \nof pancreatic cancer. I diagnosed it hundreds of times in my own \npractice of patients who were dear to me and whom I love. The problem \nwith pancreatic cancer is it is diagnosed late. It is an adenocarcinoma \nof the pancreas, much like an adenocarcinoma of the colon. The reason \nwe do so well on colon cancer is we do colonoscopies and we can treat \nthe disease early. What is well-intended by this recalcitrant cancer \nbill will actually delay the cure for pancreatic cancer and other \nrecalcitrant diseases.\n  Let me take a few minutes to explain why I am saying that.\n  We no longer look at diseases to cure them by looking at the base \ndisease. There is translational and neurocommunicative and peptide and \nsmall markers of communication on an intracellular basis. Now, when we \ndo research and we find that, what we find is we find cures for \nmultiple diseases.\n  The other thing is we can take 100 people with a recalcitrant cancer, \nand every one of them, when we look at the genetics of cancer, will \nhave to be treated differently. In other words, it is going to take a \ndifferent approach, even though we might classify it as a neuroblastoma \nof the kidney or a pancreatic cancer--but looking at the genetics of \nthe cancer, which is what we are doing now, is going to require totally \ndifferent treatments.\n  This is very well intended. I understand. This is a big disease, and \nit is terrible that we diagnose it at a time where we cannot end up--\nless than 10 percent, around 5 percent survival rates, 5-year survival \nrates on this disease.\n  I would like to have printed in the Record a letter I received from \nDr. Francis Collins. I ask unanimous consent to have that printed.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            Department of Health &\n\n\n                                               Human Services,\n\n                            Bethesda, Maryland, November 16, 2012.\n     Hon. Tom Coburn,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Tom Coburn: Thank you for your September 17 letter \n     requesting that I address four questions about how disease-\n     specific legislation affects the ability of the National \n     Institutes of Health (NIH) to plan and perform research.\n       First you asked if the NIH already has the ability to \n     create strategic plans and working groups without a \n     legislative mandate to do so. The Secretary of Health and \n     Human Services and leaders of the Institutes and Centers of \n     the NIH have the authorities needed to constitute standing \n     advisory committees, create working groups, and develop plans \n     for research programs; as a result, they do not need \n     legislative mandates to take such actions. The NIH Institutes \n     and Centers have senior advisory councils that oversee the \n     research portfolio of each component. Individually or in \n     collaboration, the NIH Institutes and Centers frequently form \n     other advisory groups charged with planning research on \n     Institute-specific or trans-NIH subjects. These many \n     activities, in conjunction with our peer review panels, are \n     part of our ongoing effort to evaluate the current scientific \n     landscape and to protect and advance our investments in \n     research for public benefit.\n       Let me provide a recent example of how these planning \n     processes work. The National Institute of Allergy and \n     Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has used working groups to \n     identify scientific opportunities in areas where there are \n     pressing public health needs. One example is influenza--both \n     seasonal influenza, which kills up to 49,000 Americans each \n     year, as well as pandemic influenza such as the recent 2009 \n     H1N1 pandemic. In early 2006 NIAID convened a Blue Ribbon \n     Panel on Influenza Research to help identify areas in which \n     progress was needed. This panel recommended eight areas in \n     which there were opportunities for scientific advancement, \n     including research on improved influenza vaccines. To \n     continue and build upon these efforts, NIAID released NIAID \n     Influenza Research: 2009 Progress Report, which identified \n     the development of ``universal'' influenza vaccines as an \n     expanding area of scientific opportunity.\n       Currently, the NIAID's extramural researchers are pursuing \n     multiple vaccine strategies for the development of a \n     universal influenza vaccine. In addition, researchers at the \n     NIAID Vaccine Research Center are making significant progress \n     towards the development of such a vaccine. They have tested \n     in animals a two-step, prime-boost vaccine that generates \n     neutralizing antibodies against many strains of influenza \n     virus. Animal studies of this technique have proven \n     promising, and researchers will soon study the approach in \n     human clinical trials. This past summer, NIAID sponsored, \n     with the Food and Drug Administration, a scientific meeting \n     to revisit progress and challenges with regard to the \n     development of universal influenza vaccines. This \n     comprehensive NIAID effort is just one example of how the NIH \n     constantly examines scientific opportunities and conducts \n     research evaluation and planning activities within its \n     current statutory authority.\n       You next asked me to address the NIH's ability to foster \n     groundbreaking discoveries without legislation that directs \n     it to address a specific disease or group of diseases. While \n     we seek always to be responsive to the concerns of the \n     public, often expressed through ``report language'' in \n     appropriations bills, the NIH has considerable statutory \n     authority to plan and oversee the research that leads to \n     important discoveries. Because our science often produces new \n     and unexpected findings and because medicine is often \n     confronted with altered or unyielding threats to public \n     health, the NIH Institutes and Centers must constantly assess \n     their research plans and portfolios. For example, the \n     National Cancer Institute recently organized a group to \n     perform a ``horizon scan'' of pancreatic ductal \n     adenocarcinoma (PDAC) research, building on previous planning \n     exercises in 2001 and 2008. This new group will examine \n     current research efforts, benchmark our scientific under \n     aiding, and identify promising and possibly underexplored \n     areas for future research in hopes of improving the still \n     dire outcome of this dreaded disease.\n       You further asked me to address the impact of disease-\n     specific legislation on the NIH's ability to allocate \n     resources freely and to study basic biology and mechanisms. \n     When providing technical assistance to the Congress on \n     possible legislation, the NIH generally suggests that \n     Congress provide the maximum flexibility for our mission. \n     Basic\n\n[[Page S7164]]\n\n     research that may lack any overt connection to specific \n     diseases is the foundation for disease-specific translational \n     and clinical research, and it must be preserved to ensure the \n     discoveries that later drive applied work on individual \n     diseases. If Congress is too proscriptive when it directs the \n     NIH to focus on specific diseases, the agency loses its \n     valued flexibility to allocate resources in a manner that \n     optimizes the likelihood that the scientists we support will \n     discover the underlying disease mechanisms that must be \n     understood to achieve our goal of improving the health of our \n     nation.\n       Let me provide an example of basic research that addresses \n     several specific types of cancer. As early as the 1980s, \n     cancer researchers observed mutations in a certain critical \n     gene, the KRAS gene, in a variety of human cancers, including \n     about a third of lung cancers, about half of colon cancers, \n     and as many as 95 percent of PDACs. Basic research on a wide \n     variety of cell types, from yeast to human, has taught us \n     that the KRAS gene encodes an unusual signaling protein that \n     acts in conjunction with other proteins as a molecular ``on/\n     off' switch for signals promoting cellular growth. Mutations \n     in this gene leave the switch ``on'', resulting in persistent \n     cell growth and division. Despite what we know about KRAS \n     mutations, and despite extensive efforts in both industrial \n     and academic research sectors, we have not yet been able to \n     counter these mutations therapeutically. In order to treat \n     PDAC and many other cancers exhibiting KRAS mutations, we \n     must focus on research that increases our understanding of \n     how such mutations drive the biological effects that cause \n     these devastating diseases. Given what we have learned about \n     molecular mechanisms, it would be counterproductive to limit \n     that effort to a specific cell type. In other words, if \n     Congress directs the NIH to study specific diseases without \n     flexibility, it can limit our ability to follow the best \n     leads in science and to pursue discoveries that move an \n     entire research field forward in a way that produces maximum \n     benefit to the public.\n       Finally, you asked me to address how genomics has \n     revolutionized the study of underlying mechanisms of disease. \n     Recent advances in genomics are transforming the way science \n     is conducted. Our understanding of basic mechanisms has \n     increased exponentially with the widespread adoption of high-\n     throughput screening, genome sequencing, and advances in \n     bioinformatics. This transformation of the biosciences is \n     profoundly affecting the practice of medicine. Advances in \n     the biological sciences have changed the way we view disease. \n     We now recognize that dysfunction of specific biochemical \n     pathways that govern cell behavior may be similar in \n     superficially disparate diseases or quite different in \n     patients with the same category of diagnosis.\n       When you and I were in medical school, all patients with \n     cancers of a given organ were treated with the same \n     combination of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgery. \n     With today's application of high-throughput screening and \n     genomics, we are now shifting to treating an individual's \n     cancer with a kind of ``precision medicine'' that is based \n     upon the patient's genome and the genome of his or her \n     individual tumor. As an industry scientist recently told the \n     New York Times, ``[t]he old way of doing clinical trials \n     where patients are only tied together by the organ where \n     their cancer originated, those days are passing.'' This is \n     just one more reason why directing research resources toward \n     a particular disease without flexibility, as defined in the \n     pre-genomic era, can run counter to scientific opportunity.\n       In closing, let me be clear that the NIH is not permitted \n     to take a position on the recalcitrant cancer legislation \n     being considered by the Congress. Such statements can only be \n     issued by the Office of Management and Budget as a Statement \n     of Administration Policy.\n       Thank you for your continued support of the NIH.\n           Sincerely yours, with best personal regards,\n                                  Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D.,\n                                                          Director\n\n  Mr. COBURN. It is outlining NIH's and specifically the National \nCancer Institute's concerns with this type of directive from us. I \nthink they care about whether we solve these problems associated with \nthese recalcitrant cancers. I think people who want to get it solved \nare true in their motives to try to solve it.\n  But there are some significant things in his letter that I would like \nto quote for my colleagues because I think it might just change your \nmind about us micromanaging what they are doing.\n  First, he says:\n\n       We have all the authorities to do whatever we need to do \n     with the money that you have given us. We can do all these \n     things you want us to do. If you tell us to do them, we will \n     do them. But we already have the authority to go where we \n     think we are going to get the best results in the quickest \n     way.\n       NIH constantly examines scientific opportunities and \n     conducts research evaluation and planning opportunities \n     within its current statutory\n\n  In other words they are looking, trying to figure out how they \nchange, where they go now\n\n       The national cancer institute recently organized a group to \n     provide a ``horizon scan'' of pancreatic ductal \n     adenocarcinoma ad carcinoma, building on previous planning\n\n  They just did all this. They have just been through a total review of \npancreatic adenocarcinoma, and they have just shifted where they are \nspending funds to address this issue.\n\n       Basic research that may lack any overt connection to \n     specific diseases is the foundation for disease-specific \n     translational and clinical research.\n\n  We must preserve this translational research if in fact we will want \nto eventually apply it to specific diseases. So I would say this bill, \n``pre'' the genomic age, would be a right thing for us to do. It is the \nwrong thing for us to do because what we are actually going to do is we \nare going to force the NIH to do things that are not going to benefit \nthe results--the outcome of these diseases and waste money on what is \nbeing directed.\n  Do we have a time limit?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Evidently; 10 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent to continue until I finish my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am distracted. What is the unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. COBURN. I wanted to finish my remarks.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I understand. Was it an additional 5 minutes?\n  Mr. COBURN. It will not be much longer than that. I am certainly not\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. ``Advances in the biological sciences have changed the \nway we view disease. We now recognize the dysfunction of specific \nbiochemical pathways''--not disease-specific pathways--``biochemical \npathways that govern cell behavior that may be similar in superficially \ndisparate diseases or quite different in patients with the same \ndisease.\n  What they are saying to us, through this letter, is that, of course, \nthey are going to do what we tell them to do. But the very intent of \nwhat we are wanting to accomplish is we are going to delay the outcome \nbecause we have not significantly, in the last 3 years, significantly \nincreased NIH's budget. So limited dollars are going to be spent as \ndirected through this recalcitrant bill that are not going to direct \nthe translational research and biochemical pathway research they are \nin.\n  I would just tell my colleagues in the next 10 years we are going to \nsee such phenomenal changes in our approach to disease, and the \ntreatments for that, and the reason we are going to see it is because \nwe stop looking at diseases and started looking at translational \ngenomics and biochemical pathways.\n  I will be one of the few who vote against this. I am fine with a \nvoice vote if no other colleagues object. I have no problems with that. \nBut in the name of doing good I suggest that we are actually going to \nlimit our ability to achieve, at a sooner time, the cures that \neverybody who is supporting this bill would like to see.\n  I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. With the permission of the chairman, may I ask for a \nvoice vote at this time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I know of nobody else who wishes to speak on this \namendment--I withhold that so we can hold off and see if anybody else \nwishes to speak.\n  Mr. President, I know of no further debate on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3180) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Senator Portman, I believe, wishes to speak relative to an \namendment? I believe the Senator from Ohio wishes to speak relative to \nan amendment? I ask Senator Portman be recognized for--how many \nminutes, may I ask the Senator?\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Seven minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. For up to 10 minutes, to speak up to 10 minutes.\n\n[[Page S7165]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Partisan Rule Change\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I commend the chairman and ranking member \nfor the way they are handling this bill. As we have seen on the floor \ntoday, Democrats and Republicans alike are able to offer amendments and \nhave an honest debate on the issues, which is exactly how we ought to \nbe operating.\n  As the fiscal cliff approaches we should not only be working together \nacross the aisle to address issues like we are today with the Defense \nauthorization bill, but we should also be working to address other \ncritical issues, including tax issues and spending issues. That is what \nI wanted to address.\n  We have a lot of challenges. Instead of pulling together we seem to \nbe pulling apart, and I am specifically referring to some of the \nsuggestions by some in the majority that we consider a controversial \nand partisan rule change that would marginalize minority Members and in \na way that breaks the current rules to change the rules.\n  What I mean by that is it takes 67 votes to change a rule in the \nSenate. That is a rule, by the way, that dates back to 1917. The reason \nthat is in place is because, obviously, folks wanted to force the \nmajority and minority to work together to make those rule changes. We \ndon't get a two-thirds vote without that. I think it is important that \nthe basic rules are ones that are agreed on.\n  The party in the majority tends to change a lot around here. In fact, \nwe have shifted back and forth between Republicans and Democrats 7 \ntimes in the past 30 years. So at one point we are in the majority, one \npoint in the minority, and that is why having these basic rules in \nplace make sense.\n  There are some proposing we get around the 67-vote majority by some \nprocedure where, instead of having a two-thirds vote, we would just \nhave a majority vote to change a rule. Regardless of what rule that \nmight be--some would say it would be on the motion to proceed and other \naspects of the filibuster. Of course it would set a precedent that \ncould change the rules for other things as well. I think that would \nprove counterproductive in the short term. I also think it would prove \ncounterproductive in the long run for the Senate.\n  All of us are focused, I hope, on the serious economic challenges \nthat we face with the fiscal cliff impending. I think this would be the \nwrong time for us to put this body into an even more partisan \nenvironment by changing these rules.\n  Again, I commend the chairman and ranking member for what we are \ndoing today because this is an example of how the Senate can work and \nhas worked on several bills in my short time here. But in other cases \nwe have not been able to do that. I think that involves both parties, \nagain, working together to solve these problems.\n  The issue before us is the fiscal cliff, and I also want to address \nbriefly, if I may, the ongoing discussion about taxes and what we \nshould do regarding taxes. I want to take this opportunity to talk a \nlittle about why some of us believe that raising tax rates would be \ncounterproductive at a time when our economy is so weak, and that there \nis another opportunity, and that is for tax reform.\n  The jobs crisis and the debt crisis are linked, and the President has \nmade that point. He has said his priority in the grand bargain \ndiscussions, the fiscal cliff discussions, is to ensure that we \nencourage economic growth and jobs. So we should use this as an \nopportunity to address the underlying problems that are holding back \nour economy, an economy that is in tough shape today. Unemployment is \nstill stuck just below 8 percent. The projections CBO has given us for \nthe next year, by the way, are continued anemic growth in the economy \nand, in fact, unemployment going up, not down.\n  The economic case against imposing higher taxes is overwhelming. We \nall know if we tax something, people tend to do less of it and that is \none reason why smoking is taxed, to get people to quit smoking. So why \ndo we want to raise taxes on working, saving, and investing? Instead, \nwe should encourage policies that create jobs, not discourage them \nthrough higher taxes.\n  Don't take it from me. There are others who have commented on this on \nboth sides of the aisle. Christina Romer, President Obama's former \nChief Economic Adviser, has written that in most circumstances, a tax \nincrease that equals about 1 percent of GDP actually lowers GDP by \nabout 3 percent. Harvard economist Marty Feldstein has written that a \n$1 increase in tax rates tends to cost the economy about 76 cents of \ngrowth.\n  There is a global perspective on this as well because other countries \nhave gone through these fiscal problems and they have chosen to cut \nspending in some cases and raise taxes in other cases. There is a \nHarvard economist, Alberto Alesina, who has recently studied the \nexperience of 17 countries in the developed world, such as the United \nStates. Over the past 25 years, he has looked at how they have \nattempted to reduce their budget deficits. Based on IMF data, which is \nthe International Monetary Fund, he concluded that ``tax-based deficit \nreduction'' was, in his words, ``always recessionary.'' By contrast, \nreducing deficits by cutting spending and enacting pro-growth reforms, \nincluding tax reform, actually spurred economic growth, according to \nthe same study.\n  I think that this is consistent with our own economic history. \nBetween 1948 and 1961, a period when the highest income tax rate rose \nfrom 82 to 91 percent, we went through some tough times. We had four \nrecessions. Thankfully, our exports that helped rebuild Europe \nfollowing World War II helped keep the economy moving. Reducing the top \ntax rate to 70 percent also helped, but the 1970s were still a period \nof stagnation, recession, double-digit unemployment, double-digit \ninterest rates, double-digit inflation. It was when Ronald Reagan \nreduced rates to 28 percent that we saw this impressive period of \ngrowth, maybe the most impressive ever.\n  It is something we saw again in 1997 when capital gains taxes that \nwere cut under President Clinton and the Republican leadership in \nCongress were followed by a surge of investment and growth into the \nlate 1990s. Again, after the 2003 tax rate cuts, we saw another example \nof the power of low tax rates. This was the 2003 tax cuts. In the six \nquarters before those rate cuts, the economy lost 1 million jobs. In \nthe six quarters after those tax rate reductions, in 2003, economic \ngrowth nearly doubled and 2.3 million jobs were added.\n  Some tax increase advocates may assert a willingness to accept slower \neconomic growth in the cause of deficit reduction and that is a \nlegitimate point of view, that we need to have slower economic growth \nbecause deficit reduction is so important. But I would also point out \nsome statistics. Slow growth also means less tax revenue. The White \nHouse's own data suggests that even a .26-percent reduction in economic \ngrowth--which is likely with big tax hikes--would wipe out the entire \n$800 billion in promised deficit reduction from higher tax rates. \nGrowth is so incredibly important to reducing our debt and deficit and \ngetting in control of our fiscal situation. So tax rate increases are \nnot only bad economic policy, but they tend to be bad budget policy.\n  Tax reform is needed, and through tax reform we could have higher \nrevenues. But both theory and practice make a convincing case that \nkeeping rates low is better for the economy and jobs. Structural \nspending reforms combined with pro-growth tax reform, in my view, are \nthe right approach and I think historically that has proven to be true. \nI will speak for myself as one Republican, although other Republicans \nas well are willing to accept new revenues, but the right way to do it \nis through reforming our outdated Tax Code and having these structural \nreforms that everybody feels are necessary.\n  Both the corporate and individual sides of the Code are marked by \nrelatively high marginal rates and a complex maze of tax preferences \nthat distort economic decisions, misallocate capital, and allow some \ntaxpayers to avoid paying their share. Tax reform can kill two birds \nwith one stone. By capping or eliminating inefficient tax\n\n[[Page S7166]]\n\npreferences, we can avoid raising corporate and individual rates, \nwithout adding a dime to the deficit, by the way. In fact, if done \nright, tax reform will increase revenues by spurring growth, job \ncreation and, therefore, bigger tax receipts.\n  Tax reform is both a fiscal and competitive necessity for our \ncountry. It has been more than 25 years since we substantially reformed \nthe Tax Code and twice as long--about 50 years--since we did a bottom-\nup review of our international tax laws. The world has changed a lot in \nthat time period, yet America has not kept up. The underlying \nassumptions in our Tax Code are, frankly, out of step with today's \ncomplex global economy. This is especially evident in our corporate Tax \nCode. The United States is now the highest corporate tax country among \nall the developed countries in the developed world. Canada has lowered \nits federal corporate rate from 16.5 percent to 15 percent, bringing \nits combined rate to 25 percent--nearly 15 points lower than the U.S. \ncombined rate. Our rate is 39.2 percent when we combine the State and \nFederal burden. The Federal burden is 35 percent and the State burden \nis closer to 36 percent. So right now the average among all of the \ndeveloped countries in the world is 25.1 percent, and the U.S. rate \nstands at 39.2 percent when we combine the State and Federal burdens.\n  A similar trend, by the way, has played out with respect to \ninternational tax rules, as our trading partners, including Japan and \nBritain, have moved to a more competitive, territorial-like tax regime \nover the past 10 years, which encourages movement of investment, \ncapital, and jobs overseas. So there is a simple point here which is, \nby standing still, the United States is falling behind. The resulting \ndrag on American competitiveness and job creation is real and \nsubstantial.\n  The solution is tax reform that broadens the tax base by scaling back \ntax preferences and cutting the corporate rate. We could cut it to 25 \npercent and scale back the deductions, credits, and exemptions, and \nhave a competitive, territorial system and have it all be revenue \nneutral. There is such a proposal by the Joint Committee on Taxation \nhere in Congress.\n  I am not saying it is easy. Some of these preferences, of course, and \nloopholes are ones that are very difficult to reduce or eliminate, but \nit would be the right thing to do for our economy. I think we have seen \nsome signs of developing bipartisan consensus on this issue and I am \nhopeful we will see the same movement for pro-growth individual tax \nreform, because reforming the entire Tax Code is critical to regaining \ncompetitiveness, spurring growth, and producing the revenues we need to \npay for important public priorities.\n  The smart way to raise revenue is not through tax hikes that will \nshrink our economy, but rather through tax reform designed to help grow \nthe economy and help make American workers and businesses more \ncompetitive so we can compete and win in the global economy.\n  Again, today as we are approaching the fiscal cliff I hope this \nSenate works together on a bipartisan basis to work toward tax reform \nin a way to increase revenues and grow our economy while we look at the \nimportant structural reforms we have to make in order to solve the \nfiscal crisis we face.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me elaborate a little bit on what the \nSenator from Ohio just said. I think it is important to remember that \nthe whole idea was a Democratic idea and not a Republican idea. Some of \nus remember. We were not actually here at the time, but in the 1960s \nduring the Kennedy administration--of course, the last time I checked \nhe was a Democrat--he was the one who made this statement. I have \nquoted him very often. He said, We need more revenue to take care of \nthe great society programs that he had kind of inherited and was \nfurthering. He said, The best way to increase revenue is to decrease \nmarginal rates. He did that. I remember the top rate went down from 90 \npercent to 70 percent, and during his period of time, the total amount \nof revenue that came from marginal rates raised from $94 billion to \n$153 billion.\n  Then, a few years later, along came Ronald Reagan and the total \namount of revenue that was raised for marginal rates in the year 1980 \nwas $244 billion and in 1990 it was $466 billion, which almost doubled \nin the decade that had the most streamlining and reduced reduction in \nmarginal rates in our history.\n  So I think it is interesting to observe that this is not--it wasn't \nall a Republican idea, but it is something that has worked every time \nit has been tried.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. I thank my colleague from Oklahoma. I wish to follow up \nbriefly on that and say that in 1997, when we decided to move toward a \nbalanced budget agreement when President Clinton was President, there \nwas also an agreement to cut the capital gains rate. We sometimes \nforget the capital gains rate cut produced a lot of revenue that was \nnot expected. As a result, we got to a unified balanced budget on a \nunified basis more rapidly than anybody thought we would. It came 2 or \n3 years sooner than projected, in part because there was about $100 \nbillion of new revenue that showed up the next year from the fact that \nwe did reduce the capital gains rates.\n  I understand the need for us to deal with the deficit and to have \nrevenue. There is no question that this is necessary, but to do it by \nraising rates alone, which is what is being proposed by some people, is \ngoing to result in lower economic growth, it is going to result in job \nloss, and it is not going to have the intended benefit on the revenue \nside. The alternative is clear, which is, for the first time in a \ncouple of decades, we need to get busy on reforming this Tax Code as \nRonald Reagan did with Democratic help, including Democratic Senators \nsuch as Phil Bradley here in the U.S. Senate, to encourage growth and \nto encourage the kind of economic growth that is going to result in \nmore revenue coming in. We should not miss this opportunity to do that.\n  As I said earlier, I believe there is a building consensus around \nthat. We saw it in the Simpson-Bowles Commission. We have seen it in \nthe Rivlin-Domenici work, and other outside groups have looked at this, \nat our Tax Code. And by broadening the base, we can be more competitive \nand through growth have additional revenues coming in.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I appreciate the comments of the Senator from Ohio. I \nwould go a little farther and say this obsession that the only way to \ndo these things is to raise taxes, I think that flies in the face of \nhistory.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask that the quorum call be dispensed \nwith.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I listened to the Senator from Ohio and I \nwant to be heard because he is talking about the fiscal cliff and how \nupset he is at the thought that the wealthiest people in America might \ngo back to the tax rates we had under Bill Clinton when we had the \ngreatest prosperity, we had 23 million new jobs, and we balanced the \nbudget to the point where we even had a surplus. My friend comes down \nhere and complains that the proposal on the table would give 98 percent \nof the people a tax cut and he is upset that 2 percent of the people \nmight have to go back to the rates under Bill Clinton.\n  I want to say something. We just had an election. We had a big \nelection. We had a tough election. We had an expensive election. One of \nthe major parts of that election revolved around what do we do about \nthe deficits, what do we do about economic growth, what do we do about \nspending. We discussed it in the Senate races, we discussed it in the \nHouse races, and, of course, President Obama and candidate Governor \nRomney discussed it again and again.\n  My friend talks about consensus. Let me tell my colleagues the \nconsensus. More than 60 percent of the people agree with President \nObama and the Democrats that we ought to climb down off this fiscal \ncliff in the next 5 minutes and pass what the Senate passed, which is \nto renew all the Bush tax cuts and go back to those over $250,000 to \nthe rates of Bill Clinton. That is what we passed here. That\n\n[[Page S7167]]\n\nwould bring us almost $1 trillion over 10 years. That will get us to \nclimb down that cliff.\n  Then we have other parts of the cliff, there is no question about it, \nincluding the automatic sequester. I think it is easy to deal with that \nby bringing home some of the overseas account money and applying it to \nthe sequester and getting rid of at least half of that sequester, and \nmaybe all of the sequester. But, no, people are going to listen to \nthese speeches every day about how we are obsessed with taxes.\n  What are people talking about when they say obsessed with taxes? I \nwill tell my colleagues what I am obsessed about. I am obsessed with \nthe fact that we passed a tax cut for 98 percent of the American people \nand our friends are so worried about the millionaires and the \nbillionaires that they will not allow that bill to be voted on in the \nHouse. So people can stand up here morning, noon, and night, and I want \nthem to and I respect their views, believe me, but I do not agree with \nthem.\n  It is no wonder that the American people are confused. We know we \nhave the fiscal cliff. We know we don't want to see tax rates go up for \nthe middle class. Yet the Republicans say they are going to hold up all \nthose tax breaks for 98 percent of our people because they want to hold \non to the tax breaks for billionaires and for millionaires. We had an \nelection about that.\n  People agreed with us. I suppose we are going to have to hear these \nspeeches every day about how we are going to grow our way out of the \ndeficit. We are going to grow our way out of the deficit? Really? Look \nwhat happened under George W. Bush. He inherited surpluses. He turned \nit into deficits as far as the eye can see, with huge tax cuts to the \nmillionaires and billionaires--huge--the very tax cuts our friends are \ndefending right now. He did two wars on the credit card and we wound up \nin a mess.\n  So we have to come together with the best ideas that we can have. I \nknow we can reach agreement. But let's do the first step, which is to \ntake care of 98 percent of the people. The Republicans want to have tax \nbreaks for 100 percent of the people. We are saying: Can you take 98 \npercent?\n  If I stopped you on the street and said: I am willing to give you 98 \npercent of what you say you want, and you walk away from me, and you \nattack me, and you say I am not ready to do anything, I honestly think \npeople would scratch their heads.\n  So I think it is clear. The Senate passed a bill to renew the tax \nbreaks for 98 percent of the people. We are saying up to $250,000 in \nincome, we go right back to those Bush tax cut rates. But over \n$250,000, we go to the Clinton years, pay a little bit more, so we can \nattack this deficit, so we can make the investments we need to make in \nthis great country of ours.\n  I will tell you, if the Republicans can do this, we are going to see \nsmiles on the faces of the people. I was very happy to see that Tom \nCole over in the House, who was the head of the RCC, the Republican \nCongressional Committee over there, says it is time to come to an \nagreement on that proposal.\n  So I say to the Republicans: We are giving you 98 percent. Take it. \nThen let's sit down and debate the rest of it. There are a lot of other \nthings we have to do. There is the AMT. We have to do a doc fix. We \nhave to do a lot of other things. I am willing to compromise on those \nthings. But let's at least get those tax cuts in place right now before \nthis holiday season so that the middle class knows they are not going \nto face a tax increase. I can say honestly that the American people \nwould think we were doing the right thing if we were to see the House \ntake up the Senate bill and pass it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on a broadly bipartisan \namendment that I have filed, and that I hope and believe will be called \nup at some point. Obviously, I would like it to be adopted by unanimous \nconsent but, if not, it merits a rollcall vote, and I am confident it \nwill be addressed on a rollcall vote.\n  This amendment is amendment No. 3090 to this National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013. It will reauthorize two very \nimportant and very broadly supported programs--the Assistance to \nFirefighters, AFG, Program--which otherwise used to be known as FIRE, \nthe FIRE Act--and the Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response \nProgram, known as SAFER. This amendment also reauthorizes the U.S. Fire \nAdministration for 5 years, an agency which is a component of FEMA that \nis focused on supporting firefighters and EMS personnel.\n  This amendment reauthorizes AFG and SAFER for 5 years but it also \ntakes much needed steps to ensure that the firefighters not only have \nthe equipment, vehicles, and personnel that we need them to have to do \nthe jobs they do for us in our country every day, the amendment also \nhelps departments in communities struggling with economic difficulties, \ncreating a hardship waiver for both of these fire programs--AFG and \nSAFER--that allows FEMA to waive requirements in communities that have \nbeen hard hit in these tough economic times.\n  Some people might say: Well, why has the Federal Government \nestablished these programs to support firefighting? Aren't those local \nresponsibilities? Well, of course, the Federal Government has partnered \nwith many local and State responsibilities that we deem to have \nnational importance.\n  There is no question since 9-11-2001, as we witnessed those \nfirefighters putting their lives on the line, running into danger to \nsave people as opposed to running away from it--and we contemplated \nafter 9-11-2001, as we have consistently in the Senate Homeland \nSecurity Committee, how we would respond--are we ready to respond to, \nGod forbid, another mass terrorist attack on the United States? The \nfirst line of defense will be the local firefighters, the local law \nenforcers, and the local emergency medical personnel.\n  So these brave and skillful firefighters around America now become \npart of the first line of response to the kind of threats in this \nunconventional age in which we live that our homeland security is \nthreatened by.\n  As important as it is to help our firefighters, obviously, many of us \non both sides of the aisle, who have cosponsored both of these bills, \nunderstand we have to demand accountability as we spend taxpayer \ndollars in a time when we are trying to reduce our deficit and debt.\n  For this reason, the amendment does a couple of things. It includes \nprovisions to prevent earmarks from being attached to these programs. \nAFG and SAFER actually have never been earmarked, which is an \nimpressive accomplishment. In other words, these are formula programs \nin that sense and decided on a merit basis, decided on applications, \nnever earmarked from Congress. We should keep it that way.\n  But this amendment, recognizing the tough economic times we are in, \nalso reduces the authorizations for these two programs, AFG and SAFER, \nby more than 30 percent--more than 30 percent. So we are meeting a \nnational need with the authorization of these programs, but we are \ndoing it in a way that is mindful of the tough fiscal times we are in.\n  Supporting our Nation's firefighters and emergency medical service \nresponders is a national priority. It is, in my opinion, one that is \nnot only broadly supported by Members of both parties and an occasional \nIndependent here in the Senate, but is broadly supported by the \nAmerican people regardless of where they live all over this country.\n  So, Mr. President, I will, with the cooperation and support of the \ntwo managers of the bill, who are supporters of these two pieces of \nlegislation--Chairman Levin and Senator McCain--look forward to the \ntime when I can ask that this amendment be the pending business and \nthat we can either adopt it by consent or bring it up for a rollcall \nvote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S7168]]\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to \nspeak as in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise in support of an Ayotte \namendment, No. 3245, an amendment that makes permanent the current \nprohibition on the use of defense funds to transfer or release \nGuantanamo Bay detainees into the United States. This amendment is \nidentical in substance to section 1027 of the Fiscal Year 2012 National \nDefense Authorization Act, except that it prohibits the use of the \nfunds permanently.\n  We know the President said he would close Guantanamo almost 4 years \nago. I thought it was a bad idea then; I think it is an even worse idea \ntoday. We should move beyond campaign promises and think about what \nmakes sense on this issue. The stubborn refusal to increase the Gitmo \ndetainee population has been the key stumbling block in establishing an \neffective long-term detention policy.\n  The American people have been pretty unified in their opposition to \nbringing Gitmo detainees to the United States, and I believe we should \nlisten to them.\n  I understand that Senator Feinstein just released the GAO report she \nrequested regarding facilities and factors to consider if Gitmo \ndetainees were brought to the United States. I have reviewed this \nreport, and I have to respectfully disagree that this report offers any \nsupport whatsoever for the idea that Gitmo detainees can or should be \nmoved to the United States.\n  The very first page of the GAO report lays out in stark terms the \nserious problems that would come into play if detainees from Guantanamo \nwere transferred to the United States: legal and cost considerations, \ncompliance with U.S. and international laws, collecting intelligence \ninformation, and ensuring the safety and security of the general public \nand personnel at these facilities.\n  The report makes very clear that the Department of Justice does not \nhave the authority to maintain custody of detainees under the AUMF. In \nother words, even without the prohibition on transfers of detainees to \nthe United States, it would be illegal for the Bureau of Prisons or the \nMarshals Service to take custody of Guantanamo detainees.\n  Moreover, the Department of Justice told the GAO--and I quote--it \n``does not plan to transfer detainees to the United States,'' saying it \nraises legal, policy, and resource issues that descriptions of current \npolicies and practices contained in the GAO report cannot fully \naddress.\n  Essentially, the Department of Justice is saying that on top of those \nissues already described in the GAO report, such as insufficient \nstandards for law or war detention, severe overcrowding, and \n``implications for the public safety,'' there would be even more issues \nthat are not mentioned at all. And that is from a Department of Justice \nthat has fully supported the idea of moving Gitmo detainees into the \nUnited States.\n  Housing these detainees in DOD corrections facilities does not seem \nto be the answer either because of equally troubling legal and safety \nissues for detention of these individuals, including the Geneva \nConventions' prohibition on detaining prisoners of war in \npenitentiaries.\n  These are just some of the reasons Congress has prohibited the \ntransfer of these detainees to the United States and why those \nprohibitions must continue.\n  This prohibition made sense last year and it still makes sense today. \nThe GAO report only confirms that. The detainees who remain at Gitmo \ninclude the ones who have been determined to be too dangerous to \ntransfer, including the individuals who were responsible for the \nmasterminding of the attack on September 11, which we just celebrated \nthe 11th anniversary of.\n  So if that is the case, why on Earth would we put these detainees \nwhom we will not send to other countries in cities and towns across the \nUnited States of America? The Federal Government's primary \nresponsibility is to keep the American people safe. Keeping these \ndetainees at Gitmo accomplishes that goal.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Ayotte amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I also ask to be recognized as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, the Senator from Georgia is exactly right. \nI do not think, in the years I have been here, I have ever seen one \nissue where everyone is in agreement. If we go back to 2007, 94 Members \nof this Senate got together and they said--and this is all documented--\nthat: Detainees housed at Guantanamo Bay should not be released into \nAmerican society, nor should they be transferred stateside into \nfacilities.\n  We all agreed on that. Then we agreed again in 2009 and every year \nsince then, as the Senator from Georgia has said. But a lot of people \nhave forgotten. We have had this issue for so many years now, they have \nforgotten some of the original reasons why. One of the obvious \nreasons--there are three reasons. One was that prisons that hold these \ndetainees become magnets. I do not think people understand that a \nterrorist is not a criminal. He is a terrorist. His job is to train \npeople to kill other people, to engage in terrorist activities.\n  Do we truly want them in there talking to all our prisoners? That was \none of the major reasons people were all coalescing around the idea \nthat we have a great place to put these guys; that is, Guantanamo Bay.\n  The second reason is the prison guards. They have to be specially \ntrained in order to guard a prison that has terrorists as opposed to \nthe normal criminal element.\n  The third is what FBI Director Robert Mueller has said; that there is \na very real possibility that Gitmo detainees will recruit more \nterrorists from among the Federal inmate population and continue al-\nQaida operations from the inside, which is how the New York synagogue \nbombers were recruited.\n  We should not even be debating this. The Ayotte amendment is one that \nwill take care of this so we do not have to worry about it from year to \nyear, we do not have to stand here and anguish over this thing that we \nhave decided several times.\n  I can remember--I guess it was back in the early administration of \nObama--when he identified 17 areas in the United States that would be \nappropriate for incarcerating terrorists whom we would take out of \nGitmo. One of those places happened to be Fort Sill in my State of \nOklahoma. So I went down to Fort Sill. I looked at the facility we had \nthat was within the Fort Sill facility.\n  There was a lady there whose name is Sergeant Major Carter. I can \nremember when she came up to me she said: Senator, why in the world? Go \nback and tell those people back there that they do not understand what \nis going on. This is coming from a sergeant major. She happened to be a \nBlack lady. She had been down there for some time. She said: Go back \nand tell them I had two tours in Gitmo. There is no place that is more \nhumane. There is no place that is taking care of them, no place where \nwe can secure the area so we protect our prison guards like Gitmo.\n  She even went on to say one of the biggest problems we had with the \ninmates in Gitmo is an overweight problem because they are eating \nbetter than they have ever eaten in their lives. They had medical \nattention for diseases they did not know existed.\n  So we have an opportunity there to do it. I applaud Senator Ayotte \nfor wanting to address this so we do not have to go through this every \nyear. Nothing has changed. We know it is a revolving door. People who \ngo out from there, many of them return to the battleground, and there \nis no place else that offers this security and the confinement.\n  The last thing I would say, we do not have many good deals in \ngovernment, and let's see anyone here find a better deal. We have had \nthis--it was either\n\n[[Page S7169]]\n\nsince 1901 or 1904. I cannot remember the year. But as I do recall we \nare still under the same lease agreement. That whole facility that we \nhave at Gitmo, along with the court system down there, all we pay is \n$4,000 a year.\n  Ever heard of a better deal than that? About half the time Castro \ndoes not bill us. So let's take advantage of one of the few good deals \nwe have, one of the few security deals we have, and make this a \npermanent arrangement. I hope we have the chance to vote on it. It is \nmy understanding we are going to be able to address these and bring \nthem up, put them in the queue and have votes. Hopefully, that will \neven be tonight.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order \nfor the Lieberman amendment, No. 3090, to be called up with the \nmodification that is at the desk; that the amendment, as modified, be \nagreed to; that following disposition of the Lieberman amendment, it be \nin order for the following amendments to be called up: Ayotte No. 3245 \non Guantanamo and Feinstein amendment No. 3018 on detainees; that there \nbe up to 20 minutes of debate equally divided in the usual form on the \nAyotte amendment; that upon the use or yielding back of time on the \nAyotte amendment, there be up to 60 minutes of debate equally divided \nin the usual form on the Feinstein amendment; further, that at 9:30 \np.m. this evening, the Senate proceed to votes in relation to the \nAyotte and Feinstein amendments in the order listed and that no \namendments be in order to the amendments prior to the votes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, I \nbelieve we will have a package, also, following this, of amendments \nthat have been cleared by both sides.\n  I would like to express my personal appreciation for the cooperative \nand compromising fashion in which this unanimous consent agreement was \nentered. I would like to thank all parties, including the chairperson \nof the Intelligence Committee and others. I think this will allow us to \nmove forward and complete this legislation sooner rather than later.\n  There are still a lot of amendments that have been filed, and at some \npoint that has to stop and at some point we are going to have to finish \nall these. Many of them are duplicative and many of them are not \nparticularly necessary, but I think we have made a giant step forward. \nI am confident we can complete this authorization bill and we will \ncontinue the record of now some 51 years of having completed an \nauthorization bill.\n  I thank the chairman for his leadership.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that any further \namendments must be filed no later than 7:30 tonight.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, does this \napply to second-degree amendments?\n  Mr. LEVIN. If there is an amendment filed tonight by 7:30. It could \nbe offered as a second degree at some later time, but it has to be \nfiled tonight by 7:30.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would indulge my colleague, apparently \nthere are two people on our side we would have to check with. I ask if \nour colleague could withhold that request to see if we can work it out.\n  I would also ask, is it not possible that if further amendments can \nbe worked out to be voted on tonight after the two that are scheduled \nto be voted on, there could be other votes tonight to try to continue \nto dispose of amendments on the bill; is that correct?\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator is correct. These are not the last two votes \ntonight necessarily at all. As of now, we are still planning on having \nvotes tomorrow.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard to the filing \ndeadline request.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I withdraw that request.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. It is withdrawn.\n\n\n               Lieberman Amendment No. 3090, as Modified\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to temporarily set \naside the pending amendment so I may call up my amendment No. 3245, \nwhich is at the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Ms. Ayotte] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3245.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds for the transfer or release of \n certain individuals from United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, \n                                 Cuba)\n\n       At the end of subtitle D of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1032. PROHIBITION ON USE OF FUNDS FOR THE TRANSFER OR \n                   RELEASE OF INDIVIDUALS FROM UNITED STATES NAVAL \n                   STATION, GUANTANAMO BAY, CUBA.\n\n       No authorized to be appropriated funds may be used to \n     transfer, release, or assist in the transfer or release to or \n     within the United States, its territories, or possessions of \n     Khalid Sheikh Mohammed or any other detainee who--\n       (1) is not a United States citizen or a member of the Armed \n     Forces of the United States; and\n       (2) is or was held on or after January 20, 2009, at United \n     States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, by the Department \n     of Defense.\n\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I rise in support of my amendment No. \n3245.\n  Last year, in the Defense authorization bill we had in it a \nprohibition that would prohibit transferring those who are held in \nmilitary custody at the Guantanamo Bay facility from there to the \nUnited States of America. This year, as the language of the Defense \nauthorization stands, there is no such prohibition, making it possible \nfor the administration, should it choose, to transfer from the \nGuantanamo Bay detention facility 166 foreign enemy combatants who are \nbeing currently detained at Guantanamo. I am deeply concerned that the \nDefense authorization does not include this prohibition of transfer \nlanguage, and that is why I have brought forth this amendment.\n  I am also pleased that this amendment is being cosponsored by the \nvice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Senator \nChambliss, as well as Senators Inhofe, Graham, Kirk, and Sessions.\n  We have at Guantanamo Bay a top-rate facility that allows for the \nsecure and humane detention and interrogation of foreign terrorist \ndetainees, including right now the mastermind of the attacks of our \ncountry on 9/11.\n  I don't think anyone in this body would dispute that when our country \nwas attacked on September 11, that was an act of war against the United \nStates of America, and we remain, unfortunately, at war with members of \nal-Qaida and other terrorist organizations that want to kill Americans \nand our allies simply for what we believe in and for what we stand for \nin this country. This is a war, and those who were killed on September \n11 were victims of this war.\n  One of the concerns I have is that when we are at war, the priority \nalways has to be to detain those who are captured, pursuant to that \nwar, in military custody.\n  We have at Guantanamo Bay a top-rate facility. I have visited it \npersonally. Those who are held there are treated humanely. It is a very \nsecure facility that is not on our homeland, and it is very well \nprotected by our military.\n  Also at that facility is a top-rate court, where military commissions \ncan be held for those who are charged who are held at Guantanamo Bay. \nWhy is that important? Because when you are at war, those aren't mere \ncriminals--they are not mere criminals who have committed a burglary in \nour neighborhood. They have committed acts of terror against our \ncountry, and they are very dangerous individuals, many of whom would \nattempt do so again were they released. That is another reason why I \nhave brought this amendment forward, because I think it is very \nimportant that the American people be safe and secure and that those \nindividuals who are being held there--many of them who are tremendously \ndangerous--be held in a secure facility that is not on our soil.\n  In 2009, the Attorney General discussed and sought to bring Khalid \nShaikh Mohammed--the mastermind of 9/11--to trial in New York City. The \nAmerican people and members of both sides of the aisle objected to \nhaving the trial of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed in New York City. As a \nresult, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed is being held at Guantanamo Bay. He will \nbe tried by a military commission. But that demonstration made it clear \nthe American people do not want foreign members of al-Qaida and \nassociated terrorist organizations being brought to the United States \nwhen we have a secure facility at Guantanamo Bay that we have spent \nresources to update, that is very humane.\n  In fact, in February of 2012, the Washington Post asked: Do you \napprove of the decision to keep open the Guantanamo Bay prison for \nterror suspects? Seventy percent of the American people who answered \nthat survey said: Yes, we approve of it.\n  I want people to understand whom we are talking about transferring \nfrom Guantanamo Bay to the United States of America and understand the \nindividuals and some of the background of those who are being held at \nGuantanamo Bay, coming to a neighborhood near you.\n\n[[Page S7179]]\n\n  This is, of course, the mastermind of the September 11 attacks, \nKhalid Shaikh Mohammed, who is being held at Guantanamo Bay. He is \noften called KSM. He claims to have personally decapitated American \njournalist Daniel Pearl in 2002, and he admitted to playing a role in \nover 30 terrorist plots. Some of these include a 1995 plot to blow up \n12 U.S. airliners flying from Southeast Asia to the United States for \nwhich he was indicted the following year; the 1993 World Trade Center \nbombing; a plot to hit towers in Chicago, Seattle, Los Angeles, New \nYork's Empire State Building, and nuclear power stations. KSM also \nclaimed he was involved in a plot to assassinate Pope John Paul II and \nPresident Bill Clinton. He, of course, met Osama bin Laden in the \n1980s, and in 1999 KSM persuaded Osama bin Laden to support the \nhorrible acts that occurred on our soil on September 11.\n  Mullah Mohammad Fazil is another individual being held at Guantanamo \nBay. Fazil is suspected in the death of CIA Officer Johnny ``Mike'' \nSpann in 2001, the first casualty of the Afghanistan war. He was deemed \nby U.S. officials as a high threat to the United States. It was \nassessed that he would likely rejoin the Taliban and participate in \noperations against U.S. and coalition forces if released. He was at one \ntime the most senior Taliban leader in northern Afghanistan. In fact, \nhe was so senior he once threatened Taliban leader Mullah Omar. Fazil \nhas been implicated in the murder of thousands of Shiites in northern \nAfghanistan under Taliban control, and he is wanted by the United \nNations for possible war crimes.\n  Another individual being held at Guantanamo Bay, Mohammad Nabi, is \ntied to a 2002 attack that killed two Americans and maintains loyalty \nto al-Qaida.\n  Let's be clear. There is a 28-percent recidivism rate of those we \nhave released from Guantanamo Bay back to foreign nationals who have \ngotten back into the battle against our country. These are individuals \nwho have not renounced the war on terror. The recidivism record speaks \nfor itself. They have gotten into the battle. They still want to be \ninvolved in terrorist activities. They still want to be a member of al-\nQaida or other terrorist groups and commit acts against our country and \nour allies.\n  Again, Mohammed Nabi is tied to the 2002 attack that killed two \nAmericans. He maintains loyalty to al-Qaida. Yet some of my colleagues, \nif you think about it, would insist in other amendments we are dealing \nwith today that he be treated as a common criminal.\n  One of the concerns I have is that if we close Guantanamo and we \ntransfer all of those individuals to the U.S. courts, will they then \nclaim all of the rights here in the United States? And God forbid any \nof them had to be released here as a result of challenges they would \nbring.\n  Nabi was a senior Taliban official also who helped finance the \nTaliban and smuggled weapons used against our troops. Nabi maintained \nweapons stockpiles and helped smuggle fighters and weapons to attack \nour warfighters. He is reportedly loyal to the Pakistan-based Haqqani \nterrorist network. The Haqqani network, of course, has been designated \nby the State Department as a foreign terrorist organization, and the \nHaqqanis are loyal to the Taliban and behind some of the largest \nattacks against the United States, Afghan, and coalition troops and \ninterests in Afghanistan. He was also a member of a joint al-Qaida/\nTaliban cell in Khost, Afghanistan, that was involved in attacks \nagainst the United States and coalition forces. He continues to have \nissues with his behavior and how he has conducted himself.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. He is just one of the individuals who, if we do not have \nthis prohibition, may be transferred to the United States of America.\n  Those are just three of the individuals who are present at Guantanamo \nBay who could be coming to a neighborhood near you. Some may cite--one \nof the reasons I brought forth this amendment as well is some may cite \na GAO report saying that we could somehow transfer these individuals \nhere. Let's be clear what that GAO report says.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I ask this body to agree to this amendment and not bring \nthese terrorists here to the United States of America.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I oppose this amendment, and I ask \nMembers to vote against it. The distinguished Senator from New \nHampshire just said that any transfer of Guantanamo detainees out of \nthat facility essentially endangers Americans. But consider how \neffectively we hold terrorists in the United States today.\n  We have 180 terrorists in Federal prisons in the United States of \nAmerica who are in maximum security, and they cannot escape. We have \nsupermax prisons. We have prisons where for 23 hours a day individuals \nare in a cell that is all concrete with just a small viewing place.\n  What this amendment would do is prevent any flexibility forever in \nhow the U.S. government can handle those held in Guantanamo Bay. For \nexample, the Guantanamo detainees could not be moved to a supermax \nprison in the United States. I don't think preventing options is the \nright thing to do. No one in all these years has escaped from a \nsupermax prison in the United States of America. So clearly, the \ndetainees could be held safely and securely.\n  Additionally, I believe this amendment could bring on a veto by the \nPresident. Today, a statement of administration policy was issued that \nindicated concern about restricting the transfer of Guantanamo \ndetainees.\n  I believe Guantanamo has been a blight on the image of our country \nacross this world and it should be closed down. It is important to note \nthat there are reasons to have the flexibility that Senator Ayotte's \namendment would restrict.\n  For example, there are detainees at Guantanamo who could be \ntransferred to the U.S. to be convicted in federal criminal courts. \nOthers try to leave, like the Uighurs, for instance, but there is no \nplace for them to go. And this amendment restricts them from being \ntransferred here to the United States.\n  Many say, why would we let terrorists come to our backyard? Well, \nlet's consider the hundreds of terrorists that are already in our \nbackyard serving time at 98 facilities across the United States, \naccording to a GAO report released yesterday.\n  The Blind Sheik is incarcerated in a Federal prison in the U.S. \nKhalid Shaikh Mohammed's nephew, Ramzi Yousef, is in a Federal prison \nhere. Richard Reid, the Shoe Bomber, is in a Federal prison here. \nNajibullah Zazi and Adis Medunjanin, who plotted to bomb New York \nsubway system, are both in Federal prison here.\n  I have a list of terrorists arrested here, 98 of them since 2009, who \nwill go to Federal prisons. Let me describe a few of these arrests. One \nof the examples was earlier this month, Ralph Deleon, with Miguel \nAlejandro Santana Vidriales and Arifeen David Gojali were arrested by \nthe FBI. They were planning to travel to Afghanistan to attend \nterrorist training and commit violent jihad. They will do time in a \nFederal prison here. Rezwanul Ahsan Nafis plotted to bomb the New York \nFederal Reserve Bank on October 20, 2012. He will do time in a Federal \nprison here. Adel Daoud plotted to bomb a downtown Chicago bar in \nSeptember 2012, and he will do time in a Federal prison here.\n  Our Federal prisons hold terrorists already and they will continue to \nhold them. So to remove any kind of flexibility on Guantanamo and to \nsay that you cannot move a detainee out of the facility and into a \nFederal prison in the United States is a mistake. I very strongly \nbelieve perpetuating Guantanamo forever is a mistake. So I ask my \ncolleagues to vote no on this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have 2 minutes \nto respond, and then I will defer to my colleague from South Carolina.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, how much time is left on \neach side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Time in opposition is 5\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n\n[[Page S7180]]\n\nThe proponents of the amendment have no time remaining.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I don't have any time remaining. OK.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Would the Senator from California agree that there be 5 \nminutes added to each side?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I do not need additional time. I would be willing to \nadd an additional 2 minutes.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Then I defer.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is fine. I think there is no objection.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. We thought there was 20 minutes on each side. Apparently, \nit is close enough. Just a few minutes? But I want Senator Ayotte to \nwrap this up.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that 6 additional minutes be added \nto the proponents of this amendment and, if needed, that 6 additional \nminutes be added to the other side.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I would like to respond briefly.\n  I have great respect for the Senator from California. The distinction \nhere in the cases she has been citing--the disposition of them--I think \nis a very important distinction. Certainly we have good Federal court \nsystems. They are designed, though, for criminals and for crimes. \nGuantanamo Bay is a secure facility on which we have spent substantial \nresources to make a top-grade facility. I visited there. That is for \nterrorists when there is an act of war against our country, and those \nindividuals who are being held there have committed acts that warrant \nthem being held in military detention because of the terrorist acts I \nhave outlined and the individuals involved. There is a big distinction, \nand the American people do not want those individuals brought here to \nthe United States of America.\n  With that, I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, long story short, the American people \nbelieve that the military prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, isolated from \nthe American population, that is being well run by our military and \nmonitored by all kinds of organizations, is a satisfactory answer to \nthe problem of terrorism. Simply stated, the American people do not \nwant to close Guantanamo Bay, which is an isolated, military-controlled \nfacility, to bring these crazy bastards who want to kill us all to the \nUnited States. Most Americans believe that the people at Guantanamo Bay \nare not some kind of burglar or bank robber. They are bent on our \ndestruction. I stand with the American people, that we are under siege, \nwe are under attack, and we are at war.\n  Some of my colleagues in this body have forgotten what 9/11 is all \nabout. The people in that prison who attacked us on 9/11 want to \ndestroy our way of life. They do not want to steal your car. They don't \nwant to break into your house.\n  We have a military prison being well run, so I think the American \npeople are telling everybody in this body: Have you lost your minds? We \nare at war; act like we are at war.\n  I yield.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I have heard a lot of hyperbole \ntonight. Of course we are at war. Part of the glory of this country is \nthe values we hold dear. We have a Federal court system that has \nworked. We have 373 people connected to terrorism serving time in the \nFederal prisons of the United States of America. They are under an \nentity called the Bureau of Prisons that sees that the facilities are \nrun the way they should be. Most are in isolated areas, such as the one \nin Florence in Colorado. It is far from the city--I think some 30 \nmiles--and is a maximum security prison in part.\n  The GAO report just released yesterday showed that the Federal prison \nsystem can hold Guantanamo detainees safely and securely. To keep \nGuantanamo open forever, to say that there is no flexibility as to what \nyou can do with the detainees in terms of transferring them into the \nUnited States, into Federal custody, I think is wrong.\n  I have seen and watched on the Judiciary Committee and the \nIntelligence Committee real problems with military commissions. I think \nSenator Graham understands that and has seen it as well. I do not \nbelieve the rate of convictions in Military Commissions any way equals \nthe rate of convictions in Federal courts and think about how much time \nit has taken to get the Military Commission trials going compared to \nfederal courts.\n  I really think this is very much a kind of political movement, that \nGuantanamo, isolated from everything, run by the military, has to keep \npeople for the rest of their lives. Maybe that is what some people \nthink. But a terrorist act is also a criminal act. It is a heinous \ncriminal act, but one which our federal criminal courts can provide \njustice. Not just Guantanamo. So I really urge a ``no'' vote on this. \nHopefully, if it passes, it can be removed in conference.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. How much time remains for the opponents?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Three minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I very much oppose this amendment. We have \na court system in this country which is second to none. To deny this \nadministration or any administration the opportunity, should they \nchoose to exercise their discretion, to charge terrorists as criminals \nseems to me to be highly unwise and is not a particularly strong step \nin the war against terrorism.\n  This amendment is undesirable. It would create a permanent \nrestriction on the administration's options--not, by the way, just this \nadministration's options, any administration's options in conducting \nthe fight against terrorism. It prevents the administration's ability \nto bring any detainee from Guantanamo for any purpose, including their \nprosecution in court. I think it is unwise and not a strong step at all \nin the war on terror to deprive the President of the tools he might \nneed to carry out the protection of this country from the threat of \nterrorism.\n  This amendment would permanently cut off the possibility of \nprosecuting these Guantanamo detainees in Federal court. I hope we do \nnot do that. I hope we defeat the amendment of my friend from New \nHampshire, Senator Ayotte.\n  Finally, this is what we call veto bait. The administration continues \nto strongly oppose these provisions which intrude upon the executive \nbranch's ability to carry out its military, national security, and \nforeign relations activities and to determine when and where to \nprosecute Guantanamo detainees.\n\n  So it is unwise in terms of our national security; it is unwise in \nterms of the rigidity it imposes on the executive branch as to where to \nprosecute terrorists, alleged terrorists, and it also jeopardizes the \nsigning of this bill as soon as we can get this bill to a conference \nand get a conference report back to both bodies. So I hope we defeat \nthe Ayotte amendment.\n  If we have any time left, I yield it back.\n  Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Ayotte amendment is pending.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Has all time been used?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. All time has expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. So under the existing UC, we are now moving to the \nFeinstein amendment, and that is now the pending business?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. It has not been called up yet by \nthe Senator from California.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I understand. Let me then ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Inhofe, on behalf of Senator Coons and himself, offer a cleared \namendment at this point.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3201\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment for the consideration of amendment No. 3201.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S7181]]\n\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe], for Mr. Coons and \n     himself, proposes an amendment numbered 3201.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate on ongoing efforts to \n    apprehend or remove Joseph Kony and his top commanders from the \n  battlefield and end atrocities perpetuated by his Lord's Resistance \n                                 Army)\n\n       At the end of subtitle D of title XII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1246. EFFORTS TO REMOVE JOSEPH KONY FROM POWER AND END \n                   ATROCITIES COMMITTED BY THE LORD'S RESISTANCE \n                   ARMY.\n\n       Consistent with the Lord's Resistance Army Disarmament and \n     Northern Uganda Recovery Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-172), it \n     is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the ongoing United States advise and assist operation \n     to support the regional governments in Africa in their \n     ongoing efforts to apprehend or remove Joseph Kony and his \n     top commanders from the battlefield and end atrocities \n     perpetuated by his Lord's Resistance Army should continue;\n       (2) using amounts authorized to be appropriated by section \n     301 and specified in the funding table in section 4301 for \n     Operation and Maintenance, Defense-wide for ``Additional ISR \n     Support to Operation Observant Compass'', the Secretary of \n     Defense should provide increased intelligence, surveillance, \n     and reconnaissance assets to support the ongoing efforts of \n     United States Special Operations Forces to advise and assist \n     regional partners as they conduct operations against the \n     Lord's Resistance Army in Central Africa;\n       (3) United States and regional African forces should \n     increase their operational coordination; and\n       (4) the regional governments should recommit themselves to \n     the operations sanctioned by the African Union Peace and \n     Security Council resolution.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, this amendment has been cleared on both \nsides. This is the one that originally we had several years ago \nconcerning the Lord's Resistance Army in Africa and the showing that we \nhave a policy in this country to bring this man down, the man called \nJoseph Kony. And we want to renew this so that we will have this \npending again. It doesn't change anything that is going on at the \npresent time except it keeps our policy in effect; that we are after \nthe Lord's Resistance Army, and we will do what we have been doing in \nthe past until it is completed.\n  So I ask my colleagues to adopt this amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there further debate?\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Let me, first of all, commend Senators Inhofe and Coons. \nThis is a very important amendment, and the determination to go after \nKony and the Lord's Resistance Army is essential not just in terms of \nthe values that we so dearly believe in, but also in terms of avoiding \nfurther slaughter that has been perpetrated by Kony.\n  So I commend Senators Inhofe and Coons, and I hope this amendment \nwill not only pass but will send a very important statement as to where \nAmerica stands on this subject.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there further debate on the \namendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3201) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I think we may have someone--we want to \nyield 5 minutes to the Senator from Utah.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The pending business is still the Ayotte amendment. I am \njust wondering if the Senator from Utah might indicate what it is that \nhe will speak on.\n  Mr. LEE. I wish to speak for 5 minutes regarding the Feinstein-Lee \namendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if we could get to the Feinstein amendment. I am \nsure Senator Feinstein will be happy to yield time to the Senator from \nUtah.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3018\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask unanimous consent to call up amendment No. \n3018.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein], for herself, \n     Mr. Lee, Mr. Coons, Ms. Collins, Mr. Paul, Mr. Lautenberg, \n     Mrs. Gillibrand, and Mr. Kirk, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3018.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To clarify that an authorization to use military force, a \n declaration of war, or any similar authority shall not authorize the \n  detention without charge or trial of a citizen or lawful permanent \n                     resident of the United States)\n\n       At the end of subtitle D of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1032. PROHIBITION ON THE INDEFINITE DETENTION OF \n                   CITIZENS AND LAWFUL PERMANENT RESIDENTS.\n\n       Section 4001 of title 18, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating subsection (b) as subsection (c); and\n       (2) by inserting after subsection (a) the following:\n       ``(b)(1) An authorization to use military force, a \n     declaration of war, or any similar authority shall not \n     authorize the detention without charge or trial of a citizen \n     or lawful permanent resident of the United States apprehended \n     in the United States, unless an Act of Congress expressly \n     authorizes such detention.\n       ``(2) Paragraph (1) applies to an authorization to use \n     military force, a declaration of war, or any similar \n     authority enacted before, on, or after the date of the \n     enactment of the National Defense Authorization Act For \n     Fiscal Year 2013.\n       ``(3) Paragraph (1) shall not be construed to authorize the \n     detention of a citizen of the United States, a lawful \n     permanent resident of the United States, or any other person \n     who is apprehended in the United States.''.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I note that Senator Lee is on the floor, and I know \nhe wants to speak as he is a cosponsor of this amendment. So I will \nyield to him, and then when he finishes I will speak.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak \nregarding amendment No. 3018, the Feinstein-Lee amendment.\n  It has come to my attention that some opponents of the Feinstein-Lee \namendment have made an argument that habeas corpus is sufficient to \nprotect the rights of Americans apprehended on American soil and \ndetained by the United States Government. This is nothing more than \nanother way of suggesting that the government should be able to detain \nsome Americans indefinitely without charge or trial. I disagree and \nbelieve that our constitutional traditions demand more than this--\nsignificantly more.\n  The fifth amendment of our Constitution provides that ``No person . . \n. shall be . . . deprived of life, liberty, or property without due \nprocess of law.''\n  As Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia has written:\n\n       The gist of the Due Process Clause, as understood at the \n     founding and since, was to force the government to follow . . \n     . common-law procedures traditionally deemed necessary before \n     depriving a person of life, liberty, or property.\n\n  This right of American persons to due process of law is foundational \nto the very idea of individual liberty from unwarranted government \nintrusion.\n  I have worked with Senator Feinstein and other colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle to craft an amendment originally entitled the Due \nProcess Guarantee Act to ensure that this basic constitutional right is \nindeed protected. I believe even with the serious national security \nthreats we now face, America must hold fast to our most fundamental \nconstitutional rights and liberties.\n  The U.S. Government should not be authorized to detain Americans \nindefinitely without charge and without trial. As Justice Scalia \nexplained, the proposition that the Executive lacks indefinite wartime \ndetention authority over citizens is consistent with the Founders' \ngeneral mistrust of military power permanently at the Executive's \ndisposal.\n  I believe it is clear that the Founders of our Constitution were \nacutely aware of this critical tradeoff--the tradeoff\n\n[[Page S7182]]\n\nwe still face today--between safety on the one hand and freedom on the \nother. On this very point, Alexander Hamilton was prescient. He wrote:\n\n       Safety from external danger is the most powerful director \n     of national conduct. Even the ardent love of liberty will, \n     after a time, give way to its dictates. The violent \n     destruction of life and property incident to war; the \n     continual effort and alarm attendant on a state of continual \n     danger, will compel nations the most attached to liberty, to \n     resort for repose and security to institutions which have a \n     tendency to destroy their civil and their political rights. \n     To be more safe they, at length, become willing to run the \n     risk of being less free.\n\n  Our Nation's Founders warned us about the great danger of sacrificing \nour most basic liberties in the pursuit of security--security at all \ncosts. They provided us with a Constitution framed to prevent precisely \nsuch a tragic outcome.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the Feinstein-Lee amendment \nand against the mistaken idea that the government may detain American \npersons indefinitely without charge and without trial.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield back the remainder of my time to \nSenator Feinstein.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, the amendment before us is cosponsored \nby the distinguished Senator who just spoke, Senator Lee, as well as \nSenators Coons, Collins, Paul, Lautenberg, Gillibrand, Kirk, Tester, \nJohnson, Sanders, Whitehouse, Heller, Baucus, DeMint, Webb, Klobuchar, \nBingaman, Rockefeller, Begich, and Boxer. An amendment similar to this \nreceived 45 votes in the last session.\n  I wish to spend a moment on the genesis of this amendment because, \nfor me, it goes back to April 1942, the day a Western Defense Command \nand Fourth Army Wartime Civil Control order went out in San Francisco \nwith instructions to all persons of Japanese ancestry, that: All \nJapanese persons, both alien and nonalien, will be evacuated from the \nabove designated areas by 12 o'clock noon on Tuesday, April 7, 1942. No \nJapanese person will be permitted to enter or leave the above described \narea after 8 a.m. Thursday.\n  That was in the city of San Francisco.\n  What was created was an internment camp near the city which became a \nstaging area for the placement of Japanese Americans in detention camps \nwithout charge or trial for the remainder of World War II.\n  This was Tanforan Racetrack, directly south of San Francisco. One \nSunday afternoon--I was a small child in 1942--my father took me down \nto show it to me. This is what I saw. We see stalls made into bunk \nhouses. We see the center of the field made into barracks. We see the \nlittle places where individuals were kept. We see Japanese-American \ncitizens who did nothing wrong who were being interned for years during \nWorld War II.\n\n  It was shocking. Then it took until 1971 for a bill to be passed and \nthen signed by President Nixon reversing the policy. That bill was \ncalled the Non-Detention Act of 1971, and it repealed a 1950 statute \nthat explicitly allowed detention of U.S. citizens. That 1971 bill \nsaid--and I quote:\n\n       No citizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained by the \n     United States except pursuant to an act of Congress.\n\n  Since then and after 9/11, various cases were litigated and went as \nfar up as the Supreme Court. One of them in 2004 was Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, \nand it addressed a very narrow issue involving a citizen captured on \nthe battlefield of Afghanistan. Then a second case, Padilla v. \nRumsfeld, in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals involved an American \ncitizen captured in the U.S.\n  So the question is whether the Non-Detention Act of 1971 prevents \nU.S. citizens captured in the U.S. like Padilla from being detained or \nwhether the AUMF passed after 9/11 authorizes such law of war detention \nin the U.S.\n  What we are trying to do with this simple amendment is what is called \na clear statement rule, to say once and for all:\n\n       An authorization to use military force, a declaration of \n     war, or any similar authority shall not authorize the \n     detention without charge or trial of a citizen or lawful \n     permanent resident of the United States apprehended in the \n     United States unless an Act of Congress expressly authorizes \n     such detention.\n\n  I know this is a sensitive subject, but I believe we stand on the \nvalues of our country, and one of the values of our country is justice \nfor all. And we have a Constitution that has 7 articles and 27 \namendments that give us fundamental protections.\n  This amendment, which builds on the continuing application of the \nprinciples behind the Non-Detention Act of 1971, would provide very \nclearly that no military authorization allows the indefinite detention \nof U.S. citizens or green card holders who are apprehended inside the \nUnited States. Some may ask why just include citizens and green card \nholders. Let me be clear, if I could further and add ``all persons'' \nand get as many votes, I would. I do not think it would, and we have \nlooked into how to do this for a year now. So we have limited it to \nwhat we believed could get the maximum number of votes in this body.\n  Here is the point of this amendment: What if something happens and \nyou are of the wrong race in the wrong place at the wrong time, and you \nare picked up and held without trial or charge in detention ad \ninfinitum? We want to clarify so this cannot happen; so that the law \ndoes not permit an American citizen or a legal permanent resident to be \npicked up and held without end, without charge or trial.\n  I want to say that the FBI and other law enforcement agencies have \nproven time and time again that they are up to the challenge of \ndetecting, stopping, arresting, and convicting terrorists found on U.S. \nsoil.\n  I have a document that was prepared by the Intelligence Committee \nstaff lists 98 terrorists who have been arrested and are on their way \nto conviction and will do time, many of them life sentences, in Federal \nprisons, and these are just those arrested in the last 3 or 4 years.\n  Since January of 2009, there are 98 who have been successfully \narrested. I think it is important to understand that suspected \nterrorists who may be in the United States illegally can be detained \nwithin the criminal justice system under four options that exist today. \nThey can be charged with a Federal or State crime and held. They can be \nheld for violating immigration laws. They can be held as material \nwitnesses as part of a Federal grand jury proceedings. They can be held \nunder section 412 of the PATRIOT Act for up to 12 months.\n  This amendment is not about whether citizens such as Hamdi and \nPadilla--or others who would do us harm--should be captured, \ninterrogated, incarcerated, and severely punished. They should be and \nthey are.\n  It is about the innocent American, again in the wrong place, at the \nwrong time, who gets picked up, like these innocent Japanese Americans \nshown in this picture who just happened to live in a certain part of \nthe United States, in my hometown, San Francisco. But this was what \nhappened. People were picked up and held for the duration of the war--\njust because of their race.\n  Finally, I want to quote Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who wrote for \nthe plurality in the Hamdi decision in 2004:\n\n       As critical as the Government's interest may be in \n     detaining those who actually pose an immediate threat to the \n     national security of the United States during ongoing \n     international conflict, history and common sense teach us \n     that an unchecked system of detention carries the potential \n     to become a means for oppression and abuse of others who do \n     not present that sort of threat.\n\n  So it is my hope we can clarify U.S. law to state unequivocally that \nthe government cannot indefinitely detain American citizens or legal \nresidents captured inside this country without trial or charge.\n  We live with the stain of how we treated some of our own people \nduring World War II. It should not be repeated.\n  I thank the Acting President pro tempore, and I would like to yield \nto the distinguished Senator Paul, if I may.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Feinstein-Lee \namendment to prevent the indefinite detention of American citizens \nwithout a trial by jury. In the year 1215, the English barons gathered \non the plain at Runnymede. They gathered to protest against King John. \nThey gathered for their rights as free men. And they gathered for the \nright to trial by jury.\n\n[[Page S7183]]\n\nWe have had it enshrined in both English law and American law for 800 \nyears. It seems a shame to scrap it now.\n  People say: But these terrorists are horrible people. Yes, they are \nhorrible people. But every day and every night in our country horrible \npeople are accused of crimes, and they are taken to court. They have an \nattorney on their side. They are given a trial. People we despise, \npeople who murder and rape, are given trials by juries. We can try and \nwe can prosecute terrorists.\n  People say: But they are terrorists. Well, the thing is, you are an \nAmerican citizen and you are accused of terrorism. Who is going to \ndetermine who is a terrorist and who is not a terrorist? They do not \nwalk around with a badge. They do not walk around with a card that \nsays: I am from al-Qaida. They will be accused of a crime, and there \nwill be facts. Someone must judge the facts. That is what a jury does.\n  To give up on this because we are afraid of terrorists is to give in \nto the terrorists. If we give up our rights, if we relinquish our \nrights, haven't the terrorists then won?\n  Jefferson said the right to trial by jury was the ``anchor,'' it was \nthe anchor by which we protect ``the principles of the Constitution.''\n  Senator La Follette, a Senator from Wisconsin, said if we give up \nthese rights, if we are unable to protect these rights, that ultimately \nthe Bill of Rights loses its value.\n  He said:\n\n       Let no man think that we can deny civil liberty to others \n     and retain it for ourselves. When zealot agents of the \n     governments arrest suspected radicals without warrant, hold \n     them without prompt trial, deny them access to counsel and \n     admission of bail . . . we have shorn the Bill of Rights of \n     its sanctity. . . .\n\n  I would ask today of my colleagues that we have a chance to replace \nfear with confidence--confidence that no terrorist will ever conquer us \nif we remain steadfast to our principles--the principles of our \nFounders. We have nothing to fear except our own unwillingness to \nprotect our rights. If we relinquish our right to trial by jury, we \nwill have given up so much. Do not let those who would instill fear let \nyou give up the most basic of rights--a right that prevents the \noppression of government and the evolution or devolution into \ndespotism.\n  So I hope my colleagues will today vote to uphold an 800-year-old \ntradition, a tradition that is enshrined in the body of our \nConstitution, a tradition that is enshrined in our Bill of Rights, and \na tradition that is in every constitution of all 50 States. Are we to \ngive that up because we are fearful? We can and have convicted \nterrorists. We are not talking about terrorists from overseas. We are \nnot talking about a battlefield somewhere else. We are talking about \nAmerican citizens accused in our country.\n  Why should you be wary? The government has descriptions of who might \nbe a terrorist. If you have 7 days' of food in your basement, you might \nbe a terrorist. If you have weatherized ammunition, you might be a \nterrorist. This is what your government describes as things you should \nreport. Know your neighbor to report your neighbor. If you have \nweatherized ammunition, multiple guns, food in your basement, if you \nlike to pay by cash--if these are the characteristics for which you \nmight be accused of terrorism, would you not, at the very least, still \nwant to retain your right as an American citizen to a right to a trial \nby a jury of your peers?\n  I ask that we step up today and support an ancient tradition. And I \nworry about a country that would let a tradition like the right to \ntrial by jury go so easily.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity. This is a \ngood debate. It is a fascinating discussion. I guess the way I look at \nthis issue--and we will talk with Senator Levin in a bit--I have been a \nmilitary lawyer for about 30 years, and the first thing you do in JAG \nschool is have a discussion about the difference between the law of war \nand criminal law. Every military lawyer is taught from the very \nbeginning of their career that law of war detention is designed to \nneutralize the enemy and to gather intelligence about the enemy.\n  There is a reason that when we capture somebody in a war we do not \ngive them a trial by jury, and we do not give them a lawyer. We have \n3,000 people in American military custody in Afghanistan who were \ncaptured on the battlefield, and they are held under the law of war \nbecause we do not want to let them go back to killing us. And they are \nnot given a lawyer because we are not trying to solve a crime; we are \ntrying to win a war.\n  Here is the question to my good friend from California: I do not want \nanyone to believe that under the law of war construct we have created \nover the last 7 or 8 years that you can be put in jail because you look \nlike a Muslim, that you sound like a Muslim, that you have got a name \nMohammad. What happened to Japanese-American citizens is they were put \nin military custody because we were all afraid and they looked like the \nenemy. That was not a high point in America.\n  What are we talking about here? We are talking about detaining people \nunder the law of war who are suspected of joining al-Qaida or the \nTaliban and engaging in a belligerent act against the United States. I \nwant to make the record clear that some of my colleagues on the \nRepublican side have been trying to deny law of war detention to the \nObama administration, and they have openly said this: If you allow this \nto happen, President Obama is going to put you in jail because of \npolitical dissent.\n  There are people on my side who are afraid of law of war detention \nbeing in Barack Obama's hands because they think,--they hate him so \nmuch they think he is going to use a provision to protect us against an \nal-Qaida attack to put them in jail because they disagree with his \nagenda.\n  It gets worse. I want you to know this. There has been a statement in \nour conference that habeas corpus review by an independent judiciary \nwhere the intelligence community, the military, would have to prove in \ncourt by a preponderance of the evidence that the person in question \nhas, in fact, engaged in hostilities against the United States by \nhelping the Taliban or al-Qaida--that is the requirement of the \ngovernment--they have to prove that to the judge, that is not really a \ncheck on government power because the judge could be an Obama \nappointee.\n  As much as I disagree with President Obama, as much as I think he has \nbeen a divisive President, in many ways has failed to lead, I want to \ndisassociate myself from the concept that you cannot give this \nCommander in Chief the powers that Commanders in Chief have enjoyed in \nother wars because we hate him so much.\n  To my friends who get on the Internet and talk radio and stoke this \nparanoia, we are afraid enough for good reason. This is a dangerous \nworld. We are about to walk off the fiscal cliff. We have people out \nthere trying to undermine our way of life. There is a lot to be afraid \nof: Al-Qaida coming back to our shores, recruiting American citizens to \nhelp their endeavors. I hate to say it, in every war we have ever been \nin, there have been occasions when Americans joined the enemy.\n  In World War II that happened. You had German saboteurs land on Long \nIsland, aided and abetted by American citizens sympathetic to the \nNazis. All of those American citizens in In Re: Quirin were held in \nmilitary custody and tried by the military because we have long \nunderstood that when you join the enemy, that is not a crime but an act \nof war.\n  We have very bad people who get a right to a jury trial. I will be \nthe first one to say that when you go to court, no matter if you are \nthe worst terrorist in the world, you will get a jury trial, you will \nget a lawyer, and you will have your due process rights. But the \ndifference I am trying to inform the body of when you are fighting a \nwar is the goal is not to prosecute people, the goal is to win. And how \ndo you win a war? You kill them; you capture them; you interrogate them \nto find out what they are up to next. So I am here to say to my \ncolleagues that the al-Qaida-Taliban efforts to do harm to our Nation \nare alive and growing. The narrative that al-Qaida has been decimated \nis a false narrative. What happened in Libya, unfortunately, is going \nto happen again.\n\n[[Page S7184]]\n\n  I know my good friend from California, who is the chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee, knows there are active efforts in our own \nbackyard--and Joe Lieberman can tell you, too--to recruit American \ncitizens to attack us--not to commit a crime, to join the enemy.\n  All I am suggesting is that Barack Obama and every Commander in Chief \nin the future needs to have the tools available to protect us against \nan enemy. And the basic question is: Is fighting al-Qaida fighting a \ncrime or fighting a war? I believe with all of my heart and soul that \nthey do not want our property, they do not want our cars, they do not \nwant our bank accounts, they want to destroy us. They hate what we \nstand for. Just as in World War II, when you decided to help the Nazis, \nyou were held in military custody because you did something other than \ncommit a crime.\n  The goal here is if you capture an American citizen who has sided \nwith the enemy that we preserve the ability of our military \nintelligence community to find out what they know about future attacks \nand present attacks. The goal of a criminal prosecution is to find \njustice under a criminal statute. The goal in time of war is to win.\n  I do not believe in torturing people to get good information, but I \ndo believe in interrogating them for military purposes if they have \nsided with the enemy.\n  This is a great debate. But the one thing I do not want to associate \nmyself with is as much as I may disagree with this President's agenda, \nthere are people on my side of the aisle who are stirring up their \nfellow Americans, making them afraid that Barack Obama could use \nlegitimate powers in a time of war to gather intelligence against \npeople who sided with the enemy to come after them because they look \ndifferent or they may have a different political belief. I want to \ndisassociate myself with those on my side of the aisle who say that \nhabeas corpus, an independent judiciary, is not an adequate check \nbecause Barack Obama may have appointed the judge. That undermines our \njudiciary. That creates paranoia. That creates a fundamental distrust \nof what I think is something we should be all proud of: America.\n  This war will last probably longer than most of us. It is an \nideological struggle. There is no capital to conquer, like Berlin and \nJapan. There is no air force to shoot down. There is no navy to sink. \nIt is about an ideology that must be contained and fought, an ideology, \nunfortunately, that will be attractive to some Americans as it was in \nother wars.\n  Unfortunately, as I speak today, the enemy is trying to come back to \nour shores and use some American citizens to further their cause. To an \nAmerican citizen: Do not join al-Qaida or the Taliban. Do not turn on \nyour country. Do not side with their view of humanity. If you do, you \nhave not committed a crime, you have engaged in an act of war against \nthe rest of us and we have a right to win this war. We have a right to \nhold you under the law of armed conflict as we have held others in the \npast, to find out why you joined, what you know, and what they are up \nto next. There is no American citizen in law of war custody. This \nPresident has not rounded up one person and put them in jail using the \nstatute that exists today because they disagreed with him. I do not \nbelieve he will. All I am asking is that we have options available in \nthis war that have existed in every war America has fought. Because \nhere is my bottom-line belief, that as much as the Nazis represented a \nthreat to humanity, al-Qaida represents an equal threat to humanity. \nAnd nobody in World War II would have entertained the idea that if you \nsided with the Nazis and you helped the saboteurs blow up parts of \nAmerica, you should be considered anything other than an enemy who has \njoined the other side.\n\n  So unlike criminal law, where you are trying to find justice for \nvictims, this is about winning a war and marginalizing the enemy. And \nwhen the enemy is able to turn one of our own, the last thing in the \nworld we should do is deny ourselves the ability to interrogate that \nperson in a way to help us win the war and keep us safe. That has been \nthe law forever when it comes to war. That is the law today, that will \nbe the law tomorrow.\n  I look forward to talking to Senator Levin, who has been a 100-\npercent voice of reason, to talk about authorization to use force and \nthe ability to detain.\n  I will end with this thought: If you deny the ability to gather \nintelligence and detain, you do not want to put our troops in a \nposition where they have to kill everybody they find. We want to \ncapture the enemy when we can. Because when you capture the enemy, not \nonly do you hurt the enemy, you find out a lot about what they are up \nto. Here is the question: If an American citizen is engaging in helping \nal-Qaida and the Taliban in a terrorist activity on our shores, are \nthey the enemy? Yes, they are. We need to know about why they did what \nthey did and what they are going to do next.\n  With that, I will yield.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 9 minutes 15 seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. How much time is there left on our side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 17 minutes 24 seconds.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I will wait until the very end and give the \ndistinguished chairman the opportunity.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it would be my intent, if we need \nadditional time, unless there is something else that is needed at about \n9:30 or so when this time runs out, to seek additional time for both--\nfor anyone who needs it, frankly. I do not know about both sides, \nbecause this is a multifaceted debate that we are going to have here \ntonight on this issue.\n  I would yield myself 10 minutes. I would ask to be notified when I \nget to 10 minutes.\n  The Feinstein amendment provides that no authorization for the use of \nmilitary force may be construed to authorize the detention of U.S. \ncitizens or lawful resident aliens who are captured inside the United \nStates, unless--and this is a big ``unless''--an act of Congress \nexpressly authorizes such detention.\n  As I read the amendment, it says the military detention of U.S. \ncitizens may be authorized in accordance with the law of war as long as \nthis action is expressly authorized by Congress. Further, the \namendment's requirement for express authorization applies only to the \ndetention of U.S. citizens who are captured inside the United States. \nSo no such authorization would be required for the detention of a U.S. \ncitizen in the course of military operations overseas. I believe it is \nappropriate that Congress focus on the issue of military detention at \nthe time they authorize the use of military force, as would be required \nby the Feinstein amendment.\n  As the Supreme Court has stated: Detention is a fundamental and \naccepted incident to armed conflict. Without such authority, our Armed \nForces could be put in the untenable position of being able to shoot to \nkill but not to capture and detain enemy forces.\n  As to the ongoing conflict, I believe the 2001 authorization for the \nuse of military force authorized the detention of U.S. citizens when \nappropriate in accordance with the laws of war.\n  I base this view on the fact that the Supreme Court has said so.\n  In the Hamdi case, the Supreme Court considered the relationship \nbetween the AUMF and the nondetention act which prohibits the detention \nof a U.S. citizen except where authorized by an act of Congress. The \nSupreme Court held in Hamdi that this statute does not preclude the \ndetention of U.S. citizens on the battlefield in Afghanistan because \nthe 2000 authorization for the use of military force, quoting the \nSupreme Court, ``is explicit congressional authorization for the \ndetention of individuals'' in such circumstances. The Court explained \nthat such detention is so fundamental and accepted as an incident to \nwar as to be an exercise of the ``necessary and appropriate force'' \nthat Congress authorized the President to use in the AUMF. In other \nwords, the Supreme Court has already concluded that the authorization \nto use necessary and appropriate force is an explicit authorization to \ndetain enemy combatants in accordance with the law of war, and that \nmeets the test of the Feinstein amendment.\n  Any other conclusion would lead to absurd results, under which we \nwould tie the hands of our Armed Forces even\n\n[[Page S7185]]\n\nin the face of an actual invasion. For example, if a group of \nterrorists were to approach one of our Navy bases in boats loaded with \nbombs, our sailors protecting those ships at that base would be in the \nuntenable position of being able to shoot to kill, but not to capture \nthe enemy forces if Hamdi did not reach the conclusion it did.\n  Similarly, in the unthinkable event that we were to experience a 9/\n11-type attack, our military would be in the untenable position of \nhaving the authority to shoot down the hijacked aircraft but not to \nforce them to land and to capture the enemy hijacker. Of course, we \ncould not expect our military to inquire as to whether any of the enemy \nforce were American citizens before deciding on the level of force to \nbe applied.\n  As the Supreme Court explained in its Hamdi decision, ``the capture, \ndetention, and trial of unlawful combatants, by 'universal agreement \nand practice,' are 'important incidents of war''' and a ``fundamental \nand accepted incident to war.''\n  What the Supreme Court said in Hamdi is explicit in the AUMF, in the \nauthorization for use of military force, the core ``law of war'' \nauthority for our military to capture and detain those who join enemy \nforces at a time of war and plan or participate in attacks against us. \nThis core authority to use less than lethal force, rather than lethal \nforce, in appropriate circumstances must be available to our military \nwhenever and wherever it engages with the enemy.\n  Again, Senator Feinstein's amendment does not prohibit the military \ndetention of U.S. citizens who are captured or apprehended inside the \nUnited States because a U.S. citizen who joins a foreign army and \nattacks the United States should be subject to detention as an enemy \ncombatant if it does not prohibit military detention and if it is \nexpressly authorized by law. I read this as a statute authorizing the \nuse of military force itself or some other act of Congress.\n  This is a major difference between or from the amendment Senator \nFeinstein offered last year, which included no exception for \ncongressional authorization. This new approach is appropriate because I \nbelieve that Congress ought to address the issue of detention of U.S. \ncitizens when captured in the United States at the time that we \nauthorize the use of force.\n  The Supreme Court in Hamdi held that the existing authorization for \nuse of military force does address this issue and does explicitly, in \ntheir words, authorize detention of U.S. citizens in that situation \nwhich was on the battlefield in Afghanistan, but that it explicitly, \nagain in the words of the Hamdi Court, authorized the detention of U.S. \ncitizens in the case of an individual who was captured in Afghanistan \nwho was attacking U.S. forces.\n  I believe the same reasoning applies to persons who join foreign \narmies and attack us militarily here in the United States when they \nbring the war here to the United States and attack us here. If they \nattack a Navy base and are captured by sailors defending their ships, \nthe same logic that Hamdi applied to an attack in Afghanistan against \nour forces applies here. That is the same reason they used in that case \nto find that there was an explicit authorization for the detention of \nU.S. citizens in the Afghanistan circumstance; that it is an inherent \nfundamental function of war, that you be able to capture and detain \npeople who are at war with you, applies when that act of war is carried \nout here in the United States, such as in the attack on a Navy base.\n  I request 1 additional minute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Feinstein amendment provides an appropriate signal to \nCongress that in an authorizing context they should be aware of \ndetention authority issues. Therefore, I intend to vote for the \nFeinstein amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, may I ask how much time remains on our \nside and on the other side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 17 minutes remaining.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. There is 17 minutes remaining in opposition?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Yes.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I rise to agree with my colleague Senator \nLevin, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, in his \ninterpretation of the Hamdi decision with regard to the review of the \ncurrent amendment pending before us. The Feinstein amendment includes \ndifferent language than the amendment that was brought forward and \ndefeated in this body last year. The language says in 2(b)(1) that an \nauthorization to use military force, a declaration of war, or any \nsimilar authority, shall not authorize the detention without charge or \ntrial of a citizen or lawful permanent resident of the United States, \napprehended in the United States, unless an act of Congress expressly \nauthorizes such detention.\n  I do view, as does my colleague from Michigan, Senator Levin, the \nHamdi decision that was decided before our U.S. Supreme Court as \nrendering an opinion that the current authorization for the use of \nmilitary force that is in effect for our country gives explicit \ncongressional authority for the detention of individuals such as in the \ncase of Hamdi. He was an American citizen engaged in the battle against \nour country and would fall underneath the authorization for military \nforce. In the Hamdi decision, the Court said that the AUMF, which has \ncurrently been approved by Congress, having the full force and effect \nof law, gives explicit congressional authorization for such detention.\n\n  I too believe, as Senator Levin has said, under that authorization, \nthe Hamdi decision would be interpreted similarly if an individual who \nwas a covered individual--a member who was covered by the authorization \nfor military force but was nevertheless a United States citizen--was \ncaught here committing an act of terrorism in this country. Our Supreme \nCourt has already interpreted that in Hamdi in such a way. I wanted to \nadd my support for his interpretation of the current Feinstein language \nin that way.\n  I wish also to say in response to the arguments of some of my \ncolleagues that if the argument that is being made is this, that if you \nare an American citizen who is captured in this country committing an \nact of terrorism against our country and collaborating with al-Qaida, \ncommitting belligerent acts in this country, then you should be held \nunder the law of war. If you are not, then we will have to give you \nMiranda rights. We will have to tell you you have the right to remain \nsilent.\n  Let me remind you, in those situations, can you imagine if an \nAmerican citizen had been one of the collaborators of 9/11, would we \nwant to tell a member of someone who had committed an act like 9/11 \nagainst us--an act of war against this country--the first thing you \nhear is you have the right to be silent? Our goal is we have to be \nthere to gather intelligence to see if there is another attack coming. \nIs it coming to the Pentagon, is it coming to the White House, is it \ncoming to that second tower? Then we can protect American lives.\n  That is the difference between war and common crime. That is an \nimportant distinction that has been recognized long before--with all \nrespect to my colleague from Kentucky--in World War II in In Re: \nQuirin. Our U.S. Supreme Court in World War II recognized this \nauthority, the difference between the law of war. In that case an \nAmerican citizen who collaborated with the Nazis was held under the law \nof war because our country was at war.\n  I would also wish to point out that this would only cover under the \ncurrent law authorized by this Congress. It would not apply to someone \nwho is holding ammunition or someone who is paying with cash. It only \napplies to a person who has planned, authorized, committed, or aided \nthe terrorist attack that occurred on 9/11 or harbored those \nresponsible for the attacks, or a person who has a part or \nsubstantially supported al-Qaida, the Taliban, or associated forces \nthat are engaged in hostilities against the United States or its \ncoalition partner, including any person who has committed a belligerent \nact or directly supported such hostilities in aid of enemy forces \nagainst our country.\n  That is very different than some of the examples that were cited \nhere. It is\n\n[[Page S7186]]\n\ncalled being a member of al-Qaida, being involved in September 11, \nbeing a member of the Taliban and committing belligerent acts against \nthis country. That is terrorism.\n  Let me point out what I think is the most absurd distinction of all. \nThis is Anwar al-Awlaki. He is someone who is a U.S. citizen. He is \nsomeone who was an influential leader in al-Qaida in the Arabian \nPeninsula. He advocated for violent jihad. He was involved in a dozen \nterror investigations. He was alleged to be involved in killing \nAmericans and collaborating to kill our allies. On September 30, 2011, \nit was reported that al-Awlaki was killed by the CIA in a drone strike \nin Yemen. Yet it is being interpreted, as we have heard by some of my \ncolleagues represented here, if the Feinstein amendment were \ninterpreted the way they have interpreted, if al-Awlaki made it to \nAmerica to commit these terrorist acts, he gets his Miranda rights. He \ngets all his rights here. But yet if he is in Yemen to do these acts, \nto try to kill Americans and our allies, then we can use a drone attack \nto him. But if he makes it to America--which, by the way, the \nterrorists want to make it to America; 9/11 is Exhibit A of that--why \ndo we want to be in a position to read them their Miranda rights, tell \nthem you have the right to remain silent? Our priority there has to be \nprotecting American lives. That is the distinction between the law of \nwar and a common criminal in this country.\n  By the way, there are protections under the law. It is the right of \nhabeas corpus where you do have a right to challenge your detention \nbefore the Federal court through appeals with counsel. That is \ncertainly a protection that we have respected in this country for a \nlong time.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to inform the body that I \nthink Senator Levin's understanding and reasoning is incredibly sound. \nWe have actually been talking about this for a couple of days. And in \nlight of the Hamdi decision and just plain old common sense, I will \nsupport the Feinstein amendment.\n  I will be the first to say that if we are attacked by the Iranians \ntomorrow or some other group, we have an authorization to use force. \nSenator Levin and I will be the first to say in that authorization that \nit will provide that if an American citizen joins the Iranians in a war \nagainst America, they can be detained under the law of war.\n  Now, you can vote however you like. I know how I will vote. But this \nhas already gone up to the Supreme Court. And if I can build on what \nSenator Levin said as to the logic of the Court and I think the logic \nof our position, let's get us back to the United States. I don't think \nanybody in their right mind would say the United States is not part of \nthe battlefield in the war on terror. I would suggest that of all the \nplaces the enemy wants to hit us, they want to hit us here at home the \nmost. Their goal is to kill us here. They will kill us in Libya, they \nwill kill us in Afghanistan, they will attack our consulates, they will \nkill our soldiers, they will blow up our embassies, they will hit us \nall over the world, but don't be misled--they want to hit us here. \nRemember 9/11? I do. I am sure you all do.\n  You know what. The only reason we haven't had another 9/11 is we have \nbeen fighting these bastards over there, where we have been getting \ngood intelligence. It took a couple of years before any of the people \nheld at Guantanamo Bay told us what was going on, but we found out \nabout bin Laden--and not because we tortured people but because we put \nthe intelligence puzzle together over time by holding people under the \nlaw of war and gathering good intelligence. That is how we got bin \nLaden. So bin Laden is dead, but the war is not over. I wish it were.\n  Now, the homeland. If there is a planned attack on a Navy vessel or a \nmilitary installation, I think the point Senator Levin was making is \nthat we have already authorized the use of force to protect the country \nagainst the Taliban and al-Qaida; is that right?\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is my opinion, and that is the fundamental core \nruling in the Hamdi case. Now, we have to be accurate. Hamdi applied \ncircumstances to citizens that were captured in Afghanistan, but the \nreason they use led them to conclude there was an explicit--explicit--\nauthorization to detain those citizens even though they are American \ncitizens. Their argument was that capture and detention was inherent, \nin their words--so fundamental--to capture and detain as such is an \naccepted incident to war as to be an exercise of the necessary and \nappropriate force which Congress authorized the President to use.\n  So in my analogy, if a boatload full of al-Qaida, including an \nAmerican citizen, comes to a Navy base and attacks that base and is \ncaptured by those sailors, that is surely an incident of war, and I \nbelieve the capture and detention of those al-Qaida terrorists would be \nthe exercise of necessary and appropriate force which we authorized the \nPresident to use in the authorization for military force.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I want to build on that just to make sure we understand \nabout a potential attack on a Navy base here at home. No one is \nsuggesting the military could not use force against an al-Qaida attack \nhere at home. The Hamdi case was an American citizen captured in \nAfghanistan. I hope we are not trying to create a picture that somehow \nAmerica is a place where our own military cannot fire a shot in defense \nof their ships or our country.\n  Let's say we have some ships up there in Virginia and we have a \nboatload of al-Qaida types trying to ram the ship. Does the Senator \nagree with me that our military can use force to defend us here at home \nagainst al-Qaida?\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. So if our military is authorized to use force, they do \nnot have to call the FBI or the Virginia State Police to shoot. They \ncan shoot against an enemy themselves coming at them in America.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Coming into America and attacking us on a Navy base or----\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Right. Because we are not fighting a crime. We don't have \nto disarm our military and call the local cops and say: Would you \nplease shoot these people before they get here? No. Our guys are going \nto shoot you. If you are an American citizen asked to get in a boat and \nasked to attack a military ship or installation in the United States, \nwe are going to shoot you, and if we wound you, we are going to capture \nyou. And here is what we are going to do to you as an incident of using \nforce. The Supreme Court has said that when you authorize the use of \nforce, it makes no sense to give that authorization if you don't have \nthe power to detain because the worst thing you can do to the American \nmilitary is to make them kill everybody and capture no one or let the \nother guys go. So kill-them-all is not good policy, and it is a bad \nspot to put your military in. And the option shouldn't be to kill them \nall or let them all go; the option should be to kill where you have to \nand, if you can, capture. Does the Senator agree with that?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I do.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. And our military can fire the shots because of the use of \nforce to defend the homeland and to defend themselves here at home. And \nthe Supreme Court says that once you authorize the ability to use \nforce, it just follows, as night follows day, that detention is part of \nthe ability to use force because, ladies and gentlemen, if it is not, \nyou have turned our military into murderers because you are not \nsupposed to shoot somebody and leave them wounded in the water, and you \nshouldn't watch them swim away. You capture them and interrogate them \nunder the law of war. Isn't that what Hamdi is about and the point they \nare trying to make?\n  Mr. LEVIN. It is. As part of that point, it cites the Quirin case, \nwhich says:\n\n       Citizenship in the United States of an enemy belligerent \n     does not relieve him from the consequences of a belligerency \n     which is unlawful because in violation of the law of war.\n\n  And here are the key words:\n\n       Citizens who associate themselves with the military arm of \n     an enemy government, and with its aid, guidance and direction \n     enter this country bent on hostile acts, are enemy \n     belligerents within the meaning of the Hague Convention.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I will read another quote from Hamdi.\n\n       There is no bar to this Nation's holding one of its own \n     citizens as an enemy combatant.\n\n\n[[Page S7187]]\n\n\n  Hamdi's detention could last for the rest of his life because the law \nof war detention can last for the duration of the relevant conflict.\n  Here is what we are trying to do. We are trying to create a system \nconsistent with the Hamdi decision, and quite frankly, ladies and \ngentlemen, what I am trying to avoid is the criminal paradigm because I \nknow the difference between criminal law and law of war. Under the law \nof war, you can detain somebody for interrogation to find out what the \nenemy is up to if you believe that person to be part of the enemy.\n  And let me tell my friends, I do not want to take our criminal \njustice system and bastardize it. During the Bush years when we had the \nmilitary commission rollout, they had a provision that in a military \ncommission trial, the military jury could be given classified \ninformation but not share it with the defendant. I said: No. If a trial \nmeans anything, it means the right to confront those witnesses against \nyou. I jealously guard that. The worst al-Qaida member in the world, \nwhen they go on trial in military commissions, will have a lawyer, a \nright to appeal to our Supreme Court, and will be able to confront \nevery witness against them. An American citizen who joins al-Qaida or \nthe Taliban will be tried in Federal court because we took military \ncommissions off the table. That is the trial.\n  Here is the main point: If you are allowing our military to use force \nto protect themselves, as Hamdi says, it naturally follows that with \nthe use of force comes the lawful detention. And that is why I will be \nvoting for Feinstein. I think that is where most Americans are. If \nthere is any confusion, we can talk about this in conference.\n  But, Senator Levin, I want to thank you for--since 2006--working with \nme and against me. You know, our dispute about what would be an active \nsubstitute for habeas went to the Supreme Court, and you won 5 to 4. \nDamn those Justices, but that is the way it goes. And you know what. \nThere were some Republicans and Democrats who disagreed with me and you \nboth. But I respect an independent judiciary, and I know Justice \nRoberts kind of got some people mad at him because of the ObamaCare \ndecision, but that is the way it goes. That is the way these old judges \nare. I just really appreciate an independent judiciary.\n  I just want to say that after that decision in 2006 or 2007, how much \nof a pleasure it has been to work with you and others to try to find a \nway to achieve a balance in a war that is hard to understand. There is \nno capital to conquer, no airplanes to shoot down in terms of their jet \nfighters, there is no navy to sink, but they use boats to attack us and \nthey use private planes to kill us. At the end of the day, we are at \nwar. The outcome does matter, and I want to win this war. I know \neverybody in this body wants to win this war. But I want to live within \nour values.\n  So I will work with Senator Levin and Senator McCain and say that \neven though we are fighting the worst people on the planet, count me \nout when it comes to waterboarding. I remember when people on my side \nwould say--and I understand them very well--why do you care about what \nwe do to these people? They will cut our heads off.\n  Because we are Americans. It is not necessary to go down that road to \nwin the war. And quite frankly, ladies and gentlemen, the opposite is \ntrue. You can't win this war if you don't realize you are in a war. We \nare not fighting common crime, we are fighting a vicious enemy. And we \ncan do it within our values. We can do it within due process consistent \nwith the law of war and, when we get in that criminal arena, consistent \nwith criminal law.\n  As much as I disagree with this President, I will not deny him the \nability that every Commander in Chief has had for decades as an option, \nif he chooses to use it. And if you want to go down the criminal road, \nwe can, but we need the option. As much as I dislike President Obama, I \nam not going to use as a reason to change the law of war that Barack \nObama may put some people in jail who disagree with him, and I am not \ngoing to buy into some of the rhetoric coming out of our side that a \nhabeas corpus independent judiciary view means nothing if Obama \nappointed the judge. We are better than that.\n  I stand ready to vote for Feinstein, I stand ready to work with my \ncolleagues to continue to find a way to fight and win a war within our \nvalues, the outcome of which will matter not only to us but those who \nfollow.\n  God bless every person on the front line who is risking their life at \nhome and abroad. And here is what you have as a promise between Senator \nLevin and myself and many others: We are going to give you the tools to \nkeep us safe and to keep your comrades safe. We are not going to do \nthings in this war that made no sense in other wars. You need our help, \nyou need our prayers, and you need the tools to fight and win this war, \nand we will give you those tools.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, even though my colleagues sometimes appear \nto have disdain for the trial by jury, it now appears they are \nsupporting the right to trial by jury, and so I congratulate them on \ntheir conversion. However, I think they are still a little confused on \nHamdi.\n  Hamdi had to do with a citizen fighting overseas and nothing to do \nwith a citizen here. I have great confidence that the Supreme Court, \ngiven a ruling on the right to trial by jury, will affirm the right to \ntrial by jury whether they were appointed by Ronald Reagan or President \nObama. So we will have that fight on another day.\n  I will say, though, that our oath of office says we will defend the \nConstitution against enemies foreign and domestic.\n  I met with cadets this week and they asked me, What is the freedom we \nfight for? The freedom we fight for is the Bill of Rights, is the \nConstitution. If we have careless disregard for the Constitution, what \nare we fighting for?\n  I will tell you, since I know the record of this debate will be \nwidely read, I want to make formal objection to the crazy bastard \nstandard. I don't think if we are going to have a crazy bastard \nstandard that we shouldn't have a right to trial by jury. Because if we \nare going to lock up all the crazy bastards, for goodness sake, would \nyou not want, if you are a crazy bastard, to have a right to trial by \njury?\n  I think this is a very serious debate and should not be made \nfrivolous. This is an ancient right that we have defended for 800 \nyears. To say that habeas is due process is absurd. It is the beginning \nof due process. If you don't have a right to trial by jury, you do not \nhave due process. You do not have a constitution. What are you fighting \nagainst and for if you throw the Constitution out, if you throw the \nsixth amendment out? It is in the body of our Constitution. It is in \nthe Bill of Rights. It is in every Constitution in the United States. \nTrial by jury has been a longstanding and ancient and noble right. \nLet's not scrap it now.\n  I will accept victory today. I hope we will win victory and reaffirm \nthe right to trial by jury. But let's don't play any games with any \naspect and believe that any Supreme Court in the United States, whether \nappointed by Republican or Democrat, is going to say that an American \ncitizen does not have a right to trial by jury.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If Mr. President could tell me what the respective \ntimes for either side in this amendment are?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The opposition time has expired. \nProponents have 6 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator would yield.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I will.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We are significantly over our time, I believe. We would be \nhappy to accommodate Senator Feinstein or others.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I just wanted to thank everybody. I think we had a \ngood debate. I think we ended in a good place. I am very hopeful that \nthe body will pass this now by a large majority. So I hope we are \nsuccessful tonight in achieving something that hasn't been achieved for \ndecades.\n  I want to thank everybody, our cosponsors, the chairman of the \ncommittee, and Senator Graham for the debate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, that was a good debate. Senator \nFeinstein\n\n[[Page S7188]]\n\nis always gracious and alert and smart in her arguments.\n  I want to say one thing that is not in doubt. Some of my colleagues--\nI think Senator Paul and others--have suggested that somehow the law of \nthe United States has been changed in recent years, and we need the \nFeinstein amendment to fix it and restore the constitutional rights we \nare all entitled to.\n  What I want to say, without any doubt and I think any fear of real \ncontradiction, is this amendment alters the history of the United \nStates, alters the long-term understanding of the rules of war, and \nplaces American citizens in a position where they cannot be treated \neffectively as an enemy of the state and detained, and actually be in a \nposition to be released to continue their war against the United \nStates. I think that is a bad policy.\n  I agree with Senators Levin, Ayotte, and others who share their view. \nI am not quite able to understand--and I am not sure Senator Feinstein \ndoes--that this therefore establishes through understandings of Hamdi \nand the Supreme Court decision that therefore we can vote for it. I \ndon't think it is the right step. I don't think we should alter the \nhistorical position of the United States that those who are at war with \nthe United States are not treated as criminals. Southerners who were \ncaptured by Lincoln weren't released. When Washington dealt with the \nWhiskey Rebellion, he sent out Alexander Hamilton. They weren't given \nMiranda rights. They went out there to stop the rebellion. They were \ncitizens. That is the way I feel about it.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3009\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending business and call up amendment No. 3009.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, I am wondering if the \nSenator from Alabama would repeat the request.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I wish to set aside the pending amendment and call up \namendment No. 3009. I understand it would not be voted on tonight, but \nI wish to get it pending.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if the Senator would speak on the amendment, \nthough, without calling up the amendment.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would be glad to, if the chairman thinks it won't be \na problem calling it up at a later date.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I hope not. I don't even know what is in the amendment. \nBut we are trying to accommodate the process where everybody could have \na chance, hopefully, to call up their amendments. We have to do it in \norder where we know what is in the amendment, we have to have our \nstaffs have an opportunity to make sure we understand what is in the \namendment. We are working on this amendment. So I have no objection \nwhatever to the Senator talking about the amendment. We are working \nhard on the amendment to get it in order.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. It has been conveyed to the Senator's staff.\n  Mr. LEVIN. And we are working on it. But if the Senator could just \nnot proceed to call it up but speak to it, we would appreciate it.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I withdraw the offer of calling up that \namendment and my request to set aside the pending amendment, but I \nwould share some thoughts about it.\n\n  The amendment deals with the ability of the Congress of the United \nStates to review any bilateral security agreement with Afghanistan.\n  Congress was not consulted regarding the framework or the substance \nof the Enduring Strategic Partnership Agreement between the United \nStates of America and the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan that was \nsigned on May 1, 2012. This agreement commits the United States to \nestablishing a long-term bilateral security agreement with Afghanistan. \nIn the past, Congress has been consulted and has sometimes provided its \nadvice and consent to the ratification of these type agreements.\n  The strategic partnership agreement, already signed by President \nObama, is a legally binding agreement that committed the United States \nto various policies including those related to the drawdown of U.S. \nforces in Afghanistan. It is broad and vague, and any further \nagreements entered into by the President that are based upon it should \nbe reviewed by the appropriate congressional committees.\n  The President and the Secretary of Defense have stated that the \nUnited States continues to fight in Afghanistan to defeat al-Qaida. \nWhile the authorization of military force authorizes the President to \nuse any means necessary to prevent any acts of terrorism against the \nUnited States, his authority to enter into bilateral security \nagreements with Afghanistan should be looked at and reviewed at least \nby Congress.\n  The bilateral security agreement will supersede not only the \nstrategic partnership agreement--so this will be the bilateral security \nagreement--but additional memoranda of understanding related to special \noperations in Afghanistan and detainee transfers will be part of this \nagreement. The issues addressed in the forthcoming bilateral security \nagreement are too important not to require congressional review.\n  The amendment would require the President to submit any proposed \nbilateral security agreement to the appropriate congressional \ncommittees 30 days before entering into the agreement. This is not \nunreasonable. Congress is exercising its role of oversight before the \nPresident makes long-term commitments that have significant \nramifications from the size of forces that we commit to the legal \nauthority of our commanders. So this will be a final agreement that \nwill impact quite significantly the commitment--financially, \nmilitarily, and in blood--the human support of our members.\n  There is a history behind these SOFA agreements. The Senate approved \nthe NATO Status of Forces Agreement. We actually voted on it and \napproved it in advance. A formal treaty was used as an underlying \nsource of authority for a Status of Forces Agreement on seven different \noccasions: Australia, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Japan, Korea, and the \nPhilippines. Congress has voted and approved Status of Forces \nAgreements three additional times: Marshall Islands, Micronesia, and \nPalau.\n  I hope Senator Webb is able to come over tonight. He has raised his \nconcerns about this, and expressed concern in the Armed Services \nCommittee that the Afghani and the Iraqi Parliaments vote on the Status \nof Forces Agreement, but our Congress is not voting on the Status of \nForces Agreement. Senator Webb is a cosponsor of this amendment. And \njust to have that agreement, the full and complete agreement that \ncommits the United States to be fully reported to the Congress of the \nUnited States I don't think is too much to ask. Right now, we don't \nhave any indication that would happen, and there is some opposition to \nit. But why would that be a problem? Why would the administration not \nwant Congress to know what our commitments are and what we would be \nexpected to support?\n  I believe it is a good amendment. Hopefully we can get it moved \nforward and maybe accepted; but, if not, by vote. I think we could \nhandle it. I don't think it should cause the objection that some see in \nit. This does not require that the Congress have a right to vote to \nreject the amendment or approve the amendment. It simply says the \nagreement that is entered into, the SOFA, has to be produced promptly \nto the Congress. I think that is a reasonable position, and I ask my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I think it is time to explain amendment \nNo. 3025 that I hope I will be able to call up shortly, knowing full \nwell that our schedule might get difficult when these amendments are \nbrought up at a later point.\n  My amendment would strike section 341 of the fiscal year 2013 \nNational Defense Authorization Act. It included language that would \narbitrarily require the Secretary of Defense to cut the civilian and \ncontractor workforce to achieve equal savings as they achieve from \nplanned reductions in the military personnel for fiscal year 2012 \nthrough 2017.\n  This provision does not consider the work requirements of the \nDepartment nor the law that states:\n\n       The civilian personnel of the Department of Defense shall \n     be managed each fiscal year solely on the basis of and \n     consistent with (1)\n\n[[Page S7189]]\n\n     the workload required to carry out the functions and \n     activities of the department.\n\n  What that means is that when we consider the number of civilian \npersonnel needed by the Department of Defense, we look at the mission \nthey need to accomplish and we look at the budget support. That is how \nthose decisions have been made.\n  My amendment would strike the current section 341 that is in the \ncommittee draft and reaffirms the civilian manpower requirements by \nstating the following: The Secretary of Defense, consistent with \nlongstanding law--which was expanded in a bipartisan effort in the \nfiscal year 2012 NDAA bill--ensures that the civilian workforce is \nsufficiently sized--a term copied from 10 USC 129a)--after taking into \naccount military strategy requirements and military endstrength.\n  The Comptroller General is required to report back to the Congress \nwhether the Department is compliant with the law.\n  I am pleased this amendment is cosponsored by Senators Akaka, Boxer, \nBegich, Brown of Ohio, Durbin, Harkin, Leahy, Mikulski, McCaskill, and \nTester.\n  I might point out that there is no such provision included in the \nHouse NDAA.\n  I would like to note what this amendment does not do. It would not \nprevent the Department of Defense from downsizing the civilian \nworkforce. Indeed, according to the House Armed Services Committee, the \nDepartment is already reducing its civilian workforce by over 10,000 \npositions in fiscal year 2012 alone. It would not treat service \ncontractors any differently than civilian employees.\n  The goal of this amendment is pretty simple. It would reaffirm the \nlaw that prohibits DOD from managing its civilian workforce by \narbitrary constraints. That is what this provision that I am asking to \nbe stricken by my amendment would do. It would set caps and cuts. \nDownsizing is inevitable but be consistent with the law. It should be \nbased on a workload analysis and the budgets that are provided through \nthe congressional process.\n  This would repudiate the notion that what happens in one department's \nworkforce automatically affects the other. The way the language came \nout from the committee, regardless of the needs of our civilian \nmissions within the Department of Defense, its cut would be tied to the \nmilitary side and the contractors would also be affected. It should be \nbased upon their vision. It should be based upon their budget. There \nshould not be arbitrary provisions.\n  Proponents of section 341 would insist that the civilian workforce \nshould be automatically reduced by approximately 5 percent because the \nObama administration would reduce the military workforce by \napproximately 5 percent. They are different missions, different \npriorities; they need to be judged based upon their respective \npriorities and missions.\n  Earlier today the administration released a Statement of \nAdministration Policy that clearly rejects the current section 341 of \nthe bill. I am quoting from the administration's statement of policy:\n\n       The Administration objects to section 341, which would \n     reduce funding for the civilian and contractor workforce by a \n     rate that is at least equal to the percentage of funding \n     saved from the planned reductions of military personnel end \n     strength. This would require savings in civilian and contract \n     workforces in excess of $5 billion over the planned savings \n     through FY 2017. The Administration believes the size of the \n     civilian workforce should be determined based on workload and \n     funding, not on arbitrary comparisons to the military. To \n     comply with this legislation, the Department would need to \n     significantly divest workload and impose workforce caps.\n\n  What the committee did--I don't know if it was intentional or not--\nwhat the committee did, they imposed their own sequestration order on \nthe civilian and contractor workforce within DOD. That makes no sense \nwhatsoever. Everyone here has been outspoken that it is wrong to do \nthese across-the-board cuts that have nothing to do with priority or \nmission. My amendment would strike that provision from the committee \nbill. It would substitute instead law that requires that the workforce \nbe determined by mission and budget. It does not at all prevent us from \ndownsizing. We all know we have to downsize, and the budget downsizes \nthe civilian and contractor workforce. But we should not be setting \narbitrary caps within what we have already done through the review and \nbudget process.\n  I am pleased that this amendment is supported by many of the groups \ndirectly impacted by the decisions here. When I have a chance to offer \nthis amendment, I will urge my colleagues to support the amendment so \nwe can correct this provision in the bill, which I think allows us to \ncomply with current law, protect the mission of the Department of \nDefense, and establish priorities in the way we should, not by \narbitrary caps.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3199\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have been attempting to contact the \nprimary author of amendment No. 3199, Senator Durbin. Let me first of \nall ask unanimous consent that I be added, if I am not already, as \noriginal cosponsor to the amendment No. 3199.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I think it is interesting that this \namendment is coming up at this time. It is a matter of just a couple of \nhours ago that we passed an amendment on this floor extending our \neffort and policy against the LRA, the Lord's Resistance Army, and that \nis Joseph Kony, the individual who for now over 20 years has been \nabducting young people, training them, taking them up and forcing them \nto go out and fight with the LRA. If they did not do it, they would \nhave to go home and murder their own family. It has been just horrible. \nWe are making great progress now. I spent a lot of time primarily in \nUganda where this all began, and it looks now as though we are getting \ncloser to doing that.\n  The reason I am interested in amendment No. 3199 by Senator Durbin \nand am supporting it is because a very similar thing is going on right \nnow. I happen to have spent some time in the eastern part of the Congo, \nwhere I have seen the rise of another individual, Colonel Makenga. He \nis very much like Joseph Kony. In fact, he is training the young \npeople, young kids to be fighters. We all know about the effort out \nthere with what they call the rebel leader of M23. That is very similar \nto what is happening up in Uganda. In fact, the Uganda effort and the \nLRA effort were very prominent, actually, in eastern Congo, the same \nplace where this--and I suspected myself that there is a relationship \nbetween the two efforts. So I strongly support that.\n  I want to say one thing, though. I have strong feelings about this, \nand I want to get it on the record, and I would like to have my \ncomments placed in the Record at the time this amendment comes up for \nconsideration.\n  A lot of people were feeling that one of the problems with the M23 \nleaders came from Rwanda itself. At some time, they talked about \nPresident Kagame, President Paul Kagame, as if there were a \nrelationship between this butcher over there, Colonel Makenga, and \nPresident Kagame. There is no relationship whatsoever. In fact, \nPresident Kagame rejects what this rebel leader is trying to do.\n  I had occasion to spend some time with Louise Mushikiwabo, who is the \nForeign Affairs Minister for the Republic of Rwanda. I was with her. I \nhave her picture right here. I was with her recently, and she gave us \nthe assurance that the President, President Paul Kagame, is just as \nadamant about doing away with this rebel leader, Colonel Makenga, of \nthe M23 rebel movement. I am happy to join in with this. I wanted to \nmake sure I have my assurance in this that there is no relationship \nbetween this rebel movement and the President of Rwanda.\n  I yield the floor. I see the author of this amendment is on the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank my colleague from Oklahoma. Many of my other \ncolleagues may not be aware of his interest and dedication to the \ncontinent of Africa. He has traveled there probably as much if not more \nthan any other Member of the Senate. It has been a great opportunity, \nexperience, and education for me to travel there over the years, but my \nfew visits do not come close to the commitment that has been made by \nthe Senator from Oklahoma. I\n\n[[Page S7190]]\n\ngreatly respect his knowledge of the area and appreciate his \ncosponsorship of the amendment which is pending which we hope will be \ncleared.\n  I have been to eastern Congo twice, 2005 and 2010--Goma. Goma is one \nof those places you will never forget once you visit them. This is one \nof the poorest places on Earth. You see the poverty in every direction. \nYou see the disease. You see the victims of war in every direction \nbecause there has been an ongoing war in this part of the world which \nliterally rivals some of the great wars of our history in terms of the \ninnocent people who have been killed, maimed, raped, and have suffered \ndisplacement. On top of all of these things in Goma is an active \nvolcano that erupted not that many years ago, covering this poor, \ngodforsaken part of the world with lava. It troubles me to go there and \nsee the suffering that goes on every day.\n  The ongoing war that is taking place--the rebel groups, M23--have now \ntaken over sections of eastern Congo. Eastern Congo is known as the \nrape capital of the world. One of the tactics of war is to rape the \nwomen of any age in front of their families and then force these women, \nmany times, to kill other members of the family who have witnessed it. \nThey estimate that regional war and rape leave an estimated 1,000 or \nmore women assaulted every day in the Congo. Twelve percent of all \nCongolese women have been victimized by this. I met some in a hospital \ncalled Heal Africa.\n  There is a population of 8 million people, and Heal Africa is the \nonly hospital in the area that offers any antiretroviral drugs for \nchildren with HIV and surgery to repair the bodies of these traumatized \nwomen. Heal Africa's cofounder, Lyn Lusi, passed away this past March. \nWhat a saint she was. While her death was a terrible loss, Heal Africa \nand other organizations continue to carry on her vision, including many \nAmerican medical students who go there to volunteer. God bless them. \nThere was a delegation from Purdue University there when I visited, and \nmany others have followed.\n  The Rwandan genocide has been the root cause of many of the problems, \nas well as a weak government in Congo. Eastern Congo is virtually on \nits own, with very little governance or protection, and criminals run \nrampant.\n  Dr. Denis Mukwege runs another hospital in Bukavu, the capital of \nSouth Kivu province.\n  Panzi Hospital is a one-story building on a tree-lined, dirt road. It \nreceives about 10 new rape cases a day, every day. And that is only the \ntip of the iceberg, since most rape survivors never seek treatment.\n  The victims range in age from 2 to 80 years old. Dr. Mukwege says \nthey arrive ``broken, waiting for death, hiding their faces.''\n  Last month armed gunmen attacked this genuine hero at his home, \nmurdering his guard and shooting at him, likely because of a strong \nspeech he gave at the United Nations last month, denouncing mass rape \nand impunity in Congo.\n  The United Nations has a 20,000 member peacekeeping force in eastern \nCongo to help the region's violence--but the area is still very \nfragile, awash in weapons, warlords, and competing regional interests. \nIt is also rich in valuable minerals that are found in our everyday \nelectronic and other products.\n  It has been said that the Congo war contains ``wars within wars''--\nand that is true. But fueling much of the violence is a bloody contest \nfor control of these vast mineral resources.\n  In the last Congress I was proud to join in a bipartisan effort with \nSenators Brownback, Feingold, Dodd, Johnson, and others to try to \nprevent the country's mineral wealth from fueling the region's horrific \nviolence.\n  The bill we eventually passed included a simple transparency \nrequirement--if a company registered in the United States uses any of a \nsmall list of key minerals from Congo or its neighbors, then it has to \ndisclose in its SEC filings what, if anything, it is doing to prevent \nthe mineral purchases from funding the region's violence.\n  I was happy to see that in August, the Securities and Exchange \nCommission approved a rule based on this legislation. It is a sound and \nfair rule, so you can imagine my disappointment that the National \nAssociation of Manufactures has already started a legal challenge to \nthis modest provision. I appeal to the conscience of the CEOs of these \ncompanies in America to do their part to help end this violence that is \ngoing on in Congo. Please stop fighting this simple provision so we can \ntrace these minerals and stop the exploitation of these poor people.\n\n  Last week a well-armed group of rebels calling themselves M23 overran \nand occupied the key city of Goma in eastern Congo. These rebels have \nthreatened to continue their incursions and set a course for Kinshasa, \nCongo's capital in the west. They have created a new wave of fleeing \nrefugees in need of clean water, food, and shelter. This move was \ncondemned by the U.N. Security Council, which expressed deep concerns \nabout M23. These rebels are known for brutal violence. This is a \nphotograph of a little baby being passed into a truck hopefully, to \nsafety--a victim of the violence going on by the M23 rebels who have \ntaken over this part of the Congo. Some of my colleagues may have seen \nthis tragic photo in Monday's New York Times. This baby is being \nhoisted into a packed truck while his family is trying to get out. Even \nmore troubling is that there is considerable evidence that these rebels \nhave and are continuing to receive strategic and materiel support from \nneighboring Rwanda, just as Senator Inhofe mentioned on the Senate \nfloor, and potentially from Uganda as well. News reports indicate that \nthe M23 rebels have access to night vision goggles and other equipment \nthey never had before, indicative of significant assistance from the \nwell-supplied Rwandan Army. We have seen reports that the Rwandan Army \ncrossed the border working side-by-side with these rebels.\n  A Congolese regional governor, Julien Paluku, stated that the Rwandan \nArmy entered his province behind the M23 rebels and forced the \nCongolese military to flee. Human Rights Watch has corroborated these \nreports and has independently confirmed the Rwandan Government's role.\n  There was some hope that the leaders of Congo, Rwanda, and Uganda \nwould meet last week and find a way to end this violence. Yet it didn't \noccur. It appears Rwandan President Kagame did not attend as he had \nonce promised.\n  Rwanda is a friend of the United States. I have visited President \nKagame and I have been to Rwanda. It has certainly been through its \nshare of suffering during the genocide in 1994. It helped in \npeacekeeping efforts in Sudan. With that kind of leadership, though, \ncomes an important responsibility. No one in Rwanda or any country will \nbenefit from a collapsed Congo in which the rebels hold large swaths of \nterritory and these impoverished people at gunpoint. I urge Rwanda to \nrein in the M23 rebels and work with its regional neighbors to bring \nstability to eastern Congo.\n  To make sure this happens, Senators Boozman, Boxer, Coons--let me get \nthe entire list because I am proud they have joined me in this effort--\nBrown of Ohio, Cardin, and now Senator Inhofe have joined me in filing \nan amendment to this Defense authorization bill that would impose an \nasset freeze and visa ban on any outside parties who are providing \nsupport to the M23 rebels, an amendment I urge my friends, Senators \nLevin and McCain, to accept.\n  I hope such sanctions will not be needed and that wiser heads \nprevail. The people of eastern Congo have suffered long enough.\n  I know Senator Levin is working for the approval of this amendment. I \nsincerely hope it can be done before the end of the evening. I am going \nto at this point yield the floor in the hopes that we can bring this to \na positive conclusion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me compliment Senator Durbin for his \nconcern for this activity that is going on there. I wish to clarify the \nrecord because I have had personal conversations with the President and \nwith many members of the staff and good friends over there.\n  Africa is a little bit different than other areas. Sometimes there \ncan be rebel groups within a country that are doing something people \nattribute to a country. In this case, that isn't true with Rwanda. In \nthe case of Rwanda, if they say that some of the Rwandan\n\n[[Page S7191]]\n\nmilitary was supporting the M23 movement, that would not be with the \nauthority or the knowledge even of President Kagame himself and his \nadministration. I want to make sure to clarify that.\n  Also, I want to mention, the area of Goma that the Senator from \nIllinois is talking about is something that a lot of people are not--\nthey don't understand what that is. Goma is in the far eastern part of \nCongo. The capital is Kinshasa. It is further from Kinshasa to Goma \nthan it is, of course, all the way across this country twice. So we are \ntalking about an area where there is not much control.\n  It happens that Robert Ruberwa, Parliamentarian Ruberwa, is the one \nwho is responsible for that area. The way it is working there, they \ndon't have any control over there. This is a rebel movement.\n  The reason I say I believe, and I have always believed, that there is \na relationship between the LRA and the M23 is because I was over there \nwhen the LRA had just left. We were hoping to be there at the same \ntime. It was a matter of a couple of days before. They went north up \nthrough the Central African Republic and up through south Sudan, over \nto Uganda, where they originally started. That is the same area and the \nsame motive, the same way of operating as M23.\n  They are abducting little kids. People don't realize this. They \nabduct little kids and teach them how to use weapons and make them go \nback to their villages, murder their parents and their siblings, and if \nthey don't do that, they cut their noses off and their ears off. We \nhave pictures. We have seen this happen.\n  I am pleased that we have adopted as a policy of this country to \nintervene.\n  Let's keep in mind, we have a war against terrorists. These are \nterrorists and this has spread throughout--starting actually more in \nthe Horn of Africa, Djibouti, and then moving down into the continent. \nThis is the type of terrorism that comes from it. I consider this as a \npart of that war.\n  But I do want to emphasize that the accusation that Rwanda and their \nleadership, specifically President Kagame--let's remember what happened \nwith Paul Kagame. He was the one back during the genocide of 1994 who \nwas able to come in and pull everybody together. A lot of the rebels \nwent to the west out in Rwanda and went into the eastern part of Congo. \nWe know that is right. But they have been rejected. There is no \naccusation that there is even a relationship there. But I hope people \nrealize we do have some great Presidents throughout the continent of \nAfrica, and he is one of them. It is a difficult situation there. It is \none on which we need to focus our attention.\n  By the way, I would say I don't believe it has been cleared on our \nside. It would be with me, but it hasn't happened yet, and we hope to \nwork in that direction so we can take this up.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that the filing deadline for \nfirst-degree amendments to S. 3254, the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill, be set at 9:45 tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. BOXER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, tonight the Senate will vote on an \namendment offered by the senior Senator from California that affects \nthe lawful authority of the U.S. military to detain enemy belligerents \nduring wartime. This issue is necessarily complicated and difficult \nbecause the universe of detainees at issue includes U.S. citizens who \nare captured on American soil while taking up arms against their fellow \ncitizens in the name of a foreign power or global terrorist \norganization.\n  This is not an abstract issue. The U.S. homeland remains a target for \nal Qaida terrorists, who hide among civilian populations and have \nsuccessfully recruited our fellow citizens to carry out acts of \nterrorism.\n  Some of my colleagues contend that U.S. citizens forfeit their \ncitizenship when they commit terrorist acts or acts of war against \ntheir fellow citizens but that they nevertheless should be tried and \ntreated as common criminals with all of the attendant constitutional \nrights. Others believe that U.S. citizen-enemy combatants forfeit their \nconstitutional rights altogether and can be detained indefinitely by \nthe military without any judicial review.\n  I respectfully reject both of these positions. It is entirely \nconsistent with both the Constitution and laws of war for the U.S. \nmilitary to detain such individuals pursuant to a force authorization \nor war resolution until the cessation of hostilities. To be sure, there \nis historical precedent for this proposition. What is critical to \nremember and too often seems to be omitted from this debate is that a \nU.S. citizen or any other person lawfully inside our nation's borders--\nwho is detained by our military does not forfeit their rights to habeas \ncorpus review in a Federal court. In other words, they retain the \nconstitutional right to challenge their detention before an impartial \ncivilian judge.\n  The Supreme Court has noted that the ``writ of habeas corpus is the \nfundamental instrument for safeguarding individual freedom against \narbitrary and lawless state action.'' And, in fact, a citizen's right \nto habeas corpus extends all of the way to review by the U.S. Supreme \nCourt, the highest Court in the land.\n  In closing, what I find so confounding about this debate is the fact \nthat groups like the American Civil Liberties Union, ACLU, Human Rights \nWatch, and Amnesty International have urged the Senate to reject the \nFeinstein amendment. These groups have said that a vote against the \nFeinstein amendment would send a clear message about our commitment to \nconstitutional rights. I respect the views and passion of these groups \nbut would urge a vote against the amendment for a different reason: \nnamely, I believe that we can keep faith with the Constitution and \nmaintain the global fight against al-Qaida.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I will support the Feinstein-Paul \namendment. This amendment would make it clear that Congress has not \nauthorized the indefinite detention of American citizens or lawful \npermanent residents apprehended in the United States without charge or \ntrial. This is a common-sense amendment that should be completely \nnoncontroversial. It has long been understood that is unconstitutional \nto indefinitely detain someone apprehended in the United States without \ncharge or trial. Indeed, the fifth amendment of the Constitution \nprovides simply that ``no person shall be . . . deprived of life, \nliberty, or property without due process of law.''\n  Indefinite detention in the United States is not just \nunconstitutional, it is unnecessary. Look at the track record. Since 9/\n11, our counterterrorism professionals have prevented another terrorist \nattack in the United States. And more than 400 terrorists have \nsuccessfully been prosecuted and convicted in federal court. Here are \njust a few of the terrorists who have been convicted in federal court \nand are serving long prison sentences: Umar Faruk Abulmutallab, the \nUnderwear Bomber; Ramzi Yousef, the mastermind of the 1993 WTC bombing; \nOmar Abdel Rahman, the so-called ``Blind Sheikh''; 20th 9/11 hijacker \nZacarias Moussaoui; and Richard Reid, the ``Shoebomber''.\n  Some of my colleagues have claimed that the Supreme Court's Hamdi \ndecision upheld the indefinite detention of U.S. citizens captured in \nthe United States, but it did no such thing. Hamdi was captured in \nAfghanistan, not the United States. And Justice O'Connor, the author of \nthe opinion, was very careful to say that the Hamdi decision was \nlimited to, ``individuals who fought against the United States in \nAfghanistan as part of the Taliban.''\n  Some of my colleagues also cited the case of Jose Padilla, claiming \nthat it is a precedent for the indefinite detention of U.S. citizens \ncaptured in the United States. But look at what happened in the Padilla \ncase. Padilla is a U.S. citizen who was placed in military custody in \nthe United States. The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals, one of the most \nconservative courts in the country, upheld Padilla's military \ndetention. But then, before the Supreme Court had the chance to review \nthe 4th Circuit's decision, the Bush administration transferred Padilla \nout of military custody and prosecuted him in criminal court. To this \nday, the Supreme Court has never ruled on the question of whether it is \nconstitutional to indefinitely detain a U.S. citizen captured in the \nUnited States.\n  A number of prominent civil liberties and human rights organizations \nhave expressed their concern that because the Feinstein-Paul amendment \nonly prohibits indefinite detention of U.S. citizens and lawful \npermanent residents, it implicitly authorizes indefinite detention of \nothers apprehended in the United States. I am very sympathetic to this \nconcern. As Senator Feinstein and Senator Paul have both said on the \nfloor of the Senate, they oppose the indefinite detention of anyone \napprehended in the United States, including non-U.S. citizens and non-\nlawful permanent residents. I agree.\n  Senator Feinstein and Senator Paul included language in this \namendment to make it clear that we are not implicitly authorizing the \nindefinite detention of individuals who are not U.S. citizens or legal \npermanent residents. On page 2, line 14, the amendment says\n\n[[Page S7193]]\n\nthat the prohibition on indefinite detention of U.S. citizens and legal \npermanent residents ``shall not be construed to authorize the detention \nof . . . any other person who is apprehended in the United States.'' So \nin adopting this amendment, the Senate is not implicitly authorizing \nthe indefinite detention of anyone.\n  To the contrary, the language I have just quoted makes it clear that \nthis amendment does not change existing detention authority of non-U.S. \ncitizens and non-lawful permanent residents in any way. What does that \nmean? It means that the Supreme Court will decide whether non-U.S. \ncitizens and non-lawful permanent residents can be detained \nindefinitely without trial, not the United States Senate.\n  I want to thank Senator Feinstein and Senator Paul for their \nleadership on this issue and am proud to support their amendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, in 1971, Congress passed and President \nNixon signed into law the Non-Detention Act of 1971, which repealed a \n1950 statute that explicitly allowed detention of U.S. citizens.\n  The Non-Detention Act of 1971 clearly states:\n\n       No citizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained by the \n     United States except pursuant to an act of Congress.\n\n  Despite this history, during last year's debate on the Defense \nauthorization bill some in this body advocated for the indefinite \ndetention of American citizens. This is an issue that has been the \nsubject of much legal controversy since 9/11.\n  Proponents of indefinitely detaining U.S. citizens argue that the \nAuthorization for Use of Military Force, AUMF, that was enacted in the \nwake of 9/11 is ``an act of Congress,'' in the language of the Non-\nDetention Act, that authorizes the indefinite detention of American \ncitizens regardless of where they are captured.\n  We heard this argument again tonight from Senators Levin and Graham. \nThey assert that their position is justified by the U.S. Supreme \nCourt's plurality decision in the 2004 case of Hamdi v. Rumsfeld. \nHowever, that position is undercut by the 2003 case of Padilla v. \nRumsfeld in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  But let me discuss the facts of Hamdi because it is important to note \nthat Yaser Esam Hamdi was a U.S. citizen who took up arms on behalf of \nthe Taliban and was captured on the battlefield in Afghanistan. The \nSupreme Court effectively did uphold his military detention, so some of \nmy colleagues seize upon this to say that the military can detain even \nU.S. citizens who are arrested domestically.\n  However, the Supreme Court's opinion in that case was a muddled \ndecision by a four-vote plurality that recognized the power of the \ngovernment to detain U.S. citizens captured in such circumstances as \n``enemy combatants'' for some period, but otherwise repudiated the \ngovernment's broad assertions of executive authority to detain citizens \nwithout charge or trial.\n  To the extent the Hamdi case permits the government to detain a U.S. \ncitizen ``until the end of hostilities,'' it does so only under a very \nlimited set of circumstances; namely, citizens taking an active part in \nhostilities who are captured in Afghanistan and who are afforded \ncertain due process protections, at a minimum.\n  Additionally, decisions by the lower courts have contributed to the \ncurrent state of legal ambiguity, principally those decisions involving \nJose Padilla, a U.S. citizen who was arrested in Chicago. He was \ninitially detained pursuant to a material witness warrant based on the \n9/11 terrorist attacks.\n  In Padilla v. Rumsfeld the Second Circuit Court of Appeals held that \nthe AUMF did not authorize his detention, saying:\n\n       We conclude that clear congressional authorization is \n     required for detentions of American citizens on American soil \n     because . . . the Non-Detention Act . . . prohibits such \n     detentions absent specific congressional authorization.\n\n  The Second Circuit went on to say that the 2001 Authorization for Use \nof Military Force ``is not such an authorization, and no exception to \n[the Non-Detention Act] otherwise exists.''\n  I think this history is particularly important in light of tonight's \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have one more vote to start in just a few \nminutes. Senator Levin wants to say something about the schedule for \ntomorrow.\n  Senator Levin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We are going to be making a unanimous consent request, and \nwould like to do it right now, that tomorrow morning there be debate \nand votes on the following five amendments: Senator Sessions on \nbilateral discussions with Afghanistan, Sessions amendment No. 3009; \nCardin amendment No. 3025 on civilian personnel; Menendez amendment No. \n3232 on Iran sanctions; Bill Nelson amendment No. 3073 involving widows \nand orphans; and Coburn amendment No. 3254 involving second amendment \nrights for veterans.\n  My request is that we have--I will make a unanimous consent request \nnow that tomorrow morning, at whatever time is allotted for morning \nbusiness by the leaders----\n  Mr. REID. There will be no morning business.\n  Mr. LEVIN. There will be no morning business--that we then proceed. \nNow we don't have time agreements yet on these five. That is going to \ntake a few minutes. My unanimous consent request is that immediately \nafter prayer tomorrow we move to these five amendments. We will \nallocate as little time as we can tonight after this unanimous consent \nagreement is agreed to, if it is.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Reserving the right to object, would this allow a vote, \nan up-or-down vote on the Coburn amendment? Would this allow an up-or-\ndown vote on the Coburn amendment?\n  Mr. LEVIN. This will.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n\n\n                       Vote On Amendment No. 3018\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 3018, offered by the Senator from California, \nMrs. Feinstein.\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the last unanimous consent which was \nobjected to listed the five amendments. I am now going to list the \nfirst four of those five amendments so everybody knows what I am doing.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be in order for the following first-\ndegree amendments to be offered tomorrow, with no more amendments \ntonight: Sessions 3009, Cardin 3025, Menendez 3232, and Nelson of \nFlorida 3073.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I find it \nhighly ironic that we just passed an amendment to protect the \nconstitutional rights of Americans, and we have an objection to \nprotecting the second amendment rights of the veterans of this country. \nHow in the world can we say to people who fight and defend for us \nthrough a social worker deemed incompetent to carry a gun, that ought \nto be on the basis of a danger to themselves or to someone else, and it \nought to be adjudicated, and we have Senators objecting to protecting \nthe rights of the people who defend us?\n  On that basis, the contrary nature of that basis of what we just did, \nI will object to any further unanimous consents on this bill until we \nhave a vote to protect the rights of the people who defend this \ncountry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I want to set the record straight. This \nis a provision in the law that I worked on in fact with the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma, and it says something very simple: If you are \nadjudicated mentally infirm, you are on the same list that prevents you \nfrom buying a gun as if you are a felon.\n  In my judgment--I love our veterans, I vote for them all the time. \nThey defend us. But if you are mentally ill, whether you are a veteran \nor not--just as if you are a felon. If you are a veteran or not and you \nhave been judged to be mentally infirm, you should not have a gun.\n  And no amendment, my friend, is absolute. The first amendment is not \nabsolute. You are against antipornography laws. The third, fourth, \nfifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth amendments. And as much as I \nbelieve in the second amendment and the right to bear arms and was a \nsupporter of the Heller decision, neither is the second amendment.\n  I continue my objections to the provision.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, after 12 hours today, 8 hours yesterday, \nover 42 amendments, and many more coming in the managers' package, what \nwe have is a situation where the Senator from New York--because of his \npassion, which he just articulated--refuses to allow the Senator from \nOklahoma his rights as a Senator; and that would be, since we have \ntaken up this legislation with amendments and votes with a 51-vote \nmajority as applicable, we have moved through, I am very proud to say, \nI think a very good process that I think all of us can be proud of.\n  But the Senator from New York, because of his passion and commitment \nand belief--all of which I respect--will now prevent the Senator from \nOklahoma from having his amendment considered. Why? Because he is \nafraid he will lose. The Senator from South Carolina and the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire and I have been losing all day long, and I am \npassionate about that.\n  But I ask my colleague from New York, do we really want to have a \nsituation where the depth of our passion now dictates whether the \nSenate should be allowed to go forward? The Senator from Oklahoma has \nthe same right as every other Senator has had to propose an amendment. \nI will be glad to debate it, and up or down. Because if we are now \ngoing to tell our colleagues that if you have an amendment and you feel \nthat you are going to lose and it really goes to the heart of your \nbeliefs, that you are not going to allow the Senate to work, I think \nthat is a very bad and dangerous precedent for us to set.\n  Passions are high tonight, I say to my friend from Michigan. I think \nwe have a pending amendment now and there will be other amendments that \nwe will line up. We could maybe overnight calm down a little bit and \nmove forward with a process that we have enjoyed for the last 2 days. \nNo matter how passionate we feel about a particular issue, we should \nlet the Senate work its will; otherwise, we will never complete a piece \nof legislation around here unless we go back to what we have been doing \nbefore, and that is fill up the tree, file cloture, and then none of us \nare able to engage in what the Senate should--and that is open and \nhonest debate and respecting the will of the majority.\n  So I urge, with all respect and appreciation for the passion of the \nSenator from New York, allow this process to go forward. Let an \namendment be considered, let a second-degree amendment be considered, \nand respect the will of the majority, and move on and live to fight \nanother day; otherwise, we will derail the Defense authorization bill \nthat we have managed to pass for the last 51 years, and the men and \nwomen who are serving in the military and our Nation's security will be \njeopardized.\n  I don't want to get into a fight with the Senator from New York. I \nrespect his passion. But I hope for the good of the institution he \nwould allow this process to go forward just as it has for the last \ncouple of days.\n  I thank my friend from New York for listening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, along the same lines, I would hope that at \nleast with these four amendments--which are now ready to be debated and \nvoted upon--that our friend from Oklahoma would allow that to proceed, \nwith the notice that from thereon he would not allow any unanimous \nconsent agreement. But this has been worked on for so long and these \nfour amendments are lined up so nicely for debate tomorrow that I would \nurge him to relent and allow us to at least proceed to those four \namendments. And he has now put the body on notice that he would not \nagree to any additional beyond that.\n  I happen to agree with my friend from Arizona. We are going to \ndebate, folks. Sooner or later, these amendments are going to be \ndebated, unless a cloture motion--which is going to be filed tomorrow--\nis approved on Monday. And then we are right back in the same problem \nwe have had, which has just been eloquently described by Senator \nMcCain. And if we don't vote cloture, this bill isn't going anywhere. \nIf we do vote cloture, then we will have made it impossible for some \npeople to offer amendments, which they should be allowed to offer.\n  Let us be clear on what is happening tomorrow, to the extent it is \npossible--which is not very extensive. And I want to get the Chair to \nconfirm this. There is a pending amendment. It is a modified Kyl \namendment. This has been modified so that it was been worked out with \nSenator Kerry. That is pending. Is the Senator correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment has not yet been modified, but \nit is pending.\n  Mr. LEVIN. It is pending and will be modified tomorrow.\n  At that point the Chair is going to ask whether there is any \nadditional debate on that amendment. If there is no additional debate, \nthen the Chair is going to put the question. If there is a request for \na rollcall, there will be a rollcall. If there is not, it will be voice \nvoted. At that point, the floor is open. And I intend to then offer the \nSessions amendment, the first one on this list, and then that is going \nto be open to debate. And if our colleagues want to come here tomorrow \nand filibuster or prevent a vote on the Sessions amendment, they are \ngoing to have to come here and debate.\n  But we have tried the best we know how to move this bill forward. We \nhave done everything we know how, and we have made great progress, with \nthe Members of this body being extremely cooperative. We are not giving \nup.\n  So the only technique left to us, given these two objections, is the \none I just identified: to have the pending Kyl\n\n[[Page S7195]]\n\namendment, after it is modified, debated. If no one wants to debate, \nthe Chair is going to put the question, or we will have a rollcall on \nit if people want it. And then the floor is open, and I will be \noffering the next one in line, which is the Sessions amendment. Then if \npeople want to debate that or filibuster that, the rules of the Senate \nallow you to do it. But I don't think that is what is going to happen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, could I also add, I think we need to look \nat this in the larger context. The larger context is that there is a \nlooming crisis in this body. The majority leader is going to possibly \nexercise a nuclear option, which then would change the way we do \nbusiness around here, especially on the motion to proceed. The Senator \nfrom Michigan and I had two goals in mind: one, to achieve conclusion \nof the Defense authorization bill, which is vital to our national \nsecurity on which I think we would all agree. But we also wanted to \nshow our colleagues, and maybe the country, that we could move forward \nin a normal fashion with legislation, amendments, and final votes \nwithout cloture motions, without blocking things, without objecting to \nother people's amendments, and time agreements such as we have just \ncompleted in the last 20 hours, some 42 amendments that have been \ncompleted.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues, let's show ourselves and the majority \nleader and those who want to exercise this nuclear option that we can \ntake up legislation in an orderly fashion and come to a conclusion and \ndo the people's work.\n  There is more here, frankly, than just a refusal to allow an \namendment.\n  We are again going to show that we have to file cloture and then \nthere will be people going on and on. Then I say to my friends on this \nside of the aisle, that is going to mean it is more likely that we have \nthis showdown which we think, many of us think, would be devastating to \nthis institution and the way that it has done business for a couple of \nhundred years.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I want to say to my colleague from \nArizona I very much appreciate his words and I appreciate the respect \nhe has shown for how I feel about this particular issue. But I would \nlike to say another thing here. We are in a little bit of ``Alice in \nWonderland.'' The number of times I have risen to my feet in this body \nto object because I did not want an amendment to come forward can be \ncounted on a single hand over the last year or two. My good colleague \nfrom Oklahoma has made himself a legislative powerhouse by regularly \nusing that practice. In fact, my guess is--more than my guess, the \nreason his amendment was included on the list of five--there are \nhundreds of amendments pending--is because he told people just what he \nwould do: He would object to every other amendment unless his amendment \nwas included.\n  Let me say here that if this process is going to change, it is not \ngoing to start changing in one of the rare moments when the Senator \nfrom New York or some of my colleagues here use a process that has been \nregularly used by the other side to achieve their goals or thwart other \npeople's goals. We are not going to start at this moment changing \nthings when an amendment of great importance to many of us on this side \nis at risk. I find it unfair and in fact I find it a little bit turning \nthe world--not the world, but the facts of how this body works--inside \nout. Because it is well known that my good friend from Oklahoma and \nothers have used the very rule I have used tonight over and over again. \nThat in fact, I would say to both my colleagues from Michigan and from \nArizona, is one of the reasons we are so frustrated with the present \nstate of the rules.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. All we are asking for the veterans of this country is \nthat if their rights are taken away that it be adjudicated by a judge \nor magistrate. That is all we are asking. Rather than a social worker \nat the VA--which is what happens today to veterans. We are not asking \nfor anything big. We are just saying if you are going to take away the \nsecond amendment rights, which means all those who truly should lose \ntheir rights will lose them, but they ought to have it adjudicated \nrather than mandated by somebody who is unqualified to state that they \nshould lose their rights.\n  I will announce today right now that I will not object if Senator \nLevin again offers the request that will put four amendments on the \nfloor. I will not object to that. I want to cooperate in this body. But \nI think you ought to think about what we just voted on--which I voted \nfor--which is to protect the Bill of Rights for people of this country. \nTo protect the Bill of Rights for people of this country. There could \nbe no one for whom we should want to protect the Bill of Rights more \nthan somebody who served our country.\n  We can object. All I am saying is, let them at least have their day \nin court if you are going to take away a fundamental right given under \nthe Constitution. I will say today, if the Senator from Michigan offers \nhis unanimous consent again I will not object and we will move forward \nbecause I want us to move forward. I want us to finish this bill. I \nwant the Defense Department to be able to have something they can count \non for the next year. But ask yourself in your heart, how fair is it? \nWe are worried about terrorists and their Bill of Rights but we are not \nworried about the people who defend our country and their Bill of \nRights? Tell me how we got to that point.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent it be in order for \nthe following first-degree amendments to be offered: Sessions No. 3009, \nCardin No. 3025, Menendez No. 3232, Nelson of Florida no. 3073; that at \n9:30 a.m. on Friday, tomorrow, November 30, following the prayer, that \nthe Senate proceed to votes in relation to the amendments in the order \nlisted; that there be 2 minutes equally divided prior to each vote; \nthat there be no amendments in order to the amendments prior to the \nvotes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, as \nI understand it, there are still no time agreements on this?\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is correct. We will work out time agreements----\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right----\n  Mr. McCAIN. I still have the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The only time agreement we have in yet is the time we come \nin, not a time for a vote.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I wanted to clarify.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Oh, I did not state that correctly. I believed, and I am \nnow wrong, that there would be a time agreement on each amendment that \nwe would attempt to arrive at. That is not what this says. This \nprovides, and I am going to read it again, and I did not listen to my \nown reading--that at 9:30, following the prayer tomorrow, the Senate \nproceed to votes in relation to the amendments in the order listed and \nthat there be 2 minutes equally divided prior to each vote; and there \nbe no amendments in order to the amendments prior to the votes.\n  I think we ought to have more debate on some of these amendments than \nthat. The debates could take place tonight.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Reserving the right to object, I ask the Senator----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Did the Senator say the only time for debate on these \namendments would be 2 minutes?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Tonight is open for debate.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Tonight is open. Tomorrow there would just be 2 minutes \non each amendment? Because Senator Kirk and I, and Senator Lieberman, \nhave amendments that several Members have asked to speak on, including \nthe distinguished ranking member. I would then urge them to come \ntonight and speak on it. I will not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I completed my statement.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object and I will not object, I \nwant to speak for 20 seconds. This is what I want to say.\n  There are amendments and there are amendments. We all know that. I \nthink we have shown that we can work together. But when you try to \nrepeal a\n\n[[Page S7196]]\n\nlaw that protects the lives of people--you talk about protecting \nrights, I am with you. I also want to protect the lives of people. \nComing from a State where we have had many mass shootings it may take a \nlittle longer. Maybe we ought to have a hearing or two before you \nrepeal a law that is so important to the safety of the people.\n  I will not object. I will see you all tomorrow.\n  Mr. COBURN. Reserving the right to object, this bill came out of the \nVeterans' Committee 14 to 0. They had hearings on it. We have done the \nwork. It has been done. It came unanimously out of the Veterans' \nCommittee. There is no question about what is right to do in terms of \nprotecting--this is not about allowing anybody with any mental disease \nto have a gun. This is about taking the rights of those who do not have \na mental disease to have their rights restored.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Oklahoma object?\n  Mr. COBURN. I do not.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There has been a unanimous consent request. If \nthere is no objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n Amendments Nos. 2940, 3036, 3064, 3114, 3193, 3213, 3220, 3222, 3237, \n              3243, 3256, 3260, 3261, 3271, 3275, and 3279\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I now call up a list of 17 amendments which \nhave been cleared by myself and Senator McCain. I am going to list \nthese amendments:\n\n       Blumenthal amendment No. 2940, Brown of Massachusetts \n     amendment No. 3036, Toomey amendment No. 3064, Levin \n     amendment No. 3114, Casey amendment No. 3193, Risch amendment \n     No. 3213, Wicker amendment No. 3220, Johanns amendment No. \n     3222, Coburn amendment No. 3237, Levin amendment No. 3243, \n     Lieberman amendment No. 3256, Cornyn amendment No. 3260, \n     McCain amendment No. 3261, Kyl amendment No. 3271, Webb \n     amendment No. 3275, Nelson of Nebraska amendment No. 3279.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot object----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order.\n  Mr. McCAIN. We now have 17 more amendments. We will be proceeding \ntomorrow morning. I want to tell my colleagues, we will be looking at \nother amendments to put into a package we can agree on, but I also urge \nmany of my colleagues who have redundant and duplicative amendments to \nlook at their amendments and withdraw them if possible so we can \ndispose of remaining amendments as soon as possible tomorrow.\n  I thank especially Senator Feinstein and Senator Graham and Senator \nAyotte and those who were involved in this whole detainee issue. I \nthink it was a result that helped us to move forward enormously. I \nthank, obviously, the chairman for his unlimited patience, which is a \nquality which I do not have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest to adopt the amendments en bloc?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments were agreed to, as follows:\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 2940\n\n (Purpose: To provide certain requirements relating to the retirement, \n       adoption, care, and recognition of military working dogs)\n\n       At the end of subtitle E of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1048.

With this agreement, the Afghan people, and the \n     world, should know that Afghanistan has a friend and a \n     partner in the United States.''\n       (7) At a May 20, 2012, bilateral meeting with President \n     Karzai at the NATO Summit in Chicago, President Obama said \n     that the Enduring Strategic Partnership Agreement ``reflects \n     a future in which two sovereign nations--the United States \n     and Afghanistan--are operating as partners, to the benefit of \n     our countries' citizens, but also for the benefit of peace \n     and security and stability in the region and around the \n     world''.\n       (8) President Karzai said at the May 20, 2012, bilateral \n     meeting with President Obama, ``Mr. President, the \n     partnership that we signed a few weeks ago in Kabul has \n     turned a new page in our relations. And the new page is a \n     page of two sovereign countries working together for the \n     mutual interests--peace and security and in all other \n     areas.''\n       (9) On May 26, 2012, the Wolesi Jirga, the lower house of \n     the Afghan parliament, approved the Agreement by a vote of \n     191-7 with 2 abstentions.\n       (10) On June 3, 2012, the Meshrano Jirga, the upper house \n     of the Afghan parliament, approved the Agreement by a vote of \n     67-13.\n       (11) On July 8, 2012, at the Tokyo Conference on \n     Afghanistan, the international community and the Government \n     of Afghanistan reaffirmed their partnership in the economic \n     growth and development of Afghanistan through a process of \n     mutual commitments and accountability.\n       (12) On July 4, 2012, the Enduring Strategic Partnership \n     Agreement entered into force.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the members of the United States Armed Forces, \n     intelligence community, and diplomatic and development \n     community of the United States are to be commended for their \n     dedicated efforts and sacrifices in support of military and \n     stability operations in\n\n[[Page S7200]]\n\n     Afghanistan that have helped strengthen security in \n     Afghanistan, laid the foundation for transition to a long-\n     term partnership between the United States and a sovereign \n     Afghanistan, and supported the Government and people of \n     Afghanistan as they continue to build their capacity to \n     effectively and justly govern;\n       (2) the United States negotiating team for the Enduring \n     Strategic Partnership Agreement, including the United States \n     Embassy personnel in Kabul under the leadership of Ambassador \n     Ryan Crocker, is to be commended for its committed diplomatic \n     efforts;\n       (3) the Governments of the United States and Afghanistan \n     are to be commended for concluding the Enduring Strategic \n     Partnership Agreement;\n       (4) Congress supports the objectives and principles of the \n     Enduring Strategic Partnership Agreement, including \n     protecting and promoting shared democratic values, advancing \n     long-term security, reinforcing regional security and \n     cooperation, fostering social and economic development, \n     upholding the rights of women and minorities, and \n     strengthening institutions and governance in Afghanistan;\n       (5) it is essential that the Government and people of \n     Afghanistan fulfill Afghanistan's international commitments \n     as agreed at the Tokyo Conference of July 2012, the Bonn \n     Conference of December 2011, the Kabul Conference of July \n     2011, and other venues to combat corruption, protect the \n     equal rights of all citizens of Afghanistan and enforce the \n     rule of law, hold free and fair elections in 2014, and build \n     inclusive and effective institutions of democratic \n     governance;\n       (6) a key national security interest of the United States \n     is to maintain a long-term political, economic, and military \n     relationship with Afghanistan, including a limited presence \n     of United States Armed Forces for the purpose of training, \n     advising, and supporting Afghan National Security Forces and \n     cooperating on shared counterterrorism objectives;\n       (7) the negotiation and conclusion of a Bilateral Security \n     Agreement, as called for in the Enduring Strategic \n     Partnership Agreement, will provide a fundamental framework \n     for the long-term security relationship between the United \n     States and Afghanistan; and\n       (8) Congress has a critical role in continuing to provide \n     the support and assistance necessary to achieve the goals of \n     the Enduring Strategic Partnership Agreement.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3256\n\n(Purpose: To require reports from the Comptroller General of the United \n  States on certain aspects of joint professional military education)\n\n       At the end of subtitle F of title V, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 561.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON OVERSIGHT OF THE NUCLEAR \n                   SECURITY ENTERPRISE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In 2000, the National Nuclear Security Administration \n     was established as an independent entity within the \n     Department of Energy to manage and secure the nuclear weapons \n     stockpile of the United States and to manage nuclear \n     nonproliferation and naval reactor programs.\n       (2) Serious security and health incidents continue to occur \n     at sites of the National Nuclear Security Administration.\n       (3) In September 2012, an official of the Government \n     Accountability Office testified to Congress that lax \n     laboratory attitudes toward safety procedures, laboratory \n     inadequacies in identifying and addressing safety problems \n     with appropriate corrective actions, and inadequate oversight \n     by site offices of the National Nuclear Security \n     Administration were responsible for nearly 100 safety \n     incidents since 2000.\n       (4) On July 28, 2012, three unarmed individuals compromised \n     security at the Y-12 National Security Complex in Oak Ridge, \n     Tennessee, and according to the Government Accountability \n     Office, ``gained access to the protected security area \n     directly adjacent to one of the nation's most critically \n     important nuclear weapons-related facilities''.\n       (5) In June 2006, hackers attacked an unclassified computer \n     system at the National Nuclear Security Administration's \n     Service Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and gained access \n     to a file containing the names and social security numbers of \n     more than 1,500 employees of the National Nuclear Security \n     Administration.\n       (6) As early as February 2005, the Inspector General of the \n     Department of Energy identified problems with the retrieval \n     of badges from terminated employees at Los Alamos National \n     Laboratory and other sites of the National Nuclear Security \n     Administration.\n       (7) In 2004, a pattern of safety and security incidents \n     that occurred over the course of a year prompted the stand-\n     down of Los Alamos National Laboratory.\n       (8) The National Nuclear Security Administration, \n     independent of the safety and security reform efforts of the \n     Department of Energy, has launched an overhaul of its \n     contracting oversight, placing an emphasis on contractor \n     self-policing through an untested ``contractor assurance'' \n     approach.\n       (9) The Government Accountability Office has given the \n     contractor administration and project management capabilities \n     of the National Nuclear Security Administration a ``high \n     risk'' designation and found there to be insufficient \n     qualified Federal acquisition professionals to ``plan, \n     direct, and oversee project execution''.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) there is a need for strong, independent oversight of \n     the United States nuclear security enterprise;\n       (2) any attempt to reform oversight of the nuclear security \n     enterprise that transfers oversight from the Department of \n     Energy to the National Nuclear Security Administration, \n     reduces protections for worker health and safety at \n     facilities of the National Nuclear Security Administration to \n     levels below the standards of the Department of Energy, or \n     transfers construction appropriations for the nuclear \n     security enterprise from the Department of Energy \n     appropriation account to the military construction \n     appropriation account, should be carefully evaluated;\n       (3) the Office of Health, Safety, and Security of the \n     Department of Energy, which reports to the Secretary of \n     Energy but is also accountable for routinely reporting to \n     Congress on the performance with respect to safety and \n     security of the Department, including the National Nuclear \n     Security Administration, and the role of that Office in \n     overseeing safety and security at the National Nuclear \n     Security Administration, should not be diminished but should \n     be routinely evaluated;\n       (4) any future modifications to the management or structure \n     of the nuclear security enterprise should be done in a way \n     that maintains or increases oversight of critical \n     construction, security, and acquisition capabilities;\n       (5) to the extent possible, oversight of programs of the \n     National Nuclear Security Administration by the Department of \n     Defense should increase to ensure current and future \n     warfighting requirements are met; and\n       (6) the Nuclear Weapons Council should provide proper \n     oversight in the execution of its responsibilities under \n     section 179 of title 10, United States Code.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S7202]]\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text \nof Amendments.'')\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, first I appreciate where we are. This is \na bipartisan amendment. It is an amendment with Senator Kirk and \nSenator Lieberman. It is a continuing perfection of sanctions as it \nrelates to Iran that has been unanimously passed by this body \napproximately a year ago last December. Iran has set its sights on \nachieving nuclear weapons capability and this would not be in the \nnational security interests of the United States because we have tens \nof thousands of our troops who would be in harm's way if Iran had \nnuclear weapons.\n  It would also not be in our national security interests because we \nclearly have to ensure that the Straits of Hormuz remain open and \naccessible and we would be obligated under our NATO agreements to \nrespond should a Shabab missile be launched against one of our allies. \nOf course a Shabab missile is an Iranian missile that has the type of \nflight and capability to do so.\n  It is not in our national security interests because the last thing \nwe need is a nuclear arms race in the tinderbox of the world where \ncountries, for example, such as Turkey and Saudi Arabia would feel \nobligated to follow suit if Iran were to become a nuclear power.\n  For all of those reasons among others, it would not be in the \nnational security interests of the United States. That achievement \nwould jeopardize U.S. national security interests, pose an existential \nthreat to the state of Israel, and would result in a nuclear arms race \nthat would further destabilize the region.\n  The news out of Iran is dire. Just this week the Director of the \nInternational Atomic Energy Administration told the press Iran has not \nslowed its enrichment activities. The International Atomic Energy \nAdministration also suspects that Iran has conducted live tests of \nconventional explosives that could be used to detonate a nuclear weapon \nat the Parchin military base--a facility the Iranians have denied \naccess to by the International Atomic Energy Administration.\n  Between May and August of this year, Iran doubled the number of \ncentrifuges at its fortified Fordow facility, buried deep inside a \nmountain to protect it against strikes. Iran now has over 2,140 \ncentrifuges for enriching uranium and it continues to enrich to 20 \npercent. Iran claims it needs this higher grade uranium for its \npeaceful nuclear program, but a country with peaceful ambitions doesn't \nenrich uranium in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions. It \ndoesn't refuse to disclose its operations. It doesn't hide them inside \na mountain. A peaceful nation doesn't breach the international \ninspections regime compelled by the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, \nand a peaceful nation is not one that pursues weaponization of missiles \nthat can reach countries far beyond its borders.\n  The sanctions passed by this body unanimously last December are \nhaving a significant impact. The Iranian currency, the rial, has lost \nmuch of its value, and Iran's oil exports have dropped to a new daily \nlow of 860,000 barrels per day, which is over 1 million barrels of oil \nper day less than 1 year ago.\n  Through our sanctions and the combined effort of the European Union, \nwe have forced the Iranians back to the negotiating table. By passing \nthese additional measures--requiring the cessation of sales to and \ntransactions within Iranian sectors that support proliferation, \nincluding energy, shipping, shipbuilding, and port sectors, as well as \nanyone on our specially designated national list--we will send a \nmessage to Iran that the time for confidence-building measures is over. \nWe do not want the Iranian regime simply to believe they can toughen \nout the sanctions. This sends a clear message that toughening it out \nwill not work and it will only get worse.\n  If Iran is serious about wanting to reach a diplomatic solution, then \nit must quickly and fully implement U.N. Security Council resolutions. \nIt must stop enriching uranium, permit removal from its territory of \nenriched uranium, close the Fordow enrichment facility, and submit to a \nrobust inspections regime that includes inspections of the Parchin \nmilitary facility.\n  Clearly, sanctions are not the ultimate goal. They are only a means \nto a clear end, in this case preventing Iran from becoming the next \nnuclear state and an existential threat to our ally, the State of \nIsrael. Let me highlight the major provisions of this amendment.\n  First, this amendment designates Iran's energy, port, shipping, and \nshipbuilding sectors as entities of proliferation because of the role \nthey play in supporting and funding Iran's obvious proliferation \nactivities. With the exception of permissible petroleum transactions \nunder the existing sanctions regime from countries that have \nsignificantly reduced their purchases of oil from Iran, these sectors \nwill now be off limits. We will sanction any transactions with these \nsectors and we will block the property--and any third party--that \nengages in transactions with them.\n  Second, we impose sanctions on persons selling or supplying a defined \nlist of commodities to Iran--commodities that are relevant to Iran's \nshipbuilding and nuclear sectors such as graphite, aluminum, steel, \nmetallurgical coal, and software for integrating industrial processes. \nWe also will prevent Iran from circumventing sanctions on its Central \nBank that this Congress and the President signed by receiving payments \nin precious metals.\n  Third, we designate the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting entity \nand its President as human rights abusers for their broadcasting of \nforced television confessions and show trials, thereby blocking their \nassets and preventing others from doing business with the IRIB.\n  To address concerns about access to humanitarian goods in Iran, which \nis a very real and serious concern, we have provided for exceptions for \nthe provision and sale to Iran of food, agricultural commodities, \nmedicine, medical devices, and other humanitarian goods. We have \nimposed new human rights sanctions on those in Iran who are engaged in \ncorruption or the diversion of resources related to these goods and \nthat are preventing them from reaching the Iranian people.\n  Our message is clear. The window is closing. The time for the waiting \ngame is over. Yes, our sanctions are having a demonstrable effect on \nthe Iranian economy, but Iran is still working just as hard to develop \nnuclear weapons. Iran has to decide what it will do. Will it continue \ndown the path to proliferation and risk further crushing economic \nsanctions or will it end the madness and negotiate a responsible end to \nits nuclear ambition? The waiting game is over and, in the end, one way \nor the other, Iran will not be allowed to acquire a nuclear weapon that \ncould threaten the national interests and security interests of the \nUnited States, Israel, the region, and the world.\n  I wish to thank Senator Kirk, whom we have worked with on this issue \nfor quite some time, as well as Senator Lieberman, Senator Casey, and \nmany others who have shared their interests and their views, and we \nhave tried to incorporate those views. I hope that tomorrow when we \ncast a vote, it will be the type of unanimous vote this Senate passed \nnearly 1 year ago, that ultimately sends a very clear message to the \nIranians that if they seek to evade, if they seek to avoid, if they \nthink they can wait out the process, they are wrong. That is, in \nessence, what we are doing through this amendment. It is, in essence, \nwhy we believe it is so critical to move forward, to send a very clear \nmessage to the Iranians.\n  This is about the national security of the United States. It is the \nexistential challenge to the State of Israel, our ally, and it is the \nbest of a bipartisan effort that we have seen in this Senate.\n  With that, I look forward to tomorrow's vote.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Menendez amendment No. 3232 is pending.\n  Mr. McCAIN. All right. I intend to speak on that shortly.\n\n[[Page S7203]]\n\n  I see the chairman is here.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, what Senator McCain and I and our staffs \nare going to attempt to do tomorrow morning is that shortly after the \nfourth vote that is now scheduled, the fourth rollcall vote, we hope to \nbe able to announce a finite list of amendments which would need to be \ndisposed of before completion of this bill. That is going to be our \ngoal, and we are going to repeat that goal the first thing in the \nmorning. But it is important people know that. That is now something \nthat is important that we do because we expect there will be a cloture \nmotion tomorrow that will be filed, and if we can put together a finite \nlist of amendments that need to be disposed of before final passage of \nthis bill, that step may be unnecessary.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to say I think we have made great \nprogress. I think we have addressed the major issues concerning this \nlegislation, although there are certainly other issues our colleagues \nfeel are very important. But we should have reached a point now after 3 \ndays that we put together a list of amendments. We can decide whether \nthose amendments can be agreed upon, dropped or voted on. But it is \ntime we put that list together and, obviously, with that being \naccomplished, we could get this thing wrapped up without having to go \nthrough the process of cloture and the intervening hours and all the \nparliamentary procedures that are embodied in that process.\n  I thank the chairman and thank the presiding officer.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No 3199, as Modified\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nnotwithstanding the adoption of Durbin amendment No. 3199, it be \nmodified with the changes at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, my colleague Senator Landrieu and I have an \namendment to remove inequities that exist in the women-owned small \nbusiness contracting program, when compared to other socioeconomic \nprograms.\n  As former chair and now ranking member of the Senate Committee on \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship, I have long championed women \nentrepreneurship and have urged both past and present administrations \nto implement the woman-owned small business, WOSB, Federal contracting \nprogram, which was enacted into law 10 years ago. On March 4, 2010, the \nSmall Business Administration, SBA, finally proposed a workable rule to \nimplement the women's procurement program. And I am pleased to report \nthat today there is a functional WOSB contracting program, however, the \nprogram lacks the critical elements that the SBA's 8(a), historically \nunderutilized business zones, and the service-disabled veteran-owned \ngovernment contracting programs include.\n  To remedy this, our bipartisan amendment will help provide tools \nwomen need to compete fairly in the Federal contracting arena by \neliminating a restriction on the dollar amount of a contract that a \nWOSB can compete for, thus putting them on a level playing field with \nthe other socioeconomic contracting programs.\n  Women-owned small businesses have yet to receive their fair share of \nthe Federal marketplace. In fact, our government has never achieved its \ngoal of 5 percent of contracts going to WOSBs, achieving only 3.98 \npercent in fiscal year 2011. This amendment would greatly assist \nFederal agencies in achieving the small business goaling requirement \nfor WOSBs.\n  Mr. President, I also wish to speak to an amendment to S. 3254, the \nNational Defense Authorization Act, to cease Federal involvement in the \nNational Veterans Business Development Corporation.\n  This bipartisan amendment would cease, once and for all, Federal \ninvolvement in the National Veterans Business Development Corporation, \nalso known as The Veterans Corporation or simply TVC. Let me begin by \nthanking the bill's cosponsors, Small Business Committee Chair Mary \nLandrieu, former Small Business Committee Chair John Kerry and Senator \nTom Coburn. Senator Coburn, as most in this body will recognize, is a \ntrue leader in efforts to streamline the Federal government. Recently \nhe spoke with us about ideas for federal entities or programs that \ncould be eliminated and we readily provided TVC as an example of an \nentity that we had already identified that the Federal government \nshould sever its ties with.\n  I want to say at the outset that an amendment, with identical text as \nthis one, passed the Senate by a vote of 99-0 in May of 2011, but the \nbill it was attached to did not pass. We are introducing this repeal as \na stand-alone bill because TVC has been ineffective and controversial \nsince its inception as part of the Veterans Entrepreneurship and Small \nBusiness Development Act--P.L. 106-50--in 1999. In December of 2008, \nformer Small Business Committee Chairman Kerry and I investigated TVC, \nand issued a report detailing the organization's blatant mismanagement \nand wasting of taxpayers' dollars.\n  The report found, among other things, that TVC (a) failed to support\n\n[[Page S7204]]\n\nVeteran Business Resource Centers; (b) had wasteful programs; (c) \nlacked outcomes-based measurements; (d) provided it's employees with \nunacceptably high executive compensation; (e) engaged in dubious \nexpenditures, and (f) failed to properly fundraise.\n  For instance, our report concluded that TVC had spent only 15 percent \nof the federal funding that it had received on veterans business \nresource centers, which TVC was required to establish and maintain \nunder law. In FY 2008, the percentage dropped to about 9 percent. We \nalso found that TVC's executives received unacceptably high levels of \ncompensation given the organization's limited resources and reach. \nWhile an average of 15 percent of TVC's federally appropriated funds \nwent to the Centers, 22 percent of TVC's FY 2007 federal appropriation \ndollars were spent on its top two executives' compensation packages \nalone. Moreover, the organization miserably failed to fundraise--which \nwas required by law in order for it to become self-sufficient--and \nduring fiscal years 2005 through 2007, TVC leaders spent $2.50 for \nevery $1.00 they raised through the organization's fundraising \nefforts--almost entirely at the taxpayers' expense. Additionally, \nthrough broad decision-making powers granted to TVC's executive \ncommittee under the organization's bylaws, the committee approved a \nnumber of measures without proper approval or ratification form the \nfull Board, including $40,000 in employee bonuses in one year alone.\n  Since the issuing of the Small Business Committee's report, Congress \nhas appropriated no further funding for TVC, and the Small Business \nAdministration has incorporated the Veteran Business Resource Centers \nthat TVC previously funded into its existing network of Veteran \nBusiness Outreach Centers. These moves were publically supported by a \nvariety of veteran service organizations, including the American Legion \nand the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW). For instance, in August of \n2008, the American Legion passed a resolution at its national \nconvention, Resolution No. 223, stating that the Legion ``no longer \nsupport[s] the continuing initiatives or existence of the national \nVeterans Business Development Corporation.''\n  At present, TVC is still Federally chartered. At the same time, it \nreceives no Federal funds, has no department or agency oversight. In \nlight of everything I have discussed, it is my belief that the Federal \ngovernment must take the next step and fully sever all ties with the \norganization. I ask my colleagues to support this bipartisan amendment.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Fiscal Year 2013 \nNational Defense Authorization Act. This bill represents a bipartisan \ncommitment to ensuring that our brave men and women in uniform have the \nresources, equipment, and support they require to defend the interests \nof the United States around the globe.\n  I wish to commend Chairman Levin and Ranking Member McCain for their \nefforts.\n  This bill represents a prudent path forward for the Department of \nDefense. But it is a path that could be shortly undermined if a \ncompromise is not reached to avert the impending self-inflicted crisis \nof sequestration. Without action, sequestration could spell disaster \nfor many of the programs that we would authorize through this bill. I \nstand ready to work with all my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, \nto correct the short-sighted policy of sequestration and determine a \nsustainable way forward for our country.\n  I am pleased this bill recognizes the importance of shipbuilding to \nour Nation's defense, authorizing $778 million more than the \nadministration's fiscal year 2013 request for Navy ships.\n  While the total annual shipbuilding budget is less than what the \nUnited States pays each month on interest to service the national debt, \nthe ships built by the Navy represent such an important part of our \nnational military strategy. The Navy's fleet, as an instrument of \nnational policy, has a positive effect upon global security that far \nexceeds the percentage of the budget it represents.\n  This bill authorizes multiyear procurement authority for both the \nVirginia-class submarine program and for up to ten Arleigh Burke-class \ndestroyers. The two programs are projected to achieve savings of 14 \npercent and 9 percent respectively, when compared to the cost of annual \ncontracting.\n  I congratulate both the chairman and ranking member for their \nwillingness to direct the Navy to make good on cost-effective planning \nand, as a result, to increase the size of the fleet. For as we have \nheard this year in the testimony of virtually every combatant \ncommander, the importance of the maritime environment continues to grow \nwith each passing year.\n  As our Nation and our military look to the Western Pacific, that \ntrend is sure to continue. Events this year in the South China Sea, \nwhich saw a disconcerting maritime standoff between the Philippines and \nthe People's Republic of China, highlight just how important the \nmaritime environment is to global security. Although thankfully the \ncrisis abated, the ability of the Navy to respond with forward-deployed \nmultimission platforms capable of operating in anti-access and area-\ndenial environments must be maintained. Moreover, we must continue to \nmake the necessary investments in both our public and private shipyards \nto allow for a strong domestic shipbuilding and ship repair industrial \nbase.\n  I am proud that my own State of Maine contributes so much to the \nstrength of our Navy. Maine, after all, has a proud maritime legacy. \nTens of thousands of Mainers earn their living from the sea, as \ncommercial fishermen or lobstermen, as merchant sailors, as Coast \nGuardsmen or Navy Sailors, as part of Maine's tourist industry, or as \nworkers at Maine's public and private shipyards.\n  Bath Iron Works, a private shipyard and Maine's largest private \nemployer, has been building ships for the Navy since 1893, and the \nshipyard continues to be known by the phrase ``Bath built is best \nbuilt.''\n  Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, in Kittery, ME, is one of only four public \nshipyards that remain in the United States, and conducts repair and \nrefueling work on nuclear submarines. Both of the yards, along with the \nother public and private yards across the country, are truly national \nstrategic assets, and the workers in these yards are the world's \nleading experts in ship construction and repair. As Chinese yards \ncontinue to churn out modern warships, and as the Chinese fleet \ncontinues to expand, we cannot allow any of the capabilities \nrepresented by our shipyards to atrophy.\n  Given the events of this month in the Middle East, I am pleased this \nbill also authorizes important additional funding for the Iron Dome \nprogram and cooperative programs with the State of Israel. As the \nSenate has affirmed time and again, most recently on November 15 when \nwe passed S. Res. 599 introduced by Senator Gillibrand, Israel has an \ninherent right to act in self defense. In that resolution, the Senate \nexpressed our unwavering commitment to Israel's security--a security \nwhich unfortunately continues to be threatened.\n  While I commend the efforts undertaken by those in the Middle East \nand by Secretary Clinton to achieve the recent ceasefire, we must \ncontinue to make the investments necessary to guarantee Israel's \nsecurity. I can think of no better investment than the Iron Dome \nsystem, which had a success rate of 80-90 percent against the hundreds \nof rockets fired into Israel's borders.\n  And while Iron Dome protects the State of Israel, we must also look \nat how to better secure the United States, particularly those states on \nthe East Coast, from the threat of a missile attack from rogue regimes \nin the Middle East. According to the Pentagon's Annual Report on the \nMilitary Power of Iran, parts of which were released in July, Iran \ncould produce missiles capable of reaching the U.S. within 3 years.\n  To address this threat, Senators Lieberman, Ayotte, and I have filed \nan amendment which would require the Department to conduct an \nEnvironmental Impact Statement and create a plan for establishing a \nmissile defense site on the East Coast of the United States. Such a \nsite, whether sea-based or on land, located in the northeast tip of our \ncountry, could better protect the East Coast from an intercontinental \nballistic missile attack. Beginning an EIS now, a task which could take \nup to 18-24 months, is a prudent measure to preserve our options in the \nfuture.\n  Just as we must protect the East Coast, we must also provide the \nmilitary the tools to protect the mental\n\n[[Page S7205]]\n\nand physical wellbeing of military personnel. This year, the suicide \nrate amongst Active-Duty personnel has continued to soar. On average, \nmore than one soldier, sailor, airman, or Marine has taken their own \nlife every day this year. That is a tragedy of the first degree.\n  For every servicemember who dies in battle, 25 veterans die by their \nown hands. Not only have more military personnel killed themselves than \nwere killed in Afghanistan this year, but the rate of suicides in the \nmilitary significantly exceeds the rate of suicides in the general \npopulation. Veterans, many of whom are dealing with financial or \nposttraumatic stress, chronic pain, or depression resulting from their \ntime in uniform, also face high rates of suicide. According to a \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs report this spring, a veteran commits \nsuicide every 80 minutes.\n  While I applaud the military and the VA efforts to address this \nthreat seriously, especially the Army, we can and must do more. To that \nend, I have filed an amendment with Senators Lieberman and Blumenthal \nto require the Attorney General to exercise authority granted to him by \nthe Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010 to establish a \ndrug take-back program in coordination with both the Secretary of \nDefense and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs.\n  There is substantial evidence that prescription drug abuse is a major \nfactor in military and veteran suicides. The Army has reported that 29 \npercent of suicides had known history of psychotropic medication use, \nincluding anti-depressants, anti-anxiety medicine, anti-psychotics, and \nother controlled substances such as opioids.\n  I understand the legitimate concerns raised by some law enforcement \nofficials that accountability of drugs must be strictly maintained and \nthat these drugs must be prevented from being misused, abused, or sold \nin the black market. I am confident, however, that both the military--\nan institution that has developed and implemented programs for the \nhandling of nuclear weapons and classified information--and the VA are \ncapable of running a drug take-back program with the utmost \naccountability and highest of standards.\n  I have also filed another amendment to establish a resilience \nresearch program in the Army to study the effectiveness of the \nComprehensive Soldier Fitness program. This program is intended to \nimprove the resilience of our active duty force.\n  The loss of even one servicemember to a potentially preventable \nsuicide is unacceptable. We have a responsibility to take every \npractical step that we can to help the military win the battle against \nsuicides. Over the past decade, we have made an incredible investment \nto prevent deaths or injuries from IEDs. Although the threat to our \nforces posed by suicide will not be solved overnight, it deserves a \nsimilar commitment to combat this epidemic.\n  Likewise, the high incidence of military sexual assaults also \ncontinue to warrant our attention, particularly after the scandal at \nLackland Air Force Base. This bill includes two provisions that I \nsupport which would codify into law regulations that were issued by the \nDepartment earlier this year. We should all continue to watch the \nDepartment closely to see that the changes are implemented wisely, that \nthe Department's policy of zero tolerance becomes a culture of zero \ntolerance, and that the incidence of these crimes is dramatically \nreduced.\n  In the area of mental health, this bill includes a provision to grant \nauthority for additional behavioral health professionals to conduct \npre-separation medical examinations for post-traumatic stress disorder. \nThis provision would increase the number of medical professionals \navailable to conduct evaluations because the backlog of cases within \nthe integrated disability evaluation system is significant, and results \nin unacceptable wait times for our military personnel being processed \nfor separation.\n  Unfortunately, the military does not even know the true scope of the \nbacklog within the disability evaluation system, and I am sure that \nmany of our colleagues receive letters from their constituents \nexpressing this concern each week. This year's bill contains a \nprovision I authored that would require DOD to collect data on the \nphysical, mental, and behavioral health of Wounded Warriors in order to \naccurately assess the efficacy of the military's Wounded Warrior \nprograms.\n  In Afghanistan, where many of our wounded warriors received their \ninjuries, military personnel continue to pay a high cost. As we head \ninto the final 2 years of combat in Afghanistan, after more than a \ndecade of war, I have grown increasingly concerned about the high \nnumber of insider attacks and their effect upon our strategy to \ntransition to Afghan Security Forces leadership and for U.S. forces to \nassume a training and mentoring role after 2014.\n  Each death caused by the tactic of insider attacks has a strategic \neffect upon the war, both in terms of the American people's perception, \nand the willingness of our partners in NATO and ISAF to remain engaged \nin battle.\n  In 2012 alone, 60 Coalition troops, representing 16 percent of \nCoalition deaths, have been slain at the hands of those upon which our \nstrategy depends. It is for that reason that I, along with Senators \nUdall, Portman, and Shaheen have filed an amendment that would require \nthe Secretary of Defense to report on the effect of insider attacks \nupon the progress of the war and the effect these attacks have upon our \nstrategy and the behavior of our partners. Our Nation has made too \ngreat an investment in blood and treasure in Afghanistan; Congress must \nunderstand the strategic environment, and be presented with all the \ninformation to make informed decisions about how to proceed in \nAfghanistan.\n  The Afghan war has also left us with important questions about \ndetention policy here at home that must be resolved. One of the \nquestions that has been left unaddressed in the eleven years since the \nCongress authorized the use of military force to go after al-Qaeda and \nthe Taliban is whether the Congress intended to authorize the detention \nof persons in the United States, and specifically the detention of \nAmerican citizens. I have cosponsored an amendment with Senator \nFeinstein that would explicitly prohibit the indefinite detention of \nU.S. citizens captured on U.S. soil.\n  The final amendment I have offered, along with Senators Kerry, Brown \nof Massachusetts, Blumenthal, Whitehouse, Snowe, and Brown of Ohio, \nwould require the Department of Defense to establish a temporary pilot \nprogram to issue domestically procured athletic shoes to Army recruits \nin initial entry training. DOD historically provided athletic footwear \nto new recruits that comply with the Berry Amendment, but DOD's current \nprocurement process has allowed it to circumvent the spirit, letter, \nand intent of the law. I have no doubt that domestic suppliers will be \nable to produce a Berry compliant shoe, with minimal waivers necessary, \nthat can meet the needs of recruits and the Army in a cost-effective \nmanner. We should not allow government funds to be used to support \nforeign-made shoes, when American shoes are available. Much like our \nOlympic athletes should be clothed in domestically produced apparel, so \ntoo should our military recruits be wearing athletic shoes made in the \nU.S.A.\n  I am also cosponsoring two amendments that grew out of the work of \nthe Commission on Wartime Contracting. I have cosponsored Senator \nBlumenthal's End Trafficking in Government Contracting Act to tighten \nthe U.S. government's zero tolerance policy for any form of human \ntrafficking. This amendment would require contractors to certify that \nthey have plans in place to prevent such practices. It also makes it a \ncrime to engage in such labor practices overseas on U.S.-controlled \nproperty or while working on a U.S. contract.\n  The Commission on Wartime Contracting also found that contingency \ncontracting in Iraq and Afghanistan has been plagued by high levels of \nwaste, fraud, and abuse--estimating that at least $31 billion had been \nlost to contract waste and fraud. Without high-level attention, \nacquisition planning and allocation of resources, we are likely to \nrepeat the contracting mistakes of the last contingency operation.\n  Therefore, I have cosponsored Senator McCaskill's amendment to \nstrengthen contingency contracting at DoD, State, and the U.S. Agency \nfor\n\n[[Page S7206]]\n\nInternational Development--USAID--by improving planning, execution, and \noversight of this function at these agencies and requiring education \nfor personnel who engage in contingency contracting.\n  From the Maine Military Authority and the DFAS Center in Limestone to \nthe Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, from innovative composite and \nrenewable energy research at the University of Maine to high-tech firms \nlike Vingtech, Hodgdon Defense Composites, Maine Machine Products, and \nMt. Desert Island Biological Laboratory, Mainers continue to support \nnational defense with ingenuity and craftsmanship.\n  The investments authorized in this bill support these efforts in \nMaine and in States around the Nation, and they ensure that our \nmilitary is the best trained and equipped in the world. I urge my \ncolleagues to support passage of this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/29/senate-section/article/S7206-1", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7206]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the \nNational Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013. Congress has \npassed the Defense Authorization every year for the past 5 decades and \nit remains one of the most bipartisan pieces of legislation we produce \nin this body. I believe strongly that there is no more important \nresponsibility that we have than providing for our common defense. The \nNDAA is a crucial part of that responsibility and I am glad to have the \nopportunity to speak in favor of it today. As Senators, it is one of \nour most important duties, and one of our greatest privileges, to \ndebate and pass this bill every year.\n  I would like to thank Chairman Levin and Ranking Member McCain for \ntheir leadership of the Armed Services Committee and their \ndetermination in getting the NDAA to the floor.\n  I have had the honor to serve as Chairman of the AirLand \nSubcommittee, of which I have been a member of since its inception in \n1995 and been either Chairman or Ranking Member since 1999. I would \nlike to recognize Ranking Member Scott Brown and thank him. We have \nworked together very well once again this year. Ours has been a \nbipartisan effort through our hearings, our markup, and now on the \nfloor. I would also like to thank the Subcommittee staff, Bill Sutey \nand Creighton Greene of the majority and Church Hutton and Pablo \nCarrillo of the minority, for their hard work that helped make this \nbill possible.\n  This year, the portion of the budget request falling under the \nAirland Subcommittee's jurisdiction total over $50 billion, including \n$37.4 billion in procurement, and $12.9 billion in research and \ndevelopment. The portion of the bill under the AirLand Subcommittee's \njurisdiction supports the Defense Department's requests for several \nmajor weapons programs, including:\n  $639.9 million for the Army's new Ground Combat Vehicle that will \nreplace some of the M2 Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles in the \ncurrent force;\n  $2.7 billion for procurement of UH-60 Blackhawk and CH-47 Chinook \nhelicopters so critically important to operations in Afghanistan and \naround the world;\n  $6.9 billion in the base request for the Navy, Marine Corps, and Air \nForce's F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program;\n  $60.0 million for F/A-18E/F advance procurement to preserve the \nNavy's option to produce additional aircraft in fiscal year 2014.\n  $91.0 million for M1 Abrams tank upgrades and $123.0 million for \nM88A2 advanced recovery vehicles. These recommended increases will \nextend armored vehicle production through fiscal year 2013 and allow \ntank production through 2014, thus preserving important combat vehicle \nindustrial capability.\n  Perhaps of greatest interest to many of our colleagues, the bill \naddresses concerns that the Air Force proposed disproportionate cuts to \nthe Air National Guard in its FY13 budget submission by establishing an \nindependent commission to study the appropriate force structure of the \nAir Force, including the Air National Guard and the Air Force Reserve, \nand providing $1.4 billion to freeze Air Force force structure pending \nthe commission's review.\n  The NDAA also provides an opportunity to address policy concerns \nimportant to military families, defense, and National security at \nlarge. There are a number of worthwhile amendments that have been filed \nand that I support, including my amendment with Senator Gillibrand \nproviding TRICARE coverage for important autism treatments and my \namendment with Senator Collins mandating a prescription drug take-back \nprogram to help reduce the scourge of military suicide. I would like to \nbriefly highlight a pair of issues I hope we address through floor \namendments.\n  Finally and most importantly, I hope this bill will include a new \npackage of Iran sanctions that Senator Menendez, Senator Kirk, and I \nplan to introduce. The fact is, Iran is continuing to make progress \ntowards a nuclear weapons capability, and time is running out to stop \nthem, short of the military option that none of us desire. That is why \nwe need to do everything in our power to ratchet up the pressure on the \nIranian government, as quickly as possible. The NDAA provides the last, \nbest chance that we will have in this Congress to impose tougher \nsanctions on Iran, and we must seize it.\n  In conclusion, I urge all my colleagues to support the NDAA for FY13. \nIt is a strong bill that provides critical funding and authorities to \nour military, and it has always been passed on a broad bipartisan \nbasis. As I approach the end of my career in the Senate, I look back \ngratefully upon the annual floor debates on the NDAA as examples of the \nway this body should operate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/29/senate-section/article/S7206-2", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7206]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. President, tomorrow night will be bittersweet in \nJackson, MI; it is the night the Community Action Agency will bid a \nformal farewell to its leader and CEO, Marsha Kreucher. For nearly a \nquarter century, the Community Action Agency has been guided by a \nleader with vision and compassion. Her work has been squarely focused \non making the lives of those in need better. She has gone about this \nwork with humility and tenacity, ensuring that her work and the work of \nthe agency she leads does its part to improve the lives of the \ncountless people served by the Community Action Agency.\n  The roots of poverty are complex and deep. Marsha's work, which takes \na holistic and innovative approach to promoting self-sufficiency among \nat-risk and low-income residents, has sought to identify the issues \nassociated with poverty and develop programs to alleviate them. Her \nefforts have reaped many rewards for the residents of Jackson, Lenawee, \nand Hillsdale counties and have improved their economic, social, and \nhealth conditions as a consequence.\n  In the late 1980s, when she began working at the Community Action \nAgency, the agency administered about two dozen programs and had a \nbudget of roughly $4 million. Nearly a quarter century later, the \nagency serves more than 27,000 residents annually through more than 80 \nprograms with a budget that averages around $20 million. This is \nimpressive growth and a testament to the quality of service the agency \nprovides and the talent of those leading the way.\n  It doesn't take very long to observe the profound impact the \nCommunity Action Agency has had on this region in the last two decades. \nThe Center for Healthy Beginnings was established and currently \nprovides full health care services to more than 27,000 residents \nannually. The Partnership Park Downtown Neighborhood Project was formed \nto help revitalize and redevelop a 23-block area in Jackson, MI, \nthrough $15 million in investments. More than 1,000 children a year \nreceive early childhood education opportunities through agency \nactivities. And thousands of families receive free assistance filing \ntheir income tax returns each year. These are but a few examples of the \ngood work of this impressive agency and a glimpse\n\n[[Page S7207]]\n\nof the range of services they provide with Marsha Kreucher as a driving \nforce.\n  Marsha is not just an accomplished leader; she is also a willing \nmentor and tireless community servant. She sits on a number of \nnonprofit boards and works to bring various stakeholders together to \nseek out fresh ways to combat the issues related to poverty. She is \nalways willing to lend an ear or to provide insight to others. Her \nvision and her ideas have helped spark innovation and creativity, \nplanting the seeds for a brighter future.\n  Marsha recently said to a local paper about her life after \nretirement, ``It's almost hard to comprehend the difference my life \nwill have without it.'' I say to her today that it is hard to imagine \nhow different the Jackson community would be without her vision, \nleadership, and hard work over the last two decades. She has worked \ntirelessly and fiercely to make a positive impact on the lives of those \nin need, and she has done so with grace and determination. I \ncongratulate her on a job well done and wish her the best as she begins \nher next, exciting journey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/29/senate-section/article/S7207-1", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7207-S7208]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN REAUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this fall also marks the 10th anniversary \nof the passing of another great Senator, Paul Wellstone, and his wife \nSheila. They were dear friends. Among the many things for which they \nare fondly remembered is the important work they did to combat domestic \nviolence and help victims. We have made much progress on this issue, in \nlarge part thanks to the Violence Against Women Act, which has long \ndemonstrated the bipartisan commitment to work together against \ndomestic violence and rape.\n  Sadly, so much remains to be done. Recent reports find that almost \none in four women have experienced severe domestic violence, and nearly \none in five women have been raped. In some communities, the picture is \nmuch worse. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, \none in five female college students will be a victim of sexual assault \nduring college. A recent study found that three out of five Native \nAmerican women have been assaulted by a spouse or intimate partner.\n  The bipartisan Leahy-Crapo Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act \nincludes vital provisions to help these and other particularly \nvulnerable victims. As the New York Times observed this weekend:\n\n       The act's reauthorization is must-do business for the lame-\n     duck session. Mr. Boehner should relent and allow the House \n     to vote on the Senate bill.\n\n  I ask that the full Times editorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Nov. 24, 2012]\n\n                 The G.O.P. and Violence Against Women\n\n       If Republicans are serious about repairing their party's \n     standing among women, gay and Hispanic voters, they need to \n     adjust some policies and stop sending hostile messages. A \n     good place to start would be for Republicans in the House to \n     stop blocking reauthorization of the Violence Against Women \n     Act over provisions deemed too protective of gay and \n     immigrant victims of domestic violence and sexual assault.\n       The 1994 law remains crucial to the nation's efforts to \n     combat domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking. \n     Previous reauthorizations sailed through Congress.\n       A thoughtful renewal measure introduced by Senator Patrick \n     Leahy, a Vermont Democrat and Judiciary Committee chairman, \n     and Senator Michael Crapo, an Idaho Republican, cleared the \n     Senate in April with strong bipartisan support. But it has \n     hit a wall in the Republican-led House. Instead, House \n     Republicans pushed through a regressive version of the \n     measure that omits new protections for gay, bisexual or \n     transgender victims of abuse.\n       The House bill also left out a needed increase in the \n     number of visas, known as U visas, available for undocumented \n     immigrants who are victims of domestic violence and sexual \n     assaults. And it would reduce the incentive for frightened \n     victims to come forward by ending the current ability of U \n     visa holders to apply for permanent residency after three \n     years.\n       Speaker John Boehner and his Republican colleagues blame \n     Democrats for the impasse, suggesting the Democrats inserted \n     changes to invite opposition and score political points. But \n     the provisions at issue respond to real humanitarian and law \n     enforcement needs identified by experts working in the field.\n       By refusing to accept the principle of protecting all \n     victims of domestic violence, House Republican leaders are \n     conveying a belief that rapes of gay people and immigrant \n     women are not ``legitimate'' rapes, as Representative Todd \n     Akin, the failed Republican candidate for the Senate from \n     Missouri, put it so appallingly. Is that really what \n     Republicans want to stand for?\n       The act's reauthorization is must-do business for the lame-\n     duck session. Failure to agree on a bill would mean having to \n     start the legislative process all over again next year. Mr. \n     Boehner should relent and allow the House to vote on the \n     Senate bill. There is a chance it would not muster sufficient \n     Republican votes to pass. But at least it would give \n     Republican representatives who value moderation a chance to \n     dissociate themselves from the narrow-minded prejudices and \n     politics hurting their party.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Friday will mark a year since Senator Crapo and I \nintroduced this bill. We have kept victims waiting too long. We should \ncome together to act now.\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it has now been more than 3 weeks since \nPresident Obama was reelected by the American people, and Senate \nRepublicans are still blocking votes on 19 judicial nominations who \nshould have received confirmation votes before the Senate recessed for \nthe election. Some of these nominees have been waiting close to 9 \nmonths for a vote. It is time for us to come together to do what is \nright and to act in the interests of the American people.\n  We should begin by having an up or down vote on the longest-pending \nnomination. The nomination of Patty Shwartz to the Third Circuit Court \nof Appeals has been ready for a final vote since last March 8. Judge \nShwartz received a unanimous well-qualified rating from the nonpartisan \nABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary, its highest possible \nrating, and it is well past time for the Senate to vote on her \nnomination.\n  Regrettably, the Senate has not been allowed to make real progress \nfor the American people by reducing the number of judicial vacancies. \nThere were more than 80 vacancies when the year began. There were more \nthan 80 vacancies when in March the Majority Leader was forced to take \nthe extraordinary step of filing cloture petitions on 17 district court \nnominations. There are now more than 80 vacancies once again. In stark \ncontrast, there were only 29 vacancies at this point in President \nGeorge W. Bush's first term.\n  There is no justification for holding up final Senate action on the \n19 judicial nominations that have been approved by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee and are pending on the Senate Executive Calendar. President \nObama has consistently reached across the aisle, consulted with home \nstate Senators from both parties and appointed moderate, well-qualified \njudicial nominees. It is time for the obstruction to end and for the \nSenate to complete action on these nominees so that they may serve the \nAmerican people without further delay. Delay for delay's sake is wrong \nand should end.\n  Senate Republicans have engaged in unprecedented obstruction and a \ncontorted rewriting of the ``Thurmond Rule'' in their refusal to \nproceed on consensus nominees. Whatever justification Senate \nRepublicans contended they had by resort to their misapplication of the \nThurmond Rule to stall judicial nominations before the election is \ngone. The American people have voted and chosen to reelect President \nObama. It is time for the Senate to vote.\n  From 1980 until this year, when a lame duck session followed a \npresidential election, every single judicial nominee reported with \nbipartisan Judiciary Committee support has been confirmed. According to \nthe nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, no consensus nominee \nreported prior to the August recess has ever been denied a vote. That \nis something Senate Democrats have not done in any lame duck session, \nwhether after a presidential or midterm election.\n  Senate Democrats allowed votes on 20 of President George W. Bush's \njudicial nominees, including one very controversial circuit court \nnominee, in the lame duck session after the elections in 2002. I \nremember, I was the chairman of the Judiciary Committee who moved\n\n[[Page S7208]]\n\nforward with those votes. The Senate proceeded to confirm judicial \nnominees in lame duck sessions after the elections in 2004 and 2006, \nand proceeded to confirm 19 judicial nominees in the lame duck session \nafter the elections in 2010, as well. The reason that I am not listing \nconfirmations for the lame duck session at the end of 2008 is because \nthat year we had proceeded to confirm the last 10 judicial nominees \napproved by the Judiciary Committee before the election recess in \nSeptember.\n  Republicans can no longer claim the ``Thurmond Rule'' is the reason \nthey are holding up nominations since the American people reelected \nPresident Obama. Having said in September that they objected to \nproceeding because of the impending election, Senate Republicans cannot \nnow say that their insistence on delay has made it too late in the year \nto proceed with confirmations. That is wrong and it results in denying \nAmericans the judges they need to administer justice around the \ncountry.\n  I implore Senators to put their partisanship aside and work with the \nPresident on behalf of the American people. That is what the American \npeople voted for in the last election. Delaying confirmation votes on \nnominees for the sole purpose of delay is precisely what the American \npeople repudiated when they cast their ballots. Further delays on the \n19 nominees before us do not benefit the American people.\n  I am encouraged that several Republican Senators have recognized \nthis, and have said that they want votes on their home State nominees. \nThe Republican Senators from Oklahoma and Maine, and Senator Toomey \nfrom Pennsylvania have all advocated for up or down votes on nominees \nduring this lame duck session, and they are right to do so. They know \nthat filling those judicial vacancies in their States is important.\n  A judge in Florida has written that persistent vacancies ``jeopardize \nour Court's ability to deliver the quality of justice that the citizens \nof Florida deserve and will inhibit our citizens' access to justice.'' \nSadly, Senate Republicans' tactics of delay and obstruction has \nperpetuated the high level of judicial vacancies around the country. \nContinuing these tactics hurt the Federal courts and the American \npeople they are intended to serve. This is a problem that has a \ncommonsense solution: Let the Senate vote on consensus nominees that \nhave been stalled.\n  With the number of judicial vacancies now at 83, and with all pending \nnominees having waited at least 4 months for a vote, it is past time \nfor Senate Republicans to abandon these tactics. This obstruction is \nnot good for the country. How does preventing a vote on Patty Shwartz \nbenefit the people of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware? How does \npreventing a vote on Richard Taranto benefit Americans who seek to have \ntheir claims resolved by the Federal Circuit? How does preventing a \nvote on William Kayatta benefit the people of Maine, Massachusetts, New \nHampshire, Rhode Island, and Puerto Rico? How does preventing a vote on \nRobert Bacharach benefit the people of Oklahoma, Colorado, Kansas, New \nMexico, Utah, and Wyoming? How does preventing a vote on Michael Shea \nbenefit the people of Connecticut? How does preventing a vote on John \nDowdell benefit the people of Oklahoma? How does preventing a vote on \nPaul Grimm benefit the people of Maryland? How does preventing votes on \nMark Walker and Brian Davis benefit the people of Florida? How does \npreventing a vote on Terrence Berg benefit the people of Michigan? How \ndoes preventing votes on Jesus Bernal, Fernando Olguin, William Orrick, \nand Jon Tigar benefit the people of California? How does preventing \nvotes on Lorna Schofield and Frank Geraci benefit the people of New \nYork? How does preventing votes on Matthew Brann and Malachy Mannion \nbenefit the people of Pennsylvania? How does preventing a vote on \nThomas Durkin benefit the people of Illinois? How does preventing votes \non these nominees help the American people receive speedy justice?\n  If we can just have up or down votes on these 19 nominees, we can \nfill almost one-quarter of our Nation's judicial vacancies, and almost \none-third of all judicial emergency vacancies. Most importantly, we can \nmake it easier for hardworking Americans to have access to justice.\n  President Obama has worked with home State Senators and all of these \nnominees have the support of their home State Senators. Seven of them \nare supported by Republican home State Senators. Seventeen of these \nnominees received bipartisan support on the Judiciary Committee.\n  When Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush were \nPresident, Senate Democrats cleared the calendar of all but the most \ncontroversial and extreme ideological judicial nominations. The Senate \nneeds to be allowed to vote on President Obama's judicial nominees now \nso that our Federal courts are better able to function and fulfill the \nfundamental guarantee of providing access to justice. Americans are \nrightfully proud of our legal system and its promise of access to \njustice and speedy trials. This promise is embedded in our \nConstitution. When overburdened courts make it hard to keep this \npromise, the Senate should work in a bipartisan manner to help.\n  I have asked, now that the American people have reelected President \nObama, for Senate Republicans to work with us to fill these \nlongstanding judicial vacancies. The American people deserve no less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/29/senate-section/article/S7208-1", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7208]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          WORLD AIDS DAY 2012\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, Saturday we mark another World \nAIDS Day dedicated to showing our support of people living with HIV. In \nthe 24 years since the first such day, we have seen great progress in \nthe fight against the spread of this disease.\n  But there is still much more that needs to be done, not the least of \nwhich includes increasing public awareness. So this World AIDS Day, \nespecially in memory of those who have died from this disease, let us \nrecommit to ending this epidemic once and for all.\n  My State of Florida has been hit particularly hard by this epidemic: \nover 100,000 people are living with HIV/AIDS. And for too long, Florida \nhad a long waiting list of low income residents waiting for assistance \nto afford the high cost of life saving medications. At times, this list \ngrew to over 4,000 Floridians.\n  Thankfully, we have made great progress over the past year through \nincreased State and Federal investment--and, Florida's wait list is now \ndown to 56 individuals. But no one should have to forgo life saving \ndrugs because they can't afford them.\n  In the days ahead when Congress is considering ways to tighten our \nbelt, I would urge my colleagues to avoid blindly slashing these life \nsaving programs.\n  We also must remain committed to funding the goals of President \nBarack Obama's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief globally. Among the goals \nis to provide care for the more than 12 million people with HIV around \nthe world, including some 5 million orphans and children.\n  Mr. President, this is not, and should not be partisan issue for \nlawmakers. As former President George W. Bush noted in 2008, it's a \nquestion of our moral interest.\n  ``We believe in the timeless truth,'' the president said, ``to whom \nmuch is given, much is required.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/29/senate-section/article/S7208-2", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7208-S7209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING TINKHAM VEALE II\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life of Tinkham \n``Tink'' Veale II. Mr. Veale was a successful entrepreneur and \nphilanthropist who contributed greatly to the success of numerous \nbusinesses and community institutions throughout northeast Ohio and \nbeyond during his long life. The impact and proud legacy of his \nbusiness expertise and generosity will be realized for many years to \ncome.\n  Mr. Veale was born in 1914 in Topeka, KS and moved to the Cleveland \narea as a child when his father joined the Eaton Corporation. He \nattended Heights High School and Case Institute of Technology, \ngraduating with a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering. Mr. \nVeale worked for several companies including General Motors. In 1941 he \nmarried Harriett Ernst, of the Ernst and Young accounting family, who \npassed away in 1998. The couple had three children, seven grandchildren \nand eight great grandchildren.\n  In the 1960s, Veale and his associates formed Alco Standard \nCorporation.\n\n[[Page S7209]]\n\nVeale developed the philosophy and strategy he referred to as \n``corporate partnership,'' through which his company acquired and \nfinanced small businesses while keeping their original management \nstructures in place. His success grew from buying small companies and \nhelping them to succeed through keeping their management in place while \ncontributing with capital and strategic direction. Over the years, the \ncompany operated many businesses representing diverse industries \nincluding manufacturing, mining, and banking, as well as operating \noffice equipment and paper distribution businesses. Veale served as \nAlco's president and chairman until 1971 and stayed on as chairman \nuntil 1986. By 1987, the company had 175 businesses with 16,000 \nemployees in the United States and Europe.\n  Mr. Veale had a unique spirit and love of life. Over the years he was \nactive in a variety of community organizations, served as a councilman \nin Gates Mills, OH, and was known for raising thoroughbred horses. \nPerhaps most significant, was his generous philanthropy which continues \nto benefit communities, students and institutions in Ohio. He was a \nnotable supporter of his alma mater, Case Western Reserve University, \nwhere the most recent pledge of $20 million from The Veale Foundation \nis being utilized for construction of a new university center, which \nwill be named in his honor.\n  Tink Veale was a role model and a source of inspiration to us all. He \nwill be greatly missed, and his extraordinary legacy and giving spirit \nwill not be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/29/senate-section/article/S7209-1", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n         SCONTSAS FINE JEWELRY AND HOME DECOR 100TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and \ncongratulate Scontsas Fine Jewelry and Home Decor, a small business in \nmy hometown of Nashua, NH, as it celebrates its 100th year in business.\n  Scontsas, which began as a shoe shining and repair business and hat \nblocking service, is now a third generation, family owned small \nbusiness that specializes in fine jewelry and home gifts and \ndecoration. A century ago, a Greek immigrant named George J. Scontsas \nfirst opened his doors at 173 Main Street in Nashua, and ever since, \nhis family's business has remained a permanent fixture at this same \ndowntown location. The Scontsas legacy, by any measure, is a testament \nto the entrepreneurial spirit that makes America great.\n  In an effort to expand his customer base, George began stocking \ngreeting cards, and by the mid-1940's, his store became the first \nHallmark store in Nashua. The Scontsas family business continued to \nexpand by selling children's toys, books, yarn, and gifts.\n  In 1974, George's son Peter, and his wife Joan, purchased deMontigny \nJewelers in the adjacent building. Since Peter Scontsas' passing in \n1995, his son Phillip and daughter-in-law Amalia have served as the \nprincipal owners of the business. Together, the Scontsas family \ndeveloped a new department within the family store, featuring home and \ngarden decor.\n  Since its inception, Scontsas has focused not only on growing bigger, \nbut also on growing better. The reasons for the Scontsas family's \nsuccess are many. Chief among them are the family's commitment to \nbuilding enduring relationships with their customers and their strong \ncommunity involvement. Scontsas Fine Jewelry and Home Decor prides \nitself on treating every customer like a member of the family.\n  In typical fashion, the Scontsas family decided to celebrate their \nbusiness' 100th birthday by giving back to the Nashua community in a \nseries of events this year. The year long celebration showcased their \nstrong roots in the community while promoting their products. I had the \npleasure of attending the city of Nashua's Annual Holiday Stroll this \npast weekend, where the Scontsas family unveiled their limited edition \n100 Year Holiday ornament for their loyal customers.\n  As Nashua helps the Scontsas' celebrate a century of family, \nbusiness, and community, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing \nScontsas Fine Jewelry and Home Decor's 100th anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/29/senate-section/article/S7209-2", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING WAYNE BURKE\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize a true \nNevadan and friend, Wayne Burke, who has been honored by the Nevada \nIndian Commission as American Indian Community Leader of the Year. As \ntribal chairman for the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe, Wayne led the tribal \ncouncil through many successes for the betterment of Nevada. Wayne's \nuntimely passing is a great loss, but his legacy of community and \neconomic development in the Silver State will never be forgotten.\n  In addition to serving the State of Nevada, Wayne bravely served our \nNation in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1993 until his honorable discharge \nin 1997. As a U.S. Marine Corps veteran, Wayne understood the \nimportance of supporting those who defend our Nation. He was a member \nof Numu Tookwasu--Pyramid Lake Veterans and Warriors Association--and a \nstaunch advocate for Native American veteran affairs. His vision helped \nlaunch Nevada's first annual American Indian Veteran Summit this year, \nwhich invited members of the 27 tribes of Nevada to learn about access \nto veteran benefits and healthcare. His legacy will help raise \nawareness and resources for Native American veterans for years to come.\n  As tribal chairman, Wayne promoted an award winning Pyramid Lake \neconomic development and tourism plan. His advocacy for the recovery \nand restoration of the Pyramid Lake fishery helped to secure over 1,000 \nacres of water, the most in any one-month period. Under his leadership, \nthe Pyramid Lake Tribe has enjoyed a record number of visitors to \nPyramid Lake and, subsequently, numerous tourism awards. In August \n2012, Wayne became the first Native American leader to serve on the \nNevada Commission on Tourism.\n  The citizens of the Silver State were privileged that such a \npassionate and dedicated leader called Nevada home. My thoughts and \nprayers go out to his wife, Leticia; and children, Alex, Christian, and \nSoleil. Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the life \nof a devoted Nevadan and honoring his esteemed accomplishments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/29/senate-section/article/S7209-3", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO STEVE RANSON\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate Steve \nRanson on his 25 years with the Lahontan Valley News. Nevadans are \nfortunate to read his reporting every day and to have a dedicated voice \nserving the community. I applaud Steve's hard work and dedication to \nour Nation's brave men and women that serve in our Armed Services and \nthe field of journalism.\n  Steve joined the staff in 1986 as a part-time sports writer and \neditor. Today, he has grown to be one of Nevada's leading reporters. \nSteve's journalism, reporting, and newsroom leadership has earned him \ncountless awards including Outstanding Journalist from the Nevada Press \nAssociation. His nomination for this award also reflects his extensive \noverseas travel to cover the U.S. Navy and Nevada Army National Guard \nin Southwest Asia and Afghanistan. His series of stories covering the \nwar efforts earned him first place awards for community service and for \nbest explanatory journalism from the Nevada Press Association.\n  As a lieutenant colonel who retired in 2009 after serving in the \nNational Guard and U.S. Reserve, understanding the role of the military \ncame easily for Steve. During his 28 years of service, Steve \nparticipated in two tours to the Republic of Korea and Panama. I would \nlike to extend my gratitude to Steve for his service to this great \nNation and State. I am both humbled and honored by the sacrifices made \nby the brave men and women who have served our country.\n  Steve's 25 years of service with the Lahontan Valley News is a true \ntestament to his character. I wish him all the best in his future \nendeavors and look forward to reading more of his great work.

Mr. President, Today I wish to pay tribute to my \nprofessor and my\n\n[[Page S7210]]\n\nfriend Richard Wilkins who passed away on Monday. Richard was truly a \nrenaissance man, a law professor turned international advocate who also \nenjoyed unique local notoriety for his 27 consecutive performances as \nEbenezer Scrooge in the Hale Center Theater's annual production of A \nChristmas Carol.\n  In the canon of literary classics, Charles Dicken's Scrooge is a \nbeloved but unlikely hero, a selfish miser turned community benefactor. \nWilkins embraced the dynamic nature of Scrooge's transformation and saw \nthe role as an opportunity to convey much deeper lessons regarding the \nvalues of family and personal improvement. The Hale Center opened in \n1985 and cast then 32-year-old Richard as Scrooge, certainly unaware \nthat they had found their star for the next 27 consecutive seasons.\n  In 2005, Her Highness Sheikha Moza bint Nasser, the queen of Qatar \nasked him to move to Qatar to lead an institute for family studies. He \nwould not agree until she assured him he would be able to return to the \nHale Center every Christmas season to take up his top hat and bathrobe \nto reprise his role as Scrooge. Richard loved delivering Scrooge's \nfamous line ``I will honor Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it \nall the year. I will live in the past, the present, and the future.'' \nThose close to Richard undoubtedly agree that he took these words to \nheart, carrying the spirit of Christmas into all other aspects of his \nlife.\n  Richard graduated from my alma mater Brigham Young University Law \nSchool in 1979. He served as an assistant to my father, Solicitor \nGeneral Rex Lee and argued several cases before the United States \nSupreme Court. Just 5 years after his graduation from BYU Law School he \nreturned to teach constitutional law and civil procedure. He was a \ngifted public speaker, well known for his engaging lectures in the \nclassroom and scholarly insights on the law. He had a unique \nintelligence that propelled him to prominence in the legal world and \nestablished him as a powerful voice the international community.\n  Richards's greatest contribution to the world came as an \ninternational advocate for family values. His first exposure to the \nfamily values movement came in an academic effort to change the \nlanguage the United Nations used to portray issues relating to the \nfamily. After engaging with international leaders on critical family \nvalues issues his academic curiosity turned into a personal mission. He \ntraveled around the world presenting papers on the importance of \ntraditional marriage, the need to protect children and the sanctity of \nlife and other family centered topics. He served as the managing \ndirector of the Doha International Institute for Family Studies and \nDevelopment for the nation of Qatar and founded the World Family Policy \nCenter at BYU. His leadership as chairman of the Defend Marriage \nCoalition placed him at the forefront of Utah's debate over traditional \nmarriage. Richard's fiery passion for causes related to traditional \nfamily values was matched by his warmth and love for those around him. \nHe could disagree with individuals and groups but was never \ndisagreeable.\n  Richard Wilkins' life serves as an illustration of the renowned \nbiblical charge ``Let your light so shine before men, that they may see \nyour good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.'' He was a \nman blessed with tremendous talents and he used those talents to bless \nall those with whom he came in contact, in his own community and around \nthe world. Richard's global vision and reach brought the power of \nfamily values to the forefront of international discourse, particularly \nin developing nations striving to solidify a cultural identity. Sharon \nand I would like to express our deepest condolences to Richard's wife \nMelany, their four children Brooke, Brinton, Claire and Rex and their \neight grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/29/senate-section/article/S7210-1", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7210]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:22 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2338.

    \n\n[Pages S7219-S7220]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. UDALL of Colorado (for himself, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Bennet, and \n        Mr. Barrasso):\n  S. 3650. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nfacilitate water leasing and water transfers to promote conservation \nand efficiency; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, today I am introducing \nbipartisan legislation that will improve the viability of agriculture \nand rural communities in western States like Colorado. This legislation \nwill make it easier for mutual ditch and irrigation companies, which \nare an integral part of agriculture in arid regions where you often \nhave to transport irrigation water over long distances, to remain \nprofitable.\n  I thank my colleagues Senators Crapo, Bennet and Barrasso for joining \nme in this effort.\n  Mutual ditch and irrigation companies are primarily associations of \nfarmers who band together to construct and operate water delivery and \nstorage systems for use on semi-arid farmland. For 150 years, mutual \nditch and irrigation companies have installed and maintained this kind \nof infrastructure to convey water to irrigated lands in the West.\n  These companies can qualify for tax-exempt status if at least 85 \npercent of their income comes from their member assessments. The 85-\npercent rule is meant to ensure that the members of tax-exempt \ncooperatives are not able to enrich themselves by making investments \nunrelated to their charitable purpose.\n  Over time, however, the cost to maintain and operate aging water \ninfrastructure has made it impossible for many mutual ditch and \nirrigation companies to operate solely on member income. If member \nassessments were large enough to cover the true cost of operations, it \nwould be cost prohibitive for most farmers to use the water to irrigate \ncrops, leading to a loss of irrigated farmland.\n  To sustain irrigated farmland, ditch and irrigation companies \nsupplement the cost of operations with non-member income from, for \nexample, recreational leases, crossing fees, storage rights and the \nexchange of water rights. This is a good thing, but this supplemental \nincome can jeopardize the company's tax-exempt status.\n  My legislation would exempt certain sources of income from the 85-\npercent member income test for mutual ditch and irrigation companies. \nHowever, to be excluded, the revenue from these sources must be used \nfor the tax-exempt purposes of the company. My legislation specifically \nrequires non-member income to be used for operations or maintenance of \nthe mutual ditch or irrigation company in order to be exempted from the \n85-percent test.\n  By excluding these revenue streams, we can support local agriculture \nand help ditch and irrigation companies stay in business, while at the \nsame time providing for more efficient use of precious water resources. \nFurther, by requiring that the proceeds be used exclusively for \noperations and maintenance of the ditch or irrigation company, we will \nensure that this income is reinvested in water infrastructure, helping \nto create and preserve rural jobs and our agricultural heritage.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record. \n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3650\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Ditch and Irrigation Company \n     Tax Reform Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FACILITATE WATER LEASING AND WATER TRANSFERS TO \n                   PROMOTE CONSERVATION AND EFFICIENCY.\n\n       (a) In General.--Paragraph (12) of section 501(c) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by adding at the end \n     the following new subparagraph:\n       ``(I) Treatment of mutual ditch or irrigation companies.--\n       ``(i) In general.--In the case of a mutual ditch or \n     irrigation company or like organization, subparagraph (A) \n     shall be applied without taking into account any income \n     received or accrued--\n\n       ``(I) from the sale, lease, or exchange of fee or other \n     interests in real property, including interests in water,\n\n[[Page S7220]]\n\n       ``(II) from the sale or exchange of stock in a mutual ditch \n     or irrigation company or like organization or contract rights \n     for the delivery or use of water, or\n       ``(III) from the investment of proceeds from sales, leases, \n     or exchanges under subclauses (I) and (II),\n\n     except that any income received under subclause (I), (II), or \n     (III) which is distributed or expended for expenses other \n     than operations and maintenance of the mutual ditch or \n     irrigation company or like organization shall be treated as \n     non-member income in the year in which it is distributed or \n     expended. For purposes of the preceding sentence, expenses \n     other than operations and maintenance include expenses for \n     the construction of conveyances designed to deliver water \n     outside of the mutual ditch or irrigation company or like \n     organization system.\n       ``(ii) Treatment of organizational governance.--In the case \n     of a mutual ditch or irrigation company or like organization, \n     where State law provides that such a company or organization \n     may be organized in a manner that permits voting on a basis \n     which is pro-rata to share ownership on corporate governance \n     matters, subparagraph (A) shall be applied without taking \n     into account whether its member shareholders have one vote on \n     corporate governance matters per share held in the \n     corporation. Nothing in this clause shall be construed to \n     create any inference about the requirements of this \n     subsection for companies or organizations not included in \n     this clause.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/29/senate-section/article/S7220-1", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7220]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 603--DESIGNATING THE WEEK OF NOVEMBER 26 THROUGH \n    NOVEMBER 30, 2012, AS NATIONAL NURSE-MANAGED HEALTH CLINIC WEEK\n\n  Mr. INOUYE (for himself and Mr. Alexander) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 603\n\n       Whereas nurse-managed health clinics are nonprofit \n     community-based health care sites that offer primary care and \n     wellness services based on the nursing model;\n       Whereas the nursing model emphasizes the protection, \n     promotion, and optimization of health, the prevention of \n     illness, the alleviation of suffering, and the diagnosis and \n     treatment of illness;\n       Whereas nurse-managed health clinics are led by advanced \n     practice nurses and staffed by an interdisciplinary team of \n     highly qualified health care professionals;\n       Whereas nurse-managed health clinics offer a broad scope of \n     services, including treatment for acute and chronic \n     illnesses, routine physical exams, immunizations for adults \n     and children, disease screenings, health education, prenatal \n     care, dental care, and drug and alcohol treatment;\n       Whereas, as of June 2011, more than 200 nurse-managed \n     health clinics provided care across the United States and \n     recorded more than 2,000,000 client encounters annually;\n       Whereas nurse-managed health clinics serve a unique dual \n     role as both health care safety net access points and health \n     workforce development sites, given that the majority of \n     nurse-managed health clinics are affiliated with schools of \n     nursing and serve as clinical education sites for students \n     entering the health profession;\n       Whereas nurse-managed health clinics strengthen the health \n     care safety net by expanding access to primary care and \n     chronic disease management services for vulnerable and \n     medically underserved populations in diverse rural, urban, \n     and suburban communities;\n       Whereas research has shown that nurse-managed health \n     clinics experience high patient retention and patient \n     satisfaction rates, and nurse-managed health clinic patients \n     experience higher rates of generic medication fills and lower \n     hospitalization rates when compared to similar safety net \n     providers;\n       Whereas the 2011 report of the Institute of Medicine on the \n     future of nursing highlights the work nurse-managed health \n     clinics are doing to reduce health disparities by bringing \n     evidence-based care to individuals who may not otherwise \n     receive needed services; and\n       Whereas nurse-managed health clinics offering both primary \n     care and wellness services provide quality care in a cost-\n     effective manner: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week of November 26 through November 30, \n     2012, as ``National Nurse-Managed Health Clinic Week'';\n       (2) supports the ideals and goals of National Nurse-Managed \n     Health Clinic Week; and\n       (3) encourages the expansion of nurse-managed health \n     clinics so that nurse-managed health clinics may continue to \n     serve as health care workforce development sites for the next \n     generation of primary care providers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/29/senate-section/article/S7220-2", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7220]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 604--RELATIVE TO THE DEATH OF THE HONORABLE WARREN B. \n  RUDMAN, FORMER UNITED STATES SENATOR FOR THE STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN (for herself, Ms. Ayotte, Mr. Reid of Nevada, Mr. \nMcConnell, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Barrasso, Mr. Baucus, Mr. \nBegich, Mr. Bennet, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Blunt, Mr. \nBoozman, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Brown of Massachusetts, Mr. Brown of Ohio, Mr. \nBurr, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Carper, Mr. Casey, Mr. Chambliss, \nMr. Coats, Mr. Coburn, Mr. Cochran, Ms. Collins, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Coons, \nMr. Corker, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Crapo, Mr. DeMint, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Enzi, \nMrs. Feinstein, Mr. Franken, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Graham, Mr. Grassley, \nMrs. Hagan, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Heller, Mr. Hoeven, Mrs. \nHutchison, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Johanns, Mr. \nJohnson of Wisconsin, Mr. Johnson of South Dakota, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Kirk, \nMs. Klobuchar, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Kyl, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. \nLeahy, Mr. Lee, Mr. Levin, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Manchin, Mr. \nMcCain, Mrs. McCaskill, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Merkley, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. \nMoran, Ms. Murkowski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Nelson \nof Florida, Mr. Paul, Mr. Portman, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Reed of Rhode Island, \nMr. Risch, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Rubio, Mr. Sanders, Mr. \nSchumer, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Shelby, Ms. Snowe, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Tester, \nMr. Thune, Mr. Toomey, Mr. Udall of Colorado, Mr. Udall of New Mexico, \nMr. Vitter, Mr. Warner, Mr. Webb, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Wicker, and Mr. \nWyden) submitted the following resolution;

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON OVERSIGHT OF THE NUCLEAR \n                   SECURITY ENTERPRISE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In 2000, the National Nuclear Security Administration \n     was established as an independent entity within the \n     Department of Energy to manage and secure the nuclear weapons \n     stockpile of the United States and to manage nuclear \n     nonproliferation and naval reactor programs.\n       (2) Serious security and health incidents continue to occur \n     at sites of the National Nuclear Security Administration.\n       (3) In September 2012, an official of the Government \n     Accountability Office testified to Congress that lax \n     laboratory attitudes toward safety procedures, laboratory \n     inadequacies in identifying and addressing safety problems \n     with appropriate corrective actions, and inadequate oversight \n     by site offices of the National Nuclear Security \n     Administration were responsible for nearly 100 safety \n     incidents since 2000.\n       (4) On July 28, 2012, three unarmed individuals compromised \n     security at the Y-12 National Security Complex in Oak Ridge, \n     Tennessee, and according to the Government Accountability \n     Office, ``gained access to the protected security area \n     directly adjacent to one of the nation's most critically \n     important nuclear weapons-related facilities''.\n       (5) In June 2006, hackers attacked an unclassified computer \n     system at the National Nuclear Security Administration's \n     Service Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and gained access \n     to a file containing the names and social security numbers of \n     more than 1,500 employees of the National Nuclear Security \n     Administration.\n       (6) As early as February 2005, the Inspector General of the \n     Department of Energy identified problems with the retrieval \n     of badges from terminated employees at Los Alamos National \n     Laboratory and other sites of the National Nuclear Security \n     Administration.\n       (7) In 2004, a pattern of safety and security incidents \n     that occurred over the course of a year prompted the stand-\n     down of Los Alamos National Laboratory.\n       (8) The National Nuclear Security Administration, \n     independent of the safety and security reform efforts of the \n     Department of Energy, has launched an overhaul of its \n     contracting oversight, placing an emphasis on contractor \n     self-policing through an untested ``contractor assurance'' \n     approach.\n       (9) The Government Accountability Office has given the \n     contractor administration and project management capabilities \n     of the National Nuclear Security Administration a ``high \n     risk'' designation and found there to be insufficient \n     qualified Federal acquisition professionals to ``plan, \n     direct, and oversee project execution''.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) there is a need for strong, independent oversight of \n     the United States nuclear security enterprise;\n       (2) any attempt to reform oversight of the nuclear security \n     enterprise that transfers oversight from the Department of \n     Energy to the National Nuclear Security Administration, \n     reduces protections for worker health and safety at \n     facilities of the National Nuclear Security Administration to \n     levels below the standards of the Department of Energy, or \n     transfers construction appropriations for the nuclear \n     security enterprise from the Department of Energy \n     appropriation account to the military construction \n     appropriation account, should be carefully evaluated;\n       (3) the Office of Health, Safety, and Security of the \n     Department of Energy, which reports to the Secretary of \n     Energy but is also accountable for routinely reporting to \n     Congress on the performance with respect to safety and \n     security of the Department, including the National Nuclear \n     Security Administration, and the role of that Office in \n     overseeing safety and security at the National Nuclear \n     Security Administration, should not be diminished;\n       (4) any future modifications to the management or structure \n     of the nuclear security enterprise should be done in a way \n     that maintains or increases oversight of critical \n     construction, security, and acquisition capabilities;\n       (5) to the extent possible, oversight of programs of the \n     National Nuclear Security Administration by the Department of \n     Defense should increase to ensure current and future \n     warfighting requirements are met; and\n       (6) the Nuclear Weapons Council should provide proper \n     oversight in the execution of its responsibilities under \n     section 179 of title 10, United States Code.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3192.

PLAN FOR PROMOTING THE SECURITY OF AFGHAN WOMEN \n                   AND GIRLS DURING THE SECURITY TRANSITION \n                   PROCESS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) According to the Department of Defense's April 2012 \n     Report on Progress Toward Security and Stability in \n     Afghanistan:\n       (A) ``U.S. and coalition forces will continue to degrade \n     the Taliban-led insurgency in order to provide time and space \n     to increase the capacity of the Afghan National Security \n     Forces and the Afghan Government so they can assume full \n     responsibility for Afghanistan's security by the end of \n     2014.''\n       (B) ``Transition to Afghan security lead began in July 2011 \n     and transition to full Afghan security responsibility will be \n     complete country-wide by the end of 2014.''\n       (C) ``The security of the Afghan people and the stability \n     of the government are used to judge provincial readiness to \n     move to each successive stage of transition implementation.''\n       (D) For each area designated for transition, a transition \n     implementation plan is developed by the Government of \n     Afghanistan, NATO, and ISAF and approved by the Joint Afghan-\n     NATO Inteqal Board (JANIB). JANIB is also responsible for \n     recommending areas to enter and exit the transition process.\n       (2) According to a 2002 study on Women, Peace and Security \n     submitted by the Secretary-General of the United Nations \n     pursuant to Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), ``the \n     suspension of or restriction on women's enjoyment of their \n     human rights'' can act as an early-warning indicator of \n     impending or renewed conflict. In Afghanistan, restrictions \n     on women's mobility and rights can signal the presence of \n     extremist or insurgent elements in a community.\n       (3) The security of Afghan women and girls in areas \n     undergoing security transitions will be an important gauge of \n     the transition strategy's success. Indicators by which to \n     measure women's security include the mobility of women and \n     girls, the participation of women in local government bodies, \n     the rate of school attendance for girls, women's access to \n     government services, and the prevalence of violence against \n     women.\n       (4) Maintaining and improving physical security for Afghan \n     women and girls throughout the country is critical in order \n     for women and girls to take advantage of opportunities in \n     education, commerce, politics, and other areas of public \n     life, which in turn is essential for the future stability and \n     prosperity of Afghanistan.\n       (5) Women who serve as public officials at all levels of \n     the Government of Afghanistan face serious threats to their \n     personal security and that of their families. Many female \n     officials have been the victims of violent crimes, but they \n     are generally not afforded official protection by the \n     Government of Afghanistan or security forces.\n       (6) Protecting the security and human rights of Afghan \n     women and girls requires the involvement of Afghan men and \n     boys through education about the important benefits of \n     women's full participation in social, economic, and political \n     life. Male officials and security personnel can play a \n     particularly important role in supporting and protecting \n     women and girls.\n       (7) The Chicago Summit Declaration issued by NATO in May \n     2012 states: ``As the Afghan National Police further develop \n     and professionalize, they will evolve towards a sustainable, \n     credible, and accountable civilian law enforcement force that \n     will shoulder the main responsibility for domestic security. \n     This force should be capable of providing policing services \n     to the Afghan population as part of the broader Afghan rule \n     of law system.''\n       (8) Women face significant barriers to full participation \n     in the ANA and ANP, including a discriminatory or hostile \n     work environment and the lack of separate facilities designed \n     for female personnel.\n       (9) As of September 2012, female recruitment and retention \n     rates for the Afghan National Security Forces are far below \n     published targets, as follows:\n       (A) Approximately 1,700 women serve in the Afghan National \n     Security Forces, or less than half of one percent of the \n     total force.\n       (B) In 2010, President Hamid Karzai announced plans to \n     recruit and train 5,000 women in the Afghan National Police, \n     or approximately 3 percent of the force, by 2014. Currently, \n     there are approximately 1,370 women in the ANP, or 0.87 \n     percent of the police force.\n       (C) Approximately 350 women currently serve in the Afghan \n     National Army, representing only 0.17 percent of the force. \n     The Government of Afghanistan has said that its goal is to \n     achieve a force that is 10 percent female. As of May 2012, \n     approximately 3 percent of new ANA recruits were women.\n       (10) Male security personnel often do not respond to \n     threats or incidences of violence against women, particularly \n     at the local level. They largely lack the training and \n     understanding needed to respond appropriately and effectively \n     to situations involving women. According to the Department of \n     Defense's April 2012 Report on Progress Toward Security and \n     Stability in Afghanistan:\n       (A) The Afghan Ministry of Defense ``lacks the combination \n     of policies, procedures, and execution to promote opportunity \n     and fair and respectful treatment of women in the force''.\n       (B) The Afghan Ministry of Interior ``faces significant \n     challenges in fully integrating and protecting women in the \n     ANP workforce, especially among operational units at the \n     provincial and district levels''.\n       (C) In the Afghan National Police, ``Many Provincial \n     Headquarters Commanders do not accept policewomen, as they \n     prefer male candidates and lack adequate facilities to \n     support females.''\n       (D) ``While women are greatly needed to support police \n     operations, a combination of cultural impediments, weak \n     recruitment, and uneven application of policies hinder \n     significant progress.''\n       (E) ``Although stronger documentation, implementation, and \n     enforcement of policies, procedures, and guidance to better \n     integrate women will help, time will be needed to change the \n     cultural mores that form the basis of many of the current \n     impediments.''\n       (11) The United States, the North American Treaty \n     Organization, and United States coalition partners have made \n     firm commitments to support the human rights of the women and \n     girls of Afghanistan, as evidenced by the following actions:\n       (A) According to the United States National Action Plan on \n     Women, Peace and Security, ``integrating women and gender \n     considerations into peace-building processes helps promote \n     democratic governance and long-term stability,'' which are \n     key United States strategic goals in Afghanistan.\n       (B) The National Action Plan also states that ``the \n     engagement and protection of women as agents of peace and \n     stability will be central to United States efforts to promote \n     security, prevent, respond to, and resolve conflict, and \n     rebuild societies.'' This policy applies to United States \n     Government efforts in Afghanistan, where addressing the \n     security vulnerabilities of Afghan women and girls during the \n     period of security transition is an essential step toward \n     long-term stability.\n\n[[Page S7225]]\n\n       (C) The Chicago Summit Declaration issued by NATO in May \n     2012 states: ``We emphasize the importance of full \n     participation of all Afghan women in the reconstruction, \n     political, peace and reconciliation processes in Afghanistan \n     and the need to respect the institutional arrangements \n     protecting their rights. We remain committed to the \n     implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution \n     (UNSCR) 1325 on women, peace and security. We recognize also \n     the need for the protection of children from the damaging \n     effects of armed conflict as required in relevant UNSCRs.''\n       (12) The Strategic Partnership Agreement signed between the \n     United States and Afghanistan by President Obama and \n     President Karzai in June 2012 states, ``Consistent with its \n     Constitution and international obligations, Afghanistan shall \n     ensure and advance the essential role of women in society, so \n     that they may fully enjoy their economic, social, political, \n     civil and cultural rights.''\n       (b) Plan to Promote Security of Afghan Women.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 120 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense, in \n     concurrence with the Secretary of State, shall submit to the \n     appropriate congressional committees a plan to promote the \n     security of Afghan women during the security transition \n     process.\n       (2) Elements.--The plan required under paragraph (1) shall \n     include the following elements:\n       (A) A plan to monitor and respond to changes in women's \n     security conditions in areas undergoing transition, including \n     the following actions:\n       (i) Seeking to designate a Civilian Impact Advisor on the \n     Joint Afghan-NATO Inteqal Board (JANIB) to assess the impact \n     of transition on male and female civilians and ensure that \n     efforts to protect women's rights and security are included \n     in each area's transition implementation plan.\n       (ii) Reviewing existing indicators against which sex-\n     disaggregated data is collected and, if necessary, developing \n     additional indicators, to ensure the availability of data \n     that can be used to measure women's security, such as--\n\n       (I) the mobility of women and girls;\n       (II) the participation of women in local government bodies;\n       (III) the rate of school attendance for girls;\n       (IV) women's access to government services; and\n       (V) the prevalence of violence against women; and \n     incorporating those indicators into ongoing efforts to assess \n     overall security conditions during the transition period.\n\n       (iii) Integrating assessments of women's security into \n     current procedures used to determine an area's readiness to \n     proceed through the transition process.\n       (iv) Working with Afghan partners, coalition partners, and \n     relevant United States Government departments and agencies to \n     take concrete action to support women's rights and security \n     in cases of deterioration in women's security conditions \n     during the transition period.\n       (B) A plan to increase gender awareness and responsiveness \n     among Afghan National Army and Afghan National Police \n     personnel, including the following actions:\n       (i) Working with Afghan and coalition partners to utilize \n     training curricula and programming that addresses the human \n     rights of women and girls, appropriate responses to threats \n     against women and girls, and appropriate behavior toward \n     female colleagues and members of the community; assessing the \n     quality and consistency of this training across regional \n     commands; and assessing the impact of this training on \n     trainee behavior.\n       (ii) Working with national and local ANA and ANP leaders to \n     develop and utilize enforcement and accountability mechanisms \n     for ANA and ANP personnel who violate codes of conduct \n     related to the human rights of women and girls.\n       (iii) Working with Afghan and coalition partners to \n     implement the above tools and develop uniform methods and \n     standards for training and enforcement among coalition \n     partners and across regions.\n       (C) A plan to increase the number of female members of the \n     ANA and ANP, including the following actions:\n       (i) Providing, through consultation with Afghan partners, \n     realistic and achievable objectives for the recruitment and \n     retention of women to the ANA and ANP by the end of the \n     security transition period in 2014.\n       (ii) Working with national and local ANA and ANP leaders \n     and coalition partners to address physical and cultural \n     challenges to the recruitment and retention of female ANA and \n     ANP personnel, including through targeted recruitment \n     campaigns, expanded training and mentorship opportunities, \n     parity in pay and promotion rates with male counterparts, and \n     availability of facilities for female personnel.\n       (iii) Working with national and local ANA and ANP leaders \n     to increase understanding about the unique ways in which \n     women members of the security forces improve the force's \n     overall effectiveness.\n       (iv) Working with national and local ANA and ANP leaders to \n     develop a plan for maintaining and increasing the recruitment \n     and retention of women in the ANA and ANP following the \n     completion of the security transition.\n       (3) Report.--The Secretary of Defense shall include in each \n     report on progress toward security and stability in \n     Afghanistan that is submitted to Congress under sections 1230 \n     and 1231 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal \n     Year 2008 (Public Law 110-181;

SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING SPECTRUM REALLOCATION.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Nation's mobile communications industry is a \n     significant economic engine, by one estimate directly or \n     indirectly supporting 3,800,000 jobs, or 2.6 percent of all \n     United States employment, contributing $195,500,000,000 to \n     the United States gross domestic product and driving \n     $33,000,000,000 in productivity improvements in 2011;\n       (2) while wireless carriers are continually implementing \n     new and more efficient technologies and techniques to \n     maximize their existing spectrum capacity, there is a \n     pressing need for additional spectrum for commercial mobile \n     broadband services, with one report predicting that global \n     mobile data traffic will increase 18-fold between 2011 and \n     2016 at a compound annual growth rate of 78 percent, reaching \n     10.8 exabytes per month by 2016;\n       (3) as the Nation faces the current spectrum shortage, \n     consideration should be given to both the supply of spectrum \n     for licensed networks and for unlicensed devices;\n       (4) while this additional demand can be met in part by \n     reallocating spectrum from existing non-governmental uses, \n     the reallocation of Federal Government spectrum for \n     commercial use must also be part of the solution, given that, \n     according to a 2012 Government Accountability Office study, \n     the percentage of the most highly valued spectrum, that below \n     3700 MHz, used exclusively or predominantly by the Federal \n     Government ranges from approximately 39 percent to 57 percent \n     with exclusive Government use accounting for 18 percent of \n     the total amount of spectrum below 3700 MHz;\n       (5) The Federal Communications Commission and the National \n     Telecommunications and Information Administration should also \n     provide replacement spectrum to federal users before spectrum \n     is reallocated.\n       (6) existing law ensures that Federal operations are not \n     harmed as a result of a reallocation of spectrum for \n     commercial use, including through the establishment of the \n     Spectrum Relocation Fund to reimburse Federal users for the \n     costs of planning and implementing relocation and, with \n     respect to spectrum vacated by the Department of Defense, \n     certification by the Secretaries of Defense and Commerce and \n     the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that replacement \n     spectrum provides comparable technical characteristics to \n     restore essential military capability;\n       (7) wherever possible, Federal Government spectrum \n     identified for commercial use should be reallocated for such \n     use;\n       (8) realizing sharing is currently proposed as a possible \n     long-term solution, federal government users should, to the \n     extent practicable, explore how to best implement it to \n     alleviate a lack of a variable bandwidth;\n       (9) among existing Federal Government bands, the spectrum \n     between 1755-1780 MHz is particularly well-suited for \n     reallocation to commercial use because it is identified \n     internationally for commercial mobile services and is used \n     for that purpose throughout most of the world and because it \n     is immediately adjacent to existing domestic wireless \n     spectrum and would fit seamlessly into the current mobile \n     broadband spectrum portfolio allowing for more immediate \n     equipment development and deployment;\n       (9) among existing Federal Government bands, certain \n     frequencies and allocations are more well suited for \n     reallocated to commercial use because it is identified \n     internationally for commercial mobile services;\n       (10) consistent with the March 2012 National \n     Telecommunications and Information Administration report ``An \n     Assessment of the Viability of Accommodating Wireless \n     Broadband in the 1755-1850 MHz Band'', the Department of \n     Defense should prepare a long term plan in consultation with \n     relevant agencies and private sector stakeholders to \n     determine equitable outcomes for the Nation in relation to \n     spectrum use that balances the private sector's demand for \n     spectrum with national security needs;\n       (11) The Secretary of Defense should determine the \n     feasibility of relocating to the extent practicable in the \n     1755-1780 MHz and the General Accountability Office should \n     review the analysis performed; and\n       (12) if feasibility is shown by the Department of Defense \n     and the General Accountability Office, the Federal \n     communications Commission should consider reallocating this \n     band to commerical use.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3278.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON OVERSIGHT OF THE NUCLEAR \n                   SECURITY ENTERPRISE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In 2000, the National Nuclear Security Administration \n     was established as an independent entity within the \n     Department of Energy to manage and secure the nuclear weapons \n     stockpile of the United States and to manage nuclear \n     nonproliferation and naval reactor programs.\n       (2) Serious security and health incidents continue to occur \n     at sites of the National Nuclear Security Administration.\n       (3) In September 2012, an official of the Government \n     Accountability Office testified to Congress that lax \n     laboratory attitudes toward safety procedures, laboratory \n     inadequacies in identifying and addressing safety problems \n     with appropriate corrective actions, and inadequate oversight \n     by site offices of the National Nuclear Security \n     Administration were responsible for nearly 100 safety \n     incidents since 2000.\n       (4) On July 28, 2012, three unarmed individuals compromised \n     security at the Y-12 National Security Complex in Oak Ridge, \n     Tennessee, and according to the Government Accountability \n     Office, ``gained access to the protected security area \n     directly adjacent to one of the nation's most critically \n     important nuclear weapons-related facilities''.\n       (5) In June 2006, hackers attacked an unclassified computer \n     system at the National Nuclear Security Administration's \n     Service Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and gained access \n     to a file containing the names and social security numbers of \n     more than 1,500 employees of the National Nuclear Security \n     Administration.\n       (6) As early as February 2005, the Inspector General of the \n     Department of Energy identified problems with the retrieval \n     of badges from terminated employees at Los Alamos National \n     Laboratory and other sites of the National Nuclear Security \n     Administration.\n       (7) In 2004, a pattern of safety and security incidents \n     that occurred over the course of a year prompted the stand-\n     down of Los Alamos National Laboratory.\n       (8) The National Nuclear Security Administration, \n     independent of the safety and security reform efforts of the \n     Department of Energy, has launched an overhaul of its \n     contracting oversight, placing an emphasis on contractor \n     self-policing through an untested ``contractor assurance'' \n     approach.\n       (9) The Government Accountability Office has given the \n     contractor administration and project management capabilities \n     of the National Nuclear Security Administration a ``high \n     risk'' designation and found there to be insufficient \n     qualified Federal acquisition professionals to ``plan, \n     direct, and oversee project execution''.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) there is a need for strong, independent oversight of \n     the United States nuclear security enterprise;\n       (2) any attempt to reform oversight of the nuclear security \n     enterprise that transfers oversight from the Department of \n     Energy to the National Nuclear Security Administration, \n     reduces protections for worker health and safety at \n     facilities of the National Nuclear Security Administration to \n     levels below the standards of the Department of Energy, or \n     transfers construction appropriations for the nuclear \n     security enterprise from the Department of Energy \n     appropriation account to the military construction \n     appropriation account, should be carefully evaluated;\n       (3) the Office of Health, Safety, and Security of the \n     Department of Energy, which reports to the Secretary of \n     Energy but is also accountable for routinely reporting to \n     Congress on the performance with respect to safety and \n     security of the Department, including the National Nuclear \n     Security Administration, and the role of that Office in \n     overseeing safety and security at the National Nuclear \n     Security Administration,\n\n[[Page S7274]]\n\n     should not be diminished but should be routinely evaluated;\n       (4) any future modifications to the management or structure \n     of the nuclear security enterprise should be done in a way \n     that maintains or increases oversight of critical \n     construction, security, and acquisition capabilities;\n       (5) to the extent possible, oversight of programs of the \n     National Nuclear Security Administration by the Department of \n     Defense should increase to ensure current and future \n     warfighting requirements are met; and\n       (6) the Nuclear Weapons Council should provide proper \n     oversight in the execution of its responsibilities under \n     section 179 of title 10, United States Code.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3280.

Mr. President, today I rise to recognize all of the \nadvanced practice nurses who work in Nurse-Managed Health Clinics in a \nresolution to designate November 26, 2012 through November 30, 2012 as \nNational Nurse Managed-Health Clinic Week. National Nurse-Managed \nHealth Clinic Week will provide a national platform from which to \npromote the pivotal services offered by the more than 200 nurse-managed \nhealth clinics in the United States. Led by advanced practice nurses, \nthese clinics are a unique model for delivery of primary and preventive \ncare.\n  Within Nurse-Managed Health Centers, nurse practitioners and other \nadvanced practice nurses deliver high quality and cost-effective \nservices to diverse populations of all age groups and ethnicities. A \nsubstantial share of the patients are uninsured or on Medicaid. As \nsafety net providers, Nurse-Managed Health Clinics provide care \nregardless of a person's ability to pay. In addition to the provision \nof health care services, Nurse-Managed Health Centers play an important \nrole in the health profession's education. Most Nurse-Managed Health \nCenters are affiliated with colleges of nursing and provide clinical \neducation opportunities to over 3,100 students annually from the fields \nof nursing, medicine, pharmacy, social work, and public health.\n  A Senate Resolution will recognize the key role Nurse-Managed Health \nCenters play. I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this tribute \nto Nurse-Managed Health Clinics.\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Res. 603\n\n       Whereas nurse-managed health clinics are nonprofit \n     community-based health care sites that offer primary care and \n     wellness services based on the nursing model;\n       Whereas the nursing model emphasizes the protection, \n     promotion, and optimization of health, the prevention of \n     illness, the alleviation of suffering, and the diagnosis and \n     treatment of illness;\n       Whereas nurse-managed health clinics are led by advanced \n     practice nurses and staffed by an interdisciplinary team of \n     highly qualified health care professionals;\n       Whereas nurse-managed health clinics offer a broad scope of \n     services, including treatment for acute and chronic \n     illnesses, routine physical exams, immunizations for adults \n     and children, disease screenings, health education, prenatal \n     care, dental care, and drug and alcohol treatment;\n       Whereas, as of June 2011, more than 200 nurse-managed \n     health clinics provided care across the United States and \n     recorded more than 2,000,000 client encounters annually;\n       Whereas nurse-managed health clinics serve a unique dual \n     role as both health care safety net access points and health \n     workforce development sites, given that the majority of \n     nurse-managed health clinics are affiliated with schools of \n     nursing and serve as clinical education sites for students \n     entering the health profession;\n       Whereas nurse-managed health clinics strengthen the health \n     care safety net by expanding access to primary care and \n     chronic disease management services for vulnerable and \n     medically underserved populations in diverse rural, urban, \n     and suburban communities;\n       Whereas research has shown that nurse-managed health \n     clinics experience high patient retention and patient \n     satisfaction rates, and nurse-managed health clinic patients \n     experience higher rates of generic medication fills and lower \n     hospitalization rates when compared to similar safety net \n     providers;\n       Whereas the 2011 report of the Institute of Medicine on the \n     future of nursing highlights the work nurse-managed health \n     clinics are doing to reduce health disparities by bringing \n     evidence-based care to individuals who may not otherwise \n     receive needed services; and\n       Whereas nurse-managed health clinics offering both primary \n     care and wellness services provide quality care in a cost-\n     effective manner: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week of November 26 through November 30, \n     2012, as ``National Nurse-Managed Health Clinic Week'';\n       (2) supports the ideals and goals of National Nurse-Managed \n     Health Clinic Week; and\n       (3) encourages the expansion of nurse-managed health \n     clinics so that nurse-managed health clinics may continue to \n     serve as health care workforce development sites for the next \n     generation of primary care providers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/29/senate-section/article/S7277-2", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7277-S7278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        RELATIVE TO THE DEATH OF THE HONORABLE WARREN B.
