CHESTNUT AND JOHN M. GIBSON\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, every day people from across this great \nNation around the globe come here to visit the Capitol--to see the seat \nof American democracy. Every day, those of us who are fortunate to have \nbeen elected by our home States to serve in Congress also come here to \nrepresent this Nation and the American people in that democracy. Every \nday a brave and dedicated group of men and women come here to serve as \nCapitol police officers, to ensure that whether we are here to work or \nto visit, we are safe from harm. In 1998, two of those dedicated police \nofficers gave their lives protecting this Capitol and the people in \nthis Capitol. They were Special Agent John Gibson and Officer Jacob \nChestnut. Thirteen years ago yesterday, a man entered the House side of \nthe Capitol building with a gun, shot officer Chestnut at point-blank \nrange.\n  Agent Gibson warned tourists and staff to take cover and then \nconfronted the gunman. Although Agent Gibson was also shot, he \nprevented anyone else from being killed. Both officers died that day. \nThey served a combined 36 years on the force, protecting their fellow \nmen and women.\n  When I first came to Washington, I worked the night shift--the swing \nshift--as a Capitol police officer. That is why I feel a particular \ncloseness to the Capitol police. When I worked, I was never in danger. \nI was never called on to put my life on the line. I only hope I would \nhave shown the bravery Agent Gibson and Officer Chestnut displayed that \nafternoon they were killed.\n  I was a Member of the Senate when Agent Gibson and Officer Chestnut \ngave their lives to save the lives of others. I know nothing can make \nup for the loss of a cherished loved one. We hope their families and \nfriends take some comfort in knowing those of us who were here that day \nhold them in our memories and in our hearts. While I know it is little \nsolace to their families, the tragedy of that day made the Capitol a \nsafer place. It led to the construction of the Capitol Visitor Center \nwhich prevents a madman such as the one who shot Agent Gibson and \nOfficer Chestnut from entering the Capitol. We are all grateful for \ntheir sacrifice, and we are grateful that every day devoted\n\n[[Page S4856]]\n\nmen and women like them guard these hallowed halls.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/25/senate-section/article/S4856-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4856]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, some of those dedicated police officers \nstood guard Saturday and Sunday as we worked to reach an agreement to \navert a default on our national debt. Leaders in both parties were here \nthroughout the weekend. Differences still separate our two sides, but \nwork toward an agreement continues.\n  This afternoon I will put on the floor a proposal that I hope will \nbreak that impasse. This legislation would put to rest the specter of \ndefault. It would cut $2.7 trillion from the deficit over the next \ndecade. It would not raise any new revenue or make any cuts to \nMedicare, Medicaid, or Social Security. All the cuts included in this \npackage have previously been supported by Republicans. The proposal \nprovides everything the House Republicans have said they needed from an \nagreement to avert default and cut the deficit. I hope my colleagues on \nthe other side will still know a good deal when they see it. I hope \nthey will remember how to say yes.\n  The tea-party-led House of Representatives has held up a resolution \nof these negotiations for weeks because they did not want oil \ncompanies, corporations that ship jobs overseas, and millionaires and \nbillionaires in their corporate jets to pay their fair share. If they \nnow oppose an agreement that meets every one of their demands, it will \nbe because they have put politics first and the good of this Nation and \nthe economy last.\n  I hope they will not continue to insist on the kind of short-term fix \nthey opposed a few short weeks ago, and they know Democrats in the \nSenate will not pass and President Obama will not sign.\n  Economists have already said a short-term solution is no solution at \nall. It will not give the markets the certainty they need. The credit \nrating agencies have said a short-term Band-Aid could have many of the \nsame effects of default: downgrade of U.S. debt, soaring interest \nrates, and an effective tax increase for every American family and \nbusiness.\n  The financial markets do not trust the rightwing tea-party-led House \nof Representatives. They do not believe they should hold this process \nhostage, and they do not want them to do it again in 6 months. We need \nto make the right decision now, and we need to do it because the \neconomy is on the line.\n  This is what one market analyst said about a plan to avert for only a \nfew months. ``From the markets' point of view, a two-stage plan is a \nnonstarter because we now know it is amateur hour on Capitol Hill and \nwe don't want to be painted in this corner again.''\n  The markets need certainty; America needs certainty; the world needs \ncertainty; and an agreement that provides that certainty is within our \ngrasp. Democrats have done more than just meet Republicans in the \nmiddle. We have met them all the way. Now we will see whether \nRepublicans are against any agreement at all or whether they remember \nhow to say yes when the compromise on the table gives them everything \nthey have demanded.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

CHESTNUT AND JOHN GIBSON\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, as visitors walk through the Capitol \nfor the first time, they eventually come across a plaque near one of \nthe entrances on the East Front that memorializes an event which took \nplace 13 years ago yesterday.\n  It was 13 years ago that Officers Jacob Joseph Chestnut and Detective \nJohn Michael Gibson made the ultimate sacrifice to protect all who were \nworking and visiting the Capitol on that Friday afternoon.\n  And every year at this time, we take a moment to step back from our \nwork, put aside our differences, and remember these good men whose \nsacrifice stands as a permanent reminder of the debt we owe to them, \nand to all those who continue to put themselves on the front line every \nday to defend the rest of us--from the Capitol Police force, to local \nlaw enforcement officials, to those serving overseas.\n  America has always been blessed to have men and women rise up in \nevery generation who are willing to put their Nation ahead of their \nlives. Today, we honor two in particular who did so in this building. \nOfficer Chestnut was a 20-year veteran of the Air Force, a loving \nhusband, and a father of five.\n  Detective Gibson had served 3 years on Congressman Tom DeLay's \nprotective detail. Both had served 18 years on the Capitol Police \nforce. A friend of Detective Gibson's recalled shortly after the \nshooting that just a few days before, John told him he had never had to \ndraw his weapon on the job. Yet despite being mortally wounded on the \nday he died, John did not hesitate to return fire, wounding the \nintruder. Calling upon his instincts and training, Detective Gibson's \nactions saved many lives that day.\n  Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson exemplify the best America has \nto offer. And that is why we honor them here today.\n  My friend the majority leader is a former Capitol Police officer. He \nunderstands more than anyone in this Chamber the honor and dedication, \nas well as the risks associated with the job. I know he joins me in \nhonoring Jacob Joseph Chestnut and John Michael Gibson, as well as all \nCapitol Police who put their lives on the line every day to protect us \nand this institution.\n  To all members of the Capitol Police force: thank you for your \nservice and your professionalism. Your duties do not go unnoticed. And \non this day that we remember Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson, I \nwould also like to take a moment to remember the families of these good \nmen who have been so deeply affected by this tragedy. Our prayers \ncontinue to go out to them. May God continue to protect them as their \nloved ones protected us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/25/senate-section/article/S4856-4", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4856-S4857]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would like to say a few words now \nabout the ongoing debt ceiling discussions.\n  I think the American people can be excused for being a little \nconfused at this point as to what is going on here in Washington and a \nlittle bit frustrated. I am too, frankly.\n  There is no reason in the world that the American people should have \nhad to wake up this morning unsure of whether Washington was going to \nresolve this problem.\n  Candidly, as of Saturday afternoon, I had no doubt that a solution \nwas at hand.\n  That is just what we did. We came together in good faith and decided \nto do the right thing. Everyone agrees default wasn't an option, so we \nput together a responsible proposal that prevented default while \nreducing Washington spending.\n  Republicans and, yes, some Democrats, have been clear for months that \ntax hikes couldn't be part of the package. We have also been clear that \nserious cuts would have to be part of any package.\n  So taking all this into consideration, the responsible path forward \nwas clear to everyone: a plan that avoided default and required \nadditional savings before any further increase in the debt ceiling.\n  Leaders from both parties in both Houses agreed this was the right \npath forward legislatively. The only thing to do at that point was to \npresent this bipartisan solution to the President.\n  What was the President's response? Unfortunately, to demand the \nlargest single debt increase in history, $\\1/2\\ trillion more than the \nprevious biggest increase Democrats approved 2 years ago when they \ncontrolled both Congress and the White House.\n  This was the President's justification, as he put it on Friday:\n\n       The only bottom line I have is that we have to extend the \n     debt ceiling through the next election, into 2013.\n\n\n[[Page S4857]]\n\n\n  That is a direct quote from the President of the United States. There \nis absolutely no economic justification for insisting on a debt limit \nincrease that brings us through the next election. It is not the \nbeginning of a fiscal year. It is not the beginning of a calendar year. \nBased on his own words, it is hard to conclude that this request has to \ndo with anything, in fact, other than the President's reelection.\n  Look, Congress has raised the Federal debt limit 62 times since 1972. \nThe average length of an increase over that period is just over 7 \nmonths. But now the President says it has to be nearly 2 years. Why? So \nhe can continue to spend as he pleases.\n  This weekend, we offered the President a bipartisan proposal to avoid \ndefault so we could have the time we need to put together a serious \nplan for getting our house in order, and he rejected it out of hand--\nnot for economic reasons, understand, but, as he put it, ``to extend \nthis debt ceiling through the next election.''\n  Time is running out. With all due respect to the President, we have \nmore important issues to worry about than getting through the next \nelection.\n  A bipartisan plan to resolve this crisis was literally within our \nreach this weekend. The President has to know this approach is the \nresponsible path forward, and we ought to put it back on the table.\n  Congressional leaders of both parties have shown they are willing to \nwork in good faith. I suggest the President reconsider their offer \nrather than veto the country into default.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/25/senate-section/article/S4857-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4857]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to share my deepest sympathies \nfor the people of Norway who, as my colleagues know, experienced a \ndespicable terrorist act this past Friday, July 22.\n  In the Senate, I represent the State of Minnesota. It is a State that \nhas the largest number of people of Norwegian heritage outside the \ncountry of Norway itself.\n  The influence of Norwegian culture can be found throughout our State, \nand the bonds between Norway and Minnesota continue to be incredibly \nstrong to this day. That is why the shock of Friday's violence hit us \nso close to home.\n  This past weekend, I joined Minnesotans and the whole world in \noffering our country's prayers and sympathy to the people of Norway. I \nattended a memorial service at the Mindekirke Norwegian Lutheran \nMemorial Church in Minneapolis, where hundreds of people of Norwegian \nheritage gathered to go to mourn their loss.\n  It is especially heartbreaking that a mass murder such as this would \ntake place in a country such as Norway. The world knows Norway as a \ncountry that is both peaceful and peace-seeking.\n  After all, Norway is home to the Nobel Peace Prize, and it has \noffered safe haven to refugees and the politically persecuted from all \naround the world. It just doesn't make sense.\n  I am a parent. My daughter is the same age as many of the young \npeople who were at that camp. She was there with our family at the \nmemorial service on Sunday. The kids at this camp were idealistic kids. \nThey were teenagers. They were at the camp because of their interest in \ntheir community and in democracy.\n  It is very hard and very painful even to think about such a cold-\nblooded attack and the massacre of so many innocent children. It is a \nkind of terrible tragedy that puts all of us to the test. It tests our \nresilience, our trust, and our faith.\n  On Saturday morning, I spoke with Ambassador Strommen, Norway's \nAmbassador to the United States. I conveyed the deepest sympathies of \nthe people of our State. He assured me that, even though this is a very \ndifficult time, Norway is strong, the Norwegian people are strong, and \nthey will make it through this time of trouble and sorrow.\n  We will stand by them. But we will also stand against the hate that \ninspired this action. We are starting to get a sense, over the last 2 \ndays, of what motivated this madman. We know now that while most of the \npeople attacked were native Norwegians, there were also people from \nother countries, immigrants to Norway, new citizens there.\n  We all need to remember that my State was originally settled by \nNorwegians, Swedes, Danes, and Germans, but we also remember there were \nother waves of immigrants who came too, including Slovenians, such as \nmy relatives, as well as people from Poland, Russia, and most recently \nin Minnesota the Hmong people have a major presence, as well as people \nfrom Somalia. We must remember what made our State, our country, and \nNorway such vibrant places for democracy is that openness, that \nfreedom, and it is that tolerance.\n  I reminded my friends at the Norwegian church on Sunday morning of \nsomething President Clinton actually said after the Oklahoma City \nbombing, when he spoke at that memorial. He said this:\n\n       Let us let our own children know that we will stand against \n     the forces of fear. When there is talk of hatred, let us \n     stand up and talk against it. When there is talk of violence, \n     let us stand up and talk against it.\n\n  I call on my colleagues to stand true to those words. We will \ncontinue to confront the forces of fear and hatred with that same \nspirit of faith, tolerance, and good will. Let us continue to stand \nstrong in support of our allies and friends in Norway. Today, our \nthoughts and prayers are with them.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me associate myself with the remarks of \nthe Senator from Minnesota. My wife and I traveled to Oslo, Norway, a \nfew years ago and were deeply touched by the hospitality of the people \nthere and the peacefulness of the country. It is almost too much to \nbear to think about what they have gone through as a result of this \nrecent tragedy.

Mr. President, I also thought it interesting that, regarding \nthe issues we are debating that so deeply divide us, a Wall Street \nJournal op-ed today appeared, which is one of those rare times when the \nauthor puts into a much larger perspective, a more cosmic perspective, \nwhat we are talking about and puts it in moral terms--long-term moral \nterms--rather than just Democrats versus Republicans and the fight of \nthe day.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed \nin the Record after my remarks. It is written by Arthur C. Brooks and \nis called ``The Debt Ceiling and the Pursuit of Happiness.''\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KYL. Arthur Brooks is the head of AEI, American Enterprise \nInstitute, and he has written on the subject of happiness in our \ncountry and how we get there. His most recent book is called ``The \nBattle: How the Fight Between Free Enterprise and Big Government Will \nShape America's Future.''\n  His theme in this article was similar to the one in the book, which \nis that\n\n[[Page S4858]]\n\nwe have the system we have because Americans have found that it is a \nsystem which most leads us to the pursuit of happiness, the achievement \nof success, and things that are important in our lives. He talks about \nthe fight we are engaged in now about extending the debt ceiling as \nbeing a fight against 50-year trends toward statism, which he \nidentifies as a state that would be very disappointing to Americans, \nwhere we would not have the ability to pursue our dreams or the same \nopportunity we have today to be successful if we take risks and to \nutilize the full potential of the free market system.\n  He says, ``Consider a few facts,'' and this is the one thing I will \nquote from his article:\n\n       The Bureau of Economic Analysis tells us that total \n     government spending at all levels has risen to 37 percent of \n     the gross domestic product today from 27 percent in 1960--and \n     is set to reach 50 percent by 2038. The Tax Foundation \n     reports that between 1986 and 2008, the share of Federal \n     income taxes paid by the top 5 percent of earners has risen \n     to 59 percent from 43 percent. Between 1986 and 2009, the \n     percentage of Americans who paid zero or negative Federal \n     income taxes has increased to 51 percent from 18.5 percent. \n     And all this is accompanied by an increase in our national \n     debt to 100 percent of gross domestic product today from 42 \n     percent in 1980.\n\n  All of these, obviously, portend a trend toward statism, toward the \nfunding of the state through increased taxation by fewer and fewer \npeople but at a greater and greater amount of money. In his view and in \nmine, it will ultimately reduce the kinds of incentives that the free \nmarket system provides for Americans to be able to earn and hire others \nand to assist our economy to grow and, in the process, to increase our \nstandard of living.\n  This is one of the reasons why Republicans have been so focused on \nreducing spending as the solution to the problem we face in Washington \ntoday. Our problem is not that we don't tax Americans enough; our \nproblem is that we spend too much here in Washington. That is \nmanifested by the statistic that now we are spending almost 25 percent \nof the GDP. We were up to 25, and we are headed back up there. Yet just \n3 short years ago, we were at the average level of spending in our \ncountry of about 20 percent of GDP. So spending has skyrocketed in the \nlast 3 years.\n  If a physician is wanting to treat a patient's condition, the \nphysician diagnoses the patient for what is wrong and then treats that \nillness. What is wrong with us today is that Washington spending is out \nof control. That is the diagnosis. What is the treatment? The treatment \nis not to pile more taxes onto an already sick economy. The treatment \nis to reduce the amount of government spending.\n  That is what Republicans have urged us to do. The American people, \nfortunately, are in the same place.\n  I will cite three surveys that make the point. One of them is a \nRasmussen survey, just reported July 22, of likely voters in the \ncountry. It asks the question: Would you fear that the debt deal would \nraise taxes too much or too little? Would you fear that the debt deal \nwill cut spending too little or cut spending too much?\n  The answer was interesting. Among likely voters, the answer is this: \n62 percent of voters believe the deal will raise taxes too much. Only \n26 percent think we will raise taxes too little.\n  On the spending side, 56 percent are afraid it will cut spending too \nlittle. Only 25 percent think it will cut spending too much.\n  We can see the American people are with us here. They understand our \nproblem is spending, not taxes. They are worried we are not going to \nreduce spending enough and that, in fact, we are going to increase \ntaxes too much. Rasmussen had already done a survey a week before of \nlikely voters. It asked: Do you favor including a tax hike in the deal?\n  This was interesting. Fifty-five percent of voters said no. Only 34 \npercent of likely voters said yes. So the majority, by far, is saying \ndon't include a tax hike in the deal. Again, they understand what the \nproblem is: It is not taxes, it is spending.\n  CNN had a poll a few days before that, and the question--there were \nseveral questions in the poll, but the one that struck my eye asked \nabout raising the debt ceiling only if we also cut spending, cap it at \ncertain levels, and pass a balanced budget amendment. That is the so-\ncalled cut, cap, and balance proposal that passed the House of \nRepresentatives but was tabled by our Democratic colleagues here in the \nSenate last week. CNN reports that by a 2-to-1 margin the American \npeople thought we should cut, cap, and balance--66 percent favored, \nonly 33 percent opposed.\n\n  It is interesting to me the American people have internalized the \nsame thing as we Republicans; and probably the reason Republicans are \nexpressing this is because we have been listening to our constituents \nwho have been telling us this. Our concern is not that we should raise \ntaxes; our concern is that we should cut spending. That is why we have \nbeen saying what we have been saying here.\n  I find it interesting even the President himself--in an earlier \ntime--shared the same sentiment. In August of 2009 he made a similar \npoint. In December of last year, when the tax rates that have been in \nexistence for decades were extended for another 2 years, he said: You \ndon't raise taxes in a recession. He is exactly right. And, by the way, \nat the time he said that, growth in the quarter was at about 6 percent \nof GDP. Today, growth is less than 2 percent of GDP. So our economic \nsituation has gotten worse since then. We are up to 9.2 percent \nunemployment. Obviously, you don't raise taxes in a recession. When you \nhave a bad economic condition, the worst medicine is to raise taxes.\n  Another point Republicans have been trying to make with regard to \nthis difference between raising taxes or reducing spending is that \nusually a couple of things happen when Congress sets out to do this. \nYou get the permanent increases in taxes, but you never get the same \ndollar for dollar or $2 or $3 for $1 that you are promised in \nreductions in spending. Moreover, when you aim at hitting the \nmillionaires and billionaires--which is usually the excuse for raising \ntaxes--you end up hitting a lot of other folks.\n  One of the things we are concerned about is exactly what happened \nwith the alternative minimum tax. We tried to make sure 128 specific \nmillionaires didn't get out of paying taxes because of deductions and \ncredits they could take, and so we put into effect the alternative \nminimum tax. Today, the alternative minimum tax affects 25 million \nAmericans. So when you aim at the millionaires, you hit everybody else. \nIn fact, that is exactly what would happen under the proposal of the \nPresident today.\n  The President says we need to hit the millionaires and billionaires. \nWell, there are 319,000 American households that report incomes of over \n$1 million a year, but there are 3.6 million other households that \nwould be affected in the same way by the President's tax increase \nbecause they are also in the top two income tax brackets. So when you \nraise the top two brackets, you are not just going to hit the \nmillionaires and billionaires, you are also going to hit a lot of other \nAmericans who don't report incomes of over $1 million a year.\n  Probably the primary reason Republicans have argued we should not be \nraising taxes in this bad economic time is that it is a job killer. \nThis is illustrated by many things, one of which is the President's own \nSmall Business Administration. One of the taxes the President has \nproposed hiking would hit small businesses especially hard. According \nto the Office of Advocacy of the Obama Small Business Administration, \nthis tax ``could ultimately force many small businesses to close.'' Why \nwould you impose a tax on small businesses that could ultimately force \nmany of them to close? It is the wrong medicine for a sick economy.\n  In addition to the fact we always end up hitting a lot more than the \nmillionaires and billionaires, and that taxes are forever but the \nsavings never quite seem to materialize, the most important point here \nis that raising taxes is a job killer. Two-thirds of all the jobs \ncoming out of a recession are in the small business sector. Fifty-four \npercent of all jobs in the country are created by small business.\n  Republicans are going to continue to push for reductions in spending \nas the way forward here, and I hope during this next week we will be \nable to get together with our House colleagues, and Republicans and \nDemocrats alike will be able to at least rally around one thing we can \nall agree on: spending has to be reduced. If later on we need to have \ndiscussions about tax reform, that\n\n[[Page S4859]]\n\nis a debate I think all of us wish to have. Our Tax Code needs \nreforming. But let's do that not in the context of raising revenues but \nrather in the context of making it a Tax Code that would enable us to \ngrow more. At the end of the day, that is what we should all be for. \nBecause a growing pie means there is more for everyone--rich and poor \nalike--the families of America as well as the governments. I hope my \ncolleagues will focus on what the American people are telling us \nthrough these surveys: Let's reduce spending, not increase taxes.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, July 25, 2011]\n\n             The Debt Ceiling and the Pursuit of Happiness\n\n                         (By Arthur C. Brooks)\n\n       The battle over the debt ceiling is only the latest \n     skirmish in what promises to be an ongoing, exhausting war \n     over budget issues. Americans can be forgiven for seeing the \n     whole business as petty, selfish and tiresome. Conservatives \n     in particular are beginning to worry that public patience \n     will wear thin over their insistence that our nation's \n     government-spending problem must be remedied through spending \n     cuts, not by raising more revenues.\n       But before they succumb to too much caution, budget \n     reformers need to remember three things. First, this is not a \n     political fight between Republicans and Democrats; it is a \n     fight against 50-year trends toward statism. Second, it is a \n     moral fight, not an economic one. Third, this is not a fight \n     that anyone can win in the 15 months from now to the \n     presidential election. It will take hard work for at least a \n     decade.\n       Consider a few facts. The Bureau of Economic Analysis tells \n     us that total government spending at all levels has risen to \n     37% of gross domestic product today from 27% in 1960--and is \n     set to reach 50% by 2038. The Tax Foundation reports that \n     between 1986 and 2008, the share of federal income taxes paid \n     by the top 5% of earners has risen to 59% from 43%. Between \n     1986 and 2009, the percentage of Americans who pay zero or \n     negative federal income taxes has increased to 51% from \n     18.5%. And all this is accompanied by an increase in our \n     national debt to 100% of GDP today from 42% in 1980.\n       Where will it all lead? Some despairing souls have \n     concluded there are really only two scenarios. In one, we \n     finally hit a tipping point where so few people actually pay \n     for their share of the growing government that a majority \n     become completely invested in the social welfare state, which \n     stabilizes at some very high level of taxation and government \n     social spending. (Think Sweden.)\n       In the other scenario, our welfare state slowly collapses \n     under its weight, and we get some kind of permanent austerity \n     after the rest of the world finally comprehends the depth of \n     our national spending disorder and stops lending us money at \n     low interest rates. (Think Greece.)\n       In other words: Heads, the statists win; tails, we all \n     lose.\n       Anyone who seeks to provide serious national political \n     leadership today--those elected in 2010 or who seek national \n     office in 2012--owe Americans a plan to escape having to make \n     this choice. We need tectonic changes, not minor fiddling.\n       Rep. Paul Ryan's (R., Wis.) budget plan is the kind of \n     model necessary. But structural change will only succeed if \n     it's accompanied by a moral argument--an unabashed cultural \n     defense of the free enterprise system that helps Americans \n     remember why they love their country and its exceptional \n     culture.\n       America's Founders knew the importance of moral language, \n     which is why they asserted our unalienable right to the \n     pursuit of happiness, not to the possession of property. \n     Similarly, Adam Smith, the father of free-market economics, \n     had a philosophy that transcended the mere wealth of nations. \n     His greatest book was ``The Theory of Moral Sentiments,'' a \n     defense of a culture that could support true freedom and \n     provide the greatest life satisfaction.\n       Yet today, it is progressives, not free marketeers, who use \n     the language of morality. President Obama was not elected \n     because of his plans about the taxation of repatriated \n     profits, or even his ambition to reform health care. He was \n     elected largely on the basis of language about hope and \n     change, and a ``fairer'' America.\n       The irony is that statists have a more materialistic \n     philosophy than free-enterprise advocates. Progressive \n     solutions to cultural problems always involve the tools of \n     income redistribution, and call it ``social justice.''\n       Free-enterprise advocates, on the other hand, speak \n     privately about freedom and opportunity for everybody--\n     including the poor. Most support a limited safety net, but \n     also believe that succeeding on our merits, doing something \n     meaningful, and having responsibility for our own affairs are \n     what give us the best life. Sadly, in public, they always \n     seem stuck in the language of economic efficiency.\n       The result is that year after year we slip further down the \n     redistributionist road, dissatisfied with the growing welfare \n     state, but with no morally satisfying arguments to make a \n     change that entails any personal sacrifice.\n       Examples are all around us. It is hard to find anyone who \n     likes our nation's current health-care policies. But do you \n     seriously expect grandma to sit idly by and let Republicans \n     experiment with her Medicare coverage so her great-\n     grandchildren can get better treatment for carried interest? \n     Not a chance.\n       If reformers want Americans to embrace real change, every \n     policy proposal must be framed in terms of self-realization, \n     meritocratic fairness and the promise of a better future. Why \n     do we want to lower taxes for entrepreneurs? Because we \n     believe in earned success. Why do we care about economic \n     growth? To make individual opportunity possible, not simply \n     to increase wealth. Why do we need entitlement reform? \n     Because it is wrong to steal from our children.\n       History shows that big moral struggles can be won, but only \n     when they are seen as decade-long fights and not just as a \n     way to prevail in the next election. Welfare reform was first \n     proposed in 1984 and regarded popularly as a nonstarter. \n     Twelve years of hard work by scholars at my own institution \n     and others helped make it a mainstream idea (signed into law \n     by a Democratic president) and perhaps the best policy for \n     helping the poor to escape poverty in our nation's history. \n     Political consultants would have abandoned welfare reform as \n     unworkably audacious and politically suicidal. Real leaders \n     understood that its moral importance transcended short-term \n     politics.\n       No one deserves our political support today unless he or \n     she is willing to work for as long as it takes to win the \n     moral fight to steer our nation back toward enterprise and \n     self-governance. This fight will not be easy or politically \n     safe. But it will be a happy one: to share the values that \n     make us proud to be Americans.\n\n  Mr. KYL.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Moment of Silence\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I note the Senate observed a moment of \nsilence for John Gibson and Jacob Chestnut, who were killed in the \nCapitol in 1998 on July 24. Both were excellent police officers--one \nuniformed, one plain clothes--in the protective division. My wife and I \nknew both John Gibson and Jacob Chestnut, and we were at both of their \nmemorial services. Both were fine officers, and I am glad we had a \nmoment of silence.\n  We sometimes forget that we have a lot of very good police officers, \nboth in the uniform division and the plain clothes division, in this \nCapitol. They are here to protect us at all times of day or night, no \nmatter what the weather or what the circumstances. It is something we \nshould keep in mind. We often can go home when the session ends, but \nthey are here to make sure everything is still safe. So we owe all of \nthem a debt of gratitude, and I hope all of them will remain safe. It \nis a tragedy that Officers Gibson and Chestnut were not able to remain \nsafe but died protecting the Capitol.\n  Today, the Senate is finally going to vote on two judicial \nnominations reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee in early \nApril.\n  Let me put that into perspective. Way back when snow was still \nfalling in my State, every single Republican and every single Democrat \nvoted for these two nominees. In past years they would have been \nconfirmed probably in a voice vote that same week in a wrap-up session. \nFor some reason, my friends on the other side think it should be \ndifferent with a Democratic President than it was for a Republican \nPresident, or for that matter, all past Presidents.\n  Despite the support of every Democrat and every Republican on the \nJudiciary Committee, the nominations of Paul Engelmayer to fill a \njudicial emergency vacancy in the Southern District of New York, and \nRamona Manglona to fill a 10-year term in the District Court for the \nCommonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, have been stalled for \n3\\1/2\\ months on the Senate's Executive Calendar. These are the kinds \nof qualified, consensus judicial nominations that in past years--\nwhether under President Ford, President Carter, President Reagan, or \neither of the President Bushes--would have been confirmed promptly \nrather than being forced to languish for months because of Republican \nrefusal to consent to debate and vote on nominations.\n  At a time when judicial vacancies remain above 90 throughout this \ncountry, these needless delays perpetuate the judicial vacancy crisis \nthat Chief Justice Roberts, a Republican appointee, wrote of last \nDecember and that the President, the Attorney General, bar associations \nand chief judges around the country have urged us to join together to \nend. Imagine the example we set to litigants by saying: ``Well, we \ncan't hear your litigation, no matter how important it is. You are \ngoing to have to wait year after year after year because we don't have \na judge. We can't get one confirmed.'' The Senate can do a better job \nworking to ensure the ability of our Federal courts to provide justice \nto our fellow Americans around the country.\n  Recently, Chief Judge Moreno of the Southern District of Florida \nwrote to the Senate leaders urging that they expedite action on two \nnominations to fill judicial emergency vacancies in that district. Both \nKathleen Williams and Robert Scola are among the many judicial nominees \nwho were reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee, yet both are \nbeing delayed for no good reason.\n  Chief Judge Moreno writes:\n\n       [T]he judicial shortage with three vacancies in our \n     district is becoming acute. For this reason, I ask your \n     assistance in expediting both confirmations. The Judiciary \n     Committee has found the nominees qualified and the people of \n     South Florida eagerly await their service.\n\n  Both of these nominees have the support of their home State \nSenators--Senator Nelson, a Democrat, and Senator Rubio, a Republican. \nThe two Senators have set aside partisan actions, and the Senate \nJudiciary Committee has set aside partisan actions by voting for the \nnominees unanimously. Why should they be held up because of partisan \nactions on this floor?\n  Kathleen Williams and Robert Scola are among the 27 judicial nominees \nreviewed by the Judiciary Committee and reported favorably to the \nSenate for final action who are being stalled. I am glad that we are \nfinally being allowed to consider the 2 nominees who will be confirmed \ntoday, but they have been waiting since early April. This is not \ntraditional, and there are still 25 who languish.\n  This is not how the Senate has acted in years past with other \nPresidents' judicial nominees. It is not accurate to pretend that real \nprogress is being made in these circumstances. After we have these two \nvotes, we will still have 25 nominees sitting on the calendar who could \nbe disposed of within an hour, yet they are blocked week after week \nafter week. That is not progress. We may be making progress in the \ncommittee, but if the nominees are blocked on the floor, it is not \nprogress. Vacancies are being kept high, consensus nominees are being \ndelayed, and it is the American people--Republicans, Democrats, and \nIndependents alike--that are being made to suffer.\n  This is another area in which we must come together for the American \npeople. Let us do something for the American people, and not just for \nour political parties. There is no reason Senators cannot join together \nto finally bring down the excessive number of vacancies that have \npersisted in our Federal courts throughout the Nation for far too long. \nIt is not a Republican or Democratic issue, it is an American issue.\n  Between now and the August recess the Senate should consider all of \nthe judicial nominees ready for a final vote, including those \ndesperately needed in southern Florida backed by Senator Nelson and \nSenator Rubio.\n  I expect the two nominations we are going to consider today will be \nconfirmed overwhelmingly. They are examples of the almost two dozen \nconsensus nominees who are being stalled for no good reason. Mr. \nEngelmayer is a nominee with unassailable credentials. After receiving \nhis undergraduate and law school degrees with honors from Harvard Law \nSchool, Mr. Engelmayer served as a law clerk to Judge Patricia Wald of \nthe United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and \nthen to Justice Thurgood Marshall on the Supreme Court. He worked as a \nFederal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York for 9 years, \nwhere he climbed the ranks from a young lawyer to become Chief of the \nMajor Crimes Unit. Mr. Engelmayer served for 2 years as an Assistant \nSolicitor General for the United States. Since 2000, he has been a \npartner in the law firm WilmerHale, where he practices civil and \ncriminal litigation and regularly dedicates himself to pro bono work. \nThe ABA's\n\n[[Page S4861]]\n\nStanding Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated him well \nqualified to serve, its highest rating. He is supported by his home \nstate Senators.\n  Ramona Villagomez Manglona is currently an Associate Judge on the \nSuperior Court for the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands \n(CNMI), having previously served as a Justice Pro Tempore on the Guam \nSupreme Court and a Judge Pro Tempore on the Guam Superior Court. From \n1998 to 2003, she worked in the CNMI Office of the Attorney General is \nseveral capacities, including a term as Attorney General. Born in \nSaipan, Northern Mariana Islands, Judge Manglona earned her B.A. from \nthe University of California, Berkeley and her J.D. from the University \nof New Mexico. When confirmed, Judge Manglona will be the first \nindigenous person to serve as a U.S. District Court Judge in the \nCommonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Her confirmation should \nalso save money and help ease the burden on judges who have had to \ntravel to the Pacific from the mainland to provide judicial resources.\n  I, again, thank Senator Grassley for his cooperation in working with \nme to make progress in the committee concerning judicial nominations in \nregular order. We have made progress in the committee, but it goes for \nnaught if we cannot get nominees confirmed on the floor. Our work in \nthe committee has not been matched in the Senate, where agreements to \ndebate and vote on judicial nominations are too few and too far \nbetween. These are only the sixth and seventh nominations the Senate \nhas considered in the last 2 months, at a time when vacancies have \nremained at or above 90, and despite the many consensus nominees that \nhave been voted on in a bipartisan fashion by the committee and are now \nwaiting for a vote on the Senate floor.\n  These will be only the 13th and 14th nominees confirmed this year who \nhad their hearings this year. The other confirmations were all from the \ngroup considered by the Judiciary Committee last year, but were \nrenominated after having had their confirmations delayed unnecessarily \nlast year. Ignoring the words of the Chief Justice and others concerned \nwith the continuing high number of judicial vacancies, Senate \nRepublicans have continued the pattern and practice of delay for \nvirtually all judicial nominees.\n  In addition to the 2 nominations we consider today, there are \ncurrently 25 judicial nominations that have been fully considered by \nthe Judiciary Committee and sent to the Senate for final action. Of \nthem, 20 were unanimously reported, by Republicans and Democrats, \nwithout a single negative vote. At the very least, we ought to take up \nthose 20. The two nominations we consider today were reported in April. \nThere remain 13 judicial nominations on the calendar reported favorably \nby the committee way back in May or earlier, 11 of which were reported \nunanimously. When I urged the Senate to take up and vote on the many \njudicial nominations that were on the calendar and ready for action \nbefore the Memorial Day recess, Republican Senators would not agree to \nconsider a single one. With almost a score of judicial nominees \navailable to the Senate for final action, only one was considered \nbefore the July 4 recess. That is not the way to make real progress.\n  Regrettably, the Senate has not reduced vacancies as dramatically as \nwe did during the Bush administration. Federal judicial vacancies \naround the country still number too many, and they have persisted for \nfar too long. Whereas the Democratic majority in the Senate reduced \nvacancies from 110 to 60 in President Bush's first two years, Senate \nRepublicans' insistence on objections and delays have resulted in \njudicial vacancies still numbering more than 90 two and a half years \ninto President Obama's term. By now, judicial vacancies should have \nbeen reduced to similar levels, but we have barely kept up with \nattrition.\n  In fact, the Senate has reversed course during the Obama \nadministration given Republican objections, and the slow pace of \nconfirmations are keeping judicial vacancies at crisis levels. Over the \neight years of the Bush administration, from 2001 to 2009, we reduced \njudicial vacancies from 110 to a low of 34. That has now been reversed, \nwith vacancies staying near or above 90 for the last two years. The \nvacancy rate--which we reduced from 10 percent to 6 percent by this \ndate in President Bush's third year, and ultimately to less than 4 \npercent in 2008--is back above 10 percent.\n  By this time in the third year of the Bush administration, the Senate \nhad confirmed 136 judges. That is over 40 percent more than the number \nof President Obama's nominees we have been allowed to process to \nconfirmation. We have a long way to go to do as well as we did during \nPresident Bush's first term, when we confirmed 205 of his judicial \nnominations. The Senate confirmed 100 of those judicial nominations \nduring the 17 months I was Chairman during President Bush's first 2 \nyears in office. In the other 31 months, Republicans were able to do \nanother 105. So again, we demonstrated we are ready to work faster with \nPresident Bush than even his Republican Senators were--and we certainly \nworked a lot faster than we have been able to work now. President Obama \nis now in his 30th month in office and we have only been allowed to \nconsider and confirm 91 of his Federal Circuit and District Court \nnominees. Compare that to the 100 I did in 17 months for President \nBush.\n  The delays continue, despite the needs of the Federal judiciary, as \nevidenced by Chief Judge Moreno's recent letter, which I ask unanimous \nconsent to be made part of the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. I would note that the delays in confirmation of President \nObama's consensus nominees, nominees agreed to by both Republicans and \nDemocrats, are to the detriment of all Americans. Most people, when \nthey go into court, do not go in as a Republican or Democrat. They are \njust an American seeking justice. But the courts' doors are now being \nclosed; closed because the Senate will not allow confirmation of the \njudges who could open those doors. That is wrong. It is a stain on the \njudiciary, and it is a stain on this body.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                              U.S. District Court,\n\n\n                                 Southern District of Florida,\n\n                                         Miami, FL, July 21, 2011.\n     Re Nominations of Kathleen Williams and Robert Scola to the \n         U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida.\n\n     Senator Mitch McConnell,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: As Chief Judge of the United States \n     District Court for the Southern District of Florida, I urge \n     you to expedite the Senate's confirmation of Kathleen \n     Williams and Robert Scola to the positions of district judges \n     in our district. I understand that the Judiciary Committee \n     has sent both nominations by unanimous voice vote and is \n     awaiting a vote by the full Senate. Ms. Williams, our \n     district's Federal Public Defender, has been awaiting \n     confirmation for the longest period of any present nominee to \n     the district court in the entire country. State Judge Robert \n     Scola's nomination is of a more recent vintage but the \n     litigants are eagerly awaiting his confirmation.\n       The judgeship Ms. Williams has been nominated to fill has \n     been vacant for two years! At the present time, our district \n     has three vacancies. Unfilled positions in our Court present \n     an undue hardship on the citizens residing in the Southern \n     District of Florida, particularly those with cases pending in \n     the affected division of the Court. Our district is huge and \n     heavily populated. It includes the most populous counties in \n     Florida, Miami-Dade, Broward (where Fort Lauderdale is \n     located) and Palm Beach Counties. The district also includes \n     Monroe, St. Lucie, Highlands, Okeechobee, Martin, and Indian \n     River Counties.\n       We have been laboring under a judicial shortage for quite \n     some time. The Judicial Conference of the United States has \n     for the past several years annually recommended to Congress \n     three additional permanent judgeships and to convert one \n     temporary judgeship into a permanent one.\n       This shortage is exacerbated by the fact that we are one of \n     the busiest district courts in the nation. Our district had \n     10,556 new filings in both criminal and civil cases in 2010, \n     an increase of 6.7% over the year 2000. The latest national \n     statistics (FY 2010) are attached and show that our district \n     is first in ``weighted filings'' in the Eleventh Circuit.\n       In sum, the judicial shortage with three vacancies in our \n     district is becoming acute. For this reason, I ask your \n     assistance in expediting both confirmations. The Judiciary \n     Committee has found the nominees qualified and the people of \n     South Florida eagerly await their service.\n       Please call me if I can provide any additional information. \n     I thank you in advance\n\n[[Page S4862]]\n\n     for your consideration of this important matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Federico A. Moreno,\n                                        Chief U.S. District Judge.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the time be equally charged to both parties.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today the Senate will vote on the \nnomination of Paul Engelmayer to be United States District Judge for \nthe Southern District of New York and Ramona Villagomez Manglona to be \nJudge for the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands. The seat \nto which Mr. Engelmayer is being considered has been deemed a judicial \nemergency. With this vote, we will have confirmed 29 article III \njudicial nominees. Eighteen have been for such judicial emergencies. \nMs. Manglona's confirmation vote marks the second article IV judicial \nconfirmation this year. I am pleased we are moving forward with filling \ntwo more vacancies.\n  We continue to make great progress in processing President Obama's \njudicial nominees. As of today, the Senate has confirmed 60 percent of \nPresident Obama's nominees since the beginning of his Presidency. That \nis not including the two Supreme Court Justices nominated by President \nObama. As I am sure my colleagues recall, those nominations consumed a \nconsiderable amount of time in the committee and on the Senate floor.\n  During this Congress, the Judiciary Committee has held hearings on \nmore than 72 percent of the President's nominees. Another hearing is \nscheduled to take place this Wednesday. During the comparable time \nperiod for President Bush, only 64 percent of President Bush's nominees \nhad hearings by this time. We have also reported 64 percent of the \njudicial nominees, compared to only 56 percent of President Bush's \nnominees.\n  Let me say just a few words about Mr. Engelmayer and then Judge \nManglona. Mr. Engelmayer graduated summa cum laude from Harvard \nUniversity in 1983. He then graduated magna cum laude from Harvard Law \nSchool in 1987. Following law school, the nominee clerked for Judge \nPatricia Wald on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia \nand then for Justice Thurgood Marshall of the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States.\n  After his clerkships, Mr. Engelmayer joined the U.S. Attorney's \nOffice for the Southern District of New York as an assistant U.S. \nattorney. In 1994, he became an assistant to the Solicitor General of \nthe United States. In 2000, the nominee entered private practice with \nWilmer Hale and was later named Partner-in-Charge of the New York \noffice.\n  The ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary has given Mr. \nEngelmayer a unanimous ``Well Qualified'' rating. I support this \nnomination and congratulate him on his professional accomplishments.\n  Now I have a few words about Judge Manglona. Judge Manglona received \nher bachelor off arts degree from the University of California at \nBerkeley in 1990. In 1996, she graduated from the University of New \nMexico School of Law. Following law school, the nominee clerked for the \nSuperior Court of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. She \nthen worked in the Attorney General's Office and in 2002, the Governor \nappointed her attorney general for the Northern Mariana Islands. In \n2003, she was appointed to serve as an associate judge for the Northern \nMariana Islands Superior Court. During her time on the superior court, \nshe has also served as a judge pro tem on the Guam Superior Court and \nthe Guam Supreme Court.\n  The ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary has rated Judge \nManglona unanimously ``Qualified.'' I also support this nomination and \ncongratulate her on her professional accomplishments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. We have an unusual situation. It looks nice outside today. \nThe Sun is shining. But earlier today, if someone looked out the \nwindow, we had some violent storms. They are all over the area. We have \nSenators stuck in airplanes trying to get out of New York. We have one \nSenator traveling from the Midwest stuck in Richmond, VA, now. I think \nit would be in everyone's interest--and I apologize to people who \nworked hard to get back here today--but I think it is in everyone's \ninterest that we not have a vote tonight. We have a lot of people who \nsimply would miss the vote unless we keep it open for a matter of \nhours. I again apologize to people who came here to vote, but I think \nthis is the best thing to do. I have spoken to the Republican leader \nand this is what we should do.\n  I ask unanimous consent the votes scheduled for tonight be vitiated, \nand that on Tuesday, July 26, at 12:15 p.m., the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session and resume consideration of the nominations, Calendar \nNos. 83 and 84, that there be 2 minutes for debate, equally divided in \nthe usual form; that upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate \nproceed to vote without intervening action or debate on Calendar Nos. \n83 and 84, in that order; the motions to reconsider be considered made \nand laid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate; that no \nfurther motions be in order; that any related statements be printed in \nthe Record; and that the President be immediately notified of the \nSenate's action and the Senate then resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/25/senate-section/article/S4862-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4862]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I ask to speak as in morning business. I \ncertainly will not take 10 minutes that the majority leader has \nrequested because I know the Senator from Alabama is eager to speak. I \nwish to make sure I understand where we are with regard to the debt \nceiling.\n  I have an article from The Hill, dated yesterday. It points out--it \nheard the same thing in the speech the rest of the Nation heard when \nthe President spoke--the President said he would be willing to work on \nany plans lawmakers brought to him over the weekend. The President went \non to say:\n\n       The only bottom line I have is that we have to extend this \n     debt ceiling through the next election, into 2013.\n\n  I ask my colleagues what does the election of 2012 have to do with \nthe debt ceiling? What does it have to do with deciding to pay our \nobligations after August 2? What does it have to do with avoiding the \ncalamity we have all heard about from both sides of the aisle and \ncertainly from the administration? It strikes me as very odd that most \ndebt ceiling extensions have been about 7 months during a decade-long \nperiod, and for some reason because of the election of 2012, the \nPresident of the United States wants to extend the deadline past that \nelection into 2013. I think it makes Americans wonder if the President \nis playing politics with this very important issue.\n  The President went on to say in the press conference that we all \nlistened to that he wondered if the Republicans were able to say yes to \nany agreement. That was the President on Friday evening. Now we come to \nWashington, DC today with the clock ticking, 8 days away from a \nsupposed debacle, and I read in today's Wall Street Journal\n\n[[Page S4863]]\n\nthis report by Jamie Dupree, President Obama last night rejected a \nbipartisan deal offered to him by congressional leaders of both parties \nwhich would have provided for a short-term extension of the debt limit \nin order to avoid a U.S. Government default. The agreement involved \nSpeaker Boehner, Senate Majority Leader Reid, and Senate GOP Leader \nMcConnell. In fact, according to this Wall Street Journal article, \nstaffers from Senator Reid and Senator McConnell's offices were working \non the legislative language together on Sunday. When Reid took the \nbipartisan, bicameral plan down to the White House, it was rejected by \nthe President.\n  I ask my colleagues: Who is unable to say yes? The Democratic \nmajority leader of this body said yes to a bipartisan agreement. The \nRepublican Speaker of the House of Representatives, the leader of that \nmajority in the other body, said yes to an agreement. Senator Reid's \ncolleague and friend, the Republican leader, Senator McConnell, said \nyes to a bipartisan agreement, and then Senator Reid was given the task \nof taking it to the President of the United States and the President \nrejected it.\n  I think Americans have a right to ask who is unable to say yes to a \nbipartisan deal that gets us out of this box. Who is playing politics \nwith this issue? The public debt is $14.2 trillion. We meet the \ndeadline a week from tomorrow. The clock is ticking. The President had \nan opportunity to say yes to a bipartisan agreement endorsed by the \nleadership of this Congress and yet he said no. I am calling on this \nPresident, on my President, to do the right thing by the American \npeople and to do the right thing for our country and for our economy \nand ask this bipartisan group of leaders to come back to the White \nHouse and say yes to the agreement which they offered him last night.\n  I thank the President. I thank the Senator from Alabama for allowing \nme to go in front of him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I know we have talked about having an \nopportunity to digest and analyze and score any kind of proposal. I \nunderstand this afternoon the majority leader, Senator Reid, said he \nwould propose legislation tonight and file cloture tonight, and that \nwould, according to the rules of the Senate, move this vote up to early \nWednesday morning. That would give us only tomorrow, 1 day, to digest a \nbill that would impact our spending trajectory for the next decade. I \nwould ask my experienced colleague, who was a distinguished Member of \nthe House and now in the Senate, does that cause him concern?\n  Mr. WICKER. I think absolutely it should cause concern and this is \nsomething both parties have campaigned on in the past, the lack of \ntransparency, the lack of time, things being rushed through at the last \nminute. But my larger point is that on Friday afternoon the President \nwas calling for a plan, any plan. He said there was only one condition: \nWe must be political about it. We must get past the presidential \nreelection in 2012. Then on Sunday night not just any plan was \npresented to the President but a bipartisan plan by both leaders in \nthis body on behalf of their membership and the Republican Speaker of \nthe House who said, we believe we can get this through, and the \nPresident rejected it out of hand. That is the larger point.\n  The point of the Senator from Alabama is well taken. The legislative \nlanguage is important. The agreement in concept is one thing, but as he \nis pointing out, the legislative language is also important. As ranking \nmember of the Budget Committee, he knows full well Members need time to \nsee if the language actually reduced the concepts into writing that can \nbe enforced and work long term to get us out of this horrendous debt \ncrisis we are in. I appreciate the Senator's point.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator. I appreciate that. The point the \nSenator made is tremendously important. All year we have conducted \nSenate business, with regard to the financial future of our country, in \nthe most troubling way. It is unlike anything we have done in our \nhistory. I would say from a structural, systemic circumstance, this \nNation has never had a more serious debt problem. We are borrowing 40 \ncents of every dollar we spend. Yes, we do have a war going on that is \ncosting $150 billion this year. But the deficit this year will be $1.5 \ntrillion. It is not the war. That is only about 10 percent of our \ndeficit, unfortunately.\n  Back in World War II, we could see our way out of the war and into \nour victory, and we saw great growth in the future. But the deficits we \nare now accruing every day, every week, every month are significant \nbecause they are going to be hard to change. We are spending more than \nwe take in and we have got to change. We can change. If we do change we \nwill get this country back on a growth path.\n  I have repeatedly warned against avoiding the normal budget process \nthis year, a process required by law but that this Senate under the \nDemocratic leadership explicitly refused to do--the majority leader \nsaid it would be foolish to produce a budget. We are now about 820 days \nor so without a budget. For over 2 years we have not had a budget for \nthe United States of America, and they never even attempted to move a \nbudget even though a law says we should pass one by April 15. Well, it \ndoesn't put anybody in jail. Maybe that is what it should have done. \nMaybe a bunch of people would be in jail today. Maybe we would have a \nbudget if we had some teeth in the axe. It is the statute of the United \nStates that requires we have a budget and we do not have one.\n  Then we begin to hear the warnings 6 months ago that we would reach a \npoint where we would need to raise the debt limit, the debt ceiling we \nhave. Congress has said: Mr. President, you can borrow money, but only \nso much. You cannot borrow more than the amount, $14-some-odd trillion, \nthat is all. If you need to borrow more, Congress will have to approve \nit. We have the power of the purse under the Constitution.\n  This has been brewing for some time. I have been warning about this, \nsince we have not done our job, since the Budget Committee has not met \nabout these issues, the Appropriations Committee has not met about \nthese issues, the Finance Committee has not met about the tax and \nmandatory entitlement programs that are under their jurisdiction. No \nwork has been done all year. None. We are told not to worry, our \nleaders are going to meet a few times in secret. This little group \nfailed, and this group with the Vice President met and that didn't \nwork. Then they are going to meet with the President, and that didn't \nwork. Finally, last night, as Senator Wicker said, it did appear an \nagreement was reached between the Democratic leadership and the \nRepublican leadership on a bill that at least would get us past this \ndebt crisis. They had the leadership agreement. I have not read it. I \ndo not know what is in it. I am going to know what is in the bill. I \nhave a constitutional responsibility, as do the other 99 Senators here, \nto make a good judgment on it.\n  It is odd that after all of that a bipartisan agreement was reached, \nand the President walked away from it. Now he is going to blame Speaker \nBoehner, who produced a budget. The Republican House produced a far-\nreaching, historic budget that would actually change the debt \ntrajectory of our country and put us on the right path, the path to \nrestoring prosperity and the creation of jobs. This debt is so large it \nis a wet blanket, as Speaker Boehner said. I called it an anchor, a \nweight that is pulling down the economy, as expert economists have told \nus. Not just me. Experts tell us that when you have this much debt, you \nlose 1 million jobs a year that would otherwise be created.\n  We have a serious problem, and I am not pleased about it. I felt all \nalong that this is exactly what was going to happen. Somewhere in the \nback of the minds of the President or the leaders or somebody was the \nidea that they would bring up a plan at the eleventh hour, fiftieth \nminute, bring it to the floor of the Senate, and say: If you don't vote \nit, Members of the Senate, if you don't vote for it, Members of the \nHouse, we are going to have a debt crisis and it will all be your \nfault. Well, I am not interested in that. I am not going to vote for \nany kind of significant legislation, as this is, until I have had a \nchance to read it and think about it. Majority Leader Reid told us of \nhis plan this afternoon and he told us not to worry, he has a 1-page \nsummary. Trust us. He is going to introduce legislation tonight and we \nwill vote\n\n[[Page S4864]]\n\nWednesday morning, and it will be good for America. Just do what I tell \nyou and go along and mind your manners and we will get this thing taken \ncare of. Trust me.\n  Well, the American people have been trusting Washington too long. The \nAmerican people know there is no justification whatsoever in this \ncountry for spending so much money that 40 percent of every dollar we \nspend has to be borrowed. They know better. They know we have no \nbusiness spending $3,700 billion when we take in only $2,200 billion. \nThat is what happened in this last election. They said: Oh, these tea \nparty people, they are not good Americans. They are angry. They are \nmad. That is not good. You are bad people. Well, give me a break. Why \nshouldn't they be? If we had a recall election, we all ought to be \nvoted out of office, I suppose. There is no way we should ever have \nbeen in this situation.\n  Now under the pressure of the American people and fear of the next \nelection, why did the President reject this bipartisan agreement? Well, \nit would require us to meet again next year. We will need to talk about \nmore cuts because the cuts they are talking about are clearly \ninsufficient to meet the challenge we are facing today--clearly \ninsufficient. We have to do more.\n\n  So if a person runs up their credit card too much and they hit the \nlimit and they want the limit raised, the person who is loaning the \nmoney--the American people--would like to know, have you changed your \nhabits? Are you going to do better? Let's see a plan--a budget--a plan \nthat gets us out of this fix. That has been steadfastly rejected by the \nleadership in this Senate all year, and we knew we were heading to this \ndate. So Senator Reid is throwing something out there. Let's talk a \nlittle bit about what appears to be in it.\n  The President has had a friendly press on most of the things he has \nproposed. He proposed a budget--the Democratic Senate never produced \none, but by law the President has to produce one. Every President has \nto produce one every year. So the President produced one this year. The \nlowest annual deficit in that budget would be $740 billion. The highest \ndeficit President Bush ever had was $450 billion, and he was criticized \nfor that. The lowest he would have in 10 years was $750 billion, and in \nthe 10th year it was back over $1 trillion, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office's analysis of his budget. So that is where \nwe are heading. That is the kind of thing the President has submitted \nto us.\n  Do my colleagues know what he said about it? He said: I am proud of \nmy budget. It will have America living within its means.\n  Can we believe the President of the United States said that--that a \nbudget with a lowest annual deficit of over $700 billion was living \nwithin our means?\n  He also said, ``It would add no more to our debt.'' And his budget \ndirector, Mr. Jack Lew, said the same thing. He actually testified to \nthat effect before the Budget Committee. It was breathtaking.\n  So forgive me if I am not buying into a proposal based on one page. \nIt was produced this afternoon. It said we are going to reduce the \ndeficit by $2.7 trillion. Forgive me if I am not buying into that until \nI see it and it has been scored. That is what I think ought to happen \nhere today.\n  By the way, we have heard the debates--and Speaker Boehner used this \nphrase and others have used it: we want to have dollar for dollar \nspending reduction to debt limit increase. What that means is that if \nwe increase the debt ceiling and allow the government to borrow another \n$1 trillion, we should cut spending by $1 trillion. That is just a \nrough idea. I don't know how they came up with that. That is what they \ncame up with.\n  Remember, the debt is still going up every year because we are still \nspending more than we take in. This is like Wimpy in the old ``Popeye'' \ncartoon. Wimpy said: Give me a hamburger today, and I will pay you \ntomorrow. So we are going to get the immediate ability to borrow $1 \ntrillion, $2 trillion more, raising the debt limit that much, on a \npromise that we will reduce spending by that amount over 10 years--not \n1 year but 10 years.\n  This is a dangerous process. This is the kind of rhetoric that has \nput us in the position we are in today, which is that 40 cents of every \ndollar we spend is borrowed. It is what is threatening the financial \nfuture of our country, this kind of thinking in Washington, and we have \nto change that. We have to be honest about our numbers. As the ranking \nRepublican on the Budget Committee, I feel an obligation. And our staff \nis eager to see the legislative language, not a one-page outline, about \nwhat will actually happen with our spending. We want to be sure the \npromises made with this bill are more accurate than the ones President \nObama made when he said his budget would call for us to live within our \nmeans when it plainly does not.\n  I will mention a couple of things at this point that jump out at me \nfrom the one-page outline we have seen.\n  Majority Leader Reid says his plan would produce savings of $2.7 \ntrillion, but really it appears to represent a $1.2 trillion or so \nreduction in discretionary spending, and the rest of it is accrued in \nother ways. Speaker Boehner's proposal has discretionary spending \nreductions of about the same, but what is obvious is that Speaker \nBoehner's commission would reduce spending more and has a target, a \ngoal to reach an additional $1.8 trillion. The one produced by Senator \nReid, on the other hand, mentions a commission, but has no reduction in \nspending as a requirement of that commission. They don't have any \nobligation to produce a reduction in spending.\n  What else is in there? Another factor is that we are now drawing down \nthe cost of our military efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq. Last year, we \nspent a little over $150 billion. This year, we will spend a little \nover $100 billion. The plan is to at least be down to $50 billion in 2 \nor 3 years. So over the 10-year period, there will be about 8 years, \nnearly, at $50 billion or so spent on the war instead of $150 billion. \nThat is part of the plan we have been operating on for a long time. So \n$150 billion for the war is not a baseline projection of the United \nStates. It was never projected to continue at that level. So hopefully \nwe can bring it below $50 billion. Maybe we won't get to $50 billion; I \ndon't know. But what is the reasonable estimate? I think the House \nRepublicans and the President said it would drop to $50 billion, so \nthat should be the baseline projection for the rest of the time. That \nis $1 trillion total. So if we take $1 trillion out of the $2.7 \ntrillion in savings, we are down to $1.7 trillion in savings.\n  Another thing is that since the $1 trillion is war-related spending, \nas Mr. Reid wants it, it is not a real reduction from baseline \nspending. It is always considered to be extra, war-related emergency \nspending. And he claims interest savings on this money as another $200 \nbillion. So now we have about $1.2 trillion right there, overstating \nhis cuts through the elimination of the war. Speaker Boehner does not \ndo that. His numbers are far more accurate and honest and realistic.\n  I also would like to point out that when we talk about spending and \nhow we measure it, we have to know what the baseline is. One reason \nthis country is broke and is in financial crisis is because we claim we \nare cutting spending when we are actually increasing spending.\n  The way it works is the Congressional Budget Office produces an \nassumption that we will increase spending at the rate of inflation or \nsome other rate over a period of years. Then, if we reduce that rate of \nspending increase a little bit, politicians claim they have produced \nsavings, that they have cut spending. But spending is not really \nreduced. Spending is still going up. There are various baselines out \nthere that are used to calculate this, and it is very significant over \n10 years and even more so over 20 years. So we hear people saying: We \nare cutting spending under this plan. So for Speaker Boehner or Senator \nReid, either one of those plans, I am confident will show we are \nspending a good bit more money in the 10th year than we are spending \ntoday.\n  This is confusing to the American people. I am really convinced the \nonly way we can honestly compare the plans is to go back to basics--the \nway families do it: Do you increase your spending or not, based on what \nyou spent last year? You take a flat level, and how much do you \nincrease it over the next year, 2 years, 10 years? How much does it go \nup? That is the way to do it. Then we can compare plans. Then we\n\n[[Page S4865]]\n\ncan see what Speaker Boehner has, what Congressman Ryan has in his \nbudget plan for 10 years. Senator Toomey proposed a very thoughtful 10-\nyear budget plan that balanced our budget in 10 years. That was not \neasy to do, but he did it. We need to be thinking like that and get \naway from this confusing mishmash, which we use to claim that we are \nsaving $1 trillion when really nobody plans for us to be spending $150-\nplus billion on the war in Iraq and Afghanistan for the next 10 years. \nThat money has never been projected to be spent in that fashion.\n  So we are in a situation where it is important for the country to \nreach an agreement and we need to pass something that raises the debt \nceiling for America. I hate to say that, but it is a fact. It would be \ntoo disruptive not to do that. But, in exchange for that, as a part of \nthat process, we truly need to start bringing our house into financial \norder. We are in disarray and discord, but if we were to do that, we \ncould leave this a better country for our children and grandchildren.\n  I know some just want to increase spending and then raise taxes to \npay for it. The Defense Department last year got about a 2-percent \nincrease, a 3-percent increase. Next year, there is projected to be a \n2-percent increase in some of the budget numbers. It might not happen \nbecause we don't have even that much money.\n  But we know how much nondefense discretionary spending increased \nduring this time of record deficits under President Obama's leadership, \nnot counting the almost $900 billion in stimulus money. Baseline, \nnondefense discretionary spending increased 24 percent between 2008 and \n2010, and now we are seeing the biggest deficits ever. President Bush \nnever had any increases in baseline spending like that--never. It is \njust stunning.\n  There was a huge Democratic majority in the Senate and in the House, \nand the President wanted his investments, and he got these huge \nincreases, and now they want to raise taxes to pay for it and keep it \nup there and maintain it. We can't afford to maintain that level. We \nhave to bring it back down to 2009, 2008, 2007 levels. The country is \nnot going to go bankrupt--broke--and people are not going to be thrown \ninto the streets if we return to those levels of spending. If we make \nsome tough choices, the same way cities and counties and families are \ndoing all over America, we can get this house in order. That is what we \nare going to have to do.\n  I look forward to studying plans put forward by the majority leader \nand to studying the plan put forward by Speaker Boehner. The American \npeople need time to know what is in them and what they mean to us in \nterms of taxing and spending, deficits, and interest payments. And then \nCongress needs to have time to vote on it.\n  Again, I repeat my deep frustration that we have not conducted this \nin open, public debate for months now, utilizing the established Senate \nprocedure of regular order. Instead, we have attempted to solve this \nbig problem in secret, behind closed doors, with just a few people. I \nbelieve that is contrary to the historical understanding of the role of \nCongress, and I am not happy about it. I oppose it, I object to it, and \nI expect to have an appropriate amount of time to consider whatever \nplan comes forward.\n\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, this weekend, driving around the Twin \nCities, I was listening to public radio. The host of the program \nintroduced a Republican member of the House Budget Committee. The \nmember, whom I will not name to spare him or her a great deal of \nembarrassment, was asked about the consequences of not raising the debt \nceiling.\n  The member assured the host and listeners that failing to raise the \ndebt ceiling would not create a default for a number of reasons. Among \nthem was, according to this member, we can pay out all the Social \nSecurity checks to seniors because--and I quote--``the money is in the \ntrust fund.''\n  Well, of course, there is $2.6 trillion of assets in the trust fund, \nbut the Social Security trust fund is composed entirely of Treasury \nnotes. Allow me to quote from the Congressional Research Service:\n\n       By law, Social Security revenues credited to the trust fund \n     . . . are invested in non-marketable U.S. government \n     obligations. These obligations are physical (paper) documents \n     issued to the trust fund and held by the Social Security \n     Administration. When the obligations are redeemed, the \n     Treasury must issue a check (a physical document) to the \n     Social Security trust fund for the interest earned on the \n     obligations.\n\n  CRS continues:\n\n       However, unlike a private trust that may hold a variety of \n     assets and obligations of different borrowers, the Social \n     Security trust fund can hold only non-marketable U.S. \n     government obligations. The sale of these obligations by the \n     U.S. government to the Social Security trust fund is federal \n     government borrowing (from itself) and counts against the \n     federal debt limit.\n\n  Now, I have no idea what this Republican member of the House Budget \nCommittee believes is in the Social Security trust fund. Stacks of \nhundred-dollar bills? Gold bricks? Warehouses of freezers with steaks \nin them?\n  To me, it is shocking--shocking--that a Member of Congress--let lone \na member of the House Budget Committee--can be so wildly ignorant of \nthe basic workings of our government. We come to Washington to work \ntogether to solve our Nation's problems. How are we to do that if \nMembers are unwilling or unable to come to even the most rudimentary \nunderstanding of our government?\n  None of us is immune to making mistakes. Yet we find ourselves in \nthis moment of existential crisis, with the full faith and credit of \nthe United States being held hostage by a menagerie of ideologues who \ninvent their own realities and are only too happy to share these \nfantasies with an unsuspecting public.\n  We are playing with disaster. Can we please just stick to the facts? \nThe fact is, if we do not act immediately, we will see a downgrade of \nour credit rating and possibly even default on our debt. Both would be \nentirely counterproductive to our goal of shrinking our deficits and \ngrowing our economy. We cannot control the fantasies of clueless \nideologues, but we must act responsibly and do our jobs. And we must do \nit now.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, what we have done is put in the process our \nefforts, sound legislation to end the budget crisis we are in. It, in \neffect, does everything the Republicans have asked. It is dollar-for-\ndollar; that is, it increases the amount of spending cuts we make to \narrive at $2.7 trillion, which, in effect, would carry the country into \nsometime in 2013.\n  It consists of, as I indicated, what Republicans have agreed upon: \ndiscretionary spending, $1.2 trillion; mandatory, $100 billion; \nsomething called the Overseas Contingency Fund, which is warfighting, \nthat is scored both by CBO and the Office of Management and Budget to \nthe tune of about $1 trillion. That saves about $400 billion in \ninterest. That is $2.7 trillion.\n  There are other issues in this matter, including it allows us to \nfinish our appropriations bills for the next 2 years. We have a joint \ncommittee that will allow us to work to do more for the long term. So \nit is a sound piece of legislation.\n  As I indicated, virtually everything we have in there has been \nsuggested by the Republicans, and now they need to take ``yes'' for an \nanswer. We have given them ``yes.''\n  For example, the Overseas Contingency Fund--this passed the House of \nRepresentatives with 5 Republicans voting no; 230, approximately, \nRepublicans voted yes. Over here in the Senate, the same thing came up. \nForty Republicans voted for it.\n  So we should move on. But the sad part is it appears my friends in \nthe House of Representatives are being led by a very determined group \nto have us default on our debt. They are driven by probably 80 \nRepublicans who seem to be calling the shots. It is unfortunate.\n  We cannot have a short-term extension. That is what their legislation \nis that the Speaker indicated he was going to send to us today. Every \nDemocrat--not virtually every Democrat--every Democrat will vote \nagainst that legislation. The President, if there was some way it \npassed--which it will not--would veto it. They are wasting the time of \nthe American people. Now is the time to do what legislators must do, \nand that is compromise. But my friends in the House, they do not even \nhave to compromise. All they have to do is say ``yes'' because we have \ngiven them what they have asked for.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/25/senate-section/article/S4866-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4866-S4867]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                        Staff Sergeant Lex Lewis\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota.

As a \ncavalry scout in the B Troop, 1st Squadron, 10th Cavalry Regiment, 4th \nInfantry Division, of Fort Carson, CO, Staff Sergeant Lewis was serving \nin support of Operation Enduring Freedom. On July 15, 2011, he died of \ninjuries sustained when his dismounted patrol received small arms fire \nin Farah Province, Afghanistan.\n  A graduate of Rapid City Central High School, Staff Sergeant Lewis \nbegan his military career in the Navy, where he was stationed in Japan. \nHe joined the Army in 1999 and was on his third deployment, having \npreviously served two tours in Iraq. From 2006-2007 Staff Sergeant \nLewis served in Rapid City as a member of the South Dakota Army \nNational Guard. During his military career, his awards and decorations \nincluded two Army Commendation Medals and five Army Achievement Medals. \nHe was posthumously promoted to the rank of Staff Sergeant and awarded \na Bronze Star Medal and a Purple Heart.\n  Staff Sergeant Lewis will be remembered as a dedicated soldier and a \ngood friend. He demonstrated professionalism in his job and was known \nas a reliable man who you could count on. Former colleague Sgt. Dwayne \nGraves recalls, ``He was just a real likeable guy. He'd do anything for \nyou. You definitely want him watching your back.'' As a young man, \nStaff Sergeant Lewis knew he wanted to serve his country. His mother \nremembers his childhood spent playing soldier. He will be deeply missed \nby those who survive him: his wife Molly, step-daughter Ariel, \nstepbrother Frank, half-sister, Lacy, and his mother, Betty.\n  Staff Sergeant Lewis gave his all for his soldiers and his country. \nOur Nation owes him a debt of gratitude, and the best way to honor his \nlife is to\n\n[[Page S4867]]\n\nemulate his commitment to our country.

Bob could disagree without being disagreeable \nand always respected the opinions of others. It was that ability that \nhelped him to forge good legislation for the people of North Dakota.\n  As a public servant, as a citizen, Bob's deep love of North Dakota \ninformed every decision he made in the legislature, and his legacy \ntoday is a more vibrant and secure State than it was when he was first \nelected to represent District 30 in 1993. His remarkable service and \ndevotion to North Dakota benefited our State and our people in \ncountless ways over the years, helping to bridge differences and \nimprove the quality of life for all North Dakotans.\n  Mikey and I extend our deepest sympathy to his wife Kathy and the \nentire Stenehjem family on this tragic loss. Our thoughts and prayers \ngo out to them, and we pray that they will take comfort in knowing that \nhe served his State and his fellow North Dakotans well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/25/senate-section/article/S4867-2", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4867]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DR. MAX HARRY WEIL\n\n Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, today I wish to note \nthe golden anniversary of an event that has saved thousands and \nthousands of lives.\n  It was 50 years ago this year that the Institute of Critical Care \nMedicine was founded as a nonprofit public foundation at the University \nof Southern California School of Medicine.\n  Thus was born the concept that life-threatened patients have a \nsubstantially better chance of survival if minute-to-minute care is \nprovided by highly trained physicians and nurses in emergency rooms and \nin special intensive care, coronary care, and postoperative care units.\n  This concept that dangerously ill patients have a better chance at \nrecovery under the care of specially trained physicians and nurses in \nemergency rooms and intensive care units is standard today but it was \nrevolutionary in 1961.\n  Considered one of the fathers of critical care medicine who founded \nthe Institute of Critical Care Medicine a half century ago, Dr. Max \nHarry Weil is also the founding president of the Weil Institute of \nCritical Care Medicine that continues to operate in Rancho Mirage, CA.\n  My colleague, Senator Barbara Boxer would like to join me in \nrecognizing Dr. Weil and his institute and offer our congratulations on \na half century of medical success and best wishes on many more \nsuccessful years to come.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, Senator \nNelson, in recognizing an extraordinary Californian who has done so \nmuch, not just to save lives in his community but to advance the \npractice of medicine in order to save lives around the world.\n  Recognized as one of the fathers of critical care medicine, 50 years \nago Dr. Weil cofounded the Weil Institute of Critical Care Medicine, an \ninternational center for clinical education and research in Rancho \nMirage, CA.\n  The institute is renowned for conducting groundbreaking research into \nfinding new ways of monitoring and dealing with life-threatening \ncirculatory shock, heart failure, acute lung failure and infections.\n  In addition to this impressive record, Dr. Weil led the institute's \nwork in training members of the community in CPR, giving thousands of \nCalifornians the basic training they need to help save lives.\n  I know that I join thousands of Californians and patients who have \nbenefitted from Dr. Weil's work many of them without even knowing it in \nthanking him for his dedication and his service to our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/25/senate-section/article/S4867-3", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4867]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/25/senate-section/article/S4867-4", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4867]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/25/senate-section/article/S4867-5", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4867-S4868]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   REPORT DECLARING A NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO SIGNIFICANT \n              TRANSNATIONAL CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS--PM 15\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport and papers; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 \nU.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), I hereby report that I have issued an \nExecutive Order (the ``order'') declaring a national emergency with \nrespect to the unusual and extraordinary threat that significant \ntransnational criminal organizations pose to the national security, \nforeign policy, and economy of the United States.\n  Organized crime is no longer a local or regional problem; it has \nbecome a danger to international stability. Significant transnational \ncriminal organizations have become increasingly sophisticated and \ndangerous to the United States, and their activities have reached such \nscope and gravity that they destabilize the international system. These \ngroups have taken advantage of globalization and other factors to \ndiversify their geographic scope and range of activities. They have \nincreased and deepened their ties to governments and the international \nfinancial system, relying not only on bribery and violence, but also \nmore and more on the ability to exploit differences among countries and \nto create and maintain legal facades to hide illicit activities.\n  The specific harms that significant transnational criminal \norganizations threaten today are many. They corrupt--and in some cases \nco-opt--governments, thereby destabilizing them and weakening \ndemocratic institutions and the rule of law. They threaten U.S. \neconomic interests by subverting, exploiting, and distorting legitimate \nmarkets, and could gain influence in strategic sectors of the world \neconomy.\n  Significant transnational criminal organizations that engage in \ncybercrime threaten sensitive public and private computer networks, \nundermine the integrity of the international financial system, and \nimpose costs on the American consumer. Those that engage in the theft \nof intellectual property not only erode U.S. competitiveness, but also \nendanger the public health and safety through the distribution of \ntainted and counterfeit goods. Many of them also engage in drug \ntrafficking.\n  Finally, significant transnational criminal organizations \nincreasingly support the activities of other dangerous persons. Some of \nthese organizations are involved in arms smuggling, which can \nfacilitate and aggravate violent civil conflicts. Others are\n\n[[Page S4868]]\n\ninvolved in human smuggling, exacerbating the problem of forced labor. \nThere is also evidence of growing ties between significant \ntransnational criminal organizations and terrorists.\n  The Executive Order I have issued today is one part of a \ncomprehensive strategy to address the growing threat of transnational \norganized crime. The order targets significant transnational criminal \norganizations and the networks that support them, striking at the core \nof those networks--their ability and need to move money. It does this \nby blocking the property and interests in property of four \ntransnational criminal organizations, listed in the Annex to the order, \nthat currently pose significant threats to U.S. domestic and foreign \neconomic interests, as well as to U.S. promotion of transparency and \nstability in the international political and financial systems. The \norder provides criteria for the further blocking of persons determined \nby the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Attorney \nGeneral and the Secretary of State:\n  to be a foreign person that constitutes a significant transnational \ncriminal organization;\n  to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, \nmaterial, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in \nsupport of, any person whose property and interests in property are \nblocked pursuant to the order; or\n  to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act \nfor or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property \nand interests in property are blocked pursuant to the order.\n  I have delegated to the Secretary of the Treasury the authority, in \nconsultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of State, to \ntake such actions, including the promulgation of rules and regulations, \nand to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA as may be \nnecessary to carry out the purposes of the order.\n  The order is effective at 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on July \n25, 2011. All executive agencies of the United States Government are \ndirected to take all appropriate measures within their authority to \ncarry out the provisions of the order.\n  I am enclosing a copy of the Executive Order I have issued.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, July 24, 2011.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/25/senate-section/article/S4868-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4868]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:09 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Clerk be \ndirected to request the Senate to return to the House of \nRepresentatives the bill (H.R. 1309) to extend the authorization of the \nnational flood insurance program, to achieve reforms to improve the \nfinancial integrity and stability of the program, and to increase the \nrole of private markets in the management of flood insurance risk, and \nfor other purposes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/25/senate-section/article/S4868-2", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4868]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-2619.

A bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal \nService located at 462 Washington Street, Woburn, Massachusetts, as the \n``Officer John Maguire Post Office''; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, last December, in the middle of a New \nEngland blizzard, armed robbers descended on the Kohl's department \nstore in Woburn, MA. They threatened the employees of the store and \nfled with money and jewelry. Officer John ``Jack'' Maguire, on duty \nthat night, rushed to the scene in his cruiser. Responding to his \nfellow officer's call for assistance in a foot chase, Officer Maguire \nblocked the gunman's path with his cruiser and got out of his vehicle \nto confront the gunman. The two exchanged gunfire, which killed the \ngunman and left Officer Maguire mortally wounded. Officer Maguire's \ndeath marks the first officer killed in the line of duty in Woburn, MA, \nsince the department was established back in 1847.\n  On behalf of the Maguire family, Woburn Mayor Scott Galvin, Woburn \nChief of Police Richard Kelley, and the residents of Woburn, I am \nintroducing legislation to rename the U.S. Post Office on Washington \nStreet in Woburn the Officer John Maguire Post Office.\n  This post office is only a few hundred yards from the spot where \nOfficer Maguire was killed. I believe it is a fitting honor to a public \nservant who gave his life protecting the city of Woburn. It is my hope \nthat when people pass by the Post Office on Washington Street, they \nwill be reminded of the sacrifices made by both Officer John ``Jack'' \nMaguire and his family.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Crapo):\n  S. 1413. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \ntemporarily increase the investment tax credit for geothermal energy \nproperty; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague from \nIdaho, Sen. Mike Crapo, in introducing the Geothermal Tax Parity Act of \n2011. This legislation will modify an existing investment tax credit \nfor geothermal energy authorized under Section 48 of the Federal tax \ncode. Although both solar energy and geothermal energy projects are \neligible for an investment tax credit under Section 48, they are not \nequal. While I am a strong supporter of solar energy technology and \nsupport the solar energy tax credit, I am also a strong advocate for \nhaving a level playing field when it comes to government incentives. \nThat is why this bill is called the Geothermal Tax Parity Act, because \nit will create parity in the tax code for these two important renewable \nenergy resources.\n  This bill would provide geothermal energy with the same 30 percent \ninvestment tax credit that is now available to solar energy and fuel \ncell technologies in Section 48 and extend this 30 percent tax credit \nfor geothermal through December 31, 2016, as it is for these other \ntechnologies. Without this legislation, new geothermal energy projects \nwould be allowed only a 10 percent investment tax credit under Section \n48. This legislation will create a more level playing field among \nclean, renewable energy technologies and help stimulate investment in \ngeothermal energy projects.\n  Geothermal energy can provide a continuous supply of renewable energy \nwith very few environmental impacts. Although the United States has \nmore geothermal capacity than any other country, this potential energy \nresource has not been widely developed. This is due in large part to \nthe high initial cost and risk involved in locating and developing \ngeothermal resources. Extending the 30 percent tax credit through 2016 \nwill help geothermal developers obtain the financing they need to make \ninvestments in exploration and development.\n  This legislation is identical to a bipartisan companion bill, H.R. \n2408, that our colleagues from the Pacific Northwest, Rep. David \nReichert from Washington and Rep. Earl Blumenauer from Oregon have \nsponsored in the House.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1413\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

If a committee fails to report the joint \n     committee bill within that period, it shall be in order to \n     move that the House discharge the committee from further \n     consideration of the bill. Such a motion shall not be in \n     order after the last committee authorized to consider the \n     bill reports it to the House or after the House has disposed \n     of a motion to discharge the bill. The previous question \n     shall be considered as ordered on the motion to its adoption \n     without intervening motion except 20 minutes of debate \n     equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an \n     opponent. If such a motion is adopted, the House shall \n     proceed immediately to consider the joint committee bill in \n     accordance with paragraphs (2) and (3). A motion to \n     reconsider the vote by which the motion is disposed of shall \n     not be in order.\n       (2) Proceeding to consideration.--After the last committee \n     authorized to consider a joint committee bill reports it to \n     the House or has been discharged (other than by motion) from \n     its consideration, it shall be in order to move to proceed to \n     consider the joint committee bill in the House. Such a motion \n     shall not be in order after the House has disposed of a \n     motion to proceed with respect to the joint committee bill. \n     The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the \n     motion to its adoption without intervening motion. A motion \n     to reconsider the vote by which the motion is disposed of \n     shall not be in order.\n       (3) Consideration.--The joint committee bill shall be \n     considered as read. All points of order against the joint \n     committee bill and against its consideration are waived. The \n     previous question shall be considered as ordered on the joint \n     committee bill to its passage without intervening motion \n     except 2 hours of debate equally divided and controlled by \n     the proponent and an opponent and one motion to limit debate \n     on the joint committee bill. A motion to reconsider the vote \n     on passage of the joint committee bill shall not be in order.\n       (4) Vote on passage.--The vote on passage of the joint \n     committee bill shall occur not later than December 23, 2011.\n       (c) Expedited Procedure in the Senate.--\n       (1) Committee consideration.--A joint committee bill \n     introduced in the Senate under subsection (a) shall be \n     jointly referred to the committee or committees of \n     jurisdiction, which committees shall report the bill without \n     any revision and with a favorable recommendation, an \n     unfavorable recommendation, or without recommendation, not \n     later than December 9, 2011. If any committee fails to report \n     the bill within that period, that committee shall be \n     automatically discharged from consideration of the bill, and \n     the bill shall be placed on the appropriate calendar.\n       (2) Motion to proceed.--Notwithstanding Rule XXII of the \n     Standing Rules of the Senate, it is in order, not later than \n     2 days of session after the date on which a joint committee \n     bill is reported or discharged from all committees to which \n     it was referred, for the majority leader of the Senate or the \n     majority leader's designee to move to proceed to the \n     consideration of the joint committee bill. It shall also be \n     in order for any Member of the Senate to move to proceed to \n     the consideration of the joint committee bill at any time \n     after the conclusion of such 2-day period. A motion to \n     proceed is in order even though a previous motion to the same \n     effect has been disagreed to. All points of order against the \n     motion to proceed to the joint committee bill are waived. The \n     motion to proceed is not debatable. The motion is not subject \n     to a motion to postpone. A motion to reconsider the vote by \n     which the motion is agreed to or disagreed to shall not be in \n     order. If a motion to proceed to the consideration of the \n     joint committee bill is agreed to, the joint committee bill \n     shall remain the unfinished business until disposed of.\n       (3) Consideration.--All points of order against the joint \n     committee bill and against consideration of the joint \n     committee bill are waived. Consideration of the joint \n     committee bill and of all debatable motions and appeals in \n     connection therewith shall not exceed a total of 30 hours \n     which shall be divided equally between the Majority and \n     Minority Leaders or their designees. A motion further to \n     limit debate on the joint committee bill is in order, shall \n     require an affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members \n     duly chosen and sworn, and is not debatable. Any debatable \n     motion or appeal is debatable for not to exceed 1 hour, to be \n     divided equally between those favoring and those opposing the \n     motion or appeal. All time used for consideration of the \n     joint committee bill, including time used for quorum calls \n     and voting, shall be counted against the total 30 hours of \n     consideration.\n       (4) No amendments.--An amendment to the joint committee \n     bill, or a motion to postpone, or a motion to proceed to the \n     consideration of other business, or a motion to recommit the \n     joint committee bill, is not in order.\n       (5) Vote on passage.--If the Senate has voted to proceed to \n     the joint committee bill, the vote on passage of the joint \n     committee bill shall occur immediately following the \n     conclusion of the debate on a joint committee bill, and a \n     single quorum call at the conclusion of the debate if \n     requested. The vote on passage of the joint committee bill \n     shall occur not later than December 23, 2011.\n       (6) Rulings of the chair on procedure.--Appeals from the \n     decisions of the Chair relating to the application of the \n     rules of the Senate, as the case may be, to the procedure \n     relating to a joint committee bill shall be decided without \n     debate.\n       (d) Amendment.--The joint committee bill shall not be \n     subject to amendment in either the House of Representatives \n     or the Senate.\n       (e) Consideration by the Other House.--\n       (1) In general.--If, before passing the joint committee \n     bill, one House receives from the other a joint committee \n     bill--\n       (A) the joint committee bill of the other House shall not \n     be referred to a committee; and\n       (B) the procedure in the receiving House shall be the same \n     as if no joint committee bill had been received from the \n     other House until the vote on passage, when the joint \n     committee bill received from the other House shall supplant \n     the joint committee bill of the receiving House.\n       (2) Revenue measure.--This subsection shall not apply to \n     the House of Representatives if the joint committee bill \n     received from the Senate is a revenue measure.\n       (f) Rules to Coordinate Action With Other House.--\n       (1) Treatment of joint committee bill of other house.--If \n     the Senate fails to introduce or consider a joint committee \n     bill under this section, the joint committee bill of the \n     House shall be entitled to expedited floor procedures under \n     this section.\n       (2) Treatment of companion measures in the senate.--If \n     following passage of the joint committee bill in the Senate, \n     the Senate then receives the joint committee bill from the \n     House of Representatives, the House-passed joint committee \n     bill shall not be debatable. The vote on passage of the joint \n     committee bill in the Senate shall be considered to be the \n     vote on passage of the joint committee bill received from the \n     House of Representatives.\n       (3) Vetoes.--If the President vetoes the joint committee \n     bill, debate on a veto message in the Senate under this \n     section shall be 1 hour equally divided between the majority \n     and minority leaders or their designees.\n       (g) Loss of Privilege.--The provisions of this section \n     shall cease to apply to the joint committee bill if--\n       (1) the joint committee fails to vote on the report or \n     proposed legislative language required under section \n     201(b)(3)(B)(i) by November 23, 2011; or\n       (2) the joint committee bill does not pass both Houses by \n     December 23, 2011.\n\n     SEC. 303.

RULEMAKING.\n\n       The provisions of this title are enacted by Congress--\n       (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate, respectively, and as such \n     they shall be considered as part of the rules of each House, \n     respectively, or of that House to which they specifically \n     apply, and such rules shall supersede other rules only to the \n     extent that they are inconsistent therewith; and\n       (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of \n     either House to change such rules (so far as relating to such \n     House) at any time, in the same manner, and to the same \n     extent as in the case of any other rule of such House.\n\n                         TITLE IV--PUBLIC DEBT\n\n     SEC. 401.
