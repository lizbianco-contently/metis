Madam President, following leader remarks, if any, there \nwill be an hour of morning business, with the majority controlling the \nfirst half and the Republicans controlling the final half. Following \nmorning business, the Senate will resume consideration of the motion to \nproceed to the America Invents Act.\n  The Senate will recess from 12:30 until 2:15 for our weekly party \nconferences. At 2:30, there will be 30 minutes of tribute to the late \nSenator Mark Hatfield of Oregon, and I would indicate that if people \nare unable to come during that 30 minutes, I would solicit their \nstatements so that we can put them together, as we often do in these \nsituations, so they are in that nice little booklet people can look \nthrough at a later time.\n  I would say, Madam President, that I had the good fortune of being \nable to serve with Mark Hatfield--a treasure of a man. We have had \ngreat leaders from Oregon, but certainly he was equal to any of them--a \nman of great character who was not bound by party. He was bound by what \nhe thought was best for this country.\n  I had the good fortune to travel on a codel he led. It was a \nwonderful trip, led by this great statesman. We went into the Soviet \nUnion--Mongolia--and saw Lake Baikal and found that the Soviets had not \nruined this great Alpine glacier lake. There are only two in the world. \nOne is in Nevada and California--we share Lake Tahoe. But Lake Baikal \nis one thing the Soviets didn't ruin. Anyway, it was a trip I will \nalways remember, not only where we went but who led that trip.\n  I will give a more complete statement at a later time regarding Mark \nHatfield, a man for whom I had great respect and admiration. He was \nreally a role model, in my mind, for what a Senator should be.\n  We expect to be in consideration of the patent bill today. I hope the \nRepublicans will let us get on that. It is too bad we had to move to \nproceed to it, but we did. I hope we don't have to use the full 30 \nhours, and I hope I don't have to file cloture again. I hope there are \na couple of amendments and then we can get rid of this bill as early as \npossible.\n  We have a lot to do. We have so much to do in this work period--the \nhighway bill, the patent bill, FEMA, and trade issues. We need to \ncomplete all those matters before we leave here in just a few weeks. We \nhave to take a break because of the holidays coming up toward the end \nof this month.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/07/senate-section/article/S5347-7", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5347-S5348]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--H.J.

Madam President, yesterday morning a man walked into a \npancake house in Carson City, NV, our capital, and proceeded to--with, \nI am told, an AK-47--first shoot and kill some poor woman outside the \npancake house, and he then walked inside and started shooting with this \nautomatic weapon and killed three National Guardsmen and another \ninnocent person. We have a number of people who are in the hospital, \nand we hope no more die. We are still learning the details of this \ntragedy, but we do know five are dead. The shooter then killed himself \nfollowing this rampage he went on.\n  The National Guardsmen--as I understand, there were five of them \nthere having breakfast prior to their duties when this madman walked in \nand killed them. One of the five was a woman who was an assistant to \none of my outstanding employees, a colonel in the Nevada Army National \nGuard. He is an airman, and she was his assistant when he does his duty \nout there. She was killed.\n  It is sad, this violence around us, even in little Carson City, NV, \nwhere citizen soldiers--sacrificing their time to defend our country--\nare killed having pancakes at a little restaurant. My thoughts go out \nto the victims, and I appreciate their commitment to Nevada and this \ncountry.\n  What else can you say, Madam President? Your heart goes out to these \npeople who are going through such a turmoil today, trying to figure out \nwhy this happened. It is hard to imagine such a terrible act taking \nplace in this quiet little town. The legislature is out of session, \nwhich is when the town picks up a little bit. There is not much going \non in Carson City, not as you would have with the buzz of a capital \nwhen the legislature is in session. I spent three legislative sessions \nin Carson City. My kids went to school in Carson City when I was the \nLieutenant Governor.\n  I wish all the citizens of Carson City well as they begin the process \nof healing after this shocking event.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/07/senate-section/article/S5348-2", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5348-S5349]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              JOB CREATION\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, this fall the Democrats are hoping to find \nRepublican allies willing to reach across the aisle for the sake of \ncreating jobs in America, for the sake of putting people back to work. \nFor 8 months now, Republicans have wasted our time on partisan politics \nregarding issues that should have been so simple, such as funding the \ngovernment for last year. We were forced to deal with that for months. \nThen, when we finished that, we went to do something that happens as a \nmatter of fact around here. Not that it is unimportant, but there is no \nreason for our country to default on the debts we have. Extending the \ndebt ceiling doesn't allow us to spend money on more items, it simply \nallows us to pay our debts.\n  Take, for example, Ronald Reagan. Ronald Reagan is somebody whom \nRepublicans idolize, and I have no problem with that. He was a good \nPresident and did some good things for our country--lots of good \nthings. I liked him very much as a person and as a President. He asked \nus 18 different times to raise the debt ceiling, and we did it every \ntime--every time. But this time, no thanks. The Republicans forced us \nto spend months on raising the debt ceiling.\n  They have also used unrelated amendments and procedural stall tactics \nto kill good pieces of legislation that have always had the support of \nDemocrats and Republicans. Take, for example, the Economic Development \nAdministration. They blocked that, something that has been going on for \n35 years creating jobs. This piece of legislation alone would have \ncreated 314,000 jobs. They killed it. The EDA has worked with little \nbusinesses, universities, and economically challenged areas to create \njobs, as I said, for three decades. Actually, it has been 4\\1/2\\ \ndecades.\n  For nearly 2 months, they held up efforts to reauthorize the Small \nBusiness Innovation and Research Program before finally killing it \naltogether. This legislation would have helped small businesses, small \ntechnology companies, which have invented everything from the electric \ntoothbrush to how to put armor on a Bradley fighting vehicle. These \nsmall business innovation loans were terrific for bringing out the \ninnovation and creativity of the American people, creating thousands of \njobs. They forced that bill off the floor.\n  The fate of these two pieces of legislation alone cost more than one-\nhalf million jobs--more than 500,000 jobs. But not only did they take \naway these two pieces of legislation--and there are many others but \nspeaking of these two--their obstructionistic tactics also cost us lots \nof time. Every moment wasted on procedural hurdles--and we have spent \nmonths on these useless amendments--was a moment we weren't creating \njobs.\n  Republicans held up the work of Congress for months in the hope of \ndefeating the President. And this is not something I have made up. My \ncounterpart, the Republican leader, has said that is his No. 1 issue--\nmaking sure President Obama is not reelected. But this effort to defeat \nPresident Obama has also held up our economic recovery. We saw the toll \nin last month's job report, showing unemployment holding steady. For \nthe eighth month in a row we have created private-sector jobs--we \ndidn't create many--last month, about 20,000.\n  Because of what is going on around the country, with the Republicans' \nausterity programs, there are lots of government jobs being cut. Each \nof us, from New York, Illinois, and Nevada, has had local governments \nreally being cut to the bone--police and fire. These are the jobs that \npeople need very much.\n  Madam President, I hope the Republicans have gotten the stalling \ntactics out of their system and really will work with us to create \njobs. Hopefully, the Senate is now moving forward with this patent \nbill, the America Invents Act. This bill will reform the Nation's \noutdated patent system that has almost 1 million patents waiting to be \nlooked at. Any one of those patents could be a new benefit--something \nthat will create jobs and allow people who have such great ingenuity in \nAmerica to put their product on line.\n  We are told that this reform of our Nation's outdated patent system \nwill allow us to create almost 300,000 jobs, and it will clear up a 3-\nyear backlog in patent applications so inventors might be able to \ninvent the next iPod or iPad or electric car or whatever other \ninteresting thing that makes America so great. I hope the spirit of \nbipartisanship comes into being now, because Congress and this country \ncannot afford to waste any more time.\n  There are two things we can do right away to create lots of jobs. \nFirst, extend the authorization of the FAA bill. Let me explain what \nthis is all about.\n  We passed an FAA bill, a good bill, passed overwhelmingly, Democrats \nand Republicans. It went to the House and they put it in some dark hole \nover there, and finally they gave us a bill back. It is different than \nour bill, and here is how it is different. The National Mediation Board \nset a new rule. It is something called democracy. What it means is that \nin a labor election, the majority wins. Under Republican dominance in \nyears past, if you had a group of people who were trying to be \nunionized, and let's say there were 1,000 and that is how many were in \nthe work unit and there was an election held and 600 people turned out \nfor that election, 450 voted, yes, we think we should be able to \ncollectively bargain with our employer, under the old rules that is not \nenough; 450 out of 600 is not enough. You would have to get a majority \nof the people in the unit.\n  I ask my friend from New York, the Presiding Officer, and my friend \nfrom Illinois, because I have asked myself, under rules like that, none \nof us would have been elected. Of the millions and millions of people \nin New York and Illinois and the 3 million people in Nevada, I won by 5 \npercent last election. I got a majority of the people who were \nregistered to vote. That is how you win in America, not a majority of \neveryone in the State, because no one would be elected if that in fact \nwere the case.\n  But that is how the Republicans want to change the rules. They want \ngo back\n\n[[Page S5349]]\n\nand say a simple majority of those voting is not enough. You have to \nhave a majority of everybody in the union. And, as I indicated, based \non our elections, it would mean each of us would have to get a majority \nof everyone in the State.\n  So they stuck that provision in the bill saying, no, a majority is \nnot enough; you have to have a majority of everyone in the unit. It is \nthis kind of antidemocratic issue they placed in this legislation. I \nwould hope they would take that out. They haven't been willing to do \nthat.\n  If we can reform our antiquated air traffic control system, it will \nbring us into the modern world where we are no longer depending on \nSecond World War technology; that is, radar, and we can move into the \nmodern world as most all countries have, where we would have GPS, and \nit will create lots and lots of jobs, hundreds of thousands of jobs \nwhich are so badly needed. Ray LaHood, Secretary of Transportation, \nthinks it is essential that we get this done for the safety and \nsecurity of our Nation and certainly to create lots and lots of jobs.\n  Second, we must authorize Federal spending for our Nation's highways. \nAbout 1.8 million construction jobs in highway and mass transit \nprojects are at stake. If we don't extend this bill, they will be gone, \nalmost 2 million jobs.\n  So we will be happy to consider a bipartisan idea to get the economy \ngoing again. I have talked about two things.\n  Here are two ideas Republicans have supported in the past: payroll \ntax cuts and extension of unemployment insurance. Extending the payroll \ntax cut could save 972,000 American jobs next year alone. Extending \nunemployment insurance during these tough economic times would save \n528,000 American jobs. They have agreed to these in the past.\n  Speaker Boehner and Leader Cantor wrote to the President yesterday \nand they said, Our differences should not preclude us from taking \naction in areas where there is common ground.\n  I hope they would agree that extending unemployment benefits and \ncutting the payroll tax are agreements that are common sense. So I \nagree with them, our differences should not preclude us from taking \naction in areas where there is common agreement. Let's start with the \nfour commonsense measures I have talked about: the FAA bill; of course, \nwe have to do the extension of the payroll tax cuts; do the \nunemployment insurance; and, of course, FAA. I would hope we can move \non these as quickly as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/07/senate-section/article/S5349-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5349]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, tomorrow night we will hear a speech \nfrom the President of the United States about an issue that affects \nevery single one of us in America. It affects millions in a personal \nway and all of us indirectly. It is the state of our economy. It is an \neconomy that has been wracked by a recession which has gone on way too \nlong. Even the President concedes that we had hoped we would have \nemerged at this point, but we still have not. I think it is important \nfor us to focus on the reality of life even for working families in \nAmerica. Too many working families today are struggling to survive \npaycheck to paycheck.\n  Over the last 10 or 20 years, we have seen a decline in the rate of \ngrowth in real wages, which means that families, even working families, \naren't earning enough to keep up with the cost of living. They are \nfalling a little bit behind each year.\n  They recently surveyed working families across America and asked them \na basic question. They said: If you had an emergency in your family and \nneeded to come up with $2,000 in the next 30 days, could you find that \n$2,000 either in your savings or borrowed? Forty-seven percent of \nworking families said they could not come up with $2,000 in 30 days. \nNow $2,000 is the cost of an uneventful trip to an emergency room. It \nis an indication of the vulnerability of families all across America.\n  I am also concerned about the fact that, as we speak about the \neconomy, we know many families are doing the right thing, trying to \nshed debt. We see the credit card debt in America declining as fewer \nand fewer people borrow against their credit cards, understanding the \ninterest rates they are going to pay are way too high and it is \nimpossible to keep up with your debt if you pile it all on credit \ncards. People are reluctant to purchase because they are afraid of \ndebt, and vulnerable, with the thought of losing their jobs or perhaps \nseeing a decline in their wages. That is the reality of life for \nworking families across America. It is the reality I have seen in \nIllinois and a reality that affects us nationwide. The President will \naddress that tomorrow night, as he should.\n  I think there are ways to deal with it, but here is the caution I \nwish to add: We are fixed on the theme of our Nation's deficit and \ndebt, and we should be, because as we borrow 40 cents for every dollar \nwe spend, we create an unsustainable situation for future generations. \nThat is a fact.\n  I have been party to the Bowles-Simpson Commission, where I voted for \ntheir report. I have worked with the Gang of Six, a bipartisan effort \nin the Senate which has more than 30 Senators showing an interest in \nthis approach. So I seriously believe this deficit and debt are a \nproblem for us in the long term. But I might remind my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle that Bowles-Simpson, this bipartisan \nPresidential commission, concluded that we should not hit the brakes on \nspending, should not hit the brakes on government activity too soon \nbecause of the recession. In fact, they recommended that we wait \nanother year, with a serious effort to reduce the deficit coming after \nthe recession.\n  The logic behind it is obvious. It is virtually impossible to balance \nthe budget of the United States with 14 million people out of work. You \nneed to put Americans back to work earning a good paycheck, paying \ntheir taxes, and then you can start building this economy and building \ntoward a balanced budget. I hope we keep that in mind as we talk about \nwhat we are facing, as we try to create a climate to create more jobs \nin America.\n  It is interesting to me, the President will propose to extend the \npayroll tax cut for working families across America. It accounts for 2 \npercent of income. That, to me, is sensible. Put spending power in the \nhands of working families, lower and middle-income families. These are \nthe people who are struggling paycheck to paycheck. We have done that. \nWe should continue to do that.\n  The criticism from the Republican side of the aisle is, no, you \nshouldn't allow a tax cut for middle-income families and those in lower \nincome categories unless you pay for it. Interestingly enough, that is \nexactly the opposite position from what they took when they talked \nabout tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. When the Republicans \nwanted to see tax cuts for those making over $250,000 a year, they say \nwe don't have to pay for it. But when we talk about tax cuts for \nworking families, middle-income families, all of a sudden they become \ndeficit hawks and say you have to pay for those tax cuts. I think we \nshould continue the 2-percent payroll tax cuts to help working \nfamilies. I think that is good. I also think we ought to extend \nunemployment benefits.\n\n[[Page S5350]]\n\n  I spent my time in August in Illinois visiting unemployment offices, \nwhere I met a lot of people who are struggling every single day to \napply for jobs, sometimes four and five applications a day, and many \ntimes without success. They are doing their best to pick up new skills \nat community colleges and training courses. They are trying to make \ntheir resumes look a little more attractive, working to do so, and they \nare running into a brick wall time after time. Some are in extremely \ndifficult circumstances. Extending unemployment compensation at this \npoint in our economy is absolutely essential. It is the right and \ncaring and humane thing to do, and it also injects money into the \neconomy. The President will call for this, and I think he is right. The \nRepublicans have said we have to pay for that unemployment \ncompensation. Again, it is hard to follow their logic as they offer \nmillions of dollars in tax relief for millions of people, refuse to end \nthe tax cuts and benefits for the most profitable oil companies in \nAmerica, and when it comes to helping the unemployed and middle income, \nthen they become deficit hawks.\n\n  They also talk about the corporate income tax. The corporate income \ntax rate in America is 35 percent, and they say it is one of the \nhighest in the world. That is true. But it is an effective rate versus \nthe nominal rate. The nominal rate is 35 percent. The effective rate is \nmuch lower.\n  Take, for example, the report that just came out that puts this in \nperspective. There was a report that compared the salaries for the \nCEOs, the chief executive officers, of major American corporations. \nTwenty-five of the one hundred highest paid corporate executives in the \nUnited States earned more in pay than their company paid in taxes in \nthe year 2010. That is right. Our Tax Code is so easy on massive \nmultinational corporations, they pay their top executives more than \nthey pay in Federal taxes each year. It is a startling fact. It is a \nreport released by the Institute for Policy Studies. If you look \nthrough the report, you will see some of the biggest names in corporate \nAmerica.\n  Look at General Electric. They made waves when it was reported that \nthey paid zero, absolutely nothing, in Federal taxes last year. In \nfact, GE got a refund from the government of over $3 billion. The top \nexecutive at General Electric was compensated to the tune of $15.2 \nmillion. Consider that for a moment when we talk about the unfairness \nof corporate taxes. The biggest multinational corporations in America \nare escaping the 35-percent rate. Some are actually getting money back, \nand they are paying their executives money in reward for coming up with \nthese tax strategies under our current Tax Code.\n  Do you want to clean up the Tax Code? Stop imposing the highest \ncorporate tax rate on middle and small businesses, and impose it on the \nlarge corporations, the most profitable corporations in America.\n  The other idea is this repatriation tax holiday. We should take care \nhere. Before we allow major corporations to bring their profits back \ninto the United States tax free or at lower tax rates, which is what \nthey are asking for, look at what happened when we tried that under the \nBush administration. There were $362 billion of earnings repatriated \nunder the holiday, and $312 billion qualified for the tax break, but we \ndidn't see a corresponding increase in employment of those \ncorporations. They brought back the money they earned in profits \noverseas and declared it as dividends and profits, and gave it in \ncompensation and bonuses to their executives. They did not create jobs. \nNow the Republicans are pushing for that same strategy. They want to \ngive this tax holiday to these major corporations with no strings \nattached. I think we have learned our lesson under the Bush \nadministration. If that money is coming back to America, it should be \ndedicated to growing the corporations in America and growing good-\npaying jobs right here at home. It shouldn't go out the door in \nexecutive compensation, dividends, and profits.\n  The Tax Code is unfair, but it is primarily unfair to working \nfamilies. We have got to do everything we can to make it fairer for \nthem. Secondly, we have got to make sure we eliminate some of the \nloopholes that are stacked in the Tax Code today. I have been in favor \nof tax reform and think it is an essential part of fairness in America, \ngetting the economy moving forward, and dealing responsibly with our \ndeficit.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/07/senate-section/article/S5350-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5350-S5351]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TENTH ANNIVERSARY OF 9/11\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, as you know so well as the Senator \nfrom New York, across the country this weekend Americans everywhere \nwill gather to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the tragic events \nthat took place on September 11, 2001. Families from every town, from \nevery city and State will mark this day in their own solemn way and \ntake a moment to remember and honor the nearly 3,000 victims of those \nsenseless attacks. More than any episode in recent American history, \nthe events of 9/11 were experienced on a very personal level all across \nthis country.\n  No one was untouched by the tragedy of that day. All of us can \nremember exactly where we were when we heard the news. We remember \nthose frantic hours as we tried to call loved ones. We remember the \nsilence in our skies as our Nation's entire air system shut down. We \nremember mourning the loss of family, friends, and neighbors; and we \nremember the fear and uncertainty as we wondered if more attacks were \ncoming.\n  We remember the sight we all watched on television, again and again--\nthe sickening sight of the falling towers of the Trade Center. It is a \nvision that has been forever seared into every American's mind.\n  As Governor of New Hampshire at the time, I was actually in \nWashington for a National Governors Association event on early \nchildhood education. I will never forget looking out of my hotel and \nseeing the smoke rising from the Pentagon.\n  The attacks of 9/11 forever changed us as a nation. Our entire notion \nof security was turned upside down. Our government changed, our \npolicies changed, and our view of the world changed. For our children \nand grandchildren especially, this became one of the defining events of \ntheir generation and has left an indelible mark on their world view.\n  As we gather this weekend, all of us in our own way will take a \nmoment to recall those feelings of sadness and anger and to honor the \nmemories of those we lost. But that loss is not the end of the story, \nand grief is not the true legacy of 9/11. We are not defined by what \nhappens to us but by how we respond when we are faced with adversity. \nSeptember 11 did not cripple us as a nation. Instead, it brought out \nthe best in all of us. Our story is really how we responded in the face \nof this attack--with courage, resolve, and unity. In the aftermath of \nSeptember 11, we showed the world the true meaning of the American \nspirit.\n  The story of America's response to 9/11 starts on that very day with \naccounts of heroism that we could never have imagined. We remember the \nfirefighters and the other first responders climbing up the stairwells \nof the burning World Trade Center while others fled down, and how they \nmade the ultimate sacrifice for their selflessness. We remember the \ncourageous passengers on American Airlines Flight 93 who took away the \nterrorists' greatest weapon, fear, by fighting back even though it \nmeant their lives. And who knows how many lives they saved, whether \nthey stopped that attack.\n  In the days that followed, all Americans stepped forward in any way \nthey could. Red Cross centers were overwhelmed with volunteer blood \ndonors. Millions of us donated money and offered up prayers. In New \nHampshire in the days following the attack I remember joining a crowd \nof hundreds for a prayer service at St. Paul's Church in Concord. We \ncame together to honor the victims and to comfort each other. The \nresponse was incredible. The crowd spilled out into the streets with \nmany waving American flags, holding candles, and singing ``God Bless \nAmerica.''\n  In New Hampshire, our State government and our employees refused to \nbuckle under the terrorist threat. We kept the State working on \nSeptember 11.\n  I will not forget the more than 100 fire departments across New \nHampshire that called our State fire marshal's office to offer their \nservices for\n\n[[Page S5351]]\n\nassistance in New York or the countless physicians, rescue workers, and \nvolunteers who made themselves available to help at a moment's notice.\n  Of course, we cannot tell America's story without telling the story \nof the men and women in our military who have spent the last decade \ntrying to make sure an attack like this never happens again. Since \nSeptember 11, more than 5 million men and women have voluntarily joined \nthe Armed Forces to protect America and defend her freedom abroad. More \nthan 6,200 Americans, including 37 troops from New Hampshire, have \ngiven the ultimate sacrifice in our Nation's defense. Over 45,000 more \nhave been wounded or injured and returned home with lasting scars. \nMillions of troops and their families have sustained the toughest, most \ndebilitating tempo of deployments in our Nation's history, often being \ndeployed into war five or six times, enduring constant mental and \nphysical strains in service to our country.\n  The resolve our troops have demonstrated since 9/11 has yielded a \nstring of successes on an extremely complex battlefield. Our men and \nwomen in uniform have done everything that has been asked of them. \nOsama bin Laden has been brought to justice. Countless other high-level \nterrorist operatives, including the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, \nhave been killed or captured, and the organization's bases in \nAfghanistan and Pakistan remain under constant pressure. Al-Qaida and \nits extremist affiliates' deadly ideology is being questioned around \nthe globe, and the remnants of al-Qaida's diminishing leadership are \ndisorganized and struggling to reestablish themselves in the face of an \naggressive U.S. offensive.\n  As our current Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta, has remarked, we \nare ``within reach of strategically defeating al-Qaida.'' Although we \ncan't be complacent and we must remain steadfast in our pursuit, our \nmilitary should be honored for the gains our Nation has made against \nthe terrorists who attacked us on September 11.\n  In New Hampshire our Air National Guard deployed almost immediately \nafter the attacks, and every day since September 11, 2011, they have \nbeen providing persistent air refueling coverage for homeland defense \nand for our command issues in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  I will forever remember walking through the New Hampshire airport \nwith the New Hampshire National Guard when flights resumed after 9/11. \nAs we walked through, people everywhere stopped what they were doing to \napplaud the National Guard for their efforts to keep the people of New \nHampshire safe.\n  In the decade since the attacks, Americans have found new \nappreciation for the service these citizen soldiers provide, and \nAmericans outside the military have learned they have a role to play \ntoo. With the heroes of United Flight 93 as their inspiration, everyday \nAmericans have stopped a number of terrorist plots from succeeding. \nPassengers and flight personnel stopped the December 2001 bomber, the \nattempt by shoe bomber Richard Reid, and they stopped the Christmas Day \n2009 attempt onboard the Northwest Airlines flight. The attempted Times \nSquare bombing last year, as you remember, was in part averted by an \nalert New York City street vendor.\n  Perhaps most importantly, as we remember America's 9/11 story this \nweekend, we should all reflect often the unity we demonstrated in the \nface of this terrible attack. On September 11 we were not Republicans \nor Democrats, Black or White, rich or poor. We were all Americans. The \nattack focused our attention on our common bonds and on the American \nideals we all hold dear. We were determined to prove, despite our \ndifferences, that the United States of America would persevere and \nendure. While we have not always maintained that sense of unity in the \nyears since, our memory of it has inspired us and continually reminded \nus of what is possible when we reach for the best within ourselves.\n  When the history books are written and America's 9/11 story is told \nto the generations to follow, I hope it will tell of how we came \ntogether to remind the entire world of what this country stands for and \nwho we are as a people; how after our darkest day we rose up with new \ndetermination; how instead of turning inward, we chose to confront the \nevil that had visited our shores and to fight on; and how we continued \nto be the beacon of hope, liberty, and opportunity that we have always \nbeen to the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I come to the floor because this week \nPresident Obama is going to present his new jobs plan to the American \npeople and to all of us. I am certain we will hear a lot of talk and a \nlot of promises.\n  I remember when former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi famously announced \nin 2010 their White House health care summit. I sat around the table at \nthat summit. In the discussion, she said the President's new health \ncare law would create 4 million jobs. Here is exactly what former \nSpeaker Pelosi promised on February 25, 2010. She said:\n\n       . . . this bill is not only about the health security of \n     America, it's about jobs. In its life it will create 4 \n     million jobs--400,000 jobs almost immediately.\n\n  I ask, where are the jobs? The fact is, the President's health care \nlaw didn't create jobs. As a physician, I have come to the floor every \nweek since the health care law has been signed and have given a \ndoctor's second opinion about this health care law and why I believe it \nis bad for patients, bad for providers--the nurses and the doctors who \ntake care of those patients--and terrible for the taxpayers.\n  Here we are 17 months after the President signed his health care plan \ninto law and the American people have yet to see job growth anywhere \nnear the figures promised by Nancy Pelosi. In fact, the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics reported last week the American economy generated a whopping \nzero jobs during the month of August. This is sobering news when we \nhave 9.1 percent unemployment in America.\n  The New York Times, on September 3, had an editorial called ``The \nJobs Crisis,'' and let me read from it. It says:\n\n       The August employment report, released on Friday, is bleak \n     on all counts, but at least it leaves no doubt that the \n     United States is in the grip of a severe and worsening jobs \n     crisis. That should lend a sense of urgency to the speech on \n     jobs that President Obama plans to deliver this week.\n\n  The speech is scheduled for tomorrow night. The New York Times goes \non to say:\n\n       The economy added no jobs in August--zero--and the anemic \n     numbers for June and July were revised downward. The \n     unemployment rate is stuck at 9.1 percent, but it would be \n     16.2 percent if it included the swelling ranks of those who \n     find only part-time work and the millions who have given up \n     looking for jobs that simply do not exist.\n\n  Here we are looking at this sobering news, and it seems the only \nconnection between the health care law and the jobs market in America \nis that the job creators--the people who create jobs in this country--\nmade it very clear they cannot afford the President's new health care \nlaw. Month after month we hear from more people in the private sector \nwho explain they will either have to fire people or stop providing \ncoverage in order to comply with the significant expenses of the new \nhealth care law. Let me repeat. This law encourages job creators not to \ncreate jobs but to fire workers, not to hire workers.\n  To get around this problem in the short term, the administration \nbegan doing something I did not anticipate when the health care law was \nsigned. They began to grant waivers from the President's health care \nlaw. They said: Oh, it doesn't apply to you. It doesn't apply to you. \nCome and apply for a waiver. During the month of August--this past \nmonth--the administration, once again, granted another round of waivers \nfrom the President's health care law. There were another 73 waivers \nallowing 105,000 people to get out of\n\n[[Page S5352]]\n\nthe mandates of the Obama health care law.\n  Since October of 2010, the Obama administration has granted over \n1,500 annual benefit limit waivers. Now they are granting them for 3 \nyears. These waivers now cover over 3.4 million Americans. So the law \nand the mandates don't have to apply to them with regard to the \nbenefits. Whom have over 50 percent of these waivers gone to? They have \ngone to union people, people who have gotten their health care through \na union health plan. These are the same people who supported the \nPresident's health care law. It is startling that even unions cannot \nafford the President's law.\n  Remember Nancy Pelosi saying: First, we have to pass it before you \nget to find out what is in it. As more and more Americans have found \nout what is in the health care law, they say we do not want this to \napply to us. In fact, the Service Employees International Union said \nthe law would be financially impossible; that it is financially \nimpossible for them to comply with. I don't think any job creator or \nAmerican family should have to bear financially impossible costs \nbecause of the President's health care law. Each time this \nadministration releases yet another round of its health care law \nwaivers, it reminds the American people how fatally flawed the \nPresident's new law is.\n  As the President prepares for his speech tomorrow night, he needs to \ntake a hard look at his health care law. He needs to face the \nunfortunate reality that his law actually makes it harder and more \nexpensive for the job creators of this country to hire more people. We \nneed to make it easier and cheaper for the job creators in this country \nto create private sector jobs, but yet the President's health care law \nmakes it harder and more expensive. Tomorrow night, the President needs \nto change direction. Instead of giving waivers to businesses and \nunions, he should announce that all Americans can get a waiver from his \nhealth care law.\n  The good news is, I have a bill he can support immediately. My bill \nwill allow any individual--any American citizen--to submit a waiver \napplication seeking relief from any or all of the health care law's \nmandates. The waivers will be granted to individuals showing that the \nhealth care law is either increasing their health care premiums or \ndecreasing their access to benefits. The bill is simple. It is \nstraightforward. It is S. 1395. It is called the Waive Act, and there \nare 16 cosponsors in the Senate. Basically, it says, if a person's \ncosts go up or their benefits go down, they have the freedom to get out \nof the President's health care law. Health insurance premiums have \nrisen 19 percent since President Obama took office.\n  Tomorrow night, the President should announce that he will allow all \nAmericans an opportunity to opt out of his health care law. If he did, \nthis would be one of the best steps he could take to help America's \neconomy. That is why I come to the floor, week after week, with a \ndoctor's second opinion about a health care law that I believe is \nhurting our country.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, the debt crisis has become a jobs \ncrisis. There is no doubt in my mind that the debt we have now incurred \nis already weakening our economy. The gross Federal debt has increased \nby almost $5 trillion since President Obama took office, surging past \n100 percent of our gross domestic product--100 percent of the size of \nthe economy.\n  Academic research shows this level of debt is already costing us 1 \nmillion jobs a year. Our debt is destroying growth and confidence in \nthe economy. More borrowing--more borrowing--will only make matters \nworse. But according to the Associated Press in an article today, the \nPresident's job plan will add another $300 billion to the debt.\n  This is the article by David Espo:\n\n       The economy weak and the public seething, President Obama \n     is expected to propose $300 billion in tax cuts and Federal \n     spending Thursday night to get Americans working again.\n\n  I would say that is what he says will get the American people working \nagain. But we have already borrowed all we can borrow without damaging \nthe economy. It has come to a point where we can't keep borrowing in a \nfutile attempt to stimulate the economy when the increased debt itself \nis weakening the economy.\n  The article goes on to say this:\n\n       According to people familiar with White House \n     deliberations, two of the biggest measures in the proposal \n     for 2012--\n\nthat begins October 1 of this year, fiscal year 2012--\n\n     are expected to be a one-year extension of the payroll tax \n     for workers and an extension of expiring jobless benefits. \n     Together those two would total about $170 billion.\n\n  It goes on:\n\n       The White House is also considering a tax credit for \n     businesses that hire the unemployed. That could cost about \n     $30 billion. Obama has also called for public works projects, \n     such as school construction. Advocates of that plan have \n     called for spending of $50 billion . . .\n\non school construction. I don't think school buildings are the problem \nwith our education right now, and when we don't have any money, we have \nto be careful about borrowing more to spend.\n  It goes on to say--and this is significant:\n\n       Though Obama has said he intends to propose long-term \n     deficit reduction measures to cover the up-front costs of his \n     jobs plan, White House spokesman Jay Carney said Obama would \n     not lay out a wholesale deficit reduction plan in his speech.\n\n  In other words, he won't lay out a plan that would pay for it.\n  So this is where we are heading, it seems to me.\n  Remember the big debate we had over the debt ceiling that ended just \nbefore our August recess at the eleventh hour and the 59th minute. We \nremember how much spending reductions it would call for in the next \nfiscal year: $7 billion. That is how much we would actually cut \nspending next fiscal year: $7 billion. And this plan has called for \nover $300 billion in spending anew, not paid for. We are already in \ndebt. We are already borrowing 40 cents of every dollar we spend, and \nwe are going to add another $300 billion in spending, not paid for, \nborrowed, every penny of it. At some point, this country gets to a \nposition where we cannot continue to borrow without damaging the \neconomy. It is that simple. Americans understand it. As one man told me \nin Evergreen, AL: you can't borrow your way out of debt. You cannot \nborrow your way out of debt. We have reached and gone past that limit, \nin my opinion.\n  In order to have the kind of robust growth we desperately need, we \nmust remove the looming threat of a Greek-like debt crisis. We must do \nso. This debt has a chilling effect throughout our economy. Indeed, a \nEuropean banker just a few days ago said this feels like 2008, and that \ngained quite a bit of traction because people were feeling that, but \nnobody was saying it, and he was quoted all over the business channels \nabout 2008 and the crisis we might be facing.\n  But the President has refused to do anything to actually reduce the \nsurge in spending that he has engineered, nor have our Senate \nDemocratic colleagues here in the Senate. The House proposed a sound \nbudget plan that would reduce spending over the next 10 years and \nchange the debt trajectory of America, but we spent almost $8 trillion \nhere in the Congress since the Senate Democratic majority has passed a \nbudget--861 days. In fact, the Lewis and Clark expedition lasted 860 \ndays. We have passed that now, without having a budget. That is a do-\nnothing record. It just is.\n  At a time of national crisis, we have a failure of leadership in the \nSenate and in the Presidency, in my opinion. President Obama has never \nonce looked the American people in the eye and told them the bitter \ntruth about the economic dangers we are facing and how much work must \nbe done to get us back on a sound, secure path. It is hard to ask a \npeople to sacrifice. It is hard to ask the American public to make \ntough choices if the President, our\n\n[[Page S5353]]\n\nleader, will not affirm that we need to make these choices because it \nis a serious threat to America. Admiral Mullen, who is the Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs, has stated that the greatest threat to our security \nis the national debt. Every expert tells us that the greatest threat to \nour country is the debt. In my opinion, it dwarfs any other threat this \nNation faces. Yet according to the Associated Press, the President's \nspeech is going to talk about spending and nothing about how to deal \nwith the debt, or nothing significant about that.\n  So the rhetoric needs to confront reality. The President has given a \nnumber of speeches about creating jobs and reducing the deficit. But a \nspeech is no substitute for a budget or for a detailed plan. The only \nplan the President has ever put on paper--the only plan that can be \nreviewed by the press, the public, and Congress--is his February \nbudget. He reaffirmed that plan last week, sending Congress a \nmidsession review that made no policy changes in his budget he \nsubmitted earlier. He had the 500-person Office of Management and \nBudget staff working for him. Is it too much to ask for a real plan? \nWhatever he may say on Thursday night, on paper--officially--he remains \ncommitted to this budget plan that grows the debt by about $12 trillion \nand raises taxes by about $2 trillion. What it does is it increases \nspending and increases taxes significantly, but the increase in \nspending is greater than the increase in taxes. So the net result is \nthat the President's plan makes the budget projections we have from the \nCongressional Budget Office worse than they would be if we didn't have \nthis budget plan.\n  America needs the confidence that only a concrete plan can provide. \nThe constant threat of more Federal taxing, borrowing, and regulating \nundermines confidence, certainty, and predictability in our economy, \nthat which our economy so desperately needs.\n  This isn't a question simply of ideology; it is a question of \nleadership. We need and have to grow the economy, not the government. \nWe need to grow the economy. America needs a budget plan that \nrecognizes a core truth. Our Nation's strength does not lie in the size \nof our government, but in the scope of our freedoms and in the \ncreativity of our people. We need to focus on policies that unleash the \nenormous productive potential of the private sector. We need to focus \non policies that remove instability fostered by the President's refusal \nto put forward a coherent economic plan that will actually reduce debt, \nnot make it worse, and that would end the threat of high taxes and \nimprove conditions for our job creators. Instead of the failed tax-and-\nspend approach the voters rejected in the last election, we need to \nfocus on policies that create jobs--not more bureaucracy--helping to \nsteady the economy in these difficult, uncertain times. That would \ninclude such things as energy production. We have definitely damaged \nand delayed significantly the production of energy in the gulf far \nbeyond what was necessary. Only now is it beginning to come back. We \nare having incredibly increased regulations of every kind on our \neconomy, and we have failed to undertake the kind of serious tax reform \nthat could help create growth and productivity. So these are very \ndangerous things.\n  I wish to remind our colleagues that the debt problem can't all be \nblamed on President Bush. I was a critic of some of his spending \nprograms. But, for example, in the last 3 years of President Bush's \nplans compared to the first 3 years of President Obama's, he has \nincreased spending for education 67 percent. His budget for the next \nfiscal year beginning October 1, which was defended a few weeks ago in \nthe Appropriations Committee, calls for a 13.5-percent increase in the \nEducation Department. His budget plan calls for a 10.5-percent increase \nin the Energy Department. I affectionately call them the Department of \nAnti-Energy, the Anti-Energy Department. The State Department is \nlooking at a 10.5-percent increase. At a time when we are borrowing 40 \ncents of every dollar we spend, how can this be reality? Now we are \ntalking about $300 billion which will be thrown in on top of this to \nstimulate the economy again. I hope and trust there are some things the \ngovernment can do to improve the economy, but I am afraid we are at a \npoint where borrowing more money is not one of them.\n  Look what the Europeans have done. They are facing a similar crisis. \nDo they think they should borrow more and spend more? Is that what they \nare doing? No. They are taking their medicine. Italy is attempting to \npass a $65 billion austerity plan that would balance their budget by \n2013. The budget the President submitted to us does not even come close \nto balancing in 10 years. In fact, the projected annual 1-year deficit \nunder the President's plan for the tenth year of his 10-year budget is \n$1 trillion plus. The highest budget deficit President Bush ever had \nwas $450 billion. He will average almost $1 trillion a year--$1,000 \nbillion average--over 10 years. The interest payment last year was $240 \nbillion. The CBO projects in the tenth year after President Obama has \ndoubled the deficit based on his budget, interest in 1 year will be \n$840 billion, crowding out things such as aid to education, which is \n$100 billion, Federal aid to highways, $40 billion.\n  We cannot continue on this path. Italy is making a change. What about \nSpain? These are three of the so-called ``PIGS'' in Europe, the ones \nthat are in financial trouble. Spain is planning a constitutional \namendment and complementary law that will require close to balanced \nbudgets at the Federal and State levels and to limit Federal debt to 60 \npercent of their economy. The enacted austerity plan reduces salaries \nof public sector workers and cuts public sector spending.\n  Portugal has a 4-year consolidation plan that will reduce Federal \nspending by 7 percent of GDP and would balance the budget by 2015. We \nhave no plan to balance the budget, nothing close to it. Indeed, the \nplan the President has submitted to us--and I am not exaggerating. This \nis in the record books. We have the two-volume budget he sent to us, \nand it has been analyzed by the Congressional Budget Office. It will \naverage $1 trillion a year in deficits, which I suppose is why, when I \nbrought it up, the Senate voted 97 to 0 to reject the budget. We do not \nhave one. That is the only one that is pending.\n  Our Democratic colleagues cancelled the budget markup in the Budget \nCommittee in which I am the ranking Republican--we never even pretended \nto produce a budget this year. Senator Reid, the majority leader, said \nit would be ``foolish'' to do so.\n  So we are now looking at a crisis that involves millions of \nAmericans, the jobs they, hopefully, have now and hope to continue, and \nthose who have lost their jobs. Unemployment has almost doubled. So we \nare facing a difficult time. I know the pressure is on to just do \nsomething so we can politically say we did something. But that is not \nsufficient now. We need mature, strong, detailed leadership, a detailed \nplan that will put us on a path to a sound economy.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. We need a plan. I hope the President will do more than \nthe article in the newspaper says and provide the kind of specific \nleadership that can help us move forward from the economic difficulties \nwe face.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/07/senate-section/article/S5353-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5353]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to H.R. 1249, \nwhich the clerk will report by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to the consideration of H.R. 1249, an act \n     to amend title 35, United States Code, to provide for patent \n     reform.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, every time I hear discussion about how we \nbalance the budget, especially coming from the other side of the \naisle--maybe because I have been here long enough--I remember the last \ntime we did balance the budget during President Clinton's term. We \nbalanced the budget. We\n\n[[Page S5354]]\n\ncreated an amazing surplus. We created millions and millions of new \njobs.\n  But you know what. Not a single Republican voted for that. It passed \nin the Senate only because the Vice President of the United States cast \nthe deciding vote. No Republican voted--we actually had to do more than \njust have a bumper sticker ``Let's Balance the Budget.'' We actually \ndid balance the budget, which required some very tough choices. No \nRepublican voted for that.\n  In fact, they all condemned it saying: This would bring about wrack \nand ruin, and on and on. It did not. It created an enormous budget \nsurplus and created 22 million new jobs. We were paying down the \nnational debt. We left a very large surplus to President Clinton's \nsuccessor, President Bush, who immediately wasted it on a needless war \nin Iraq and tax cuts, both of which I voted against.\n  It is also interesting to be lectured by the other side of the aisle \nabout balancing the budget when they voted to go into two of the \nlongest wars in our history, and for the first time in our history \nvoted to pay for them by borrowing the money. Now look where trillions \nof dollars will have gone because of Iraq and Afghanistan, and now to \nbe told that to continue to pay for unnecessary wars we must cut out \nthings for Americans such as education, medical care, housing, \nscientific research, and things such as finding cures for cancer, \nAlzheimer's, repairing our aging bridges, roads--even hearing a Member \nof the other body saying: We cannot respond to the tragedies caused by \nIrene in the distinguished Presiding Officer's home State, mine and \nothers, unless we take the money from other needs in this country. Yet \nthat same Member supported an unnecessary war in Iraq and supports \npaying for it on the credit card. Come on. Let's be real. Let's start \nthinking about things in America.\n  The Senate began debate last night on the America Invents Act. \nUnfortunately, as has happened so many times, we had to invoke cloture \non a motion to proceed to something that has strong support. I would \nnote that 93 Senators, Republicans and Democrats alike, voted to invoke \ncloture on the motion to proceed.\n  This is a bipartisan consensus bill. It is largely similar to the \nlegislation the Senate passed in March. Incidentally, we passed that on \na vote of 95 to 5. Some would say these days that we cannot even have a \nvote like that on a resolution saying the Sun rises in the east. Here \nRepublicans and Democrats came together 95 to 5. The Senate can and \nshould move immediately to pass this bill. It will create good jobs. It \nwill encourage innovation. It will strengthen our recovering economy, \nand it will not cost the taxpayers anything.\n  I want to commend Senator Hatch, the longtime Republican lead sponsor \nof this measure; Senator Grassley, the ranking Republican on the Senate \nJudiciary Committee; and Senator Kyl, the Republican whip, for their \nsupport of the bill and for their commitment to making patent reform \nbecome a reality.\n  This is an effort we have worked on for nearly 6 years. I sometimes \nshudder to think of the amount of time my staff and I have spent on \nthis issue. During those 6 years it has become even more important to \nthe economy. The time has come to enact this bipartisan, bicameral \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the Statement \nof Administration Policy on H.R. 1249 from the Obama administration.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n                     H.R. 1249--America Invents Act\n\n                (Rep. Smith, R-Texas, and 5 cosponsors,\n\n                             June 21, 2011)\n\n       The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 1249 as \n     modified by the Manager's Amendment, but final legislative \n     action must ensure that fee collections fully support the \n     Nation's patent and trademark system.\n       The bill's much-needed reforms to the Nation's patent \n     system will speed deployment of innovative products to market \n     and promote job creation, economic growth, and U.S. economic \n     competitiveness--all at no cost to American taxpayers. The \n     bill represents a balanced and well-crafted effort to enhance \n     the services to patent applicants and America's innovators \n     provided by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, \n     USPTO. It does so by supporting the USPTO's efforts to \n     improve patent quality and reduce the backlog of patent \n     applications, reducing domestic and global patenting costs \n     for U.S. companies, providing greater certainty with respect \n     to patent rights, and offering effective administrative \n     alternatives to costly and complex litigation.\n       By adopting a first-inventor-to-file system, the bill \n     simplifies the process of acquiring intellectual property \n     rights. This provision provides greater certainty for \n     innovators, reduces legal costs that often burden small \n     businesses and independent inventors, and makes it easier for \n     innovators to market their inventions in the global \n     marketplace. This legislation also provides authority for the \n     USPTO to establish and adjust its fees to reflect the actual \n     costs of the services it provides. In addition, the Manager's \n     Amendment provides important authority for a 15 percent \n     surcharge on patent fees and additional fees for ``fast-\n     track'' patent applications, which will enable the USPTO to \n     reduce the backlog. Finally, to increase the quality and \n     certainty of patent rights and offer cost-effective, timely \n     alternatives to district court litigation, the Administration \n     also supports provisions in the legislation that would \n     enhance the opportunities for post-grant review of patents by \n     the USPTO.\n       To carry out the new mandates of the legislation and reduce \n     delays in the patent application process, the USPTO must be \n     able to use all the fees it collects to serve the users who \n     pay those fees. In this light, the Administration is \n     concerned that Section 22 of the Manager's Amendment to H.R. \n     1249 does not by itself ensure such access. The \n     Administration looks forward to working with Congress to \n     provide additional direction that makes clear that the USPTO \n     will have timely access to all of the fees collected, subject \n     to the congressional oversight provisions in the bill.\n       House passage of H.R. 1249 would foster innovation, improve \n     economic competitiveness, and create jobs at no expense to \n     taxpayers--all of which are key Administration goals. The \n     Administration looks forward to working with Congress to \n     finalize this important bipartisan legislation and ensure \n     that the USPTO can effectively accomplish its mission to \n     support America's innovators.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. The statement describes the bill as a balanced and well-\ncrafted effort to enhance the services to patent applicants and \nAmerica's innovators provided by the U.S. Patent Office.\n  The Statement of Administration Policy emphasizes the bill supports \nthe USPTO's efforts to improve patent quality, reduce the backlog of \npatent applications, reducing domestic and global costs for U.S. \ncompanies. I underscore these points because they are exactly the goals \nChairman Smith of the other body and I set out to achieve when we first \nintroduced patent reform legislation 6 years ago. It has been over half \na century since our patent laws were updated.\n  Look at the changes that have occurred during that time. We have \nbecome even more of a global economy than ever before. We have become \nmore of an innovative economy than ever before. Improving patent \nquality will benefit businesses across the economic spectrum. The \nAmerica Invents Act will improve patent quality by expanding the role \nof third parties to the patent examination process, creating a \nstreamlined first-window, postgrant review to quickly challenge and \nweed out patents that never should have been issued in the first place.\n  It improves the funding mechanism for the Patent Office to confront \nits backlog of nearly 700,000 patent applications. Those are patents \nthat could be creating jobs and improving our economy. For years, low-\nquality patents have been a drain on our patent system, and in turn our \neconomy, by undermining the value of what it means to hold a patent. \nHigher quality patents will bring greater certainty in the patent \nsystem. That is going to make it easier to get investment in American \nbusinesses, create jobs, and grow our economy. This act is bipartisan \nlegislation. It is going to lead to long-needed improvements in our \npatent system and laws. I would note that no one Senator, no industry, \nno interest group, got everything it wanted in this bill. I suggested \nthat if we were going to write this bill exactly the way we wanted in \nthis body, we would have 100 separate bills. But we can only pass one. \nThat is the nature of compromise.\n  This bill represents a significant step forward in preparing the \nPatent Office and, in turn businesses, to deal with the challenges of \nthe 21st century. Support for the bill has grown over time. It is now \nendorsed by an extensive list of supporters across the political \nspectrum. Look at who we have here. How often do you see this kind of a \nbreakdown?\n\n[[Page S5355]]\n\n  The National Association of Manufacturers, the United Steelworkers, \nthe U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Association of American Universities, \nthe American Intellectual Property Law Association, Coalition for the \n21st Century Patent Reform, Small Business and Entrepreneurship \nCouncil, the National Retail Federation, the Financial Services \nRoundtable, the American Bar Association, the United Inventors \nAssociation of America, the Association of Competitive Technology, the \nAssociation of University Technology Managers, the Information \nTechnology Council, American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, \nand so many more.\n  I cannot remember a time in my years in the Senate where we have seen \nsuch a broad coalition come together: business, labor, high-tech, and \nothers, coming together to pass legislation. We should grant this \nlegislation final approval.\n  The Senate and the House have now both considered it. A host of \nassociations, interested parties from the private sector have endorsed \npassing the bill without further amendment. At a time when we can do \nsomething to create jobs and not cost the taxpayers money, every day we \nwait, every day we delay is another day before those jobs are created. \nEvery day we wait, every day we delay is another day that we hold back \nthe innovative genius of America. Every day we wait, every day we delay \nis another day we are unable to compete with the rest of the world on a \nlevel playing field.\n  Any amendment--any amendment, including ones I might like--would \nforce reconsideration by the House, and more unnecessary delay, and \nlonger before we can create those jobs, longer before we can innovate, \nlonger before we can compete with the rest of the world. I can think of \na half dozen amendments that I would like to have in the bill.\n  I will vote against them because it is time to get this done. Patent \nreform legislation has been debated exhaustively in both the Senate and \nthe House for the past four Congresses. It is the product of dozens of \nhearings and weeks of committee markups. We should proceed to the bill \nand pass it.\n  Let's not have any one person feeling they have the magic point \neverybody else has somehow overlooked. That is not the way the \nlegislative process works. There are 100 here in the Senate and 435 in \nthe House. Nobody gets every single thing they want. But here, the vast \nmajority of Republicans and Democrats in the House and the Senate are \ngetting what they feel is best for America.\n  It is time for the Senate to serve the interests of the American \npeople by passing the legislation before us. We have before us a \nconsensus bill that will facilitate invention, innovation, and job \ncreation today. This can help everybody from startups and small \nbusinesses to our largest cutting-edge corporations.\n  Let's put Americans back to work. Let's show the American people that \nthe Congress can actually accomplish something and do it for America. \nHere is something on which both Republicans and Democrats can come \ntogether. Let's not delay any longer. We have taken 6 years to get \nhere. We had a vote yesterday where over 90 Senators voted to proceed, \nwhich indicates it is time to get moving, it is time to stop debating, \nand it is time to vote.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, it is quiet in here. Tomorrow night, \ndown at the other end of the Capitol, hopefully it won't be this quiet. \nThe President is going to give a speech that is to be focused on the \nnext steps of getting our economy moving and getting people back to \nwork. That is something which is on all of our minds.\n  As a guy who used to make my living as Governor of my State, I \nfocused a lot on the economy. These are issues of great interest to me \nand certainly to the people I represent. The thought that occurs to me \nas we anticipate the President's speech is that I don't know that there \nis any one particular jobs bill that will do the trick. I would like to \nthink there is a silver bullet, but I don't know that there is.\n  I have always focused on and what we try to focus on in our State is \nhow to create a nurturing environment for job creation and job \npreservation. How do we do that? We try to make sure we invest wisely \nin infrastructure--roads, highways, bridges, ports, trains, water, \nsewer, broadband. We try to invest in the workforce and make sure we \nhave people who are coming out of our schools who can read, write, do \nmath, and who have the skills that will enable them to fill the kinds \nof jobs that will exist in the 21st century. The other part of what we \nfocus on is trying to help promote research and development, and not \njust any kind but R that can be used to create products that can be \ncommercialized and sold not only in this country but in other places as \nwell.\n  Hopefully, the President will talk about some of those things \ntomorrow night. I look forward to whatever he talks about. I hope he \ntalks about that kind of nurturing environment and what we can do to \nallow them to plow the fields so that companies, large and small, can \nactually grow some jobs here.\n  Part of the nurturing environment for job creation is infrastructure. \nWe have been trying for many months since the beginning of this year to \nwork on the airport infrastructure in our country, to try to bring the \nFAA and air traffic control system into the 21st century because it is \nnot and it needs to be. We need resources to modernize our airports \nacross the country, and it is important that we actually pay for it and \nnot add to the deficit.\n  Legislation was passed earlier this year that does that--modernizes \nthe FAA and brings the air traffic control system into the 21st \ncentury, provides some agreement between the airlines and the general \naviation community on how to come up with the resources we need to \nmodernize our airports. It is a good approach, but it has been hung up \nin the House since then. We need to get that done.\n  Today and this week, another part of that infrastructure needs to be \nworked on. This is the infrastructure that allows companies that have a \ngood idea--and inventors--to get a patent on their idea and the patent \ndoesn't end up being litigated on and on, maybe for years, in the \ncourts. Too often, it takes years when somebody comes up with a good \nidea. They submit it to the Patent Office, and it takes a long time to \nget to the top of the list and for somebody to pay attention to the \napplication. Somebody may come in and say: I had the same idea before \nhe did, and then it ends up in litigation. We need to stop that. We \nworked out a compromise that provides that whoever files first is \nessentially the winner. It is not necessarily the one who came up with \nthe idea sooner. We need to get that legislation done and deal with \nthat one aspect of uncertainty and unpredictability that businesses \nface. It would be great if we could make progress on that front this \nweek.\n  Another part of the infrastructure for job creation and preservation \nis the Postal Service. Not a lot of people pay much attention to the \nPostal Service until they get into trouble. The Postal Service is in \ntrouble. I describe the situation as dire, but it is not hopeless. The \nPostal Service finds itself in a situation not unlike that of the auto \nindustry a couple of years ago. The auto industry was losing market \nshare, and their products weren't especially good. They were losing \nmarket share, and they essentially concluded that we have more people \nthan we need for the size of the market to which we now sell. We need \nto reduce our head count. They said: We have to make our wage-benefit \nstructure more competitive for the people we are hiring in the future \nin order to be competitive. Third, they said: We have too many plants, \nand the wage-benefit structure was out of whack.\n  In the Postal Service today, we are seeing an enormous diversion of \npeople using traditional mail, first-class mail, and a diversion into \nelectronic media. As a naval flight officer in the Vietnam war, I \nremember how excited I was--and we have been joined by Senator McCain, \nwho went for a long time\n\n[[Page S5356]]\n\nwithout getting much mail at all when he was a POW. Those of us who \nwere more fortunate, while deployed it was exciting to get mail--\npostcards, letters, cards, packages, magazines, newspapers. It was some \nconnection from home.\n  Senator Klobuchar has been over to Afghanistan, as have Senator \nMcCain and I. Our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines Skype. They \ncommunicate through different social media such as Facebook, Twitter, \nInternet, and cell phones. We never had that stuff, even 30, 35 years \nago, in Southeast Asia or around the world. But people don't use the \nmail too much, especially first-class mail.\n  The situation the Postal Service is in today--and they lost last \nyear--is they are on track to lose about $10 billion. They can only \nborrow $15 billion on a line of credit with the Federal Government. \nThat is it. They are looking to lose more money. If we don't let them \ndo something, they are going to lose more next year. At the end of this \nyear--they can default by the end of the month if we do nothing. If \nthey don't do something, by the end of next September, they could be \nout of business. That is not good for them, for us, or for the 7 or 8 \nmillion jobs that depend on the Postal Service.\n  The situation with the Postal Service is similar to that of the auto \nindustry a couple of years ago, but it is different too. The U.S. auto \nindustry--not Ford but Chrysler and GM--was looking for, if you will, a \ntaxpayer bailout. They got that and have repaid most of that to the \nTreasury.\n  The Postal Service is not asking for a bailout. They want to be \nallowed to be treated like a real business, run like a real business. \nThey say, like the auto industry, we have too many people--more than \nthey need. They need to continue to reduce the headcount through \nattrition and to incentivize the 120,000-or-so people who are eligible \nto retire, to retire by giving them early payments--maybe $10,000 or \n$20,000--and allowing them to maybe get credit for a couple extra \nyears, but get the people who are eligible to retire and encourage them \nto do so, incentivize them to retire--not to be fired or laid off but \nto retire. So there are too many people.\n  Two, there are too many post offices. There are 33,000 post offices \naround the country. The post office doesn't want to close them all. \nThey are saying: Let's look at 3,000 of them, and let's have a \nconversation with the communities there. Do all of these 3,000 post \noffices in those communities need to stay open? Are there some that \ncould locate services elsewhere? Say, if you go to a convenience store \nthat is open 24/7 or a pharmacy that is open maybe 7 days a week or if \nyou go into a supermarket that is open 7 days a week, you can get your \npostal services there. They could locate those post offices there, and \nall those services in one place adds more convenience to consumers. \nThat is what the Postal Service wants to do.\n  The last thing the Postal Service has too much of is mail processing \ncenters. They have over 500 of them around the country, which is \nprobably twice the number they need. They need to be able to reduce \nthose.\n  The Postal Service needs to be treated fairly, and they have been \npaying into the Civil Service Retirement System for many years for some \nof the older employees and more recently the Federal Employees \nRetirement System for the newer employees. Two separate audits done by \nthe Segal Company and by a consulting company called the Hay Group have \nconcluded that the Postal Service has overpaid its obligation into the \nCivil Service Retirement System by $50 billion or more. They have \nestimated they have overpaid their obligation to the Federal Employees \nRetirement System by about $7 billion more. The Postal Service has \nasked to be reimbursed for those overpayments. They would like to use \nthose overpayments, on the one hand, to help meet their obligation to \npay the heavy health care cost for folks who are retiring from the \nPostal Service or about to retire. They want to prefund that. It is an \nobligation they have under the 2006 law, and they would like to use \nsome of the $7 billion overpayment into the Federal Employees \nRetirement System to actually incent people who are eligible to retire \nfrom the Postal Service to go ahead and retire.\n\n  Eighty percent of the cost of the Postal Service is people--80 \npercent. The Postal Service has reduced its head count from about \n800,000 people to, say, 600,000 people over the last 7 or 8 years. They \nneed to be able to continue to reduce that in the years to come--\nroughly 100,000 over the next 2 or 3 years through attrition and maybe \nanother 120,000 by incentivizing people to retire.\n  The Senator from Minnesota is still standing here waiting for me to \nstop, and I have a lot more I wish to say, but I am going to stop and \ncome back maybe later today to finish my comments, but let me conclude \nwith this.\n  We need to act so the Postal Service can save itself. We don't need \nto bail them out. We need to let them act as a real company. The \nsituation is dire, but it is not hopeless. They need to be able to \naddress, as the auto industry did, too many people. They need to be \nable to close and consolidate some post offices and colocate those \nservices in places that make more sense and are more convenient to \nconsumers, they need to be able to close some of their mail processing \ncenters, and they need to be treated fairly with respect to their \noverpayments into both the Civil Service Retirement System and the \nFederal Employees Retirement System. We can do this, and we don't need \nto do it next year; we need to do it this year.\n  I yield the floor to our friend from Minnesota.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/07/senate-section/article/S5356-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5356-S5357]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMERICA INVENTS ACT\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I thank very much the Senator from Delaware, and I \nappreciate the ability to go ahead. I know the Senator from Arizona is \nwaiting as well.\n  I rise to speak in support of the America Invents Act, a bill to \nrevamp our patent system. As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I \nworked on this bill. I was one of the cosponsors, and I also helped \nmanage the bill the last time it was on the floor. I am here to make \nsure we get it over the finish line.\n  It is without dispute that intellectual property is one of our \nNation's most valuable assets, and our patent system plays a vital role \nin maintaining the value of our intellectual property. In fact, the \nCommerce Department estimates that up to 75 percent of economic growth \nin our Nation since World War II is due to technological innovation--\ninnovation that was made possible, in part, by our patent system.\n  I see firsthand the importance of success of a robust patent system \nwhenever I am visiting Minnesota companies and talking with business \nleaders in our State, as I did many times over the past month. \nMinnesotans have brought the world everything from the pacemaker to the \nPost-It-Note. These innovations would not have been possible without \nthe protection of the patent system. This strong commitment to \ninnovation and development is why our State ranks sixth in the Nation \nin patents per capita, and we are No. 1 per capita for Fortune 500 \ncompanies.\n  Companies such as 3M, Ecolab, and Medtronic need an efficient patent \nsystem. But it is also medium-sized companies, such as Imation in \nOakdale and Polaris in Medina, that rely on patents to grow their \ncompanies and create jobs in America. In fact, from 1980 to 2001, all \nthe net job growth in our country came from companies that were less \nthan 5 years old. It is the person in the garage building a mousetrap \nor, in the case of Medtronic, the first battery-powered pacemaker who \ndrives our economy forward and creates the products Americans can make \nand sell to the world.\n  I truly believe, to get out of this economic rut, we need to be a \ncountry that makes stuff again, that invents, that exports to the \nworld. That is why it is so critical we pass the America Invents Act.\n  Unfortunately, our patent laws haven't had a major update since 1952. \nThe system is outdated, and it is quickly becoming a burden on our \ninnovators and entrepreneurs. Because of these outdated laws, the \nPatent and Trademark Office faces a backlog of over 700,000 patent \napplications. Many would argue that all too often the office issues \nlow-quality patents. One of these 700,000 patents may be the next\n\n[[Page S5357]]\n\nimplantable pacemaker or a new and improved hearing aid.\n  Our current patent system also seems stacked against small \nentrepreneurs. I have spoken to small business owners and entrepreneurs \nacross Minnesota who are concerned with the high cost and uncertainty \nof protecting their inventions. For example, under the current system, \nwhen two patents are filed around the same time for the same invention, \nthe applicants must go through an arduous and expensive process called \nan interference, to determine which applicant will be awarded the \npatent. Small inventors rarely, if ever, win interference proceedings \nbecause the rules for interferences are often stacked in favor of \ncompanies with deep pockets. This needs to change.\n  Our current patent system also ignores the realities of the \ninformation age we live in. In 1952, the world wasn't as interconnected \nas it is today. There was no Internet and people didn't share \ninformation, as they do in this modern age. In 1952, most publicly \navailable information about technology could be found either in patents \nor scientific publications. So patent examiners only had to look to a \nfew sources to determine if the technology described in the patent \napplication was both novel and nonobvious. Today, there is a vast \namount of information readily available everywhere we look. It is \nunrealistic to believe a patent examiner would know all the places to \nlook for this information. Even if the examiner knew where to look, it \nis unlikely he or she would have the time to search in all these nooks \nand crannies. The people who know where to look are the other \nscientists and innovators who also work in the field. But current law \ndoes not allow participation by third parties in the patent application \nprocess, despite the fact that third parties are often in the best \nposition to challenge a patent application. Without the benefit of this \noutside expertise, an examiner might grant a patent for technology that \nsimply isn't a true invention, and those low-quality patents clog the \nsystem and hinder true innovation.\n  Our Nation can't afford to slow innovation any more. While China is \ninvesting billions of dollars in its medical technology sector, we are \nstill bickering about the regulations. While India encourages invention \nand entrepreneurship, we are still giving our innovators the \nrunaround--playing red light, green light, with stop-and-go tax \nincentives. The truth is, America can no longer afford to be a country \nthat simply exists on churning money and shuffling paper, a country \nthat consumes imports and spends its way to huge trade deficits. What \nwe need to be is that Nation that invents again, that thinks again, and \nthat exports to the world, a country where we can walk into any store \nand pick up a product and turn it over and it says ``Made in the USA.'' \nThat is what our country needs to be. It is what Tom Friedman, who \nwrites for the New York Times and is a Minnesota native, calls nation \nbuilding in our own nation.\n  As innovators and entrepreneurs across Minnesota have told me, we \nneed to rejuvenate our laws to ensure that our patent system supports \nthe needs of a 21st century economy. The America Invents Act does just \nthat.\n  First, the America Invents Act increases the speed and certainty of a \npatent application process by transitioning our patent system from a \nfirst-to-invent system to a first-inventor-to-file system. This change \nto a first-inventor-to-file system will increase predictability by \ncreating brighter lines to guide patent applicants and Patent Office \nexaminers.\n  By simply using the filing date of an application to determine the \ntrue inventors, the bill increases the speed of the patent application \nprocess while also rewarding novel, cutting-edge inventions. To help \nguide investors and inventors, this bill allows them to search the \npublic record to discover with more certainty whether their idea is \npatentable, helping eliminate duplication and streamlining the system. \nAt the same time, the bill still provides a safe harbor of 1 year for \ninventors to go out and market their inventions before having to file \nfor their patent.\n  This grace period is one of the reasons our Nation's top research \nuniversities, such as the University of Minnesota, support the bill. \nThe grace period protects professors who discuss their inventions with \ncolleagues or publish them in journals before filing their patent \napplication. The grace period, along with prior user rights, will \nencourage cross-pollination of ideas and eliminate concerns about \ndiscussing inventions with others before a patent application is filed.\n  This legislation also helps to ensure that only true inventions \nreceive protection under our laws. By allowing third parties to provide \ninformation to the patent examiner, the America Invents Act helps \nbridge the information gap between the patent application and existing \nknowledge.\n  The legislation also provides a modernized, streamlined mechanism for \nthird parties who want to challenge recently issued, low-quality \npatents that should never have been issued in the first place. \nEliminating these potential trivial patents will help the entire patent \nsystem by improving certainty.\n  The legislation will also improve the patent system by granting the \nU.S. Patent and Trademark Office the authority to set and adjust its \nown fees. Allowing the office to set their own fees will give them the \nresources to reduce the current backlog and devote greater resources to \neach patent that is reviewed to ensure higher quality. The fee-setting \nauthority is why IBM--one of the most innovative companies around, that \nhas facilities in Rochester, MN, and in the Twin Cities--was granted a \nrecord 5,896 patents in 2010 and why they support this bill. They want \nto bring even more inventions and more jobs to America.\n  As chair of the Subcommittee on Competitiveness, Innovation, and \nExport Promotion, I have been focused on ways to promote innovation and \ngrowth in the 21st century. Stakeholders from across the spectrum agree \nthis bill is a necessary step to ensure the United States remains the \nworld leader in developing innovative products that bring prosperity \nand happiness to our citizens. Globalization and technology have \nchanged our economy. This legislation will ensure that our patent \nsystem rewards the innovation of the 21st century.\n  I know this is not the exact bill we passed in the Senate earlier \nthis year, but the major components of that earlier bill are in the one \non the floor today. Those components are vital to bringing our patent \nsystem into the 21st century and unleashing American ingenuity as never \nbefore. Sometimes it is obvious how one can get a job, but sometimes it \nis harder to see, such as when one has to get an invention developed \nand get it approved and get the patent on it and get it to market. That \nis the hard work that goes on in this bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield the floor to \nmy colleague and friend from Arizona, Senator McCain.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate as in morning business, and I additionally ask unanimous consent \nthat I be joined in a colloquy with Senator Graham from South Carolina \nand Senator Lieberman from Connecticut.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/07/senate-section/article/S5357-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5357-S5361]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, yesterday, we learned from media reports \nthe Obama administration has made a decision to sharply reduce the \nnumber of U.S. forces it is proposing for a post-2011 security \nagreement with Iraq to roughly 3,000 troops. That media report has not \nbeen contradicted yet by anyone in the administration, so one has to \nassume that is the direction which the administration is headed.\n  As is well known, 3,000 troops is dramatically lower than what our \nmilitary commanders have repeatedly told us, on multiple trips to Iraq, \nwould be needed to support Iraq's stability and secure the mutual \ninterests our two nations have sacrificed so much to achieve. Our \nmilitary leaders on the ground in Iraq have told us, in order to \nachieve our goal--which is a stable, self-governing Iraq, and as a \npartner in fighting terrorism and extremism--they need a post-2011 \nforce presence that is significantly higher than 3,000 troops.\n\n[[Page S5358]]\n\n  We continue to hear that the Iraqis are to blame because they haven't \nasked for a new agreement. The fact is, in early August, Iraq's major \npolitical blocks reached agreement to begin negotiations with the \nUnited States on a new security agreement. This week, Massoud Barzani, \nthe President of the Kurdistan regional government and one of the most \nrespected men in Iraq--and, in my view, one of the finest--called for a \ncontinued presence of U.S. troops, saying Iraqi security forces are \nstill not prepared to secure protection for Iraq.\n  Perhaps significantly the inspector general for Iraq reconstruction, \nMr. Stuart Bowen, recently reported:\n\n       Iraq remains an extraordinarily dangerous place to work. It \n     is less safe, in my judgment, than 12 months ago. Buttressing \n     this conclusion is the fact that June was the deadliest month \n     for U.S. troops in more than 2 years.\n\n  And, by the way, we continue to hear these quotes from various \nadministration officials about absent a request from the Iraqis, it is \ndifficult to settle on any one thing. Victoria Nuland stated that if \nthey come forward with a request, we would consider it. That is \nassuming it is only in Iraq's national interests to have additional \ntroops here. It is in America's national security interests not to lose \nIraq after the sacrifice of some 4,500 brave young Americans, and the \nconsequences of failure are obvious.\n  Who is it that opposes the continued presence of the U.S. troops most \nvociferously, strenuously, and sometimes in a very subversive way? Iran \nand the Sadrists. Iran and the Sadrists want the United States out. It \nis not a matter of Iraqi national security interests, it is a matter of \nAmerican national security interests.\n  What do 3,000 troops do? I don't know what 3,000 troops do, but I \nknow they are required to have certain force protection numbers, which \nwould be significant, and then how many troops would be left to carry \nout the mission of protecting the United States civilians, contractors, \nand personnel who remain there.\n  I guess you can sum this up, this decisionmaking process, best, and I \nquote from a New York Times article, ``Plan Would Keep Small Force in \nIraq Past Deadline'':\n\n       A senior American military officer said the planning at \n     this point seemed to be driven more by the troop numbers than \n     the missions they could accomplish, exactly the opposite of \n     how military planners ideally like to operate. ``I think we \n     are doing this thing backwards,'' the officer said. ``We \n     should be talking about what missions we want to do, and then \n     decide how many troops we will need.''\n\n  I can assure my colleagues that is the view of the majority of \nmembers of the military, many of whom have had multiple tours in Iraq, \nthat is their view of this process we are going through.\n  I would point out that my friends Senator Graham and Senator \nLieberman, who are coming--and I have been to Iraq on many occasions \nsince the initial invasion. We have had the opportunity to watch the \nbrave young Americans serve and sacrifice. We have had the ability to \nsee as the initial military success deteriorated into a situation of \nchaos, beginning with the looting and unrest in Baghdad to very \nunfortunate decisions that were made in the early period after the \nvictory in Iraq. And we watched. We watched the situation where many of \nour military leaders, but also those who are now in the administration, \nsay that if we employed a surge, it would fail. The President of the \nUnited States, the Vice President of the United States, the Secretary \nof State, the President's National Security Adviser, all of them said \nthe surge would fail; it was doomed to failure.\n  The fact is the surge succeeded. The fact is we now have an Iraq that \nhas an opportunity to be a free and independent country, but, maybe \nmore importantly, one that would never pose a threat to the United \nStates of America and, most importantly, a chance for the Iraqi people \nto enjoy the fruits of the sacrifice that thousands and thousands and \nthousands of Iraqis have made on their behalf and approximately 4,500 \nbrave young Americans have.\n  The Senator from South Carolina, the Senator from Connecticut, and I \nrecall meeting with military leaders in 2006, where we were told that \neverything was going fine. The Senator from Connecticut, the Senator \nfrom South Carolina, and I recall meeting with a British colonel in \nBasra who told us that unless we turned things around, we were doomed \nto failure. We remember the summer of 2007, when we were lonely voices, \nalong with that of General Petraeus, General Odierno, and other great \nleaders who have been saying the surge could, and must, succeed.\n  I will leave it up to historians to decide whether our venture into \nIraq was a good one or a bad one, whether the sacrifice of young \nAmericans' lives was worth it, whether a stable and democratic Iraq, \nwhich can be the result of our involvement there, was the right or \nwrong thing to do. But what we should not do, and in deference to those \nwho have served and sacrificed we must not do, is make a decision which \nwould put all of that sacrifice and all that was gained by it in \njeopardy because of our failure to carry out the fundamental \nrequirement of contributing to Iraqi security in this very difficult \ntransition time.\n  I would ask my friend from South Carolina, to start with, perhaps he \nremembers when we went to Baghdad, I believe it was 2007, and went \ndowntown with General Petraeus and were mocked and made fun of in the \nmedia as I came back and said that things had improved in Iraq. Perhaps \nthe Senator from South Carolina recalls when we had that almost \ntriumphant visit in downtown Fallujah, a conflict that was won with \ngreat cost in American blood and treasure. Perhaps the Senator from \nSouth Carolina recalls going into downtown Baghdad and going to a \nbakery in an environment not of complete security but dramatically \nimproved. All of it was purchased by the expenditure of America's most \nprecious asset, young Americans' blood. And now we place all of that at \ngreat risk in the decisions, I say with respect, made by the same \npeople who said the surge couldn't succeed.\n  I urge the administration and the President to reconsider what \napparently is a decision and listen to our military leaders once, and \nemploy a sufficient number of troops to provide the Iraqis with--as \nBarzai said, a sufficient number of troops to secure. As Barzai said, \nIraq security forces are still not prepared to secure protections for \nIraq.\n  I would ask my colleagues from South Carolina and Connecticut, aren't \nthere plans for us to have a large amount of American civilians there, \ncontractors, to protect them? Probably the most expensive form that we \ncould do rather than American troops. Is it not a flawed strategy to \nnot have enough American troops there to ensure that the lives of \nAmericans who are serving there in various capacities are protected?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. If I may, trying to respond to the Senator's question, \nthe answer is yes. But you don't have to believe me or Senator McCain. \nAmbassador Jeffrey, who is our U.S. Ambassador to Iraq, told us back in \nJune when he was getting confirmed that all civilian movements are \naccompanied by American forces, to some extent, a mixture of Iraqi and \nAmerican forces.\n  We are about to pass the baton between the Department of Defense to \nthe Department of State. The civilian-military partnership that has \nbeen formed over the last decade has been working very well, and the \nfuture of Iraq is in Iraqis' hands, but they do need our help. As \nSenator McCain said, we are helping ourselves.\n  On June 24, 2010, we asked General Odierno, Where are we in terms of \nIraq? How would you evaluate our situation? And since this is football \nseason----\n  Mr. McCAIN. This was at a hearing?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes. This was at a hearing for confirmation for General \nAustin. He said, We are inside the 10-yard line.\n  Well, this is football season. I think most Americans can understand \nthis great progress. He said, We have four downs. This is first in 10, \non the 10, we have 4 downs. He felt good that we can get it into the \nend zone, but getting it into the end zone is going to require a \nfollow-on presence in 2012.\n  Having said that, I know most Americans want our troops to come home. \nInclude me in that group. We are going to go from 50,000 to zero at the \nend of this year if something new doesn't happen. I am confident the \nIraqis want our continued presence in a reasoned way.\n\n[[Page S5359]]\n\n  What do they need that we can provide? Intelligence gathering. We \nhave the best intelligence-gathering capability of anyone in the world, \nand it helps the Iraqis stay ahead of their enemies. And who are their \nenemies? The Iranians are trying to destabilize this young democracy. \nAmbassador Jeffrey, who is a good man, said the reason we need to get \nIraq right is it helps our national security interests.\n  Show me an example in history where two democracies went to war. \nThere is not any. So if he could take Saddam Hussein's dictatorship and \nreplace it with a representative government, that is a huge advancement \nin our national security interests over time.\n  What do the Iraqis need militarily? They don't have a mature air \nforce, so General Austin said it would be in our interests not only to \nsell them planes, F-16s, but actually train them how to use those \nairplanes. They have an infant navy to patrol their coast, to protect \nthem against threats there. It is in our interests not only to train \nand develop the Iraqi police and army but to make sure that our \ncivilians who are going to help build this new democracy can travel \nwithout fear and without unnecessary casualties, because the Iranians \nare going to try to undercut us at every turn. That means targeting \nAmerican forces left behind.\n  What else do they need? Counterterrorism. Al-Qaida and other groups, \nother radical groups, are going to try to come back into Iraq and \ndestabilize what we have done. We have seen some signs of that. We have \nhad 60 al-Qaida types released from American custody to Iraqi custody, \nand some are back out on the streets. So a counterterrorism footprint \nwould be smart. Vice President Biden is right about this. A CT \nfootprint in Afghanistan and Iraq makes sense.\n  When you add up all these missions, intelligence gathering, training, \nembedding, counterterrorism, force protection----\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I ask the Senator, are you leaving out the \nnecessity for peacekeeping in the north between the Kurdish and the \nArabs?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. That is a very good point, and that is exactly sort of \nwhere I was going to take this. That requires the footprint of \nthousands. We don't need 5,000, but I think 10,000 when you add it up \nis probably the bare minimum to do this. Because the commanders who are \npolicing the Kurdish-Arab dispute boundary line in the northern part of \nIraq have come up with a very novel approach, and I want to give the \nadministration credit and the military credit. What they have done is \nthey have taken Peshmergas, which are basically Kurdish militia, \nintegrated them with Iraqi national security forces and American forces \nto form companies that eventually go to brigades, where they will get \nto know each other and work together as a team. I think any neutral \nobserver would tell you our presence in Kirkuk has prevented a shooting \nconflict in the past. That is what President Barzai is worried about in \nthe Kurdish areas. That is 5,000, he said. He has said we will need \n5,000 troops here for a while to make sure this new concept of \njointness develops over time. So when you add the whole package, you \nare somewhere around 10,000 plus.\n  To the administration, not only is bipartisanship desired in national \nsecurity, I think it is required. We can look back and pat each other \non the back or blame each other about Iraq. That is not what I am \ntrying to do. We are where we are, and we are in a pretty decent place \nto the point that the Iranians are going nuts. They are trying to \nundercut Iraq's national development, because their biggest nightmare \nis to have a representative democracy on their border. That will incite \ntheir own people in Iran to ask for more freedom.\n  So, please, to the Obama administration, don't make the same mistakes \nat the end that the Bush administration made in the beginning. I can \nsay with some credibility that I argued against my own political party \ninfrastructure, that Senators McCain and Lieberman and others--we went \nthere enough to know it was not a few dead-enders, that the whole \nsecurity footprint was not sufficient, and the model to change Iraq was \nnot working.\n\n  It was General Petraeus's model that was adopted, to President Bush's \ncredit. That was a hard decision for President Bush. The war was \nincredibly unpopular. People were frustrated. It seemed it was a lost \ncause, and President Bush went against what was the political tide at \nthe moment. I am glad he did.\n  I ask President Obama to consider the long-term national security \ninterests of the United States and do what Senator McCain suggested--\nnot what he suggested, what our military suggested: define missions. Is \nit important to have some support to intelligence gathering? I would \nsay yes. Training the Army and Air Force and Navy? I would say yes. \nHaving some presence to protect our civilians who are going to be the \nlargest groups? I would say overwhelmingly yes. Does it make sense to \nhave some American military support in the Kurdish-Arab dispute area? \nOverwhelmingly yes.\n  We will stand by you. I think most Americans are frustrated and war \nweary, but they don't want to lose. We are very close to changing Iraq \nby helping the Iraqi people. We can't change Iraq; only they can. They \nwant to.\n  We talk about the deaths of Americans and it breaks our hearts. For \nevery American who has died there have probably been 10 Iraqis. This \nhas not been easy for people in Iraq. That is why I never lost faith. \nWhat kept me going with Iraq and Afghanistan is I have been there \nenough to know there are people in those countries who want the same \nthing for their children as most people in this body want for theirs.\n  To be a judge in America, one can get criticized. It is a tough job. \nOne can lose their life in Iraq and Afghanistan, and I have personally \nmet people who decided to step to the plate--to be lawyers, be judges, \nbe policemen--who got killed. They knew what was coming their way.\n  It is in our national security interest to help this infant \ndemocracy, and that is what it is. Corruption still abounds, there are \ntons of problems in Iraq, but they are on the right trajectory.\n  I am asking the administration: Listen to your commanders. And \n25,000, in my view--I am not a commander, but I could understand why \nthe President would say that is a bridge too far. I know what the \ngenerals have recommended. It goes from the midteens to the \nmidtwenties. But somewhere to the north of 10, given my understanding \nof Iraq, I think it will work. But I know we are broke. One thing I can \ntell you is, we cannot afford to lose after all this investment. The \nprice and cost of losing in Iraq now would be devastating for years to \ncome.\n  If we do not see this through, who would help us in the future push \nback against extremism, knowing that America left at a time when they \nwere asking us to stay? I am confident Sunnis, Shias, and Kurds want us \nthere in reasonable numbers to make sure they can have the help they \nneed to get this right.\n  Apparently, the decision has not been made yet. I am urging the \nadministration to look at the missions, be reasonable, understand that \nwe cannot give the military all they want all the time.\n  This is the decision of the Commander in Chief. He is a good man. It \nis his call. But the one thing I offer and I think the three of us \noffer in these very difficult times when America is under siege at home \nis to be supportive voices for the idea we cannot retreat and become \nfortress America.\n  Look what happened when a few people from Afghanistan, in far away \nplaces, for less than $1 million--what havoc they wreaked on our \ncountry. This Sunday is the 10th anniversary. I am hopeful as we get to \nthe 10th anniversary we can look back and say we have defended America \nin a bipartisan way. It is not just luck that has prevented us from \nbeing attacked. The President deserves a lot of credit for going after \nbin Laden, a lot of credit for adding to troops in Afghanistan when \npeople were ready to come home.\n  I urge this administration to listen to our military leaders and \nfinish this right. It would be a tragedy upon a tragedy for us to be \ninside the 10-yard line and fumble at a time when we can score a \ntouchdown--not only for our national security but for fundamental \nchange in the Mideast. If we get it right in Iraq, the Arab spring is \ngoing to get the support it needs and deserves. If we fail in Iraq, it \nwill be just repeating history's mistakes.\n\n[[Page S5360]]\n\n  The Bush administration did change. Thank God they did because they \ndid not get it right early on. We are so close to the end now. Let's be \ncautious, let's be reasonable, let's err on the side of making sure we \ncan sustain what we have all fought for. I tell you this: History will \njudge everybody well, including President Obama--and that would be OK \nwith me--if we can turn Saddam Hussein's dictatorship into a \nrepresentative government that would be aligned with us and be a voice \nof moderation for the rest of the 21st century.\n  I would like to get Senator Lieberman's thoughts. It is one thing for \nme to talk about this in South Carolina. But even in South Carolina, a \nvery red State, people are war weary and they are not excited about \nhaving to stay in Iraq in 2012. I think they will listen to reason. But \nduring the darkest days of this effort in Iraq, Senator McCain went the \nroad less traveled by saying we need more at a time when the polls said \neverybody is ready to come home. I do not question anybody's \npatriotism. It was a hard call. It was a tough fight, and there were no \neasy answers. But I am glad we chose to do what we did. I am glad \nPresident Bush adjusted.\n  But Senator Lieberman, above all of us quite frankly, literally \nrisked his political career because he believed that what happened in \nIraq mattered to the United States.\n  The Senator was right. I want to thank him on behalf of all those who \nserved in Iraq for giving them the time and resources to prove we could \nget it right.\n  I would like the Senator to, if he doesn't mind, to share his \nthoughts with the body about how we should finish Iraq.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and thank my friend \nfrom South Carolina for his generous words.\n  Obviously, what turned the tide in Iraq was a vision, a commanding \nvision by General Petraeus about what had to happen to succeed with a \nnew counterterrorism strategy and tremendous support from the men and \nwomen of the American military, a generation that volunteered, that \nstepped up to the call, that rightfully should be called America's \n``new greatest generation.'' They are an inspiration to us.\n  Of course, we lost a lot of them there. The Iraqi military fought \nhard and now, increasingly, has shown its capability to defend its own \nnation, which is what we had hoped and prayed and fought for. So my \nfriends from Arizona and South Carolina had the same reaction I did \nyesterday. We began to talk to each other by the end of the day as we \ncame back to Washington, to what was originally a FOX News story, that \nthe decision had been made in the administration to go down to 3,000 \ntroops. We reacted that way because it was lower than any number we had \never heard from anybody we had confidence in about what was necessary \nto secure all that we have gained and all the Iraqis have gained.\n  The papers today report it as a fact. Secretary Panetta says no \ndecision has been made. I hope not because in these matters--I \nunderstand there is politics in Iraq as well as here, but what has to \nbe put at the top of the list is what is best for our national security \nand, of course, for the Iraqis, what is best for their national \nsecurity.\n  To me, if the number is right, and it is only going to be 3,000 more \nthere after the end of this year, I don't see how we can feel confident \nthat we can protect what we have spent a lot of American lives--a lot \nof Iraqi lives, a lot of our national treasure and theirs--securing. \nAnd I don't see how we can help to avoid a kind of possible return to \ncivil war, particularly on the fault lines my friends have mentioned, \nbetween the Kurdish areas and the Arab areas.\n  This is a decision ultimately for the President. I want to say this \nabout doing the right thing: The President, obviously, took a position \nfor withdrawal of American troops from Iraq during the campaign of \n2008. I think there were a lot of his supporters who felt, who hoped, \nwho dreamed that pretty much the day--we are hearing a lot about day \none these days, a lot about day one after the next election. But I \nthink a lot of President Obama's supporters expected that on day one of \nhis administration he would begin a full withdrawal from Iraq. To his \ngreat, great credit, he did not do that because I think he understood \nhe had a goal, which was to pull our troops out of Iraq but that \nAmerica had an interest and he as President had to protect that \ninterest in not losing in Iraq, not letting it fall apart, and not \nletting us suffer the loss we would to our credibility and strength \naround the world.\n  My friends and I traveled a lot together. We have been in places far \naway from Iraq--Asia, for instance--where, when it was uncertain about \nwhether we were going to stick to it in Iraq we heard real concern from \nour allies in Asia. They said: You know, Iraq is far from here, but we \ndepend on American strength and credibility for our security and \nfreedom in Asia, in the Asia-Pacific region. If you are seen to be weak \nand lame and not up to the fight in Iraq, it is going to compromise our \nfreedom.\n  The President, to his credit, understood all that and put us on a \nslow path to withdrawal. But I don't think anybody would fault the \nPresident if we--and I think the expectation has been that we have \nachieved so much that we could--leave a core group there to continue to \ntrain the Iraqi military so they reach their full potential, to be \nthere to assist them in a counterterrorism fight because that is \nessentially what is going on in Iraq now. The war is basically over, \nbut the extremists, the Shia militia, some remnants of al-Qaida, are \ncarrying out terrorist attacks. Those are the explosive--literally \nexplosive--high-visibility attacks.\n  We have special capacities in the U.S. military to work with the \nIraqi military to prevent and counter those terrorist attacks.\n  Then the final part of the mission has to be to protect the American \npersonnel there, civilian personnel. I don't know what that number will \nbe. At one point--we already have the largest----\n  Mr. McCAIN. Can I ask my friend to yield?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 7 minutes past \n12:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend. At one point somebody indicated to \nus--we were in Baghdad--that the American Embassy, which is already the \nlargest U.S. Embassy in the world in terms of personnel, could go up as \nhigh as 20,000. It could be that high. Those are a lot of civilians \ncommitted to working in the country that we need to have forces there \nto protect.\n  We are all coming to the floor today to appeal to Secretary Panetta, \nto the President: It would be shortsighted. If it is really going to be \n3,000 and only 3,000, and, frankly, we are not going to tuck some away \nin those civilian personnel numbers in the embassy or somewhere else, \ncovert operators--if it is really only 3,000, they are not going to be \nable to do the job that needs to be done. Not only that, they are going \nto send a message of weakness, lack of resolve, anxiousness to get out \nto the Iraqis' enemies and ours in the region, and that particularly \nincludes Iran.\n  I join my colleagues. We have been together on this for a long time. \nI don't want us to squander what we have won, and we will, I am afraid, \nif we only leave 3,000 American troops there.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I say to my colleague, no events in history are \nexactly similar. But I think we learned in Lebanon and again in Somalia \nthat forces that are too small and do not have sufficient force \nprotection--and I am not saying they are exact parallels, but certainly \nit puts whoever is there, whether they be military or civilian, in some \nkind of danger. As that progress has been made--and it has been \nsignificant progress in a country that has never known democracy--we \nhave now Turkish attacks on the PKK up in the Kurdish area. We have \ncontinued tensions in the areas to which the Senator from South \nCarolina referred, which at one point, I believe, last June almost came \nto exchange of hostilities, between the Peshmerga and the others, and \nthere is also increased Iranian interest in Basra. There continues to \nbe the export of arms and IEDs from Iran into Iraq. They have no air \nforce. They have no ability to protect their airspace.\n  Isn't it true their counterintelligence is dependent on our technical \nassistance, which means personnel?\n\n[[Page S5361]]\n\n  So the argument seems to be that if we want this experiment to \nsucceed, we should not put it in unnecessary jeopardy.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I will add, if I may, the 3,000 number does not allow the \nmissions that are obvious to most everybody who has looked at Iraq to \nbe performed in a successful manner. That is the bottom line. That is \nwhy no one has thrown out 3,000 before. Can you do it with 10,000? That \nis where you are pushing the envelope. The Kurdish-Arab boundary \ndispute almost went hot. This new plan we have come up with to \nintegrate the Peshmurga, the Iraqi security forces with some Americans, \nwill pay dividends over time. Mr. President, 5,000 is what the American \ncommander said he needed to continue that plan. We have a plan to even \nwind down that number. It is just going to take a while. When it comes \nto Iraq, I can tell you right now I would not want our American \ncivilians to be without some American military support, given what I \nknow is coming to Iraq from Iran.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I mention one fundamental here? The question is: Is \nit in the United States national security interest to have these \n10,000-plus American troops carrying out the missions we just described \nor is it not? If it is, then it is pure sophistry to say: Well, we \nwould only consider this if the Iraqis requested it. If we are waiting \nfor the Iraqis to request it, then it means it doesn't matter whether \nthe United States is there.\n  I think the three of us and others--including General Odierno, \nGeneral Petraeus, and the most respected military and civilian \nleadership--think it is in our national interest. The way this should \nhave happened is the United States and the Iraqis sitting down \ntogether, once coming to an agreement, making a joint announcement that \nit is in both countries' national security interest. If it is not, then \nwe should not send one single American there, not one.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. If the Senator will yield for a second, that is a good \npoint. We have been asked to go by both administrations. The Iraqis \nhave a political problem. That is not lost upon us. Most people in most \ncountries don't want hundreds of thousands of foreign troops roaming \naround their country forever. So the Iraqis have been upfront with us. \nWe want to continue the partnership, but it needs to be at a smaller \nlevel. They are absolutely right. I don't buy one moment that there is \na movement in Iraq saying we will take 3,000, not 1 soldier more. I \nthink what is going on here is there is, as Senator McCain suggested, a \nnumber drives the mission, not the mission drives the number. At the \nend of the day, this 3,000 doesn't get any of the essential jobs done. \nIt leads to 3,000 exposed. It leaves the thousands of civilians without \nthe help they need. It leaves the Iraqi military in a lurch. There is \nno upside to this.\n  I would end with this thought: Let's get the missions identified and \nresource them in an adequate way, and I think the country will rally \naround the President. I cannot think of too many Americans who would \nwant our people to be in harm's way unnecessarily. If you leave one, \nyou have some obligation to the one. Well, if you left one, you would \nbe doing that person a disservice. Leave enough so we can get it right, \nand that number is far beyond 3,000.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I want to say in response to something \nSenator McCain said, somebody in the military said to me: If we are not \ngoing to leave enough to do the job, we might as well not leave anybody \nthere.\n  Of course, we don't want that to happen. There are a couple of \nalternatives here. One is that the 3,000 is not the number. Hopefully \nwe will have clarification. It is more than that. In all our trips to \nIraq, talking about repeated teams of leadership, never has there been \nanyone who said to us that we needed less than 10,000 American troops \nthere to do this job. I want to repeat this; there is a kind of sleight \nof hand here. Maybe it is 3,000 here and a few more thousand tucked \ninto the civilian workforce at the embassy and a few more somewhere in \nthe special covert operators. If that is the game plan here, it is a \nmistake. We ought to see exactly how many troops are leaving there. It \ngives confidence to our allies in the region, particularly in Iraq, and \nit will unsettle our enemies, particularly in Iran.\n  Dr. Ken Pollack has a piece in the National Interest that is out now \nabout this situation. He is concerned about the small number of troops \nthat may be left there and agrees that there may be some Iraqis who \nmight be pushing for a smaller post-2011 force with a more limited set \nof missions. Dr. Pollack says:\n\n       That would be a bad deal for the Iraqi people and for the \n     United States. Our troops would be reduced to spectators as \n     various Iraqi groups employ violence against one another. \n     Moreover, if we have troops in Iraq but do nothing to stop \n     bloodshed there, it would be seen as proof of Washington's \n     complicity. If American forces cannot enforce the rules of \n     the game, they should not be in Iraq, period, lest they be \n     portrayed as contributing to the destruction of the country.\n\n  That is what we are saying.\n  The final point here is Dr. Pollack argues in this piece that the \nUnited States, if this is in response--giving the benefit of the doubt \nfor a moment--to Iraqi political concerns, that the U.S. has the \nleverage to avoid this dangerous outcome. He writes:\n\n       America has the goods to bargain. The question is whether \n     Washington will.\n\n  That is the question I believe my colleagues from Arizona and South \nCarolina are asking today: Will we bargain with our Iraqi allies that \nthis is the problem to be able to work with them for another chapter to \nsecure all we have gained together up until now?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I appreciate your indulgence and yield the \nfloor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/07/senate-section/article/S5361-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5361]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

HATFIELD\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, my home State of Oregon has many towering \nand majestic features, such as our iconic Mount Hood and our beautiful \nState tree, the Douglas fir. Senator Mark O. Hatfield, who passed away \non August 7, stood head and shoulders above all of them.\n  Last night, the Senate passed S. Res. 257, a resolution in respect of \nthe memory of Senator Hatfield. This afternoon, Senator Merkley and I, \nwith colleagues of both parties, would like to reflect on the \nextraordinary legacy of our special friend, Senator Mark Hatfield.\n  For me, Senator Hatfield's passing this summer, just as it seems the \nCongress has become embroiled in a never-ending series of divisive and \npolarizing debates and battles, drove home that Senator Hatfield's \napproach to government is now needed more than ever in our country.\n  Senator Hatfield was the great reconciler. He was proud to be a \nRepublican with strongly held views. Yet he was a leader who, when \nvoices were raised and doors were slammed and problems seemed beyond \nsolution, could bring Democrats and Republicans together. He would look \nat all of us, smile and always start by saying: ``Now, colleagues,'' \nand then he would graciously and calmly lay out how on one issue or \nanother--I see my friend, Senator Cochran from Mississippi, who knows \nthis so well from their work together on Appropriations--it might one \nday be a natural resources question, it might one day be a budget issue \nor a health issue or an education issue, but Senator Hatfield had this \nextraordinary ability to allow both sides to work together so an \nagreement could be reached, where each side could achieve some of the \nprinciples they felt strongly about. They would not get\n\n[[Page S5362]]\n\nthem all, but they would get a number of them. That, of course, is the \nkey to what is principled bipartisanship.\n  It was not very long ago, it seems, when Senator Hatfield walked me \ndown that center aisle, when I had the honor of being selected Oregon's \nfirst new Senator in almost 30 years. I remember coming to the Senate, \na new Senator, and watching Senator Hatfield at work. Sometimes he \nwould be with Senator Kennedy and a big flock of the Senate's leading \nprogressives, and sometimes he would shuttle over to visit with Senator \nDole and a big group of conservatives. Somehow the public interest was \naddressed.\n  The question then becomes: How did he do it? What was the Hatfield \napproach all about? To me, Senator Hatfield was religious, but he was \nnever intolerant. He was idealistic, but he was never naive. He was \nwilling to stand alone but never one to grandstand.\n  But it was not his public life that shaped his belief and his \nprinciples. Those were forged in the most hellish of places: World War \nII in the Pacific. As a landing craft officer in the U.S. Navy, Senator \nHatfield witnessed firsthand the battles at Iwo Jima and Okinawa. He \nwas one of the first Americans to see the devastating effects of the \natomic bombing of Hiroshima.\n  Later, he served in French Indochina, where he saw the economic \ndisparities that would later lead to war in Southeast Asia. Those \nimages remained with him throughout his life, acting as a touchstone \nfor his belief that the world should be a safer and more peaceful \nplace. It was Senator Hatfield's beliefs--those beliefs--that served as \nthe foundation for his career in the Senate and for his opposition to \nthe Vietnam war and to the proliferation of nuclear weapons.\n  Senator Hatfield was a major player on the national stage. At the \nsame time, he never forgot our home State or strayed very far from his \napproach of trying to bring people together. I see our friend, Senator \nAlexander, on the floor, who also has had a lot of experience on \nnatural resources issues.\n  I can tell my friends on both sides of the aisle that watching \nSenator Hatfield champion the need for family-wage jobs in the forest \nproducts sector, while at the same time being a champion of \nenvironmental protections of wilderness areas and scenic rivers, was \nlike a classroom in the effort to come up with sound public policy.\n  When colleagues come to our home State, they will have an opportunity \nto go to the Columbia River Gorge, a special treasure. We had a big \nanniversary recently on the anniversary of the Columbia Gorge National \nScenic Area. Senator Merkley and I were there. That never could have \nhappened without that unique ability of Senator Hatfield to bring \npeople together, and he went into every nook and cranny of our State, \ncommunities that barely were bigger than a fly speck on the map. He \nwould make their roads better and their schools better and their health \ncare better, again by bringing people together.\n  I know colleagues are waiting. I would simply wrap up by saying that \nmy State has lost a great son. The Senate has lost one of its former \ngiants. Our Nation has lost a man who represented honesty and decency \nin public service. I will never, ever forget how much Senator Hatfield \nhas meant to my home State of Oregon.\n  I note Senator Merkley is here who served as one of Senator \nHatfield's interns as well as Senator Alexander and Senator Cochran. I \nthink we have, through the graciousness of Senator Reed and Senator \nMcConnell, time for all our colleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate a statesman \nand a mentor, Senator Mark O. Hatfield. He took many roles: dedicated \npublic servant, conscientious man of faith, and pioneer for new \ndevelopment in the West. He was born in 1922 in Dallas, OR, a small \ntown not far from our capital, Salem, to a family of modest means. His \nfather was a blacksmith and his mother was a schoolteacher. When he was \nyoung, his family then actually moved to the State capital, which gave \nhim a chance, as a teenager, to work as a guide in the State capitol \nbuilding and to imagine returning one day as a public leader.\n  He proceeded to study at Willamette University in Salem. During his \nfreshman year, events took a dramatic turn with the attack on Pearl \nHarbor in 1941. Senator Hatfield joined the Reserves and accelerated \nhis studies, so he completed his degree in 1943 and joined the Navy. He \nproceeded as a naval officer and fought in Okinawa and Iwo Jima, and he \nsaw the devastating aftermath of the atomic bomb at Hiroshima, an \nimprint that, along with his State, caused him to struggle with the \nappropriate and moral use of force throughout his life in public \nservice. In his own words:\n\n       In the war's immediate aftermath, one vivid experience made \n     the profoundest impression on me. I was with a Navy \n     contingent who were among the first Americans to enter \n     Hiroshima after the atomic bomb had been dropped. Sensing, in \n     that utter devastation, the full inhumanity and horror of \n     modern war's violence, I began to question whether there can \n     be any virtue in war.\n\n  He elaborates on this process of questioning, this process of \nchallenging, in his book ``Conflict and Conscience.'' In terms of the \nVietnam war, he concluded that it did not meet the Christian \ntheologians' test for a just war. After the war, Hatfield went back to \nOregon and he started a law degree, but he changed course after a year. \nHe decided instead to pursue a master's in political affairs, and he \nwent to Stanford and completed that master's and came back to Oregon. \nHe started teaching at Willamette University, and in short order he was \nrunning for the Oregon House, in 1950, first elected at the age of 28, \nand then Secretary of State 6 years later at the age of 34, and \nGovernor 2 years later at the age of 36. Through these experiences, \nSenator Hatfield developed the ability to chart his own course, to \ndetermine and follow his own convictions. In 1964, he championed an \ninitiative to outlaw the death penalty. That ballot measure passed, and \nGovernor Hatfield then commuted the sentences of those on death row.\n  In 1965, in July, he was the one Governor at the National Governors \nAssociation to vote against the resolution endorsing the Vietnam war.\n  In 1995, he proceeded to oppose the balanced budget amendment, and as \nthe Senate historian, Don Ritchie, observed, ``It was one of the most \ncourageous votes I had ever seen. He knew he was sacrificing his \nchairmanship and his position as a Senator. Few knew then that Senator \nHatfield had offered to resign.''\n  Senator Hatfield also worked hard to build core institutions in \nOregon. He was a champion of Oregon Health and Sciences University and \nbuilt it into a fabulous institution of research and learning. The Mark \nO. Hatfield School of Government carries on his legacy of leadership, \nconveying those principles to young leaders who are dispersing \nthroughout the public policy arena. The Marine Science Center in \nNewport, a tremendous research facility, continues to yield benefits, \nincluding setting the foundation for the recent location of NOAA'S \nresearch fleet in the city of Newport.\n  He was an intense advocate of medical research, and he championed \nNIH, where a building now bears his name. He was a champion for the \nU.S. Institute of Peace. He felt if there were academies that studied \nwar, there should be acadamies to study peace and reconciliation.\n  In 1975, he introduced the George Washington Peace Academy Act to \nfurther the understanding of the process and state of peace among \nnations, to consider the dimensions of peaceful resolutions of \ndifferences, to train students and to inform government leaders in the \nprocess of peaceful resolutions. It took 9 years, but this effort which \nbegan as the George Washington Peace Academy Act ended in the \nestablishment of the U.S. Institute of Peace in 1984.\n  As my senior colleague mentioned, he championed many efforts to \nprotect Oregon's precious wilderness. One of his final projects was to \nprotect Opal Creek, which has been described as 6,800 acres of virgin \nold growth, the largest span remaining in western Oregon. He said about \nthis:\n\n       It is an inspiration. It is a place of educational and \n     spiritual renewal and exploration. To walk among the \n     centuries old fir, hemlock, and cedar inspires tremendous awe \n     and instills, I think, a perspective unlike itself.\n\n  My own connection to Senator Hatfield began in 1976, in the spring of \nthat\n\n[[Page S5363]]\n\nyear, when I went to Salem to meet with Jerry Frank, Senator Hatfield's \nlegendary Chief of Staff, to interview for a possible summer internship \nin Senator Hatfield's DC office. I will be eternally grateful to Jerry \nFrank and Senator Hatfield for offering me that internship, for that \nopportunity to come to our Nation's capital to see government in \naction. My first responsibility was to open the mail. When you open the \nmail, you start to understand the dimension, the breadth of political \nopinion in the breadth of a State.\n  How readily did many constituents attack Senator Hatfield's Christian \nfaith because they disagreed with him on some policy position. I opened \nso much mail that said: Hi, my policy position is this and yours is \ndifferent. So how can you be a man of Christian faith?\n  Indeed, Senator Hatfield started his book ``Conflict and Conscience'' \nwith just this dimension, a politicization of religion. He puts in it a \nnumber of letters that he received. One reads:\n\n       Dear Mr. Hatfield,\n       Your encouragement of antiwar demonstrations and the riots \n     that have come from such demonstration are in fact treason \n     for they give comfort and aid to our enemies. . . .\n       I and a lot of other Christian people are extremely \n     disappointed in your performance in the Senate, for you who \n     claim to be a Christian and have access to our Almighty God \n     should have a better understanding of human nature and the \n     evil in the human heart.\n\n  Senator Hatfield talked about the challenge of being a public man of \nfaith and working to take those principles and convert them to public \npolicy in the face of hostility coming from the left or the right. But \nit was his determination to stay that course, to continue to be a \nperson of reflection and depth in the pursuit of public policy.\n  That summer, I was assigned to the Tax Reform Act of 1976. The great \njoy that I had was that it happened to come up on the floor that \nsummer. Back then, before there was television in this Chamber, before \nthere was e-mail, you would come to the floor, if you were working on \nan issue, and go up to the staff gallery and follow debate, and you \nwould rush down with the other staffers to meet your Senator coming out \nof the elevators just outside those double doors. Because there were \nlots of amendments, I got to meet with the Senator many times to \ndescribe the debate on the floor here, and to fill in what folks back \nhome were saying about the particular issue at hand.\n  Then, occasionally, the timing being just right, we would have a \nchance to walk back and forth. Senator Hatfield loved to walk back and \nforth outside in the sunshine under the trees between the Capitol and \nhis office in the Russell Office Building. It was while observing those \ndebates that I saw the Senate at its best. There was an amendment from \nthe right side of the aisle that was debated and discussed and voted on \nan hour and a half later. Then there was an amendment from the left \nside of the aisle. The amendments were on the issue at hand, such as \ndifferent tax strategies, and often they were bipartisan in nature. \nIndeed, you saw that our Senators at that time--most of whom had served \nin World War II together--could disagree without demonizing each other. \nThis is a tremendously important facet of the Senate that has been lost \nover the decades since. Indeed, there were many friendly debates \nbetween Republicans and Democrats.\n  My father, Darrell, was a mechanic, and he had one of these debates \nwith his boss who owned the company. When I was offered the internship \nwith Senator Hatfield, Jerry called my father and said, Darrell, I won \nthe debate because Senator Hatfield will work to make Jeff a good \nRepublican. My dad said, no, no, no, I won the debate because Jeff will \nwork to make Senator Hatfield a good Democrat. Neither of us would have \nbroached such a topic.\n  The conversation wasn't about Democrats and Republicans. It was about \nthe challenges at hand and how you resolve them. It was from that \nsummer that I developed a lifelong admiration for Senator Hatfield and \nhis model of public service. Here is what Senator Hatfield had to say \nabout public calling:\n\n       Political service must be rooted in a philosophy of \n     society's overall well-being, with a broad vision of how the \n     body politic serves the people through its corporate \n     structures. The heart of one's service in the political order \n     must be molded by ideals, principles, and values that express \n     how we, in the words of the Constitution, are ``to form a \n     more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic \n     Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the \n     General Welfare, and secure the Blessings of liberty to \n     ourselves and our posterity.''\n\n  He continued:\n\n       Political service must flow out of such a commitment. \n     Convictions about war and peace, about the priorities \n     governing the expenditure of Federal funds, about the \n     patterns of economic wealth and distribution, about the \n     Government's responsibility toward the oppressed and \n     dispossessed both in our land and throughout the world, about \n     our Nation's system of law and justice, and about the meaning \n     of human liberty--these should be at the core of one's desire \n     to seek public office.\n\n  It was because of my admiration for Senator Hatfield that when I \nbecame Speaker of the Oregon House in 2007, I called him and asked if \nhe would consider coming to swear me in when I took the oath of office. \nHe readily agreed to do so. That was the last public event that my \nfather was at before he passed away. It was one of Senator Hatfield's \nlast major public events.\n  I so much appreciated the symbolism of a Republican and a Democrat \ncoming together at that moment, and sought to help guide the Oregon \nHouse, the same Chamber where Senator Hatfield started his political \ncareer to solve Oregon's problems.\n  It is because of my admiration for Senator Hatfield that when I came \nto this Chamber I asked for Senator Hatfield's desk. There are 14 names \ncarved into the desk drawer in his desk. The 13th is Senator \nHatfield's. As I looked at the names, I was surprised to discover this \ndesk had never crossed the aisle before. So I think it is symbolic of \nSenator Hatfield's career of public service, focused on solving \nproblems and working together across the aisle, that his desk made that \njourney to where it is now.\n\n  During those walks back and forth between here and the Russell Senate \nOffice Building, Senator Hatfield paused one day to pull the leaf off a \nGinkgo tree. He said: Jeff, this is one of the simplest of God's \ncreations. Why is it that folks can't see the beauty of God's creation \nin the very simplest of one of his plants?\n  I held that leaf tightly in my hand, determined to preserve it. Just \nas we got back to the office, he plucked it out of my hand and said: \nWell, of course, you don't want to continue to carry that leaf. I \ndidn't have the courage at that moment to say: No, I would treasure \nthat leaf all my life, and then grab it back from him. So I don't have \nthe leaf, but I take that memory of his deep personal faith and \nconviction.\n  I was sharing this story with another intern who served with Senator \nHatfield in 1985, and he said: Well, let me tell you another story \nabout a tree and Senator Hatfield. On this walk between the Capitol and \nthe Russell Senate Office Building there is a tree that Senator \nHatfield planted. It is a Metasequoia tree. It so happens the \nMetasequoia used to grow throughout Oregon millions of years ago. When \npeople found the fossils and studied them, they concluded the tree was \nextinct--until the 1940s when they found a stand of Metasequoias \ngrowing in China.\n  Senator Hatfield arranged to have one of these trees planted in that \nwalk. It so happens in 2005, when I was House Democratic leader in \nOregon, we passed a bill that made the Metasequoia tree the fossil of \nOregon, but we didn't know about this tree Senator Hatfield had \nplanted. But there it is today. It is now 25 years old. It sheds its \nneedles every winter, so people think it is a fir tree that has died. \nBut it comes roaring back to life in the spring.\n  Now, 25 years into its life, it is equal to the highest of the broad \nleaf trees on the grounds of the Capitol. In another 25 years the \nHatfield tree is going to soar over these Capitol grounds. In so doing, \nit is going to represent the values he fought for--the courage of one's \nconvictions, the effort to get beyond the bumper stickers and into the \nnitty-gritty of issues, and to come to a conscientious decision that \nwill take our Nation forward, the determination to be oriented toward \nsolving problems and not to a partisan divide.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, would my colleague yield?\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Certainly.\n\n[[Page S5364]]\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. I appreciate that, and I certainly don't want to interrupt \nhis very eloquent remarks.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time for tributes to \nformer Senator Hatfield be extended until 3:30 so that my friend and \ncolleague can speak, as well as Senators Leahy, Alexander, Cochran, \nBingaman, and Levin, who all wish to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I have just one closing comment, and that \nis this: This is a picture of the Senator Hatfield tree. It has my \nstaff in front of it. We went out there on July 12, Senator Hatfield's \nbirthday, to take this picture and we hoped to give this to him. We \ndidn't have a chance to do that before he passed away. But I think this \ntree will serve as a living reminder of all that he championed \nthroughout his tremendous career. We have lost a great man, and our \nSenate and our Nation are poorer for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, let me speak a little bit about Mark \nHatfield, because those of us who knew Mark thought the world of him. I \nhad an opportunity to know him and to serve with him, and for 23 years \nI served with him in the Senate.\n  I rise to pay tribute to Mark as a dedicated public servant and a \nrespected lawmaker, a man whom I liked to call my friend, and I think \nvirtually everybody serving during that time, Republican and Democrat \nalike, considered him a friend.\n  He dedicated nearly his entire life to public service. He served in \nthe U.S. Navy during World War II. He took part in the battles of Iwo \nJima and Okinawa. He taught political science in Oregon at Willamette \nCollege for 7 years. He served in the Oregon State legislature. He \nserved two terms as Governor. I remember him smiling when somebody \nwould see him in the corridors and call him Governor. He became \nOregon's longest serving Senator. He served five terms in the Senate.\n  Unfortunately, Mark was one of a dying breed in politics today. He \nwas an old-fashioned Senator and a political moderate. He came from a \nbrand of Senators that included names such as Bob Stafford and George \nAiken, both from Vermont. Oregon, like my State, prizes independence in \ntheir elected officials, and he was certainly never afraid to buck his \nparty. From his opposition to the war in Vietnam to his early support \nfor the Endangered Species Act and federally protected wilderness, Mark \nshowed us all that he was ruled only by the people of Oregon and his \nconscience.\n  A true compassion for people drove many of Mark's decisions. After \nbeing one of the first American servicemen to see the destruction and \ncarnage of Hiroshima following the atomic bombing, he later declared \nhis leadership in the campaign to pass the 1987 nuclear weapons test \nban, one of his major accomplishments.\n  Having a father with Alzheimer's disease and other family members \nwith cancer, Mark became one of the strongest Senate advocates of \nFederal spending on medical research. He also supported prohibiting the \nsale of arms to undemocratic countries and countries that did not \nrespect human rights.\n  Spending 8 years as the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, \nMark Hatfield did an amazing amount of good for his State of Oregon. In \nfact, it is hard to travel in the State of Oregon without seeing the \ndifferences he made.\n  Senator Hatfield was always known for his courteousness. Despite his \nindependent streak, he had complete respect on both sides of the aisle. \nMore than once I was there, and my two colleagues from Oregon on the \nfloor know this, when people would come up to him and call him ``Saint \nMark.''\n  It is important to remember that despite the squabbling that goes on \nin Washington these days, there are politicians who care deeply about \nthe well-being of their colleagues in their State.\n  On a personal note, when I came to the Senate, I was No. 99 in \nseniority. Actually, there were only 99 of us in the Senate because \nthere had been a tied race in New Hampshire. So I was the junior most \nSenator, sitting way over in the corner seat. Several of the more \nsenior Senators reminded me how junior I was. I received a handwritten \nnote, which I still have, from a Senator who wrote: When I came to the \nSenate, I was No. 99. But you move up. You move up quickly in \nseniority. He said: My door is always open to you. Let me know what I \ncan do to help.\n  That Senator was Mark Hatfield. We became friends from that moment. I \ndid go to him for advice. Marcelle and I traveled with him and \nAntoinette in numerous parts of the world. I can still remember the \nlaughter on the plane. We would talk about everything--everything from \nchildren to politics, to sports, to whatever.\n  What a wonderful person. He was a public servant. He was a statesman. \nHe was a friend. I consider myself fortunate to have known him, but \nespecially to have served with him. This Senate was a better place with \nMark Hatfield.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, before he leaves the floor, let me thank \nChairman Leahy for his kind and gracious thoughts. I know Senator \nHatfield was very fond of the Senator as well. You have represented his \nvalues very well. I thank the Senator for those remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mark Hatfield was elected to the Senate in 1966. It \nwas a distinguished class that included some prominent Republicans, \nsort of a new wave in the Republican Party. In addition to Governor \nHatfield, a former two-term Governor, there was Charles Percy of \nIllinois, former President of Bell & Howell; there was Ed Brooke of \nMassachusetts, the first African American popularly elected to the \nSenate.\n  Also in that Republican class were Cliff Hansen, a prominent rancher \nfrom Wyoming, and a young man who was a son-in-law of then-Republican \nleader, Everett Dirksen, Howard H. Baker, Jr.\n  I hitched a ride with Howard Baker to Washington, DC, in that year \nand went to work as Baker's legislative assistant in 1967, and, of \ncourse, had a chance to meet Senator Hatfield. At that time, there was \nless space for Senators than there is even today. So new Senators were \nput into rooms with each other. For example, Senator Baker and Senator \nBrooke and all their staffs were put in a single room, separated only \nby a partition.\n  They got along with that for 6 months. But Senator Hatfield did not \nlike it very much. After all, he had been a Governor for two terms and \nwas not used to being treated in that way. He was polite about it, as \nhe always was. But soon he made a mission. He went around the Senate \nand the Capitol and he counted up all the rooms that then-Senator James \nEastland of Mississippi had taken to himself. He found 34 different \nrooms that were assigned to Senator Eastland and only half a room was \nassigned to Hatfield.\n  Senator Hatfield then reported to the Republican conference that \nEastland had 34 rooms and that apparently someone was living in one of \nthe rooms because someone from Restaurant Associates was putting a tray \nof food outside the door of this room in the Capitol and every morning \ntwo arms would come out and bring the food in.\n  This was Senator Hatfield's first report to the Senate. I saw him \nabout 25 years later, when he was chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee and had a lot of power. I said: Senator Hatfield, how many \nrooms do you have now? He just smiled. My guess is he probably had 34.\n  But what I remember about Senator Hatfield, as a very young aide, was \nhow unfailingly courteous he was to every single person. If you caught \nhis attention, you had his full attention. It is easy to see why he was \nelected to the Senate for 30 years. It is easy to see why he won 11 \nelections.\n  Of course, the other reason, he was so interesting. He was a Baptist. \nHe was a Libertarian. He was a great friend of Billy Graham. He was \npro-life, not just on abortion but on the death penalty as well. He was \nantiwar. He was antibalanced budget. He was an interesting, \nindependent, decent man. I simply wanted to say, from the vantage point \nof someone who feels privileged to serve in the Senate, what an \nimpression this man from Oregon made on a 26-year-old young aide to \nHoward Baker in 1967.\n  I remember him for his courtesy, his decency, and for his \nindependence.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I applaud my colleague from Tennessee. I\n\n[[Page S5365]]\n\nappreciate him coming to make comments about his service with Senator \nHatfield. When I was first coming to the Senate, Senator Hatfield asked \nme to bring greetings to his former colleagues. One of the first \nconversations I was able to have was to sit down with Senator Lamar \nAlexander who, like Senator Hatfield, served as a Governor, and who \nembodies so many of the qualities Senator Hatfield worked to cultivate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, today, the Senate mourns the death of the \nformer United States Senator of the State of Oregon, Mark Odom \nHatfield. He was elected to the Senate in 1966, and served for 30 years \nuntil his retirement.\n  The U.S. Senate lost one of its most talented and successful Senators \nwhen Mark Hatfield retired from this body.\n  It was a pleasure for me to serve on the Appropriations Committee \nwhen he became Chairman and to learn from his example of courtesy to \nothers and his polite but unapologetic adherence to his personal views \nand convictions, even when they may have differed from those of others.\n  His service reflected great credit on the United States Senate.\n  Senator Hatfield was a tireless and effective advocate for serious \nreforms aimed at improving the quality of life for all Americans and \naddressing what he called ``the desperate human needs in our midst.'' \nDuring the 1980s, he effectively used his Appropriations Chairmanship \nto champion a wide range of issues from human rights to improvements in \nhealth and education programs and environmental and conservation \nissues; and he got results.\n  Senator Hatfield's strength of character and commitment to doing the \nright thing, according to his conscience, whatever the consequences, \nwas widely admired.\n  His contributions through his lifetime of dedicated service in Oregon \nand our Nation's capital are impressive, and will be long respected.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan outline of Senator Hatfield's legislative accomplishments.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Former Senator Mark Hatfield's Legislative Highlights\n\n       Served five terms as a United States Senator for Oregon \n     making him the longest serving U.S. Senator from Oregon. \n     (1967-1997) Twice served as chairman of the Appropriations \n     Committee (1981-1987 and 1995-1997)\n       As chairman and later ranking Republican on the Senate \n     Appropriations Committee, Senator Hatfield steered millions \n     of dollars to public works projects in Oregon. They ranged \n     from national scenic areas and hydropower dams to the state \n     university system and the Marine Science Center that bears \n     his name. Senator Hatfield fought earnestly throughout his \n     career for environmental protection and conservation, \n     including reforestation, the development of alternative \n     energy, and pollution control. He was a longtime defender of \n     Native American tribes, serving on the Indian Review \n     Commission to protect treaty rights on tribal lands.\n       Senator Hatfield quadrupled Oregon's wilderness areas to \n     more than two million acres and worked successfully to \n     protect the Columbia River Gorge, the Oregon Dunes and \n     Oregon's rivers. During his last session of Congress, \n     Hatfield helped preserve the Opal Creek Wilderness from \n     logging. He also generously funded a wide variety of civic, \n     academic and environmental programs.\n       Senator Hatfield restored funding for the National \n     Institutes of Health and secured appropriations for the \n     improvement of the Oregon Health & Sciences University, now a \n     leading U.S. research institution. In a hushed congressional \n     hearing room in 1990, he pleaded for increased money for \n     Alzheimer's research while describing how the disease had \n     reduced his father, a powerfully built former blacksmith, to \n     a ``vegetable.''\n       His unwavering commitment to peace and matters of national \n     security were heavily influenced by his experiences as a \n     young naval officer in World War II. He manned a landing \n     craft during the invasion of Iwo Jima in 1944 and then became \n     one of the first Americans to see the devastation in \n     Hiroshima the following year. Senator Hatfield believed that \n     lasting national security is not achieved through military \n     might exclusively, but only possible when people have access \n     to education, health care, housing and job opportunities.\n       In 1970 with Senator George McGovern (D-South Dakota), he \n     co-sponsored the McGovern-Hatfield Amendment, which called \n     for a complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from Vietnam.\n       In the 1980s, Hatfield co-sponsored nuclear weapons freeze \n     legislation with Senator Ted Kennedy. He also advocated for \n     the closure of the N-Reactor at the Hanford Nuclear \n     Reservation, though he was a supporter of nuclear fusion \n     programs. The N-Reactor was used for producing weapons grade \n     plutonium while producing electricity.\n       Because of his opposition to what he viewed as excessive \n     defense spending and an unnecessary military buildup under \n     President Reagan, Senator Hatfield was the lone Republican to \n     vote against the 1981 fiscal year's appropriations bill for \n     the Department of Defense.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am honored to join with my colleagues \nin saying a few words about our former colleague, Mark Hatfield.\n  At the time I came to the Senate, Mark Hatfield had already served \nfor 16 years. For the next 14 years we were colleagues and friends in \nthe Senate. His retirement in 1997 was an occasion for regret for all \nof us who knew him and admired him. He set a very high standard for \nservice in the Senate.\n  He was a master of the complex spending and tax issues that are the \nweekly focus of most Senate work. Of course, in his role as chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee, he was respected and appreciated for his \nfair-minded consideration of requests from all Senators--Democrat and \nRepublican and Independent. He was a model of civility and of kindness, \nand he took a genuine interest in the well-being of those with whom he \nworked, both Senators and staff and all of those who worked to keep the \nSenate functioning.\n  He had a heartfelt commitment to seeking nonmilitary solutions to our \nNation's problems around the world, and his votes--including his votes \nagainst the Vietnam War--reflected that strongly held commitment.\n  It was not in Mark Hatfield's nature to be a demagogue on any issue. \nHe saw no advantage, political or otherwise, in twisting issues. The \npandering and posturing that afflict much of our political debate today \nwere not part of the politics he practiced.\n  I considered Mark both a mentor and a friend during the time he \nserved in the Senate and when I was able to serve with him. He has been \ngreatly missed since his retirement from the Senate, and now, of \ncourse, our sense of loss is even greater.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to pay tribute to \nthe life and the public service of Mark Hatfield.\n  Mark Hatfield began his lifelong career of public service in the U.S. \nNavy during World War II. After the war he returned to Oregon where he \nserved in the State house of representatives, in the State senate, as \nthe Oregon secretary of state, and eventually as Governor of the State. \nFortunately for us--for the Senate and for the country--Mark Hatfield \ndid continue his career of public service and went on to serve five \nterms in the U.S. Senate.\n  During his time in the Senate, Mark Hatfield repeatedly demonstrated \nhe possessed the courage of his convictions. We have heard that word \n``courage'' used this afternoon by Oregon Senators and others as it \nrelates to Mark Hatfield, and there are so many examples of that \ncourage, including an unpopular position he took relative to the \nVietnam war. But in 1995 he opposed the balanced budget constitutional \namendment, which was then under consideration by the Senate. It was a \ndifficult position then to take as it is today. But he followed the \ncourage of his convictions, and this is what he said about the \nconstitutional amendment they were debating in the Senate back in 1995:\n\n       A balanced budget can come only through leadership and \n     compromise. This compromise must come from each one of us. . \n     . . In the end there is no easy answer, and there never will \n     be. Regardless of the procedural restraint in place, where \n     there is political will to create a balanced budget we will \n     create one. Where there is a will to avoid one, we will avoid \n     it. . . . A vote for this balanced budget constitutional \n     amendment is not a vote for a balanced budget, it is a vote \n     for a fig leaf.\n\n  Mark Hatfield said it as he believed it, straight from the shoulder--\ncourageously and direct. He did so in regard to many other issues.\n  From the vantage point of the Appropriations Committee, Senator \nHatfield was able to champion causes near and dear not only to his \nheart but near and dear to the hearts of so many Americans. Among these \ncauses was medical\n\n[[Page S5366]]\n\nresearch. Senator Hatfield was such an effective supporter of medical \nresearch that in 2005--8 years after his retirement from the Senate--\nthe National Institutes of Health opened the Mark Hatfield Clinical \nResearch Center in honor of his career-long support of medical \nresearch.\n  How well I personally remember, as a member of the FDR Memorial \nCommission, how Mark Hatfield joined Danny Inouye, his cochairman, to \nfinally lead us to build the long overdue memorial to one of America's \ngreatest Presidents.\n  Today, the Senate mourns the passing of Senator Hatfield. How vividly \nthose of us who had the pleasure of serving with him remember him. My \nwife Barbara and my deepest sympathies go out to Mark's wife \nAntoinette, to their family, and to their friends. As the Senate honors \nhis extraordinary career, we can all take inspiration from his \nwillingness to join with colleagues of both parties to achieve enduring \ngoals.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wish to join my colleagues in \nremembering Senator Mark Hatfield, an extraordinarily good man, a man \nof dignity and integrity. I didn't have the opportunity to serve with \nhim in the Senate, but he chaired the Senate Appropriations Committee \nwhen I was a member of the House Appropriations Committee, so \noftentimes we would come together in conference on a given issue, and I \nadmired him greatly.\n  Mark Hatfield was an independent man throughout his public career. He \nwas a man of civility and deep faith, a devout evangelical Christian. \nHe was a Republican who believed government could be a force for good.\n  During the course of my statement, I will read some comments by \nSenator Mark Hatfield, and those who are following this should pause \nand reflect that his was once a major voice in the Republican Party. \nUnfortunately, few, if any, voices such as his can be heard today. I \nhope there are those who are listening who will take heart that it is \nconsistent with Republican principles to stand for the values of Mark \nHatfield.\n  Announcing his retirement from the Senate in 1995, Mark Hatfield \nsaid:\n\n       As a young man I felt the call of public service and \n     believed in the positive impact government can have on the \n     lives of people. Government service has allowed me to promote \n     peace, protect human life, enhance education, safeguard our \n     environment, improve the health care of Oregonians, and guard \n     the rights of the individual.\n\n  As I said, though I didn't have the honor of actually serving in the \nSenate with Mark Hatfield, we shared a common hero. If a person visited \nhis Hart Office Building suite and went to his conference room, they \nwould see the most amazing display of memorabilia and tributes to \nAbraham Lincoln I have seen anywhere outside of my hometown of \nSpringfield, IL. One whole wall in Senator Hatfield's office was \ncovered with a collection of Abraham Lincoln paintings, photographs, \nand memorabilia. His fascination with Lincoln began when he was in \ngrade school and he first learned about the evil of slavery and the \nleadership Lincoln provided in abolishing it.\n  Sometimes at night, Mark Hatfield said to a reporter, he liked to \nquietly slip down to the Lincoln Memorial to meditate. ``It's like a \ncathedral,'' he said. ``People come in talking loudly, but then they go \nup the steps, and it's amazing, they all begin to whisper. How can they \nhelp it?''\n  I can recall one particular instance where Mark Hatfield agreed to \ncome to my hometown of Springfield, IL. Each year on February 12, we \nhave the Abraham Lincoln Association dinner, and we invite people who \nare in public life or who are historians and academics to come and talk \nabout their impressions of some aspect of the life of Abraham Lincoln. \nI remember his speech because he spoke about a man named Edward \nDickinson Baker.\n  Edward Dickinson Baker had served in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives as a Congressman from Illinois from two separate \ncongressional districts. He then moved to Oregon and became a Senator \nfrom the State of Oregon. He was a close friend of President Abraham \nLincoln. He was killed early in the Civil War at the Battle of Ball's \nBluff. His statue is one of the Oregon statues here in the Capitol \nBuilding.\n  Mark Hatfield came to tell a story of Edward Dickinson Baker and the \nfriendship of Abraham Lincoln and the connection with Oregon. I went up \nto him afterward and said: There is another part of this story you \nmight find interesting. After Abraham Lincoln served as a Congressman--\nhe was given one term, which was the agreement with the Whigs back in \nIllinois. He wanted to stay on, but they said: No, you can't. So they \noffered him another job which he turned down before returning to \nSpringfield to practice law, and that was the job to be the provincial \nGovernor of Oregon, the territory of Oregon. Had Lincoln made that \ndecision, history might have been a lot different for America. Hatfield \nand I laughed about that and the Oregon connection between Lincoln and \nEdward Dickinson Baker. He was an extraordinary man, Hatfield was, in \nthat he not only admired Lincoln, but he studied him and the history of \nhis life.\n  Mark was born in 1922, the son of a railroad blacksmith and a \nschoolteacher. He attended Willamette University in Salem, OR. He ran \nfor the office of student body president--the only race he ever lost.\n  As a young Navy officer in World War II, Mark Hatfield was at both \nOkinawa and Iwo Jima, the two Pacific islands that were the scene of \nsome of the bloodiest fighting of the war. Later, he was one of the \nfirst Americans to enter Hiroshima after the city was devastated by the \nfirst atomic bomb. Those experiences and his own religious views had a \nprofound influence on his beliefs about the use of military power.\n  He was a lifelong foe of excessive arms buildup. He told the \nChristian Science Monitor in 1982:\n\n       There comes a time in a Nation's life when additional money \n     spent for rockets and bombs, far from strengthening national \n     security, will actually weaken national security--when there \n     are people who are hungry and not fed, people who are cold \n     and not clothed.\n\n  Mark Hatfield once castigated Democrats in the 1980s for not speaking \nup strongly enough about what he considered excessive military spending \nduring the Ronald Reagan administration. He was the only Senator to \nhave voted against the Vietnam war and the Persian Gulf war.\n  Politics wasn't his first calling. He was a college professor and \nthen college president. In 1956, he was elected to the Oregon State \nLegislature, where he was instrumental in passing measures banning \nracial discrimination in housing and public accommodations--a decade \nbefore the government considered similar civil rights laws here in \nWashington. From there, it was a steady climb to State senator and \nsecretary of state. In 1958, he was elected Governor, becoming the \nyoungest ever in his State. He was reelected in 1962.\n  He successfully ran for the Senate in 1966 with a straightforward \nplatform that included opposition to the Vietnam war. In all, he spent \n30 years in this body, including 8 years as chairman of the powerful \nSenate Appropriations Committee. I remember him as chairman. When he \nwould have conference committees, you could always count on Mark \nHatfield to be genteel, courteous, and bipartisan. It was a great \nexperience. Every conference committee was a great experience. The man \nreally exuded fairness and integrity, and it is one of the reasons I \nwanted to come to the floor today and say a few words about how much he \nmeant to me. When it came to particular issues on appropriations, he \nreally focused on medical research, which was very important to him, \nand on efforts to eliminate poverty in the United States.\n  In 1995, he cast a historic vote. He was the only Republican to vote \nagainst a constitutional amendment to require a balanced Federal \nbudget. His vote meant defeat for the measure because it fell one vote \nshort for the two-thirds majority needed for passage. Senator Hatfield \nsaid he voted against the amendment for two reasons: because he \nbelieved it would starve social programs and tear deep holes in \nAmerica's safety net and because it exempted defense and entitlement \nspending from cuts. Besides, he said, if Congress wanted a balanced \nbudget, all it had to do was pass one.\n  Some younger Senators in his party were so angry at Hatfield for \nhaving cost them this balanced budget amendment that they set out to \nstrip him of\n\n[[Page S5367]]\n\nhis committee chairmanship as chairman of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee. Luckily, that threat never materialized. Senator Mark \nHatfield shrugged off their anger. He told a reporter:\n\n       I've been out of step most of my political life. So what \n     else is new?\n\n  In the year after the balanced budget amendment vote, the \nAppropriations Committee, under Chairman Hatfield's leadership, went on \nto cut more than $22 billion in discretionary nondefense spending from \nthe budget. He wasn't opposed to spending cuts, but he didn't support a \nconstitutional amendment.\n  I wish to offer my condolences to Senator Hatfield's wife Antoinette, \nwho has been his partner for more than 50 years, and his children and \ngrandchildren.\n  ``Stand alone or come home''--that is the advice Mark Hatfield's \nfather gave him about facing moral choices, and Mark Hatfield lived his \nlife by that rule. Now he has gone home, and we are left to recall and \ncelebrate the life and service of this good man.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the passing \nlast month of Mark Hatfield, a former colleague of mine in the U.S. \nSenate whose service to the people of our great Nation and his beloved \nState of Oregon is truly noteworthy and continues to inspire public \nservants today, 15 years after his retirement in 1996 from the world's \ngreatest deliberative body.\n  Indeed, service is the hallmark of Senator Hatfield's legacy; I know \nbecause I had the pleasure of serving alongside him for many years. \nSenator Hatfield served the people of Oregon as a State legislator, as \ntheir secretary of state, as their Governor, and as a U.S. Senator. The \nonly election he ever lost was for student body president for his \nbeloved alma matter, Willamette! Although that is a record any \nstatesman can envy, it is more importantly, an example of public \nservice we can all admire.\n  As a Senator, Mark Hatfield served the people of Oregon for 30 \nyears--longer than anybody in the history of the State--and he served \nthem well. He was an Oregonian through and through, and you could tell \nhe loved his home State. He worked tirelessly for all Oregonians, \nregardless of their background or political persuasion.\n  As a young naval officer, Mark Hatfield experienced the battle of Iwo \nJima and the aftermath of the atomic bomb in Hiroshima. These \nexperiences had a profound and lifelong effect on Senator Hatfield. He \nhated war, but he always had respect for our servicemen and women. \nSenator Hatfield was also deeply religious, and relied upon his \nreligious convictions and love for this country to guide him. He \nbelieved in America as what some call it, ``a miracle of light.''\n  Senator Hatfield and I did not always agree on everything, but we \nrespected each other's views. I admired that Senator Hatfield always \ntried to find common ground with his fellow Senators. This made him a \nsuccessful statesman and a respected individual on both sides of the \naisle.\n  Today, I am honored to have the privilege to add my voice to the \nchorus of praise for this outstanding public servant whose service will \nlong endure in the heads and hearts of all Americans, especially those \nwho knew and had the pleasure of serving with him. My thoughts and \nprayers are with his family as they mourn the loss and celebrate the \nlife of this great man.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring \nthe memory of Mark Hatfield, a former Governor and U.S. Senator from \nthe State of Oregon. Mr. Hatfield passed away on August 7, 2011, in \nPortland at the age of 89.\n  The son of a Baptist railroad blacksmith and a schoolteacher, Mr. \nHatfield was born in Dallas, OR, on July 12, 1922. He graduated from \nWillamette University in 1943, having fast-tracked his studies so that \nhe could enlist with the Naval Reserve.\n  As a young man, Mr. Hatfield served in World War II at the battles of \nIwo Jima and Okinawa and later saw firsthand the devastation of the \natomic bombing of Hiroshima. These experiences shaped him personally \nand politically, and he became an outspoken advocate for peace, and a \nprominent opponent of the Vietnam war.\n  In 1966, Governor Hatfield stood alone in the National Governors \nAssociation when he voted against supporting the Vietnam war. And in \n1970, as a Member of the U.S, Senate, he sponsored the McGovern-\nHatfield amendment with Senator George McGovern of South Dakota, which \nwould have created a deadline to end U.S. military action in Vietnam.\n  Senator Hatfield later was one of only two Republicans along with \nSenator Charles Grassley of Iowa--to vote against the 1991 Senate \nresolution authorizing the first gulf war.\n  Mr. Hatfield will also be remembered as a leader in the fight against \nthe proliferation of nuclear weapons.\n  In 1982, he introduced S.J. Res. 163--the nuclear freeze amendment--\nwith Senator Edward Kennedy, which argued that ``the greatest challenge \nfacing the Earth is to prevent the occurrence of nuclear war by \naccident or design.''\n  Had it passed, the resolution would have urged the United States and \nthe Soviet Union to ``pursue a complete halt to the nuclear arms \nrace.''\n  Senator Hatfield told the Christian Science Monitor, ``We've \ndeveloped the ability to destroy the planet, but that doesn't give us \nthe right to destroy the planet.''\n  Throughout his career in public service, Mr. Hatfield fought for what \nhe believed was right, rather than walking any strict party line. He \nfought for peace, for civil rights, for the environment, and for \nmedical research.\n  As chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee for two terms, he \nsupported increased budgets for the National Institutes of Health; \nfought for crucial social programs in a time of shrinking government; \nand was an early supporter of the Endangered Species Act.\n  As a dedicated, remarkable and outspoken public servant, Mark \nHatfield's life was filled with a wide range of service and \naccomplishments. Early in his career, he said, ``I pray for the \nintegrity, justice and courage to vote the correct vote, not the \npolitical vote.'' It is clear he lived up to this principle and made \nextraordinary contributions to our nation and to the world. Our \nthoughts and prayers go out to his family. He will be missed.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life and \nlegacy of Senator Mark Hatfield--a lifelong Oregonian, a genuine \nstatesman, and a dedicated public servant. With a career in government \nthat spanned nearly five decades, Mark leaves behind a legacy of \nservice and a model of civility in American political life.\n  From the shores of Iwo Jima, to the halls of the statehouse in Salem, \nOregon, and the Chamber of the U.S. Senate, Mark dedicated his life to \nour country. He served courageously as a naval officer in the Second \nWorld War in the Pacific theater. He was a notable lawmaker in the \nOregon State Legislature, championing civil rights legislation in the \n1950s well before the Federal Government's landmark efforts in that \narea. He also served as Oregon's secretary of state, and for two terms, \nhe was a successful Governor. He went on to serve the people of Oregon \nas a U.S. Senator for three decades.\n  I knew Mark to be a man of decency, always civil in the way he \nconducted his business, and I believe that was his signature strength \nas a legislator. While Mark and I did not always agree, he was never \ndisagreeable. He was principled and passionate about the things he \nbelieved to be true, but he was also respectful of those with whom he \ndisagreed. His demeanor won him many friends and built many fruitful \nrelationships on both sides of the aisle, making him a most effective \nlegislator.\n  Upon retiring from the Senate in 1996, Mark reflected upon the nature \nof our country's politics, saying, ``I'm going to miss the people, but \nnot the process.'' He had grown disenchanted with the coarse \npartisanship that had warped the political process, and he knew that if \nwe were to keep moving forward as a country, the vital center would \nhave to hold, civility would have to prevail, and bipartisanship would \nhave to return. Solutions do not come from gridlock. Bipartisanship has \nto win the day.\n  Since Mark retired from the Senate, our politics have become even \nmore tribal. But I believe it would serve us all well, as we honor his \nlife, to reflect upon the example he set--that disagreements do not \nhave to become roadblocks but instead can be opportunities for \ninnovative compromise.\n\n[[Page S5368]]\n\n  I learned a great deal from Mark Hatfield during our time in the \nSenate together, and I am grateful for this opportunity to honor Mark's \nmemory.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life and \nlegacy of Senator Mark Hatfield. He was a true giant, a man who placed \nprinciple above politics--doing what he felt was right for the people \nof Oregon and the Nation.\n  Senator Hatfield's life was one of service. He served as a naval \nofficer during World War II. He fought in the battles of Iwo Jima and \nOkinawa. Later, he was one of the first Americans to see the effects of \nthe atomic bombing of Hiroshima. He served in the Oregon state \nlegislature, as secretary of state and Governor, and then as Senator of \nthe United States.\n  In the Senate, Senator Hatfield was known for his many \naccomplishments for the people of Oregon. He used his position on the \nAppropriations Committee, where he became chairman, to bring jobs and \nopportunity to his State. One of his greatest legacies is in foreign \npolicy, nuclear disarmament, and in the pursuit of peace. Senator \nHatfield was one of the first in the Senate to oppose the Vietnam war. \nHe was a leader in the pursuit of nuclear disarmament, and he was a \nsteadfast supporter of civil rights.\n  I was honored to serve with Senator Hatfield in the Senate and on the \nAppropriations Committee. We were neighbors on the 7th floor of the \nHart Building. We worked together on many important issues, especially \non international women's rights. As coastal Senators, we also worked \ntogether on jobs that affected both of our States--everything from \nfishery issues to saving jobs in the shrinking shipbuilding industry.\n  Senator Hatfield was a man of deep faith, known for putting his \nvalues into action. He was also a gentleman who accomplished so much \nfor his State and his Nation. He will be greatly missed.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would like to join those who have \nspoken or intend to speak about our former colleague Mark Hatfield.\n  Most people remember Mark as one of our party's most liberal \nmembers--as a Republican who called himself a liberal even after \nDemocrats started avoiding the term.\n  I think he would like to have been remembered as someone who tried to \nbring people together or as he put it, as a reconciler.\n  He was, as we all know, a man of deep principle and compassion. He \nwas also a gifted politician, to this day the longest serving Senator \nin Oregon history.\n  Mark was also deeply influenced by his experiences.\n  It is said his deep aversion to war derived, in part, from his \nexperience as one of the first American servicemen to enter Hiroshima \nafter the dropping of the atomic bomb.\n  Those of us who knew Mark as a colleague are glad to have had the \nchance to know him and serve with him. And I would like to take this \nopportunity to extend my heartfelt condolences to Antoinette and the \nHatfield children, as well as Mark's many grandchildren. America, and \nthe Senate family, have lost a good man.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, this afternoon we heard tributes to former \nSenator Mark Hatfield from a bipartisan group of Senators. I would like \nto add to those tributes by including in the Congressional Record the \neulogy that Senator Hatfield's son Visko delivered at his father's \nMemorial Service.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following statement be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Good afternoon, thank you Dr. Ogilvie, Father Mike \n     (Maslowski) amazing as usual, thank you. Pastor Ron \n     (Kinkead), thank you. Thank you also to the Village Baptist \n     church for providing this lovely sanctuary for today's Public \n     Memorial.\n       I would like to thank the distinguished guests, former \n     staff members, life-long friends, and complete strangers who \n     have turned out today to honor my father.\n       It is remarkable to see the outpouring of love and support \n     for the man we simply called Dad.\n       I have pondered this moment over and over in my head for a \n     long time.\n       Would I speak? What would I say?\n       What could I possibly add to what has already been said \n     about my father.\n       So many introductions, so much accolade, hundreds of \n     honors, countless speeches, ground breaking ceremonies, \n     ribbon cutting dedications, political campaigns, opinion \n     pages, articles and books.\n       Words, words, words and more words, volumes of stories some \n     true, some false and some, hybrids of both.\n       A dear friend advised me to share the personal side, share \n     the family side, and share something close to my heart.\n       I thought to myself, I have shared enough. I have shared my \n     childhood, I have shared my adolescence, and I have shared my \n     adulthood.\n       My entire life, shared as a function of a public figure.\n       The tank is pretty empty, what more could I share?\n       So I thought about it and came up with the reoccurring \n     question.\n       The question that, I have been asked throughout my life.\n       ``What is it like to be a Senator's son?''\n       I used to quip that I really didn't know anything different \n     he had always been a senator; except for the day I was born, \n     when he was Governor of this state of Oregon.\n       The only time in my life I wasn't a Senator's son, I was a \n     Governor's son.\n       What is it like to be a Senator's son?\n       To be in the public eye, under the microscope, in the \n     spotlight.\n       What was it like to grow up under the weight of assumption \n     and misconception, subject to the torment of political \n     persuasion?\n       In the shadow of a figure so large and with the awesome \n     responsibility of privilege, simply because the people of \n     Oregon had given my father their faith in him every six \n     years, five times.\n       What is it like to be a Senator's son?\n       I have been subpoenaed and compelled to testify in front of \n     a Senate ethics committee. Grilled for five hours by \n     government lawyers because someone thought my father had sold \n     out his career and the people of Oregon.\n       I witnessed my mother's real estate business shredded, \n     slowly, painfully and publicly, because someone thought my \n     father had sold out his career and the people of Oregon.\n       I have been hugged by total strangers who shared very \n     personal stories about how my father had changed their life, \n     or how he had bestowed their Eagle Scout award, on them \n     decades before.\n       In high school, I was walking a friend home after school. \n     Trailing us were two Secret Service agents. The same two who \n     had taken me to school earlier that morning, the same two who \n     had sat in on classes and in the lunchroom with me.\n       Two men whose job it was to throw down their lives for \n     mine. Not because mine was so important, but because the same \n     nut case had threatened the life of the President of the \n     United States and my father's life, in the same breath. While \n     my father and mother were out of the country, the thinking \n     was, the family would be the next, most likely target.\n       Agent Robert Alt, Agent Don and other members of the 24 \n     hour protection detail, I will never forget the position you \n     were in for two weeks because I am a senator's son.\n       Twelve years ago ran into friends, a couple from Oregon, on \n     the street in New York. Even more than being delighted at our \n     chance meeting, in a city of millions, they were giddy with \n     the news that they had just seen my father's obituary at the \n     New York Times.\n       With great surprise I informed them that I had just hung up \n     the phone with him not 30 minutes earlier.\n       They proceeded to clarify that they had won and auction \n     item--a tour of the New York Times offices. During the tour, \n     they had seen the Obituaries of the notable and famous. \n     Including my father's. Pre written, ready to go.\n       I remember one time at a photo studio in New York I was \n     introduced by a friend, to an Art Director from Oregon. Upon \n     hearing ``Oregon'' and ``Hatfield,'' I could see the light \n     bulb go on over the art director's head. The same connection, \n     I had awkwardly embraced many times in my life, was made. He \n     then asked in a definite and knowing voice . . . ``are you \n     related (I began nodding) to Tinker Hatfield?''\n       With great relief, I said, ``no I am not.''\n       No offense to the famed shoe designer at Nike.\n       What is it like to be a Senator's son?\n       I could tell you about the woman who came up to me when I \n     was 12 years old. I was with my father on a re-election \n     campaign swing thorough eastern Oregon. I was wearing a \n     three-piece, brown velvet suit--in eastern Oregon . . . in \n     July.\n       She had cornered me when I was alone. She waved her finger \n     in my face and exclaimed ``look at you in your fancy three \n     piece suit all dressed up from the east coast. You know we \n     have pretty girls here too, you just have to look for them \n     hiding behind the sage brush.''\n       I was stunned--where was the political playbook? What do I \n     say? I smiled and assured her I would keep my eye out for \n     girls hiding in the sage brush and I thanked her for \n     coming to the ``Meet Mark'' spaghetti dinner to support my \n     Dad.\n       One night at dinner at my home, I sat to the right of \n     former president Nixon, a dinner that included a round table \n     of official presidential historians. Nixon was brilliant, the \n     man fielded question after question on every aspect of \n     geopolitics, managed to eat his dinner and comment on how he \n     fondly remembered my mother's steamed green beans, and\n\n[[Page S5369]]\n\n     how happy he was that she had served them again that night.\n       He conjured a memory of a visit to Oregon when he was VP. \n     My father, as governor greeted him at the airport. Dad wore a \n     white trench coat, Nixon a black one. The former president \n     said it was a smart move wearing white, because, when the \n     front-page photo of the event was published the next day, it \n     was my Dad who jumped off the page, not him.\n       What is it like to be a Senator's son?\n       Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter, Billy Graham, all guests in \n     our home on separate occasions.\n       I have met Mother Theresa, Menachem Begin and the Pope.\n       I have flown onto the deck of an aircraft carrier, visited \n     mental institutions, medical research centers, and \n     courthouses.\n       Tom Brokaw wrote six simple pages about my father in his \n     book, The Greatest Generation. I always liked Tom Brokaw and \n     this book is amazing. It highlighted the few things and more \n     of what my father told me the ``one'' time he spoke about his \n     service in World War II. He spoke of how he was poised, as \n     the Commander of an Amphibious Craft, for the invasion of \n     mainland Japan. Of how if we had not dropped the atom bombs \n     on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, he would more than likely never \n     have made it to the shores of Japan alive.\n       He said the catharsis for him was in sharing his rations \n     with Japanese children, after his mission changed from that \n     of invader to clean up and relief operations, in the \n     aftermath of the bomb. He showed me a few small porcelain \n     pieces he had dug out of the rubble. Simple everyday objects, \n     teacups and saucers.\n       I will always be grateful to the people of Japan for their \n     sacrifice, because in doing so, one US Soldier made it back \n     alive and went on to become my father and to spend nearly \n     fifty years of public service, fighting for the lives of \n     millions of people worldwide.\n       I would learn more about my father reading books and \n     newspapers, than I would learn about him, from him, or so I \n     thought.\n       Dad was the man who taught me to pray.\n       To say thank you, to give thanks and to be grateful, to \n     give thanks for food, to give thanks for the blessings of the \n     day.\n       The prayer: Inner voice as outer voice.\n       ``God bless this food, in Jesus name amen.'' The kids' \n     simple prayer around our table.\n       ``Dear heavenly father we pray that you bless this food to \n     the nourishment of out bodies and thus to thy service in \n     Christ's name we pray, Amen.'' His simple version around our \n     table.\n       I have heard Dad give thanks in front of thousands and in \n     front of a few. Because he wanted to and because he was asked \n     to.\n       His faith was remarkable. His prayers were soothing, \n     thoughtful and kind.\n       I have gone to nearly every kind of church with my father. \n     But one in particular stood out . . . a Baptist church.\n       When I was a teenager, Dad would come into my room and wake \n     me up on a Sunday to go to church. Then he would come in \n     again and wake me up again.\n       Often times he would come in with a look of incredulous \n     disbelief, when it seemed as though I was not going to budge.\n       He would declare ``I cannot believe you can't commit one \n     hour of the week to the Lord.''\n       Well ``one hour'' in those days at this particular Baptist \n     church soon became about 35 minutes.\n       This was because when would arrive on time and take our \n     seats, the minister, Pastor Maritz--had kind of squeaky voice \n     and he would say--``I see we have Senator Hatfield in our \n     congregation today, perhaps he would lead us in the pastoral \n     prayer.''--Privacy shattered--Dad would rise and deliver, \n     praying for all of us, for those less fortunate, for those in \n     need, for our soldiers over seas, for our leaders to have \n     strength and wisdom to make good decisions, to make better \n     decisions.\n       Dad was fond of mixing church and state--in church--during \n     prayer.\n       I believe he thought there was certain irony in doing so.\n       And that in church, he was a safe enough distance from \n     those who might decry his faith and it's influence on him \n     when it came to matters of state.\n       When he had given enough pastoral prayers we began arriving \n     late to church, well after the pastoral prayer had been \n     given. Pastor Maritz began to catch on. Being the smart \n     Baptist that he was, he switched to asking dad to give the \n     benediction.\n       Not long afterward Dad re-maneuvered, so we would arrive \n     late AND then leave early. I felt okay with dedicating 35 \n     minutes a week, to the Lord in Church.\n       What is it like to be a Senator's son?\n       I want to read a letter, which I opened and read to my \n     father two years ago.\n       It was at a time when his health and his total awareness as \n     we knew it began to fade. I believe it was during this phase, \n     that his inner awareness was unwavering, was still intact.\n       The letter had been mailed to the MOH School of government \n     at PSU and had been forwarded on to dad's home. It was \n     written by Philip Millam.\n       (Read Letter)\n       I have had this letter on my desk for two years.\n       Forty Years this man carried the desire to thank my father. \n     To tell Dad that with the simplest words ``thank you . . . \n     thank you for your service,'' that Dad had made this man's \n     effort in an unpopular war, feel honorable. In the fewest of \n     words he had lessened the feelings of animosity and of being \n     marginalized.\n       It brought tears to my father's eyes and to mine. I was \n     proud of my father and he knew it.\n       Mr. Millam I would like to respectfully ask you to stand up \n     and to be recognized. For your service to our country, in the \n     most difficult of circumstances, I would like to thank you. \n     And for providing me with a memorable father and son moment, \n     I would like to say Thank You.\n       What is it like to be a Senator's son?\n       Awe, Awareness, Anger.\n       Pride, Press and Privilege.\n       The realization that it is not about who I have met, where \n     I have gone or what I have done.\n       It is to be witness to his impact on the lives of others.\n       Mark Odom Hatfield.\n       His life was never about the man or the name. To shower \n     praise on it, to honor it, to chisel it granite or cast it in \n     bronze or, to sully or demean it, or to criticize it, is \n     missing the point.\n       The point of my father's existence was not to collect \n     awards or praise, but rather, I believe, to teach a lesson.\n       The lesson is a simple one, yet too often overlooked.\n       The lesson is that we need to be kinder to one another, to \n     help and to teach each other.\n       To honor and to respect one another.\n       Because long after the man is gone and the buildings are \n     renamed or torn down, the lesson must live on in each of us.\n       The lesson from the teacher, from the servant leader.\n       The lesson in many instances was to stand up when others \n     chose to sit, to speak out when others were silent. To find \n     clarity when the noise was deafening. To forgive those who \n     are unforgivable.\n       The lesson is to protect life at all stages of \n     vulnerability, or as he used to say, in the womb, at the \n     gallows and on the battlefield.\n       Dad taught me that it cannot be the selfish, it must be the \n     selfless who make the world a better world.\n       Each one of us has a part to play,\n       Each one of us has influence on the other,\n       Each one of us has a responsibility to ourselves and in \n     turn, to each other.\n       Dad never wanted to be a giant, he preferred to have giant \n     impact. His were not the shoulders to stand on, his were foot \n     steps to follow.\n       A few months ago in what we thought were Dad's final \n     moments, it was late at night I was going into the second \n     straight day at his bedside. I was holding his hand and \n     telling him it was okay to let go, he had lived a good life \n     and fought long enough, we would take care of mom.\n       It was during this time, he and I had a remarkable \n     exchange.\n       At the time, he wasn't talking very much.\n       I asked him of there anything he needed or anything I could \n     do.\n       He straightened up his leaning body and opened his eyes \n     wide and he said.\n       ``You need to save a life.''\n       He asked me to save a life.\n       I said, ``Whose life should I save?''\n       He said, ``The first one you can.''\n       There was a long pause, he was staring straight ahead, not \n     blankly, but like he was seeing something that I wasn't.\n       I asked him what he was looking at, he said\n       ``There are so many poor people and people who are hungry, \n     who are on the doorstep.''\n       I paused a while, wondering.\n       Then I asked him ``what do they look like?''\n       Without hesitating, he said\n       ``They look like us.''\n       A glimpse at what it is like to be this senator's son.\n       It is a continual reminder that there is a calling to help \n     where ever possible, a calling to open our eyes to people who \n     we may think are different, or who we may think are less, \n     than who we think we are.\n       It is a reminder for us to open our eyes to help people who \n     others cannot see, or who others choose not to see.\n       Why?\n       Because they ``look like us.'' They are in fact us.\n       I would like to take a moment and thank from the bottom of \n     my heart, Dr. Francis Collins director of the NIH as well as \n     Dr. John Gallin, director of the MOH clinical research center \n     at NIH. Two men whose effort at sustaining human life and \n     medical research continues to inspire.\n       I would like also like to thank my sister Elizabeth who for \n     years has magnificently worn the titles of both doctor and \n     daughter, through some of the most difficult times during our \n     father's stages of declining health. You are a rock star of a \n     doctor. And a fabulous sister.\n       Lastly, I would like to thank my mother Antoinette \n     Hatfield, who for more decades than anyone, has stood by my \n     father's side in life. She has made sacrifices most of us \n     will never know, under more difficult circumstances than \n     anyone should have to.\n       Always the matriarch, she is the woman behind the man, in \n     front of the world.\n       Allow me to straighten your halo. You are an angel among \n     us.\n\n     Visko Hatfield, August 14, 2011.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I think we have seen in the last half hour, \nalmost going on an hour, the enormous goodwill that Senator Hatfield \ngenerated in the Senate, with Democrats\n\n[[Page S5370]]\n\nand Republicans alike coming to the floor. I just wanted to wrap up \nwith one last comment.\n  Senator Hatfield did not serve alone. He was accompanied through his \nextraordinary public service journey that we have heard discussed today \non the Senate floor by a remarkable woman, Antoinette Hatfield. For \nthose of us who knew Mrs. Hatfield, the only way we could sum her up \nwould be to say: What a woman. Whip smart, boundless energy, persistent \nin a way that made it clear she was going to push hard for what was \nimportant, but always in a way that left you with a sense that she \nwould be standing up for what was right and almost invariably with her \nhusband standing up for our State.\n  My colleague in the Chair, the Presiding Officer, Senator Merkley, \ndescribed his experiences with Senator Hatfield very eloquently. We \nhave heard that from one Senator after another. But I thought it was \nappropriate this afternoon--as many Senators knew Mrs. Hatfield and, I \nthink, share my views--and important to note that Senator Hatfield \noften said--and my colleague will recall it as well--he could not have \nmade the contributions to Oregon without having at his side, having the \ngood counsel, enjoying the affection of this wonderful woman, \nAntoinette Hatfield.\n  So as the Oregon delegation in the Senate wraps up these tributes, we \nsimply want to acknowledge not just Senator Hatfield's contributions \nbut the chance we have had to be with Mrs. Hatfield in work situations \nand personal situations, and we wish to express our gratitude for all \nshe has done for decades now working with her husband, working with \nOregonians to make Oregon a better place.\n  This afternoon, Antoinette Hatfield, as well as her late husband, has \nour undying gratitude.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor, and I note the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask that the order for the quorum call be \nrescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, they say the definition of insanity is doing \nthe same thing over and over and expecting a different result. We now \nhave been in 3 years of a policy that is not working. Joblessness is up \nand our debt has been downgraded. Our country is on a precipice, and \nyet we continue with the same people giving the same ideas that are not \nworking. It is important to know how we got here.\n  We are in a great recession, the worst recession since the Great \nDepression. How did we get here? We got here through bad economic \npolicy and bad monetary policy. This policy originated with Timothy \nGeithner when he was at the Federal Reserve in New York. It originated \nwith Ben Bernanke, the head of the Federal Reserve.\n  What did we do? We reappointed these people to higher office. They \nsay the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over \nand expecting a different result.\n  I would respectfully ask at this point we have a vote in the Senate. \nI think the American people have given a vote of no confidence to the \nSecretary of the Treasury. I think the American investors and worldwide \ninvestors have given a vote of no confidence to the debt ceiling deal \nand to what has been going on.\n  Over and over we are doing the same policy. We have now appointed as \nhead of the Council of Economic Advisers someone who brought us Cash \nfor Clunkers. We spent $1 trillion--money we don't have--trying to \nstimulate the economy and unemployment is worse. Gas prices have \ndoubled. Economic growth is anemic, if at all. We are in the process, \nperhaps, of sliding into another recession and something has to be \ndifferent. We cannot keep doing the same thing over and over and \nexpecting a different result.\n  For the first time in our history our debt has been downgraded. This \ncame after a policy that came from the Secretary of the Treasury and \nfrom this administration. It came from a deal the American people and \nthe world public, world class of investors, judged and deemed to be \ninadequate.\n  This country needs a shakeup. We need new ideas. We need different \npropositions. The same propositions, the same tired, old proposals are \nnot working. We are set during this administration to accumulate more \ndebt than with all 43 previous Presidents combined. We are accumulating \ndebt at $40,000 a second. We are spending money at $100,000 a second.\n  When a policy doesn't work, we need new policy leaders. There will \nnot be a new President until 2012, but this President could choose new \nadvisers because the advice he has been getting is not working. We are \nlanguishing. We are on the precipice of possibly going into another \nrecession, and I would suggest at this point we need a new Secretary of \nthe Treasury.\n  How did we get into this problem? We got into this problem because we \nhad a housing boom. This came from bad monetary policy. It came from \nthe Federal Reserve setting interest rates below the market rate, and \nthat signal was transmitted out into the economy and we got a housing \nboom. Then we had a housing depression. We are still in the midst of a \nhousing depression.\n  Where did that policy come from? That policy came from Secretary \nGeithner and Ben Bernanke.\n  What have we done? We have reappointed these people and reapproved \ntheir policies that got us into the problem in the first place. If we \nwant our country to thrive again, we must diagnose the problem \ncorrectly before we try to fix it. Because they didn't understand how \nwe got into this recession, they also passed a whole bunch of new \nregulations. The Dodd-Frank bill heaps all kinds of new regulations \nthat make it harder to get a home loan.\n  In the midst of a housing depression, we have heaped all these new \nrules on community banks. You know what? In my State of Kentucky, not \none bank failed. The problem is at the Federal Reserve. The problem is \nwith the policy. The problem is with the people we still have running \nthis country and advising the President.\n  What I am asking for today is a vote of no confidence on Timothy \nGeithner. I see no reason and no objective evidence that any of his \npolicies are succeeding. I have come to the floor today to ask for this \nvote, and we will continue to try to get this vote. We have introduced \na resolution in favor of voting a vote of no confidence on Timothy \nGeithner, and I hope this body will consider it.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, on Monday, we observed but did not \ncelebrate Labor Day. I say ``observed and did not celebrate'' because \nwe are painfully aware that there are at least 29 million underemployed \nand unemployed Americans in our midst. Last Friday, the Department of \nLabor sent shock waves through the global economy by reporting that the \nU.S. economy created zero net jobs in August. A growing chorus of \neconomists is warning against the dangers of making immediate draconian \ncuts to the Federal budget--something that, by its very nature, will \ndrain demand, reduce growth, and destroy jobs.\n  Tragically, too many Members of Congress refuse to listen. Over the \nsummer, they have insisted on a mindless march to immediate austerity--\nan approach that threatens to strangle the weak economy.\n  Inside the Washington bubble, some of our political leaders continue \nto insist that the biggest issue is the budget deficit. Outside the \nbeltway, ordinary Americans are desperately concerned with a far more \nurgent deficit, the job deficit.\n  I am also concerned about a third deficit, the deficit of vision and \nleadership in Washington. I am disturbed by our failure to confront the \ncurrent economic crisis with the boldness and vision that earlier \ngenerations of Americans summoned in times of national challenge.\n  Smart countries, in tough economic times, do not just turn a chainsaw \non themselves. Instead of the current slash-and-burn approach, which is \nbeing sold through fear and fatalism, we need an approach that reflects \nthe courage and determination of the American people. By all means, we \nmust agree on necessary spending cuts and revenue increases, but we \nalso must continue to invest in that which will spur economic growth, \ncreate jobs, and rebuild the middle class.\n  I cannot emphasize too strongly the importance of restoring the \nmiddle class in America. I have given several floor speeches on this \nvery subject. In the committee I am privileged to chair, the HELP \nCommittee, we have had hearings on what has happened to the middle \nclass. In fact, on September 1, our committee issued this report: \n``Saving the American Dream: The Past, Present, and Uncertain Future of \nAmerica's Middle Class.'' I commend it to my colleagues.\n  Restoring the middle class is essential to boosting demand and \nrevitalizing our economy. It is the only way to restore long-term \nfiscal balance at the Federal level.\n  Economists across the political spectrum, from left to right, agree \nthat a major cause of our current economic stagnation is a chronic lack \nof demand. For nearly three decades, workers' incomes have been \nstagnant. Simply put, they lack the purchasing power to drive America's \nconsumer economy. Without adequate demand, businesses are reluctant to \ninvest and hire.\n  Adjusted for inflation, average hourly earnings in 1970 were $18.80 \nan hour or $39,104 annually. Again, average hourly earnings in 1970 \nwere $39,104. However, by 2009, those inflation-adjusted average hourly \nearnings had actually declined to $18.63 an hour or $38,750 a year. \nImagine that. From 1970 to 2009, average hourly earnings went down. One \nmight say: So what.\n  This second chart will show what is happening to the middle class. \nThis chart shows the rising cost of essentials. At the same time \nearnings have stagnated or gone down a little bit, the costs that make \nup the largest part of a family budget have skyrocketed. Here is the \nfood budget, up 2 percent; gas, up 18 percent; rent and utilities, up \n41 percent; health expenditures, up 50 percent; public colleges, up 80 \npercent; price of a home, up 97 percent; cost of a private college, up \n113 percent. No wonder the middle class is finding it harder and harder \nto make ends meet.\n  However, at the same time, let's look at what is happening at the \nhigher end of the income spectrum and see what happened to CEO \ncompensation during this same period of time. Average hourly earnings \nhave gone down, as I said. The value of the minimum wage--I will talk \nabout that in a minute--has gone down 19 percent from 1970 to last \nyear. But the median executive compensation has gone up 430 percent in \nthe same time. Is there any surprise that people are upset around \nAmerica, that middle-class families are kind of edgy today? Sure, they \nare edgy. How are they going to send their kids to college or buy a new \nhome or get out from the ones that are already underwater, provide rent \nor buy gasoline for cars in rural areas where they have to drive to go \nto work, to school or to go to church?\n  How do we boost income and restore people's purchasing power? There \nare a number of ways we need to do this. I will suggest one to start \nwith. We need to restore a robust right to organize unions and bargain \ncollectively. I say that unabashedly. It is no coincidence the decline \nof the middle class has coincided with the dramatic decline of union \nmembership in the United States. Why? Because unions provide workers \nwith the leverage to ensure that they share in their company's gains \nthrough wages and benefits and are not just providing company CEOs with \neven larger pay packages. That is just one step.\n  Another very practical step we can take to boost purchasing power and \nboost the economy is to increase the minimum wage. The minimum wage \ntoday is $7.25. If we raised the minimum wage to make up for what it \nhas lost to inflation over the last 40 years, it would be $10.39 an \nhour. As we saw, the average CEO pay has gone up 430 percent, and the \nminimum wage--adjusted for inflation--should be $10.39 an hour today. \nBut it is only $7.25. So the minimum wage has gone down, and the median \nexecutive compensation has gone up 430 percent. A raise in the minimum \nwage puts money in the pockets of low-income consumers who are likely \nto spend it at local businesses.\n  Most important, of course, we have to create more jobs--but not just \nany jobs, quality jobs with fair wages and real benefits that can \nsupport a family and help hard-working people build a brighter future. \nThat is the way we will put demand back in the economy and get the \neconomy moving again.\n  Tomorrow evening, the President will present to Congress his plan for \nboosting job creation and helping to lift the economy. I urge the \nPresident to point out that there are some things--big national \nundertakings--that the private sector simply is not capable of doing. \nAt critical junctures, going back to the beginning of our Republic, the \nFederal Government has stepped up to the plate. Congresses and \nPresidents have to act decisively to spur economic growth, foster \ninnovation, and help create jobs. We need that kind of bold action \ntoday.\n  The mantra I hear from my friends on the Republican side is that \ngovernment can't create jobs. That is nonsense. Smart government can \ncreate jobs. Shortsighted government can destroy jobs. For example, the \nbrief shutdown of the Federal Aviation Administration this summer put \nnearly 70,000 private sector construction employees out of work. \nDraconian cuts proposed by House Republicans to the new Transportation \nbill would destroy an estimated 490,000 highway construction jobs and \nnearly 100,000 transit-related jobs. That is dysfunctional government, \nmaking the problem even worse.\n  By contrast, across our history, an often visionary and bold Federal \nGovernment has funded and spearheaded initiatives that have expanded \nprivate commerce, given birth to countless inventions and new \nindustries, and created tens of millions of jobs.\n\n[[Page S5372]]\n\n  During the Presidency of Franklin Roosevelt, with the private sector \nparalyzed by the Great Depression, the Federal Government responded \nwith an astonishing array of initiatives to restart the economy, \nrestore opportunity, and create jobs. I still have on my wall in my \noffice--and I will bet I am the only Senator on the floor today who can \nsay this--the actual WPA form of my father when he worked for the Works \nProjects Administration. He got a job to help feed his family. Some of \nthe things my father worked on in the WPA exist today--still used by \nthe public, still used by kids going to high school. A lot of times \npeople say: Well, that was all well and good, but that didn't stop the \ndepression that was World War II. Well, what was World War II but \nmassive government infusion into the economy?\n\n  By the end of the Second World War, wartime investments in plants and \nequipment and making tanks and airplanes and all kinds of things, which \nwe then turned over to the private sector, created an industrial \ncolossus the likes of which the world had never seen. Franklin \nRoosevelt and President Truman were followed by a Republican President, \nDwight Eisenhower. President Eisenhower--I am sure a very proud \nRepublican--was also determined to move America forward. He championed \none of the greatest public works projects in American history--the \nconstruction of the Interstate Highway System. A 1996 study of that \nsystem concluded:\n\n       The interstate highway system is an engine that has driven \n     40 years of unprecedented prosperity and positioned the \n     United States to remain the world's preeminent power into the \n     21st century.\n\n  This kind of visionary thinking, by both Democratic Presidents and a \nRepublican President, is by no means a relick of the distant past. In \nmore recent times, the Federal Government has funded and spearheaded \nscientific discovery and innovation that has had profound impacts on \nour economy--spawning scores of new industries and creating millions of \nhigh-value jobs. I will just mention a few.\n  Specifically, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency--called \nDARPA--invented the Internet, making possible everything from e-mail to \nsocial networking to the World Wide Web. Federal researchers at that \nsame agency--DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency--\ninvented the global positioning satellite system.\n  I can remember when I first came to the Congress as a House Member on \nthe House Science and Technology Committee and we first started \nauthorizing funding for the GPS system. A lot of people at that time \nsaid: Oh no, no. This is not the role for the Federal Government. Only \nthe private sector can do it. But the private sector could not \nundertake that at that point in time. So the Federal Government put up \nthe satellites and the private sector took over, and now we have Garmin \nand TomTom and we have all kinds of things now for airplanes and cars \nand boats--all made by the private sector employing people in private-\nsector jobs--because the Federal Government put forth the money and the \ninvestment to put that system into place.\n  Need I mention NASA, and the number of technological breakthroughs \nover the years--everything from microchips to CAT scanner technology. \nAnd of course any discussion of the Federal role in promoting our \neconomy would not be complete without mentioning the National \nInstitutes of Health. More than 80 Nobel prizes have been awarded for \nNIH-supported research.\n  One might say: Well, how has that benefitted us? Recently, the \nBattelle Memorial Institute, a nongovernment research institute, \nreported on the Federal Government's $3.8 billion investment in the \nHuman Genome Project from 1988 to 2003. Battelle estimates this Federal \ninvestment of $3.8 billion in taxpayer money has produced a staggering \n$796 billion in economic output. In 2010 alone, this ``genomic \nrevolution'' generated $67 billion in U.S. economic output and \nsupported 310,000 jobs.\n  These are the kinds of investments that are some of the best ways to \nreduce budget deficits. They will help many of the 29 million \nunemployed and underemployed get jobs and become taxpayers again. With \nthe private-sector engine again threatening to stall out, there is a \ncritical role for the Federal Government in creating demand and \npreventing a slide back into recession.\n  The most obvious way forward--with support across the political \nspectrum, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce--is to dramatically \nramp up Federal investments in infrastructure in order to boost U.S. \ncompetitiveness. The American Society of Civil Engineers estimates that \nAmerica faces a $2.2 trillion--trillion dollars--infrastructure \nbacklog. Bringing this U.S. infrastructure into the 21st century would \ncreate millions of private-sector jobs--especially in the hard-hit \nconstruction industry--while modernizing the arteries and veins of \ncommerce.\n  As someone once recently said: Think about it this way: We are still \ndriving on Eisenhower's highways and going to Roosevelt's schools. It \nis time to do it for the next century.\n  There can be no economic recovery, no return to fiscal balance \nwithout the recovery of the middle class. And there will not be a \nmiddle class unless and until we come to grips with the need for \nFederal investment in education, innovation, research, and \ninfrastructure. It means restoring a level playing field with fair \ntaxation, vibrant unions, a strong ladder of opportunity to give every \nAmerican access to the middle class.\n  I hope President Obama will be bold, as Presidents in the past have \nbeen. I hope he will put forward a very bold, visionary, challenging--\nchallenging--proposal tomorrow night, to challenge us to the better \nside of our human nature and to recapture again what we have done in \nthe past. In that way, we can rebuild the middle class and put America \nback to work. I believe that is the only way we will be able to do \nthat.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor, and I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the period for \ndebate only on H.R. 1249 be extended to 6:30 p.m. and that at 6:30 p.m. \nthe majority leader be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have worked on efforts to prevent the \ndiversion of fees collected by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for \nyears. When the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn, took \non the issue, I urged him to work with me, to withhold the amendment \nduring the Judiciary Committee's consideration of the bill, and I would \nwork with him to include improvements on the Senate floor.\n  I did. I kept my word. In fact, I included language he drafted in the \nmanagers' amendment and worked hard to pass it despite the misgivings \nof several Senators on both sides of the aisle.\n  However, when our bill went over to the House of Representatives, \nthey preserved the principle against fee diversion but changed the \nlanguage. The language of the bill is that which the House devised and \nvoted to include as worked out by the House Republican leadership to \nsatisfy House rules. The provisions Senator Coburn had drafted--and I \nunderstand may offer with his amendment--apparently violate House rule \n21, which prohibits authorizing legislation from converting \ndiscretionary spending into mandatory spending. So instead of a \nrevolving fund, the House established a reserve fund.\n  The America Invents Act, as passed by the House, continues to make \nimportant improvements to ensure that fees collected by the U.S. Patent \nand Trademark Office are used for USPTO activities. That office is \nentirely fee-funded and does not rely upon taxpayer dollars, but it has \nbeen and continues to be subject to annual appropriations bills. That \nallows Congress greater opportunity for oversight.\n  The legislation that passed the Senate in March would have taken the \nPatent and Trademark Office out of the appropriations process by \nsetting\n\n[[Page S5373]]\n\nup a revolving fund that allowed the PTO to spend all money it collects \nwithout appropriations legislation or congressional oversight. But \ninstead of a revolving fund the House formulation against fee diversion \nestablishes a separate account for the funds and directs they be used \nfor the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.\n  The House forged a compromise with its appropriators to reduce any \nincentive to divert fees from the PTO and to provide the PTO with \naccess to all fees that it collects while keeping the PTO within the \nnormal appropriations process with the oversight that process includes. \nThe America Invents Act thus creates a new Patent and Trademark fee \nreserve fund into which all fees collected by PTO in excess of that \namount appropriated in a fiscal year are to be deposited. Fees in the \nreserve fund may only be used for operations of the PTO. In effect, \nthey are doing what we have asked but staying within the House rules.\n  In fact, in addition, the House appropriators agreed to carry \nlanguage in their appropriations bills that would guarantee that fees \ncollected by the PTO in excess of the appropriated amounts would remain \navailable to the PTO until expended and could be accessed by the PTO \nthrough reprogramming procedures without the need for subsequent \nlegislation.\n  This may sound kind of convoluted, but what a number of people, \nincluding Senator Coburn, wanted to do was to make sure the fees went \nto PTO. I happen to agree with that. What the House did has the effect \nof making sure the fees go to the PTO.\n  What I hope we not do now is try to offer amendments that may change \nthat and in effect kill the bill. Through the creation of the reserve \nfund, as well as the commitment by House appropriators, H.R. 1249 makes \nimportant improvements in ensuring that user fees collected by the PTO \nfor services are used by the PTO for those services.\n  So while I oppose fee diversion, I also oppose the Coburn amendment, \nand I will tell you why. After 6 years of work getting this bill here, \nthis may kill the bill over a formality: the difference between a \nrevolving fund and a reserve fund. One would be hard-pressed to know \nwhat the difference is except it would kill the bill. It would require \nthe House to consider the whole bill again. They spent days and weeks \nin heavy debate working out their compromise in good faith. It was \nworked out by the House Republican leadership. There is no reason to \nthink that having done that, they are going to reconsider and allow the \noriginal Coburn language to violate the rules and avoid oversight.\n  In fact, I ask that a letter from Congressmen Rogers and Ryan to \nChairman Smith be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 6, 2011.\n     Hon. Lamar Smith,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Chairman Smith: It is our understanding that H.R. 1249, the \n     America Invents Act, is likely to be considered on the House \n     floor in the upcoming weeks.\n       As you know, section 22 of H.R. 1249 would strike the \n     current appropriations account language for the Patent \n     Trademark Office (PTO), replace it with a ``United States \n     Patent and Trademark Office Public Enterprise Fund,'' and \n     permit the PTO to collect and spend authorized fees--all \n     without requiring action or approval from Congress.\n       We strongly oppose this proposed shift of billions in \n     discretionary funding and fee collections to mandatory \n     spending. Putting PTO funding on auto-pilot is a move in \n     exactly the wrong direction, given the new Republican \n     majority's commitment to restraining spending, improving \n     accountability and transparency, and reducing the nation's \n     unparalleled deficits and debt.\n       Placing PTO spending on mandatory auto-pilot as outlined in \n     H.R. 1249 would also hand the Congressional ``power of the \n     purse''--bestowed in the Constitution--to the Obama White \n     House, and essentially eliminate the ability of Congress to \n     perform substantive oversight of the PTO. We strongly oppose \n     undermining these critical efforts, particularly when House \n     Republicans have pledged to strengthen oversight of federal \n     agencies to ensure resources are being used wisely and \n     appropriately, and to prevent federal agencies from over-\n     stepping their authority.\n       Oversight of the PTO belongs with the Congress, and should \n     not be abdicated to the Executive Branch of government. \n     Patent applications are filed by U.S. citizens and companies \n     from all 50 states and territories, ranging from as many as \n     66,191 from California, 16,545 from Texas, 15,258 from New \n     York, 8,128 from Ohio, 3,577 from Virginia, and 600 from \n     Nebraska in 2010. Virtually every Member of Congress \n     represents constituents who have a stake in the oversight of \n     PTO--and often businesses and livelihoods depend on actions \n     the agency undertakes. It would be both irresponsible and \n     unwise to allow the PTO to operate solely under the authority \n     of bureaucrats and White House political appointees--without \n     being held accountable to the American public through their \n     elected Representatives in Congress.\n       Given these concerns, we ask that section 22 be deleted or \n     otherwise be modified prior to floor consideration in order \n     to strengthen oversight of this important agency, and to \n     ensure American citizens are getting the most from every \n     dollar.\n           Sincerely,\n     Harold Rogers,\n       Chairman, House Committee on Appropriations.\n     Paul Ryan,\n       Chairman, House Committee on the Budget.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I know the members of the Senate Appropriations Committee. \nI know them. I trust Senator Inouye, someone awarded the Congressional \nMedal of Honor for his bravery and valor in World War II. I trust the \nsenior Senator from Mississippi and the senior Senator from Alabama \nwith whom I have served for many years. They will follow the law. They \nwill abide by the Supreme Court. I was disturbed to read a comment that \nthis amendment is being brought forward out of distrust of these \nSenators. These are Senators I have served with for decades. They can \nand should be trusted. We should not kill this bill over this \namendment. Instead, we should reject the amendment and pass the bill.\n  (Mr. BENNET assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of H.R. \n1249, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act. This is a vital piece of \njob-creating legislation and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Before I turn to the merits of the bill, let me start by applauding \nthe long, hard work of Chairman Leahy. He has led the effort on this \nlegislation for many years, patiently working towards a bill that would \nwin broad support from the many interested stakeholders while achieving \nthe crucial goals of spurring innovation, generating jobs, and securing \nAmerica's place as the world leader in the intellectual property \neconomy. It has been a pleasure to work with him on this important \nissue. I likewise applaud the hard work of colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle who have sought to support continued American leadership in \ntechnology, medicine, and countless other fields.\n  Our patent system unfortunately has become a drag on that leadership, \nlargely because it has gone 60 years without improvements. It is long \npast time to repair that system and thereby energize our innovation \neconomy and create jobs.\n  Our Nation long has led the world in hard work and ingenuity. My home \nState of Rhode Island, for example, has a long and proud history of \nindustry and innovation, from the birth of the American industrial \nrevolution to the high-tech entrepreneurs leading our State forward \ntoday. An area has developed in Providence, for example, that is \nrightfully known by the nickname ``the Knowledge District'' for its \nremarkable innovation. Rhode Island likewise is the home of remarkable \nresearch universities, individual inventors, and businesses of all \nsizes that have contributed giant leaps forward in the fields of \ntechnology, medicine, and mechanical science.\n  Innovators like these in Rhode Island, and across America, are the \ndrivers of our future economic well-being. My conversations with these \nRhode Islanders, however, have made clear to me that the current patent \nsystem is making it unnecessarily difficult for them to innovate. \nInnovators who can solve the most complicated problems of medicine, \nmechanics, or technology are losing out because of basic problems in \nour patent system. We need to fix these problems now. Fail to do so and \nwe will pay the price in jobs and international competitiveness.\n  I have heard two complaints over and over back home in Rhode Island. \nThe first relates to delays in the issuance of patents. Enormous \nbacklogs persist at the Patent and Trademark Office. As a result, our \ninnovators have no certainty whether they have successfully\n\n[[Page S5374]]\n\nestablished intellectual property rights in their inventions. This \ndampens and frustrates innovation.\n  The America Invents Act takes on the backlog in a number of different \nways. It allows the Patent and Trademark Office discretion to set its \nown fees and includes a provision that will discourage fee diversion. \nWhile I would have preferred to have seen Senator Coburn's anti-fee-\ndiversion amendment accepted by the House, I am confident that these \nprovisions, coupled with exceptions that will ensure low fees for small \nbusinesses, will enable the Patent and Trademark Office to better \nmanage its resources and reduce examination times.\n  My conversations with Rhode Island inventors also identified a second \nclear problem in our patent system: the threat of protracted \nlitigation. Unfortunately, numerous poor quality patents have issued in \nrecent years, resulting in seemingly endless litigation that casts a \ncloud over patent ownership. Administrative processes that should serve \nas an alternative to litigation also have broken down, resulting in \nfurther delay, cost, and confusion.\n  The America Invents Act will address these problems by ensuring that \nhigher quality patents issue in the future. This will produce less \nlitigation and create greater incentives for innovators to commit the \neffort and resources to create the next big idea. Similarly, the bill \nwill improve administrative processes so that disputes over patents can \nbe resolved quickly and cheaply without patents being tied up for years \nin expensive litigation. The bill also moves America to the simple \nFirst-Inventor-to-File system which will eliminate needless uncertainty \nand litigation over patent ownership, and it eliminates so-called ``tax \npatents.''\n  In all, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act is an important and much-\nneeded reform of our patent system. True, every intellectual property \nstakeholder did not get everything they wanted in this version of the \npatent bill. I am sure every participant in this process would like a \nfew things added to the bill and a few things taken out. That is \ninevitable in a bill that has been crafted in a true spirit of \ncompromise. The result is a bill that may not please everyone in all \nrespects but that satisfies its core responsibility to remove existing \nburdens on American innovation and allow the growth of high quality, \nhigh technology jobs in our country. It is extremely important in this \ntime of economic hardship that we put people to work. That is exactly \nwhat this bill will do and I believe we should pass it immediately. We \nshould not amend it further in a manner that will risk the bill's \nultimate defeat. This is a long journey and we are at the finish; let's \nget this bill done for American inventors and workers. Let's see this \nmuch-needed piece of patent reform passed into law.\n  I once again urge my colleagues to vote to pass this important piece \nof legislation into law.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to submit for the Record two \nletters addressed to the chairman and ranking member of the House \nJudiciary Committee. The letters were written by Judge Michael \nMcConnell, a former member of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth \nCircuit and the current the director of the Constitutional Law Center \nat Stanford Law School. Judge McConnell's letters examine the \nconstitutionality of section 18 of the America Invents Act, a section \nof the bill that authorizes a temporary program for administrative \nreview of business-method patents. The letters thoroughly refute the \narguments being presented by some opponents of section 18 that the \nprovision either constitutes a taking or runs afoul of the rule of \nPlaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U.S. 211 1995. Because these \nletters have circulated widely among members and staff and have played \na substantial role in the debate about section 18, I think that it is \nappropriate that they be published in the Record.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following materials be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         Michael W. McConnell,\n\n                                      Stanford, CA, June 16, 2011.\n       Dear Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Conyers: I am the \n     Richard and Frances Mallery Professor and Director of the \n     Constitutional Law Center at Stanford Law School, and a \n     Senior Fellow of the Hoover Institution at Stanford \n     University, where I teach and write in the field of \n     constitutional law. I previously served as a judge on the \n     United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. \n     Congress is now considering legislation (the ``America \n     Invents Act'') that would expand the grounds on which patents \n     may be reexamined by the Patent and Trademark Office \n     (``PTO''), after their initial issuance. I write to address \n     the constitutionality of those sections: Section 6 (Post-\n     grant Review Proceedings) and Section 18 (Transitional \n     Program for Covered Business Method Patents) of the America \n     Invents Act. Based on my review, these sections of the \n     proposed Act are constitutional as drafted.\n       As you are aware, for the past thirty years, this nation's \n     patent laws have included procedures for reexamination of \n     already-issued patents. In two leading cases, parties \n     challenged the constitutionality of reexamination of patents \n     in court, raising all the the theories now propounded in \n     opposition to sections 6 and 18 of the proposed America \n     Invents Act--takings, due process, retroactivity, and \n     separation of powers. The court of appeals carefully \n     considered and rejected those challenges, upholding the \n     reexamination process in all respects. Sections 6 and 18 of \n     the proposed Act merely expand the grounds on which \n     reexamination is available under current law, but do not \n     change substantive patent law at all, nor the fundamental \n     procedure of reexamination in any constitutionally \n     significant way. We may therefore state with confidence that \n     the proposed legislation is supported by settled precedent.\n       Moreover, the proposed measure conforms to the purposes of \n     the Patent Clause of the Constitution, Article I, Section 8, \n     Clause 8, which grants Congress authority to ``promote the \n     Progress of Science and the useful Arts.'' By means of this \n     provision, the Framers sought to balance the goal of \n     encouraging innovation against the dangers and economic loss \n     of monopoly. The reexamination process serves to preserve \n     that balance by adopting a procedure by which the PTO can \n     identify patents that were issued in error. Challenges to the \n     reexamination process proceed on the theory that a patent is \n     a vested right, which once granted may not be taken away, at \n     least not by the agency that granted it. This is a \n     fundamental misconception. If a party is issued a patent that \n     does not comply with the patent laws--and the patent is \n     therefore invalid--it is not a ``taking'' for either a court \n     or the PTO to determine that the patent is invalid. Just as \n     it is not a taking to determine that a person occupying land \n     has a defective title to it, it is not a taking to determine \n     that a patent holder never had a right to a patent in the \n     first place.\n       Unlike many other familiar forms of property, the validity \n     of a patent is never determined once and for all; members of \n     the public with competing or adverse interests have long had \n     a continuing right to demonstrate, through reexamination \n     before the PTO, that a patent was invalidly issued. And a \n     party threatened with a patent infringement action has always \n     had the right to seek to demonstrate that the patent is \n     invalid, regardless of whether the same issue has been \n     previously litigated in a different case. In other words, \n     there is no such thing as ``adverse possession'' in patent \n     law. The only change wrought by the proposed Act is to expand \n     the grounds under which such reexaminations are made by the \n     PTO in the first instance. As a constitutional matter, \n     Congress is entitled to allocate the responsibility of \n     determining whether a patent was properly granted to the \n     courts or to the expert agency, in its discretion. As long as \n     interested parties have the ultimate right to challenge the \n     agency's decisions in court, the administrative nature of the \n     proceeding has no constitutional significance. Moreover, I \n     see nothing in sections 6 and 18 of the proposed Act that \n     would alter or interfere with existing principles of res \n     judicata or collateral estoppel in the context of a final \n     judgment, much less allow the PTO to disturb the final \n     judgment of a court.\n       I offer no view on the merits or policy of the Act, but \n     offer my judgment that it is entirely consistent with the \n     Constitution for Congress to bring to bear the experience and \n     expertise of the PTO in providing for more robust review of \n     issued patents.\n\n                        I. Background Principles\n\n       I begin with the basic background principles. The Framers \n     of the United States Constitution were well aware of the \n     dangers of monopoly, and sought to ensure that patents could \n     be granted only when they served an overriding public \n     interest. An invalidly issued patent does not properly reward \n     innovation, but instead impedes commerce, hence ``the public \n     good.'' The Federalist, No. 43 (Madison), at 268 [1788] (C. \n     Rossiter ed., 1961). The Framers were also painfully aware of \n     the propensity of governmental agencies and bureaucracies to \n     err. They would not, therefore, have been surprised by \n     efforts to ensure that patent rights may be exercised only \n     when the underlying patent claim is valid and the patent was \n     properly issued. That is why, from the beginning, patents \n     have never been regarded as a fully and irrevocably vested \n     right. As the Supreme Court has explained, the Patent Clause \n     of the Constitution ``is both a grant of power and a \n     limitation,'' and Congress' actions\n\n[[Page S5375]]\n\n     must be directed to striking the balance between encouraging \n     innovation and stifling competition through the grant of \n     patents that do not promote ``the Progress of . . . useful \n     Arts. This is the standard expressed in the Constitution and \n     it may not be ignored.'' Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. \n     1, 5 (1966) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted); \n     see also Bonito Boats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc., 489 \n     U.S. 141, 146-47 (1989).\n       Patents are unquestionably property rights. Consolidated \n     Fruit Jar Co. v. Wright, 94 U.S. 92, 96 (1876). However, \n     unlike many property rights, the right to exclude under a \n     patent ``is a right that can only be conferred by the \n     government.'' Patlex Corp. v. Mossinghoff, 758 F.2d 594, 604 \n     (Fed. Cir. 1985). A patent is not a natural right, but solely \n     a product of positive law; its extent, duration, and validity \n     is a matter that must be determined by the legislative \n     branch. In contrast with purely private rights, ``the grant \n     of a valid patent is primarily a public concern.'' Id. In \n     assessing the validity of a patent, the ``threshold \n     question usually is whether the PTO, under the authority \n     assigned to it by Congress, properly granted the patent.'' \n     Id. As the Supreme Court recently reaffirmed, the \n     statutory presumption of validity found in 35 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 282, is a reflection of the presumption of \n     administrative correctness by the PTO. Microsoft Corp. v. \n     i4i Ltd. P'ship, -- U.S. --, No. 10-290, slip op. 16-17 \n     (2011).\n       Patents are issued after a limited, ex parte process in \n     which the public has no opportunity to participate. The PTO \n     largely only has before it the information provided by the \n     inventor's attorney. As a result, as courts have recognized, \n     the PTO may not have all of the material information at the \n     time it issues a patent. Therefore, although patents are \n     presumed valid, ``if the PTO did not have all material facts \n     before it, its considered judgment may lose significant \n     force.'' i4i, slip op at 17.\n       The validity of a patent is not a matter that is ever fully \n     and finally settled. Rather, it remains ``ever-present,'' \n     Patlex Corp., 758 F.2d at 600, because any defendant may \n     assert an invalidity defense in patent litigation--even if \n     the same issue has been previously litigated by another \n     defendant. Prior to 1980, the only means by which a party \n     could challenge the validity of a patent was through \n     litigation in court. In 1980, however, Congress created an \n     administrative reexamination procedure, designed to weed out \n     patents that are invalid because they did not meet the \n     requirements for patentability set forth in the Patent Act. \n     See Public Law No. 96-517. Under these procedures, ``[a]ny \n     person at any time may file a request for reexamination by \n     the [PTO] of any claim of a patent on the basis of any prior \n     art'' that was published. 35 U.S.C. Sec. 302 (emphasis \n     added).\n       Since 1980, therefore, the validity of a patent may be \n     challenged several ways: A party who is sued for patent \n     infringement may assert a defense of invalidity, which must \n     be proven by the higher standard of clear and convincing \n     evidence (in deference to the presumed correctness of the \n     PTO's decision), or a patent's validity can be reviewed \n     through a reexamination proceeding. Upon reexamination, the \n     PTO may confirm any patentable claim or cancel any \n     unpatentable claim. Reexamination thus provides an \n     opportunity for the PTO to review and correct its own work \n     based on fuller information. As the Federal Circuit has \n     described, ``[t]he innate function of the reexamination \n     process is to increase the reliability of the PTO's action in \n     issuing a patent by reexamination of patents thought \n     `doubtful.' '' In re Etter, 756 F.2d 852, 857 (Fed. Cir. \n     1985).\n       The reexamination process created in 1980 endured \n     constitutional challenges similar to what opponents of the \n     America Invents Act are marshalling today: the 1980 \n     reexamination procedure was challenged by patent holders as \n     an unconstitutional taking, as a violation of due process, as \n     a violation of the Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial, \n     and as a violation of separation of powers. See Patlex Corp., \n     758 F.2d 598-599; Joy Technologies v. Manbeck, 959 F.2d 226 \n     (Fed. Cir. 1992). Each of these challenges was soundly \n     rejected by the United States Court of Appeals for the \n     Federal Circuit.\n       Thus, to be clear, under current law, at the instance of a \n     party, the PTO may reexamine a patent that has been issued, \n     and the validity of which has been unsuccessfully challenged \n     in litigation. With this in mind, I first address the \n     constitutionality of Sections 6 and 18 of the America Invents \n     Act.\n\n       II. Section 6 of the America Invents Act Is Constitutional\n\n       Section 6 of the America Invents Act amends the Patent Act \n     to create a post-grant review procedure available for a \n     limited time (one year, in the current America Invents Act \n     legislation) after the date a patent is granted. Section 6 \n     also amends existing inter partes reexamination procedures to \n     make them available after the period of time for post-grant \n     review has passed or, if post-grant review has been \n     initiated, after that post-grant review is complete. A key \n     distinction between the post-grant review procedures and the \n     inter partes reexamination procedures is the grounds and \n     evidence that can be considered for invalidating a patent: as \n     with current law, the inter partes reexamination procedure of \n     Section 6 is limited to considering (1) whether a patent is \n     invalid for failing to meet the Patent Act's requirements of \n     novelty and non-obviousness (2) based on patents or printed \n     publications.\n       Section 6 is in harmony with the first principles of the \n     Constitution and with the body of legal precedent addressing \n     the existing reexamination procedures. The Patent Clause of \n     the Constitution empowers Congress to ``promote the Progress \n     of Science and useful Arts'' by granting patents to \n     inventors, but it correspondingly limits Congress' authority \n     to grant patents that do not advance ``the Progress of \n     Science and useful Arts.'' The Supreme Court has recognized \n     that from the beginning our Founders have sought to strike \n     that constitutional balance: ``Thus, from the outset, federal \n     patent law has been about the difficult business of `drawing \n     a line between the things which are worth to the public the \n     embarrassment of an exclusive patent, and those which are \n     not.'' Bonito Boats, 489 U.S. at 148 (quoting 13 Writings of \n     Thomas Jefferson (Memorial ed. 1904) at 335). One manner in \n     which Congress has fulfilled this mandate to strike the \n     proper balance is through the existing reexamination \n     procedures, which provide a mechanism for removing patents \n     that should never have been granted by the PTO because they \n     did not meet the requirements for a valid patent set by \n     Congress in the Patent Act. As the Federal Circuit has \n     observed, ``[t]he reexamination statute's purpose is to \n     correct errors made by the government, to remedy defective \n     governmental (not private) action, and if need be to remove \n     patents that should never have been granted.'' Patlex Corp., \n     758 F.2d at 604 (emphasis added). A determination that a \n     patent should never have been granted is no more a ``taking'' \n     than is a determination that a putative landowner suffers a \n     defect in title.\n       Accordingly, the revised inter partes reexamination \n     procedures and the post-grant review procedures of Section 6 \n     are hardly novel but rather are based on longstanding \n     procedures established by Congress and repeatedly recognized \n     as constitutional by the Federal Circuit in decisions such as \n     Patlex Corp., 758 F.2d 594, 607 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (emphasis \n     added), Joy Technologies, 959 F.2d 226, 228-29 (Fed. Cir. \n     1992), and In re Swanson, 540 F.3d 1368, 1379 (Fed. Cir. \n     2008). As such, Section 6 does little more than expand the \n     grounds for reexamination of patents, something Congress is \n     plainly entitled to do pursuant to its authority under the \n     Patent Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 8) of the \n     Constitution.\n       Nor is there any conflict between Section 6 and other parts \n     of the Constitution such as Article III and the Seventh \n     Amendment. The gist of the arguments suggesting a conflict is \n     that the PTO would be permitted to ``overrule'' final \n     judicial determinations made by an Article III court and/or \n     jury of a patent's validity. But these arguments fail to \n     understand the nature of judicial review of patent \n     validity and fail to recognize the body of precedent that \n     has rejected these arguments as applied against the \n     current legal regime.\n       To begin, what exactly happens when issues of patent \n     validity are litigated in district courts should be placed in \n     proper context. As the Federal Circuit has explained, \n     ``Courts do not find patents `valid,' only that the patent \n     challenger did not carry the burden of establishing \n     invalidity in the particular case before the court under 35 \n     U.S.C. 282.'' Ethicon, Inc. v. Quigg, 849 F.2d 1422, 1429 n.3 \n     (Fed. Cir. 1988) (emphasis original and internal quotation \n     marks omitted). For this reason, ``a prior holding of \n     validity is not necessarily inconsistent with a subsequent \n     holding of invalidity and is not binding on subsequent \n     litigation or PTO reexaminations.'' In re Swanson, 540 F.3d \n     1368, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (internal citations and quotation \n     marks omitted). In other words, a district court decision \n     that a patent is ``not invalid'' merely means that the \n     challenger did not carry his burden; it does not mean that \n     the patent is valid.\n       The existing reexamination procedures and the new post-\n     grant review procedures proposed in the America Invents Act \n     vest authority to determine validity upon reexamination in \n     the agency entrusted by Congress with making the validity \n     decision in the first instance--the PTO. It is entirely \n     proper that this corrective action be taken by the PTO, with \n     review 67 the Federal Circuit. It need not be limited to an \n     Article III court in the first instance. ``A defectively \n     examined and therefore erroneously granted patent must yield \n     to the reasonable Congressional purpose of facilitating the \n     correction of governmental mistakes. This Congressional \n     purpose is presumptively correct, and we find it carries no \n     insult to the Seventh Amendment and Article III.'' Patlex \n     Corp., 758 F.2d at 604. In other words, under a well-settled \n     body of case law, ``the Constitution does not require that \n     [courts] strike down statutes, otherwise having a reasonable \n     legislative purpose, that invest administrative agencies with \n     regulatory functions.'' Id. at 604,305. That holding is just \n     as applicable to Section 6 of the America Invents Act as it \n     is to the original reexamination procedures adopted in 1980.\n       Nor does it matter, for constitutional purposes, that the \n     PTO may reconsider the validity of patents' that are, or have \n     been, adjudicated by district courts. In In re Swanson, 540 \n     F.3d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2008), the Federal Circuit specifically \n     considered and rejected the argument that Plaut v. \n     Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U.S. 211 (1995), prohibited \n     reexamination of a patent by the PTO after that patent had \n     survived an invalidity challenge in court. See Swanson, 540 \n     F.3d at 1378,79 (``[The patentee] argues that this reading of \n     the statute--allowing an executive agency to find patent \n     claims invalid after an Article III court has upheld their \n     validity--violates the constitutionally mandated separation \n     of powers, and therefore must be avoided. We disagree.''). As \n     the Federal Circuit held, ``the\n\n[[Page S5376]]\n\n     court's final judgment and the examiner's rejection are not \n     duplicative--They are differing proceedings with different \n     evidentiary standards for validity. Accordingly, there is no \n     Article III issue created when a reexamination considers the \n     same issue of validity as a prior district court \n     proceeding.'' In re Swanson, 540 F.3d 1368, 1379 (Fed. Cir. \n     2008) (citation omitted). Because Section 6 merely broadens \n     the kinds of invalidity challenges that can be pursued during \n     reexamination, that holding would apply to the America \n     Invents Act as well. Plaut simply does not apply.\n       Relatedly, invalidation of a patent by the PTO (or by a \n     court, for that matter), after it has been adjudicated ``not \n     invalid'' in one particular case, does not purport to undo a \n     court's judgment in an earlier case. The PTO has no authority \n     to disturb a final judgment of a court, and nothing in the \n     proposed Act would change that. Rather, it would remain \n     within the discretion of the district court to determine \n     whether relief from a final judgment was appropriate under \n     Rule 60(b) based on changed circumstances. See Amado v. \n     Microsoft Corp., 517 F.3d 1353, 1363 (Fed. Cir. 2008). \n     Nothing in Section 6 purports to alter the standards under \n     which a court determines whether to grant relief from a final \n     judgment. Accordingly, there is no constitutional problem \n     under Plaut.\n\n      III. Section 18 of the America Invents Act is Constitutional\n\n       Section 18 of the America Invents Act is equally \n     constitutional. As an initial matter, it is important to \n     recognize that Section 18 does nothing more than apply the \n     more robust post-grant review provisions of Section 6 to \n     existing business-method patents. By any measure, this is not \n     a ``taking'' within the meaning of the constitution (unless \n     for the past thirty years patent law has been effecting \n     ``takings'' each time a reexamination takes place). The \n     constitutional arguments that have been marshaled against \n     Section 18--that it applies ``retroactively'' to existing \n     patents, that it would change the rules of the game, or that \n     it would upset settled property rights--were rejected by the \n     Federal Circuit in Patlex Corp. and again in Joy \n     Technologies. These are the precedents that would govern any \n     future challenge to Section 18.\n       I understand that critics of Section 18 are arguing that it \n     improperly singles out business-method patents and that it \n     creates a ``second bite at the apple.'' I find both sets of \n     arguments to be unpersuasive as a constitutional matter. \n     First, Congress is well within its authority to determine \n     that a particular subset of patents warrant closer \n     administrative review than other patents due to their history \n     and development. Business-method patents are relatively novel \n     creatures, and far removed from what the Founders would have \n     envisioned when they sought to ``promote the Progress of \n     Science and the useful Arts.'' Prior to the 1990s, business-\n     method patents were largely unheard of. The surge in the \n     issuance of such patents followed the 1998 decision of the \n     Federal Circuit in State Street Bank & Trust Co. v. Signature \n     Financial Group, Inc., 149 F.3d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 1998), which \n     has been widely viewed as having opened the door to business-\n     method patenting. The increase in business method patents \n     does not appear to be abating. According to the PTO, the \n     number of business-method patent applications that issued as \n     patents jumped from 494 in 2002 to 3649 in 2010. See http://\nwww.uspto.gov/patents/resourcesimethods/applicationfiling.jsp \n     (last visited June 14, 2011). In the intervening 13 years \n     since State Street, the PTO and the courts have struggled to \n     determine when such patents should issue. The Supreme Court's \n     decision last Term in Bilski v. Kappos, 130 S. Ct. 3218 \n     (2010), offered some clarification, reaffirming the basic \n     minima required to be patent-eligible subject matter under 35 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 101. Nonetheless, in light of the continuing \n     confusion over such patents, and the paucity of traditional \n     published prior art at the time such patents were issued, it \n     is entirely rational--and thus constitutionally appropriate--\n     for Congress to make the judgment that it wants to provide a \n     mechanism for ensuring that adequate vigor went into the \n     PTO's decision to issue a business-method patent, and that \n     such further review helps to ensure that this category of \n     patents is subject to the same quality of review as other \n     patents were. See eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, LLC, 547 U.S. \n     388, 397 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (noting the ``suspect \n     validity of some'' business-method patents). Given \n     Congress's general authority to allow administrative \n     reexamination, as well as judicial challenge, to an \n     already-issued patent, there can be no valid objection to \n     Congress's decision to focus these reexaminations on a \n     class of patents that, because of their novelty, were \n     especially prone to improvident grant.\n       Second, providing a more robust reexamination procedure \n     does not create a second bite at the apple. By their nature, \n     patents are continuously subject to challenge, whether in \n     court or before the PTO. As noted above, patents are \n     initially issued after an entirely ex parte process in which \n     no one else is allowed to participate. To the extent a \n     patent's validity has been challenged in court, the challenge \n     is only reviewed for clear and convincing evidence that the \n     PTO erred in granting the patent. That does not answer the \n     question of whether or not the PTO made a mistake--only \n     reexamination provides a vehicle for answering that question. \n     To the extent this is a second bite, it is at a different \n     apple. Section 18 does not create any more opportunities for \n     challenge than there are under existing law. It simply allows \n     reexamination on a broader array of theories than allowed \n     today.\n       Moreover, just as a criminal defendant can be acquitted \n     under a beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard, but found civilly \n     liable under a preponderance standard, there is also nothing \n     unusual about the fact that a patent may be upheld in court \n     (where a thumb is decidedly on the scale of the patentee), \n     but subsequently rejected as invalid by the PTO during \n     reexamination. That is exactly what happened in Translogic \n     Technology, Inc. v. Hitachi, Ltd, 250 F. App'x 988 (Fed. Cir. \n     2007), and In re Translogic Tech., Inc., 504 F.3d 1249 (Fed. \n     Cir. 2007). In the Translogic cases, the district court found \n     the asserted patent to be infringed and not invalid. While \n     the case was pending, the PTO reexamined the patent in an \n     inter partes proceeding and found the patent was improperly \n     issued and, thus, invalid. The Federal Circuit affirmed, and \n     thus found that the judgment of infringement in the case \n     against Hitachi had to be vacated. The only material \n     difference between the law today and the procedures \n     contemplated in Section 18, is that Section 18 allows a \n     broader array of invalidity arguments to be presented to the \n     PTO. Moreover, nothing in Section 18 purports to alter how \n     principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel would \n     apply to a final judgment after all appeals are resolved, or \n     to change the standard for a district court to determine \n     whether relief should be granted under Rule 60(b). Thus, as \n     discussed above, the procedures in Section 18 and Section 6 \n     do not present any of the constitutional concerns identified \n     in Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U.S. 211 (1995).\n       Nor is there anything constitutionally suspect about \n     limiting the review of existing business-method patents to \n     those that have actually been asserted in court (or \n     threatened to be asserted, such that a declaratory judgment \n     action could be brought). Rather, such a decision serves to \n     limit the burden on the PTO and to focus the use of limited \n     resources on reexamining patents that, if improperly issued, \n     are more detrimental to the economy. It is like limiting \n     challenges to land claims to competing users of the land. \n     Again, I see nothing in section 18 that purports to alter or \n     interfere with application of existing principles of res \n     judicata or collateral estoppel in the context of a final \n     judgment, or to alter the standard for obtaining relief from \n     a final judgment.\n       Finally, Section 18(c) provides that a party that initiates \n     a PTO reexamination may also seek a stay of ongoing \n     litigation pending reexamination from the court where ongoing \n     litigation is pending. It is the court, not the PTO, that \n     decides whether or not to grant a stay. That is consistent \n     with existing law. See, e.g., Medichem, S.A. v. Rolabo, S.L., \n     353 F.3d 928, 936 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (IA] stay of proceedings \n     in the district court pending the outcome of the parallel \n     proceedings in the PTO remains an option within the district \n     court's discretion.''). Although Section 18(c) provides a \n     list of factors for a district court should consider, these \n     factors are quite balanced and provide the district court \n     with ample discretion. Indeed, these are the factors \n     currently used by district courts in deciding whether to \n     grant a stay pending reexamination. See, e.g., Akeena Solar \n     Inc. v. Zep Solar Inc., 2010 WL 1526388, *1 (N.D. Cal. 2010); \n     Broadcast Innovation, L.L.C. v. Charter Communications, Inc., \n     2006 WL 1897165, *4 (D. Colo. 2006); Mots Fr ove Co., 2005 WL \n     3465664, *1 (D.N.J. 2005); Tap Pharm. Prods. Inc. v. Atrix \n     Labs., Inc., 70 U.S.P.Q. 2d 1319, 1320 (N.D. III. 2004). \n     Moreover, Section 18(c) provides for immediate appellate \n     review of a decision to grant or deny a stay, ensuring that \n     this discretion is not abused.\n       In sum, there is nothing novel or unprecedented, much less \n     unconstitutional, about the procedures proposed in sections 6 \n     and 18 of the America Invents Act. The proposed procedures \n     simply expand existing reexamination procedures to a broader \n     array of invalidity issues. And under settled case law, the \n     application of these new reexamination procedures to existing \n     patents is not a taking or otherwise a violation of the \n     Constitution. Congress's decision, to make these new \n     reexamination procedures available only to a subset of \n     existing patents--a category of patents that Congress could \n     rationally believe were more suspect than other patents--\n     represents a constitutionally proper decision on how to \n     expend limited resources.\n           Sincerely,\n     Michael W. McConnell.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                         Michael W. McConnell,\n\n                                      Stanford, CA, June 23, 2011.\n       Dear Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Conyers: I am the \n     Richard and Frances Mallery Professor and Director of the \n     Constitutional Law Center at Stanford Law School, and a \n     Senior Fellow of the Hoover Institution at Stanford \n     University, where I teach and write in the field of \n     constitutional law. I previously served as a judge on the \n     United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. On June \n     16, I wrote to you regarding several constitutional issues \n     that have arisen regarding proposed changes to patent \n     reexamination procedures in sections 6 and 18 of the America \n     Invents Act. Since then, two distinguished constitutional \n     authorities, my old friends Richard Epstein and Charles \n     Cooper have written responses to my letter. I thought it \n     would be helpful for me to address those two responses \n     directly and to explain why I remain convinced my original \n     analysis was correct.\n\n[[Page S5377]]\n\n       Both responses give far too broad a reading to Plaut v. \n     Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U.S. 211 (1995), and give short \n     shrift to binding precedent of the U.S. Court of Appeals for \n     the Federal Circuit that directly addresses the very kinds of \n     constitutional objections that are being made with respect to \n     sections 6 and 18 of the America Invents Act. Indeed \n     Professor Epstein and Mr. Cooper acknowledge, as they must, \n     that their position is contradicted by In re Swanson, 540 \n     F.3d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2008). This shows that their analysis, \n     whatever its abstract merits, is a departure from actual \n     judicial precedent governing these questions.\n       Most fundamentally, the Epstein and Cooper critiques refuse \n     to accept the importance of the fact that judicial review of \n     invalidity in the context of a patent infringement suit \n     applies a different standard than administrative \n     reexamination. When the PTO (and subsequently the Federal \n     Circuit) reviews invalidity in the context of a \n     reexamination, a court is not ``rehearing'' the same issue, \n     much less ``reopening'' a final judgment (as Professor \n     Epstein erroneously posits), nor does it somehow render an \n     earlier decision that an accused infringer had failed to \n     carry its burden of proving invalidity by clear and \n     convincing evidence an ``advisory opinion'' (as suggested by \n     Mr. Cooper). Indeed, this fundamental point was critical to \n     the holding in Swanson. See 540 F.3d at 1377 (``[A] prior \n     holding of validity is not necessarily inconsistent with a \n     subsequent holding of invalidity and is not binding on \n     subsequent litigation or PTO reexaminations''). Plaut does \n     not need to be ``overcome''--it is simply inapplicable.\n       Professor Epstein attempts to distinguish the well-\n     developed body of case law upholding the constitutionality of \n     reexamination procedures, on which sections 6 and 18 of the \n     proposed act are based, by highlighting factual differences \n     in those cases that are, in my view, simply irrelevant to the \n     constitutional analysis. For example, he contends Patlex \n     Corp. v. Mossinghoff, 758 F.2d 594 (Fed. Cir. 1985), is \n     different because there was no final judgment at the time the \n     reexamination had begun. However, the Federal Circuit \n     ascribed no significance to that fact--and with good reason. \n     The case rests on the necessarily provisional and correctable \n     nature of patents, not on whether they had previously gone \n     unchallenged in court. A prior judicial decision that a \n     patent was not invalid would mean only that the initial PTO \n     decision was not bereft of substantial support in the \n     evidence--not that it was correct for all time, under a de \n     novo standard. The court rejected the notion that there was a \n     ``right to judgment by an Article III court on those issues'' \n     of invalidity. Id. at 600. The court reasoned that ``[t]he \n     reexamination statute's purpose is to correct errors made by \n     the government, to remedy defective governmental (not \n     private) action, and if need be to remove patents that should \n     never have been granted.'' Id. at 604. That holding and \n     reasoning would apply equally whether or not the \n     reexamination was commenced before entry of a final judgment.\n       Likewise, Professor Epstein attempts to distinguish Joy \n     Technologies v. Manbeck, 959 F.2d 226 (Fed. Cir. 1992), by \n     saying it arose in the context of a settlement. But \n     regardless of the context in which it arose, the court there \n     considered and rejected the same constitutional objections \n     being raised by the objectors to sections 6 and 18 in the \n     context of reexamination. The attempt to distinguish Ethicon, \n     Inc. v. Quigg, 849 F.2d 1422 (Fed. Cir. 1988), is also \n     unavailing. That case cogently explains the distinction \n     between a court considering a challenge to validity under the \n     clear and convincing standard, and reexamination by the PTO \n     under the preponderance standard.\n       In addressing Swanson, Professor Epstein suggests that it \n     is ``strange'' to ``think that the PTO will help purge the \n     legal system of weak patents when it allows itself to use a \n     weaker standard than those involved in litigation.'' But \n     under the clear-and-convincing evidence standard used for \n     reviewing the PTO's work in court, an improperly issued \n     patent will often survive even in the face of significant \n     evidence that the patent should not have issued. Thus, there \n     are many mistakes that can be corrected only by the PTO--the \n     agency that erroneously issued the patent in the first place. \n     Professor Epstein further suggests that Swanson is of \n     ``dubious validity.'' However, I am not aware of any \n     subsequent court decision calling Swanson's holding into \n     question. That Professor Epstein disagrees with Swanson shows \n     only that his analysis is contrary to precedent, not that the \n     precedent is ``dubious.'' He also contends that the \n     reexamination procedures in Swanson are distinguishable \n     because they were limited to new prior art. However, he \n     ignores the higher-threshold gatekeeping function required \n     under sections 6 and 18 of the proposed Act to obtain \n     reexamination in the first place. In any event, the \n     distinction is one without constitutional significance: there \n     is no constitutional basis for confining reexamination to \n     only one of possible correctable defects in the original \n     issuance of a patent.\n       Professor Epstein asserts that I am incorrect in stating \n     that under current law, at the instance of a party, the PTO \n     may reexamine a patent that has issued, and the validity of \n     which has been unsuccessfully challenged in litigation. Yet, \n     that is essentially what happened in Translogic Technology, \n     Inc. v. Hitachi, Ltd., 250 F. App'x 988 (Fed. Cir. 2007), and \n     In re Translogic Technology, Inc., 504 F.3d 1249 (Fed. Cir. \n     2007)--cases that he simply does not address.\n       Mr. Cooper barely addresses the above-mentioned precedent \n     at all, except to assert that the unanimous decision of the \n     U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in In re \n     Swanson is inconsistent with his reading of Plaut. In so \n     doing, Mr. Cooper suggests that there is something unseemly \n     about the fact that a patent could be found ``not invalid'' \n     in a proceeding against an infringer, but then subsequently \n     found invalid by the PTO through reexamination at the behest \n     of the infringer. Yet that is the law today. Sections 6 and \n     18 do nothing more than expand the types of invalidity \n     challenges that may be considered by the PTO. Mr. Cooper's \n     analysis is not really a critique of sections 6 and 18; it is \n     a critique of patent law as it has existed for thirty years. \n     By analogy, the fact that a party may be acquitted by one \n     court under a reasonable doubt standard, but found civilly \n     liable by another court under a preponderance standard does \n     not render either decision ``advisory.'' So too here. \n     Finally, the passage Mr. Cooper cites from Plaut is simply \n     inapplicable. The standard of patentability is not being \n     changed, and the use of a clear-and-convincing standard of \n     review in court is merely an acknowledgement of the \n     presumption of administrative correctness, which is \n     inapplicable when the PTO reviews its own work.\n       At bottom, nothing in sections 6 and 18 of the proposed Act \n     purports to change the substantive law regarding when a \n     patent is validly issued. They merely broaden the \n     availability of one of the preexisting procedural vehicles \n     (reexamination) for assessing validity. Matters of a \n     technical nature, such as this, are especially appropriate to \n     administrative as opposed to judicial redetermination. Courts \n     have consistently rejected the notion that there is a \n     property right in having patent validity reviewed only in an \n     Article III court. And courts have rejected the argument that \n     the PTO cannot reconsider its own decision to issue a patent \n     merely because a court has found in a particular proceeding \n     that an accused infringer failed to carry its burden of \n     proving the patent invalid by clear and convincing evidence. \n     Against this backdrop, we may be confident that the \n     amendments to the reexamination procedure provided by \n     sections 6 and 18 will be judged to pass constitutional \n     muster.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Michael W. McConnell.\n\n  Mr. KYL. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on Thursday, \nSeptember 8, when the Senate resumes consideration of the America \nInvents Act, the following amendments be the only first-degree \namendments in order: Coburn No. 599, Sessions No. 600, Cantwell No. \n595; that there be 5 hours of debate on the amendments divided in the \nfollowing manner: 75 minutes for Senator Coburn or his designee; 1 hour \nfor Senator Sessions or his designee; 45 minutes for Senator Cantwell \nor her designee; 1 hour for Senator Grassley or his designee; and 1 \nhour for Senator Leahy or his designee; that upon the use or yielding \nback of time, the Senate proceed to votes in relation to the amendments \nin the following order: Sessions No. 600; Cantwell No. 595; Coburn No. \n599; that no other amendments or points of order be in order to any of \nthe amendments or the bill prior to the votes; finally, that following \ndisposition of the amendments, the Senate proceed to vote on passage of \nthe bill, as amended, if amended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, with this agreement, there will be up to \nfour rollcall votes tomorrow afternoon beginning about 4 p.m. Senators \nshould also expect an additional vote following the President's speech \nto the joint session. This vote will be on a motion to proceed to S.J. \nRes. 25, which is a joint resolution of disapproval of the President's \nexercise of authority to increase the debt limit.\n  If we proceed to the debt limit; that is, S.J. Res. 25, that means we \nwill be in session for a long time on Friday--enough to dispose of \nthat. If we do not move, the motion to proceed is not made \nsuccessfully, then we would finish that matter and the week's business, \nat least as far as votes. Friday we have some other items we need to be \nfiling, different motions and things, but the general body would not \nhave to worry about that.\n\n[[Page S5378]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/07/senate-section/article/S5378-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5378-S5379]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n                                 F_____\n                                 \n\n COMMITTEE ALLOCATIONS, BUDGET AGGREGATES, AND PAY-AS-YOU-GO SCORECARD\n\n  Mr. CONRAD.

FORCES\n\n\n              Master at Arms First Class Johnny Douangdara\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a true \nAmerican hero, Master-at-Arms PO1 Johnny Douangdara of South Sioux \nCity, NE, who was tragically killed on August 6, 2011, when the CH-47 \nChinook helicopter in which he was a passenger was shot down in Wardak \nProvince, Afghanistan.\n  After graduating from South Sioux City High School in 2003, Johnny \nknew he wanted to serve in the Navy. While initially he wanted to work \non nuclear submarines, his love of dogs instead led him to become the \nlead dog handler serving with an East Coast-based Navy SEAL unit.\n  Johnny earned numerous decorations throughout his five overseas \ntours, including the Bronze Star with ``V'' device, Joint Service \nCommendation Medal with ``V'' device, Army Commendation Medal, \nPresidential Unit Citation, Good Conduct Medal, Rifle Marksmanship \nMedal, and the Pistol Marksmanship Medal, among others.\n  The son of Laotian immigrants, Sengchanh and Phouthasith Douangdara, \nJohnny was never outspoken about his career. He was a humble man, a man \ndoing a job he loved and a job in which he believed strongly. And in \nthat belief, he and his dog, Bart, selflessly climbed aboard a Chinook \nwith 29 other U.S. service members and 8 Afghans, rushing to help a \nband of Army Rangers pinned down by enemy fire. That helicopter was \nshot down in what has become the single deadliest incident for the U.S. \nmilitary in this 10-year operation.\n  Johnny knew the dangers he faced and the risks he took working with \nthe Navy's elite SEALs. He also knew the importance of the work he did \nin the Navy on behalf of his fellow Americans. He risked--and \nultimately sacrificed--his own life so that people a world away could \nhave the chance to enjoy the freedoms he and his family had found in \nAmerica.\n  PO Johnny Douangdara and Bart made the ultimate and most valiant \nsacrifice in service to their country, and my condolences and prayers \ngo out to Johnny's family and friends. His heroism and selflessness \nwill remain an inspiration for all of us.\n\n\n                    Staff Sergeant Patrick Hamburger\n\n  Mr. President, I also rise today to honor a true American hero, SSG \nPatrick Hamburger of Lincoln, NE, who was tragically killed on August \n6, 2011, when the CH-47 Chinook helicopter in which he was a passenger \nwas shot down in Wardak Province, Afghanistan.\n\n[[Page S5380]]\n\n  Sergeant Hamburger was born in Sioux City, IA, on Memorial Day, May \n25, 1981. In 1985 his family moved to Lincoln, NE, where Patrick \ngraduated from Lincoln Southeast High School in 1999. While still \nattending school, Patrick chose to use his talents and serve his fellow \ncitizens as a member of the Nebraska National Guard.\n  Patrick met Candie Reagan and her daughter, Veronica, in 2005. In \n2008 the three of them moved to Grand Island, NE, where Patrick served \nas a full-time helicopter flight engineer with the 2-135th General \nSupport Aviation Battalion. In January 2009, Candie gave birth to their \ndaughter, Payton. There is no doubt that while Patrick loved being a \nsoldier, he loved his family more.\n  Patrick was less than 2 weeks into his deployment when he selflessly \nclimbed aboard a Chinook with 29 other U.S. service members and 8 \nAfghans, rushing to help a band of Army Rangers pinned down by enemy \nfire. The helicopter was shot down in what has become the single \ndeadliest incident for the U.S. military in this 10-year operation.\n  Patrick knew the dangers he faced and the risks he took. He also knew \nthe importance of the work he did in the Army on behalf of his fellow \nAmericans. He risked--and ultimately sacrificed--his own life so that \npeople a world away could have the chance to enjoy the freedoms he had \nfound in America.\n  Patrick is survived by his girlfriend, Candie Reagan; her daughter, \nVeronica Reagan; their daughter, Payton; his mother and stepfather, \nJoyce and DeLayne Peck of Lincoln; father and stepmother, Douglas and \nShaune Hamburger of Knoxville, TN; brothers, Michael of New York, NY, \nand Christopher of St. Louis, MO; grandparents, Willard and Jacque \nHamburger of Omaha; stepsiblings Jessica, Jeremy, and Joshua Francis of \nKnoxville, TN; and numerous other family members and friends.\n  Sergeant Patrick Hamburger made the ultimate and most valiant \nsacrifice in service to his country, and my condolences and prayers go \nout to his family and friends. His heroism and selflessness will remain \nan inspiration for all of us.\n\n\n                      Sergeant Joshua J. Robinson\n\n  Mr. President, I further rise today to honor a true American hero, \nSGT Joshua J. Robinson of Nebraska, who was tragically killed on August \n7, 2011, in Helmand Province, Afghanistan.\n  Joshua grew up on a 100-acre farm near Oak, NE, where he would spend \nhis days hunting and tracking in the back pasture. Joshua took the \nskills he learned in his early years with him into the Marine Corps, \nwhere he quickly excelled and became an instructor, teaching younger \nmarines how to track the enemy and survive in the mountains. Joshua \neven developed an enemy-tracking course which is believed to be the \nfirst of its kind.\n  Joshua deployed three times to Iraq before being sent to Afghanistan, \nleaving at home his wife, Rhonda, and two sons, Wyatt and Kodiak. \nAlthough he was a proud, smart, tough marine, he was first and foremost \na loving father and husband.\n  I offer my most sincere condolences to the family and friends of \nSergeant Robinson. He made the ultimate and most courageous sacrifice \nfor our Nation, and his sons will grow up knowing their father was \ntruly a hero. I join all Americans in grieving the loss of this \nremarkable young man and know that Sergeant Robinson's passion for \nserving, his leadership, and his selflessness will remain a source of \ninspiration for us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/07/senate-section/article/S5380-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5380]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   INAUGURATION OF DR. LOBSANG SANGAY\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, on August 8, 2011, in the small town of \nDharamsala in northern India, a modest ceremony was held to inaugurate \nthe new Prime Minister of the Central Tibetan Administration. The new \nPrime Minister's name is Dr. Lobsang Sangay, and I had the opportunity, \ntogether with some of my distinguished colleagues, to meet him last \nmonth.\n  Dr. Sangay assumes office at an important moment in Tibetan history. \nIndeed, his election marks a significant milestone in the advancement \nof Tibetan democracy, as His Holiness the Dalai Lama earlier this year \nannounced his decision to devolve fully his political authority to the \nelected leadership, now led by Dr. Sangay.\n  At a time when dictators in many parts of the world have proven \nthemselves willing to slaughter their own people rather than cede an \niota of power, the decision of His Holiness the Dalai Lama to surrender \nhis political authority in favor of democracy is both inspiring and \nsignificant. It was also a wise decision that will strengthen the \nlegitimacy of the Tibetan cause among the international community and \nsustain it for decades to come.\n  The election that brought Dr. Sangay to power involved voting by tens \nof thousands of Tibetans living in exile in over 30 countries, from \nBelgium to Bhutan. In my home State of Connecticut, nearly 100 Tibetan \nAmericans took part in this election.\n  Dr. Sangay, a 43-year-old academic who holds a doctorate from Harvard \nLaw School, was elected Prime Minister with 55 percent of the vote. Now \nthe executive authority of the Central Tibetan Authority rests solely \non his shoulders.\n  I came away from my conversation with Dr. Sangay deeply impressed. He \nis a young man of considerable intellect and accomplishment, and I am \ncertain that he will prove to be a leader of courage and conviction. \nThe Tibetan people have chosen wisely in electing him as their Prime \nMinister.\n  During our meeting, Dr. Sangay affirmed his commitment to the Dalai \nLama's ``Middle Way Approach,'' which seeks genuine autonomy for Tibet, \nnot independence, and I was encouraged by his determination to meet the \nchallenge of finding a solution for the Tibet issue.\n  Unfortunately, the situation for the 6 million Tibetans living under \nChinese rule today remains deeply troubling. This is a community that \nhas never been permitted to participate in a free and fair election of \nthe sort that just took place among Tibetans in exile. In fact, this is \na community that is governed by authorities who have deemed that \ncarrying a copy of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights or a \nsimple photograph of his Holiness the Dalai Lama to be illegal and \npunishable acts. It is a community that has faced brutal repression and \nviolence and that has, for decades, been denied their fundamental \nrights, including the freedoms of expression, assembly, and \nassociation.\n  I hope that the self-fulfillment of democratic governance exercised \nby Tibetan refugees can provide hope and inspiration to those in Tibet \nand China who yearn for the fundamental freedom to choose their own \ngovernment and leaders.\n  While the U.S. government does not officially recognize the Central \nTibetan Administration, we do work with them though a variety of \nprograms to help Tibetan refugees. As the United States continues its \noutreach to civil society and nongovernmental groups, and its promotion \nof democracy around the world, I hope we should enhance our engagement \nwith the Central Tibetan Administration and Dr. Sangay.\n  Moreover, when Lobsang Sangay returns to Washington this fall, I hope \nmany doors will be open to him. What the Dalai Lama and his fellow \nTibetan refugees have accomplished is worthy and deserving of our \nattention and respect.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/07/senate-section/article/S5380-2", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5380-S5381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            FREEDOM IN CUBA\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record the following articles highlighting the resilience and \nstrength of the Cuban people as they continue to struggle under an \noppressive regime. These stories and videos which continue to surface \nout of Cuba have underlined the Cuban Government's inhumane actions \nagainst its people. Santa Maria Fonseca is one of these brave ``Ladies \nin White'' who continue to peacefully fight for liberty in Cuba. She \nexplained, ``Our objective is that one day the people will join us.'' \nMs. Fonseca and the Cuban people deserve our unyielding support in \ntheir courageous efforts to reclaim freedom in Cuba.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S5381]]\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Aug. 29, 2011]\n\n                     Castro vs. the Ladies in White\n\n                      (By Mary Anastasia O'Grady)\n\n       Rocks and iron bars were the weapons of choice in a \n     government assault on a handful of unarmed women on the \n     outskirts of Santiago de Cuba on the afternoon of Aug. 7. \n     According to a report issued by the Paris-based International \n     Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), the beatings were savage \n     and ``caused them injuries, some considerable.''\n       It was not an isolated incident. In the past two months, \n     attacks on peaceful women dissidents, organized by the state \n     security apparatus, have escalated. Most notable is the \n     intensity with which the regime is moving to try to crush the \n     core group known as the Ladies in White.\n       This is not without risk to the regime, should the \n     international community decide to pay attention and apply \n     pressure on the white-elite regime the way it did in \n     opposition to apartheid in South Africa. But the decision to \n     take that risk suggests that the 52-year-old dictatorship in \n     Havana is feeling increasingly insecure. The legendary \n     bearded macho men of the ``revolution,'' informed by the \n     trial of a caged Hosni Mubarak in an Egyptian courtroom, \n     apparently are terrified by the quiet, prayerful, nonviolent \n     courage of little more than 100 women. No totalitarian regime \n     can shrug off the fearless audacity these ladies display, or \n     the signs that their boldness is spreading.\n       The Castro brothers' goons are learning that they will not \n     be easily intimidated. Take, for example, what happened that \n     same Aug. 7 morning in Santiago: The women, dressed in white \n     and carrying flowers, had gathered after Sunday Mass at the \n     cathedral for a silent procession to protest the regime's \n     incarceration of political prisoners. Castro supporters and \n     state security officials, ``armed with sticks and other blunt \n     objects,'' according to FIDH, assaulted the group both \n     physically and verbally. The ladies were then dragged aboard \n     a bus, taken outside the city and dropped off on the side of \n     a highway.\n       Some of them regrouped and ventured out again in the \n     afternoon, this time to hold a public vigil for their cause. \n     That's when they were met by another Castro onslaught. On the \n     same day thugs set upon the homes of former political \n     prisoner Jose Daniel Ferrer and another activist. Six people, \n     including Mr. Ferrer's wife and daughter, were sent to the \n     hospital with contusions and broken bones, according to FIDH.\n       The Ladies in White first came on the scene in the \n     aftermath of the infamous March 2003 crackdown in which 75 \n     independent journalists and librarians, writers and democracy \n     advocates were rounded up and handed prison sentences of six \n     to 28 years. The wives, mothers and sisters of some of them \n     began a simple act of protest. On Sundays they would gather \n     at the Havana Cathedral for Mass and afterward they would \n     march carrying gladiolas in a silent call for the prisoners' \n     release.\n       In 2005, the Ladies in White won Europe's prestigious \n     Sakharov prize for their courage. Cellphones that caught the \n     regime's brutality against them on video helped get their \n     story out. By 2010, they had so embarrassed the dictatorship \n     internationally that a deal was struck to deport their \n     imprisoned loved ones along with their family to Spain.\n       But some prisoners refused the deal and some of the ladies \n     stayed in Cuba. Others joined them, calling themselves \n     ``Ladies in Support.'' The group continued its processions \n     following Sunday Mass in Havana, and women on the eastern end \n     of the island established the same practice in Santiago.\n       Laura Pollan, whose husband refused to take the offer of \n     exile in Spain and was later released from prison, is a key \n     member of the group. She and her cohorts have vowed to \n     continue their activism as long as even one political \n     prisoner remains jailed. Last week I spoke with her by phone \n     in Havana, and she told me that when the regime agreed to \n     release all of the 75, ``it thought that the Ladies in White \n     would disappear. Yet the opposite happened. Sympathizers have \n     been joining up. There are now 82 ladies in Havana and 34 in \n     Santiago de Cuba.'' She said that the paramilitary mobs have \n     the goal of creating fear in order to keep the group from \n     growing. But the movement is spreading to other parts of the \n     country, places where every Sunday there are now marches.\n       This explains the terror that has rained down on the group \n     in Santiago and surrounding suburbs on successive Sundays \n     since July and on other members in Havana as recently as Aug. \n     18.\n       Last Tuesday, when four women dressed in black took to the \n     steps of the capitol building in Havana chanting ``freedom,'' \n     a Castro bully tried to remove them. Amazingly, the large \n     crowd watching shouted for him to leave them alone. \n     Eventually uniformed agents carried them off. But the \n     incident, caught on video, is evidence of a new chapter in \n     Cuban history, and it is being written by women. How it ends \n     may depend heavily on whether the international community \n     supports them or simply shields its eyes from their torment.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Aug. 26, 2011]\n\n                        On Cuba's Capitol Steps\n\n       The four Cuban women who took to the steps of the capitol \n     in Havana last week chanting ``liberty'' for 40 minutes \n     weren't exactly rebel forces. But you wouldn't know that by \n     the way the Castro regime reacted. A video of the event shows \n     uniformed state security forcibly dragging the women to \n     waiting patrol cars. They must have represented a threat to \n     the regime because they were interrogated and detained until \n     the following day.\n       The regime's bigger problem may be the crowd that gathered \n     to watch. In a rare moment of dissent in that public square, \n     the crowd booed, hissed and insulted the agents who were sent \n     to remove the women.\n       One of the four women, Sara Marta Fonseca, gave a telephone \n     interview to the online newspaper Diario de Cuba, based in \n     Spain, as she made her way home after being freed. Ms. \n     Fonseca, who is a member of the Rosa Parks Feminist Movement \n     for Civil Rights, said that the group was demanding ``that \n     the government cease the repression against the Ladies in \n     White, against the opposition and against the Cuban people in \n     general.'' The Ladies in White are dissidents who demand the \n     release of all political prisoners.\n       Yet as Ms. Fonseca explained, the group wasn't really \n     addressing the government. ``Our objective is that one day \n     the people will join us,'' she said. ``Realistically we do \n     not have the strength and the power to defeat the \n     dictatorship. The strength and the power are to be found in \n     the unity of the people. In this we put all our faith, in \n     that this people will cross the barrier of fear and join the \n     opposition to reclaim freedom.''\n       Ms. Fonseca said her group chose the capitol because the \n     area is crowded with locals and tourists and they wanted to \n     ``draw attention to the people of Cuba.'' In the end, she \n     said that they were satisfied with the results because she \n     heard the crowd crying ``abuser, leave them alone, they are \n     peaceful and they are telling the truth.'' This reaction, the \n     seasoned dissident said, ``was greater'' than in the past. \n     ``I am very happy because in spite of being beaten and \n     dragged we could see that the people were ready to join us.''\n       For 52 years the Cuban dictatorship has held power through \n     fear. The poverty, isolation, broken families and lost dreams \n     of two generations of Cubans have persisted because the \n     regime made dissent far too dangerous. If that fear \n     dissipates, the regime would collapse. Which is why four \n     women on the capitol steps had to be gagged.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/07/senate-section/article/S5381-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5381-S5382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     LAUREL SENIOR LEAGUE CHAMPIONS\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate the \nworld champion Laurel Senior League Softball team, led by manager Brad \nLee, and by coaches Bo Collins and Kevin Green. By winning the Senior \nLeague Softball World Series, the young women on the team demonstrated \nthat success comes from hard work, perseverance, and teamwork, with the \nhelp of dedicated coaching and the support of community, parents, and \nfans.\n  This spring when the softball season opened, more than 2.5 million \ngirls around the world dreamed of winning the Senior League Softball \nWorld Series. Among them were 14 girls from the town of Laurel in \nSussex County, DE, who--after suffering a heartbreaking loss in the \n2010 championship game--vowed that 2011 would be their year. And that \nis exactly what happened.\n  The players are Alison Pusey, Alexis Hudson, Logan Green, Sara Jo \nWhaley, Whitney Toadvine, Emily Pusey, Regan Green, Erin Johnson, \nKortney Lee, Kristen Collins, Nicole Ullman, Alyssa Givens, Bethany \nWheatley, and Bree Venables. Led by manager Brad Lee and coaches Bo \nCollins and Kevin Green, these young women worked hard all season to \nimprove their hitting, fielding, pitching, and base running.\n  In its 38th year, the Senior League Softball Little League division \nfor girls ages 14 to 16 is a worldwide tournament with teams traveling \nto compete from as far away as Italy and the Philippines. The Senior \nLeague Softball World Series has been held for 8 years in Sussex \nCounty, DE. As the host, Delaware's top team gets a berth in the \ntournament, and Laurel has captured that spot 7 of the past 8 years.\n  While the Laurel girls have served as excellent hosts and ambassadors \nfor Delaware and for the United States of America during those 7 years, \nthey fell just short of the championship year after year.\n  The championship title almost slipped again from Laurel's grasp--not \nonce, but twice--during the 2011 tournament. In two of the playoff \ngames, the team came from behind in the bottom of the final inning to \nwin. While the championship game proved to be a pitching match, clearly \nthe many hours of practice at the plate paid off.\n  On August 13, under the threat of rain, 16-year-old Logan Green took \nthe\n\n[[Page S5382]]\n\nmound against the Latin America team and pitched a three-inning no-\nhitter. Laurel scored in the first inning when first-baseman Bree \nVenables was hit by a pitch with the bases loaded. Logan's sister, 14-\nyear-old Regan Green, took over the mound in the fourth inning and gave \nup four hits--but no runs--over the last four innings to secure the \nfinal win and the championship.\n  Regan Green recalled her nervousness during that final game but said \nthat her fellow players' teamwork gave her the confidence she needed on \nthe mound. ``It's always good knowing they have my back,'' she said.\n  Alyssa Givens set the stage for the ``safety run'' with a well-hit \ndouble in the sixth inning and then stole home from third base. Regan \nGreen and the fielders took care of five batters in the seventh inning.\n  Finally, after years of coming close, the Laurel Senior League \nSoftball team claimed the World Championship title.\n  Team Manager Brad Lee credited the victory to players' hard work and \nexpressed the pride of his hometown. ``There's nothing like playing for \nyour hometown. This is something that these young ladies will remember \nforever, and to bring the trophy home to Laurel for the first time is \nan unbelievable feeling.''\n  The State of Delaware--and especially the town of Laurel--share \nManager Lee's sentiment.\n  Today, we congratulate the Laurel Senior League Softball team, \nmanager Lee, and coaches Collins and Green. Through their commitment to \nexcellence, perseverance, hard work and team work, they made their \ndreams come true and accomplished something that no other Delaware \nteam, male or female, has ever done. In doing so, they have not only \nmade the town of Laurel and its citizens proud; they have made all \nDelawareans proud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/07/senate-section/article/S5382-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO SECOND LIEUTENANT VICKI ALTHAGE\n\n Mr. JOHANNS.

I \ncan assure you that the entire Johanns office will be cheering loudly \nand filled with a sense of pride as Vicki accepts this new \nresponsibility.\n  We hold our heads high when we talk about the strong tradition of \nmilitary service in our great State.

Mr. President, today I pay \ntribute to the 125th anniversary of the founding of the community of \nDelmont, SD. I am proud to honor the people of Delmont and extend my \ncongratulations to them on this memorable occasion.\n  Delmont was a railroad town along the Milwaukee Road even before \nSouth Dakota achieved statehood. An investor named Thomas Ball built \nthe town at the top of a hill overlooking the East Choteau Creek \nValley. Its railroad depot served the people of Douglas County.\n  Many of the people who originally settled Delmont were Germans from \nRussia. Today they still celebrate their heritage with the annual Old-\ntime Harvest Festival. The residents use the celebration to honor their \nheritage with kuchen, a sweet German pastry with a custard topping, \nSouth Dakota's official dessert. This year's festival will be special \nin honor of the 125th anniversary. The 2-day festivities will include \ntractor pulls, demonstrations of frontier-era harvesting equipment, \nfireworks, and plenty of kuchen.\n  A hundred twenty-five years after its founding, Delmont continues to \ncelebrate its rich heritage through the Old-time Harvest Festival. \nThough the railroad is gone, the community remains an important \nhistorical and cultural asset to South Dakota. I am proud to honor the \nachievements of Delmont on this memorable occasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/07/senate-section/article/S5382-3", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING MICHAEL GARAFANO\n\n Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to an \nauthentic hero, Michael Garafano, who died tragically in Rutland, VT on \nAugust 28, 2011, during Tropical Storm Irene.\n  Michael Garafano was the water treatment and resource manager in the \nRutland City Department of Public Works, a position he held since 1981. \nHe was known by his coworkers as someone who always went above and \nbeyond the call of duty, and his work ethic was second to none. He took \nhis responsibilities of protecting the Rutland water supply very \nseriously. He was a model of a dedicated public servant.\n  So it was not unusual that the night of August 28, as the heavy rains \nfrom Tropical Storm Irene started assaulting Rutland, Mr. Garafano, \nwent to check on the city reservoir one more time, looking out for his \nfellow citizens as he had done so often, and so well, and with such \ndedication, over three decades. Tragically, his life was taken by the \nraging storm. Compounding his tragedy is another: Michael Garafano took \nhis son Michael Jr. to check the city reservoir when he went out that \nnight. Michael Garafano Jr. never returned from that journey and is \nstill missing.\n  Alan Shelvey, Rutland Commissioner of Public Works, said of Michael \nGarafano, ``He was doing what he always did--trying to make sure \neverything was right and the water supply was protected. We're going to \nmiss him tremendously. He can't be replaced. People say that about \npeople--in this case that's true.''\n  Michael Garafano represented what is best about Vermont and about \nAmerica: he worked hard and with great dedication, he loved his work, \nhe cared about those who lived in the community where he lived. When \nthere was a job to be done, a responsibility to be met, he responded \nwith generosity and directness. He was the epitome of public service, \nand lost his life doing the job he cared so deeply about.\n  Michael Garafano was devoted to his family, and he was a friend to \nmany who knew they could count on him when they were most in need.\n  It is people like Michael Garafano who make our communities and our \nentire Nation work and prosper, who make our cities and towns into \ncommunities and not just random groups of people. The State of Vermont \ngrieves the loss of one of its unsung heroes.\n  He will be sorely missed by his family, by the city of Rutland, and \nby the many people whose lives he touched and enriched.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/07/senate-section/article/S5382-4", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:45 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the following concurrent resolution, in which it requests the \nconcurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.

A bill to strengthen Indian education, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the \nissue of tribal education; an issue of great importance to Indian \nCountry, but one that does not receive the attention it should from the \nrest of the nation.\n  Native students' academic outcomes show the worst achievement gaps in \nthe country. Graduation rates for American Indians and Alaska Natives \nare lower than the graduation rates for all other racial and ethnic \ngroups. American Indian and Alaska Native students have a lower average \nscore in reading than other students. Sadly there's been little \nimprovement to these statistics over the past 80 years.\n  I hear often from many of the tribal school districts in my State, \nand the issues they face in providing quality education to their \nstudents are numerous. Aging infrastructure badly in need of \nrenovation. Difficulties in recruiting trained, Native teachers and \nadministrators. Chronic underfunding and late payments of Impact Aid. \nThe failure of No Child Left Behind requirements to address tribal \nneeds and learning styles especially related to language and culture. \nAll are impediments to the goal of improving educational outcomes of \nNative American youth.\n  To try and help address these issues, I rise today to introduce the \nBuilding upon the Unique Indian Learned and Development, or BUILD, Act. \nThis legislation is an important step towards improving the conditions \nand teaching for Native American students.\n  In general, our Nation's schools are aging and in a state of \ndisrepair. But this is especially true of BIE schools, where over half \nof the almost 4,500 education buildings are over 30 years old, and more \nthan 20 percent are more than 50 years old. It is reprehensible that \nany child is being subjected to learning conditions that are literally \na danger to them. Although education construction has improved \ndramatically over the last few years, the deferred maintenance backlog \nis still estimated to be over $500 million and increasing annually. How \ncan we expect our students to succeed academically when we fail to \nprovide them with a proper environment to achieve success?\n  That is why the BUILD Act includes a School Facility Innovation \nContest, which would allow students and faculty who learn and work in \nthese old school buildings, as well as engineering and architecture \nstudents and faculty nationwide to propose creative ways to improve \ntribal school facilities through a national competition. It is time for \nbold, new ideas to renovate or replace these old facilities, and \nthere's no one better to contribute than those who use the buildings \nmost often, and some of the brightest architectural and engineering \nminds in the country.\n  In addition to infrastructure needs, a major concern is the \nachievement gap of Native American students. So many of them are not \nreaching their academic potential. These students need to be inspired \nand shown the possibilities in their future. One way to do so is to \nexpose them to successful members of their own communities and cultural \nbackgrounds. These kids must have role models, mentors, and teachers, \nfrom their community and culture. Unfortunately, today, while American \nIndians are 11 percent of the student population, less than 3 percent \nof their teachers, counselors or principals are also Native American.\n  New Mexico has already developed some programs to increase the \npipeline for Native American teachers and leaders, both in its tribal \ncolleges and non-tribal colleges. These local programs are models for \nwhat can be expanded in New Mexico and nationwide. We need many more \nprograms growing local leaders to meet the needs of the tribal schools.\n  For example, Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute offers an \nEarly Childhood Associate Degree program, which works closely with the \nsurrounding tribal communities to meet the Office of Head Start \nstandards for certified Early Childhood educators in their classrooms.\n  New Mexico State University offers an American Indian Education \nDoctoral Program in its College of Education, where the majority of \nstudents stay to work in NM.\n  The University of New Mexico offers an Institute for American Indian \nEducation to encourage upper-level Native American undergraduates to \nconsider teaching, and helps paraprofessionals from tribal communities \nreceive their teaching certification. In addition, it offers Native \nLanguage teachers professional development and training for language \nrevitalization and immersion style teaching.\n  At the Zuni Pueblo's ``Grow your Own'' program, started in 1980, \ntribal members attend Saturday school to produce Zuni-certified \nteachers, meeting the state's alternative certification.\n  Research tells us that with incentives, we can increase the number of \neffective Native teachers and leaders in public and tribal schools. And \nall of these programs are a great example of it.\n\n[[Page S5389]]\n\n  But more must be done, which is why the BUILD Act seeks to provide \nthese incentives and expand the pipeline for Native American students \nto become teachers, principals and administrators. Strong classroom \nteachers and school leadership must be developed, not left to chance.\n  In addition to Native American students learning from Native American \nteachers and mentors, learning in their own language and culture has \nbeen shown to improve academic outcomes. Schools can succeed when they \npromote and maintainan overall educational climate that values and \nrespects Native language and culture, and make the curriculum relevant \nto Native students' lives. Native American children who are proficient \nin their native language have higher proficiency in English and lower \ndropout rates.\n  My bill would strengthen language and culturally based education by \nallowing tribal leaders and elders to teach Native language in schools. \nSchool districts in New Mexico are piloting programs like these.\n  For example, the Mescalero Apache Schools developed a Native Language \nK-12 Curriculum aligned to New Mexico State Standards where tribal \nmembers are teaching in the school system.\n  The Central Consolidated School District is the first public school \nin the State to implement a language Immersion Program/Model in Navajo \nlanguage.\n  The Pueblo of Jemez has created an Education Collaborative by \ncoordinating effort between Tribal, Public, Charter and Bureau school \neducators and administrators to align curriculum and transitions from \none school to the next, while supporting and honoring the Jemez \nlanguage, culture and traditions.\n  Also related to this, the BUILD Act reauthorizes the Esther Martinez \nAct for native language immersion programs, and allows standards, \nassessments, and teaching strategies to accommodate diverse culture and \nlanguage learning needs.\n  Last but not least, the BUILD Act calls for both full and forward \nfunding of Impact Aid. Forward funding so that tribal school \nadministrators will know before the school year begins what resources \nthey have for salaries, for maintenance and utilities, and for \nsupplies. Full funding so that school districts receive the funds they \nneed to provide a quality education to all children.\n  For many of these local school districts responsible for educating \nchildren connected to federal land, Impact Aid represents the basic \nfunding that supports their schools. Yet, Impact Aid appropriations \nhave not matched the loss in property taxes that these communities \nwould otherwise have been able to use to support their local schools. \nImpact Aid construction and facilities funds have been redirected to \nbasic support, resulting in school buildings deteriorating and in such \npoor condition that no parent could expect their child to learn in \nthem. Years of not fully funding Impact Aid has resulted in Indian \nTreaty Land school districts with insufficient resources to meet \nAverage Yearly Progress under No Child Left Behind, including the \ndifficulties to retain highly qualified teachers and purchase adequate \ncomputer equipment to educate its children, and an inability to \nrenovate existing facilities and maintain adequate transportation \nfleets.\n  In developing the BUILD Act, I worked closely with many tribes, \nIndian Educators, and Indian institutes of higher education and am \nhappy to have the support from many of them. Southwestern Indian \nPolytechnic Institute, Institute of American Indian Arts, Navajo \nTechnical College, the NM Indian Education Advisory Council, the \nNational Indian Education Association, American Indian Higher Education \nConsortium, and National Association of Federally Impacted Schools have \nall endorsed the BUILD Act. I would like to thank them for their \nsupport and collaboration.\n  I would also like to thank Senator Akaka, my chairman on the Indian \nAffairs Committee, with whom I worked to include many of these \nprovisions in the Native CLASS Act, which he introduced this past June. \nThe Native CLASS Act is important legislation that will improve the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act by including provisions to \nstrengthen tribal control of education for Native American students \nthrough relationships between tribes and local education agencies and \ngreater parental involvement with school districts; by providing \nalternatives to detention programs for at-risk Indian children; and by \nproviding for alternative licensure and other incentives to increase \nthe number of skilled native language teachers.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Akaka and the rest of my \ncolleagues to ensure that the provisions and ideas in the BUILD Act and \nNative CLASS Act are reflected in any ESEA Reauthorization legislation. \nNative American children are the future of their communities and our \nnation. They deserve equal access to resources, teachers, and safe \nschools. Unfortunately, to date, they have not been getting this. It is \nlong past time for us to do something about it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/07/senate-section/article/S5389-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5389-S5390]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 258--SUPPORTING THE DESIGNATION OF NATIONAL ADULT \n                   EDUCATION AND FAMILY LITERACY WEEK\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY (for herself, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Whitehouse, \nMr. Webb, Mr. Begich, Mr. Johnson of South Dakota, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. \nCardin, Mr. Casey, Ms. Murkowski, and Ms. Mikulski) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 219\n\n       Whereas celiac disease affects approximately 1 in every 130 \n     people in the United States, for a total of 3,000,000 people;\n       Whereas the majority of people with celiac disease have yet \n     to be diagnosed;\n       Whereas celiac disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder \n     that is classified as both an autoimmune condition and a \n     genetic condition;\n       Whereas celiac disease causes damage to the lining of the \n     small intestine, which results in overall malnutrition;\n       Whereas when a person with celiac disease consumes foods \n     that contain certain protein fractions, that person suffers a \n     cell-mediated immune response that damages the villi of the \n     small intestine, interfering with the absorption of nutrients \n     in food and the effectiveness of medications;\n       Whereas such problematic protein fractions are found in \n     wheat, barley, rye, and oats, which are used to produce many \n     foods, medications, and vitamins;\n       Whereas because celiac disease is a genetic disease, there \n     is an increased incidence of celiac disease in families with \n     a known history of celiac disease;\n       Whereas celiac disease is underdiagnosed because the \n     symptoms can be attributed to\n\n[[Page S5393]]\n\n     other conditions and are easily overlooked by doctors and \n     patients;\n       Whereas as recently as 2000, the average person with celiac \n     disease waited 11 years for a correct diagnosis;\n       Whereas \\1/2\\ of all people with celiac disease do not show \n     symptoms of the disease;\n       Whereas celiac disease is diagnosed by tests that measure \n     the blood for abnormally high levels of the antibodies of \n     immunoglobulin A, anti-tissue transglutaminase, and IgA anti-\n     endomysium antibodies;\n       Whereas celiac disease can be treated only by implementing \n     a diet free of wheat, barley, rye, and oats, often called a \n     ``gluten-free diet'';\n       Whereas a delay in the diagnosis of celiac disease can \n     result in damage to the small intestine, which leads to an \n     increased risk for malnutrition, anemia, lymphoma, \n     adenocarcinoma, osteoporosis, miscarriage, congenital \n     malformation, short stature, and disorders of the skin and \n     other organs;\n       Whereas celiac disease is linked to many autoimmune \n     disorders, including thyroid disease, systemic lupus \n     erythematosus, type 1 diabetes, liver disease, collagen \n     vascular disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and Sjogren's \n     syndrome;\n       Whereas the connection between celiac disease and diet was \n     first established by Dr. Samuel Gee, who wrote, ``if the \n     patient can be cured at all, it must be by means of diet'';\n       Whereas Dr. Samuel Gee was born on September 13, 1839; and\n       Whereas the Senate is an institution that can raise \n     awareness in the general public and the medical community of \n     celiac disease: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 13, 2011, as ``National Celiac \n     Disease Awareness Day'';\n       (2) recognizes that all people of the United States should \n     become more informed and aware of celiac disease;\n       (3) calls upon the people of the United States to observe \n     National Celiac Disease Awareness Day with appropriate \n     ceremonies and activities; and\n       (4) respectfully requests the Secretary of the Senate to \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the Celiac Sprue \n     Association, the American Celiac Society, and the Celiac \n     Disease Foundation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/07/senate-section/article/S5393-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5393]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           NATIONAL ADULT EDUCATION AND FAMILY LITERACY WEEK\n\n  Mr. REID.
