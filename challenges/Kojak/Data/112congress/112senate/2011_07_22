Mr. President, in about an hour we will vote on the \nRepublicans' so-called cap, cut, and balance legislation. As I have \nsaid before--in fact, just a few minutes ago--this is one of the worst \npieces of legislation to ever be placed on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate. It violates the spirit of our Constitution and certainly what \nwe are trying to accomplish here in Washington, and we as a Senate \nrefuse to waste even one more day on this piece of legislation.\n  We have 11 days left until the United States simply stops paying its \nbills, and, frankly, we have wasted too much time already. The U.S. \nHouse of Representatives needs to know this legislation has expired. It \nis gone.\n  Republicans wanted a vote on their radical plan to kill Medicare and \nSocial Security before they would consider helping Democrats avert this \ncrisis. In an hour, they will get that chance. At least one of the \nRepublican Senators went over to a large gathering in the House of \nRepresentatives,\n\n[[Page S4814]]\n\nI am told, and said: We are going to get at least 60 votes.\n  Please, Mr. President.\n  Their extreme plan would, within 25 years, cut in half every Federal \nbenefit on the books, including Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, \nmilitary pay, veterans' benefits, and much more. Meanwhile, it would \nerect constitutional protections for hundreds of billions of dollars in \nspecial interest tax breaks to oil companies, corporations that ship \njobs overseas, and millionaires and billionaires who are able to buy \nthose yachts and corporate jets for which they get tax benefits.\n  Republicans have demanded we pass this radical proposal before they \nwill even consider cooperating with Democrats to avert a default crisis \nthat would rock the global financial markets. They are, in effect, \nholding this Nation's economy hostage and demanding the death of \nMedicare and Social Security as its ransom. But we all know their \nfailed prescription will fail in the U.S. Senate. They do not have the \nvotes to pass a plan that would balance the budget on the backs of \nseniors and middle-class families while protecting unfair tax breaks \nfor millionaires and billionaires.\n  So we must move on, Mr. President. And I want to be very, very clear: \nThere is simply no more time to waste debating and voting on measures \nthat have no hopes of becoming law. We have no more time to waste \nplaying partisan games. As the saying goes, indecision becomes decision \nwith time. Our time is running out before this gridlock--this refusal \nby the other side to move even an inch toward compromise--becomes a \ndecision to default on our debt. The markets are already reacting to \nour inaction. Every responsible voice, including those of my Republican \ncolleagues--many of them, at least--has warned that much worse is to \ncome if we do not take action and take it soon. That is a risk we \ncannot afford to take.\n  So I ask my Republican colleagues again to join Democrats in seeking \ncommon ground. The American people have demanded it of us. \nOverwhelmingly, they have said a national default is a serious \nproblem--and that is an understatement--and that both parties in \nCongress must meet in the middle.\n  We all know there are talks going on between President Obama and \nSpeaker Boehner. I wish them well. We await their efforts. What I am \ntold, there will be revenue measures in that. If that is the case, we \nknow constitutionally the matter must start in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  I say to both the President and to the Speaker here on the Senate \nfloor, representing my Democrats--and I am confident many Republicans--\nbe very careful. Show a lot of caution as this negotiation goes forward \nbecause any arrangement must be fair to all of America, not just the \nwealthy.\n  Would the Chair announce the proceedings for this morning.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/22/senate-section/article/S4814-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4814]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 10 a.m. shall be equally divided and controlled between the two \nleaders or their designees.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, in about an hour, we are going to vote on \na package that was sent to this body by the House of Representatives.\n  Let me first comment on the context within which we consider this \nlegislation. I think it is very important to remind our colleagues and \nremind citizens across the country who are perhaps watching and \nlistening that our country is borrowing more than 40 cents of every $1 \nwe spend. That is unsustainable. It cannot be continued for long.\n  I think all of us know that the circumstance we are in is \nextraordinarily serious. Here is what the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff told us just a year ago:\n\n       Our national debt is our biggest national security threat.\n\n  I believe that is the case. Our gross debt now is approaching 100 \npercent of the gross domestic product of the United States. We have not \nseen a debt that high since after World War II. It is extraordinarily \nimportant that we take on this debt threat. It is extraordinarily \nimportant for our country's future economic well-being that we change \ncourse.\n  The legislation that has been sent to us by the House is one of the \nmost ill-considered, ill-conceived, internally inconsistent pieces of \nlegislation I have seen in my 25 years in the U.S. Senate. It has all \nthe earmarks of something that was hastily thrown together, really \npasted together.\n  This legislation includes an amendment to the Constitution of the \nUnited States. We are better than this. The Congress is better than \nthis. Certainly, the country is better than this. Let me just be brief.\n  The fundamental problems with this balanced budget amendment are as \nfollows: One, it restricts the ability to respond to economic \ndownturns, having all the potential to make an economic downturn even \nmore serious. It uses Social Security funds to calculate balance and \nsubjects that important program to the same cuts as other Federal \nspending, even though it is funded separately. It shifts the ultimate \ndecisions on budgeting in this country to unelected and unaccountable \njudges. Finally, it requires a State ratification process that could \ntake years to complete. We need a long-term debt resolution now, not in \nthe sweet by-and-by.\n  The proposal before us has all of the potential to turn a recession \ninto a depression. Why do I say that? Because it would prevent Congress \nfrom taking urgent action to provide lift to the economy in the midst \nof a severe economic downturn.\n  Here is what Norman Ornstein, a distinguished scholar at the American \nEnterprise Institute, said about this:\n\n       Few ideas are more seductive on the surface and more \n     destructive in reality than a balanced budget amendment [to \n     the constitution]. Here is why: Nearly all our states have \n     balanced budget requirements. That means when the economy \n     slows, states are forced to raise taxes or slash spending at \n     just the wrong time, providing a fiscal drag when what is \n     needed is countercyclical policy to stimulate the economy. In \n     fact, the fiscal drag from the states in 2009-2010 was barely \n     countered by the federal stimulus plan. That meant the \n     federal stimulus provided was nowhere near what was needed \n     but far better than doing nothing. Now imagine that scenario \n     with a federal drag instead.\n\n  The Washington Post editorialized:\n\n       Worse yet, the latest version [of the balanced budget \n     amendment] would impose an absolute cap on spending as a \n     share of the economy. It would prevent federal expenditures \n     from exceeding 18 percent of the gross domestic product in \n     any year. Most unfortunately, the amendment lacks a clause \n     letting the government exceed that limit to strengthen a \n     struggling economy.\n\n  That has all of the potential to turn a recession into a depression.\n  Two of this country's most distinguished economists, Alan Blinder, \nformer Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve, and Mark Zandi, former \nconsultant, adviser to Senator McCain in his Presidential campaign, \nevaluated the government response to the last downturn. Their \nconclusion: Absent that Federal response, we would have had ``Great \nDepression 2.0.'' The legislation before us would have prevented that \nFederal response.\n  They call this legislation cut, cap, and balance. They misnamed it. \nThey should have called it ``cut, cap, and kill Medicare'' because that \nis precisely what it would do. Why do I say that? Because when I \nreferred earlier to the inconsistency of this legislation, this is what \nI was referring to. They have two different spending caps in the \nlegislation before us. In one part of the legislation, they say the \nspending cap would take spending from 24.1 percent of GDP to 19.9 \npercent. That is in one part of the bill before us. In another part of \nthe bill--the constitutional amendment--they say the spending cap would \nbe 18 percent of GDP. So I do not know who cooked this up, but you \nwould think they would have at least gotten on the same page as to what \nis the limitation on spending.\n  What does it mean if you have a balanced budget amendment with a cap \nof\n\n[[Page S4815]]\n\n18 percent of GDP? Here is what it means--by the way, the \nconstitutional provision would certainly trump the conflicting \nprovision that is in this legislation. So the cap would not be 19 \npercent of GDP, the cap would not be 19.9, it would be 18 percent of \nGDP. What would that mean? Well, this dotted black line is 18 percent \nof GDP. If you fund just Social Security, defense and other nonhealth \nspending, and interest on the debt, you are at 18 percent of GDP. There \nis not a dime left for Medicare. There is not a dime left for Medicaid. \nIs that really what they intend? It must be because that is what it \nsays. So Medicare is finished. Medicaid is finished. Anybody who votes \nfor this ought to understand what they are voting to do.\n  Here is a former top economic adviser to President Reagan. Here is \nwhat he said about the amendment that is before us:\n\n       In short, this is quite possibly the stupidest \n     constitutional amendment I think I have ever seen. It looks \n     like it was drafted by a couple of interns on the back of a \n     napkin. Every Senator cosponsoring this legislation should be \n     ashamed of themselves.\n\n  That is a former top economic adviser to Ronald Reagan.\n  I have been here 25 years. I don't think I have ever seen a piece of \nlegislation more unprofessionally constructed than the legislation \nbefore us.\n  But those are not the only problems. When they titled this ``cut, \ncap, and balance,'' they could have also called it ``preserve, protect, \nand defend tax havens and tax shelters'' because that is the other \nconsequence of this legislation. Why do I say that? Because it would \ntake a two-thirds vote to increase revenue--a two-thirds vote. That \nmeans attempts to shut down these offshore tax havens, these abusive \ntax shelters--because they would raise revenue--would take a two-thirds \nvote.\n  What does that mean? Well, here is a little building down in the \nCayman Islands. I have talked about this many times. It is a little 5-\nstory building that claims to be home to 18,857 companies. They claim \nthey are doing business out of this little building. I have said this \nis the most efficient building in the world. Quite remarkable that \n18,857 companies are doing business out of this little 5-story \nbuilding. I am told there are not many people coming and going from \nthis building during the day.\n  Are 18 companies really doing their business--they call this \n``headquarters.'' Is that really their headquarters? We all know that \nis not their headquarters. We all know what is going on. It is not \nbusiness; it is monkey business. What they are doing down there is \navoiding the taxes all the rest of us pay.\n  This amendment would protect this scheme. You want to protect this \nscheme, vote for this amendment. How big is this scheme? Well, here is \nwhat our own Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations has told us:\n\n       Experts have estimated that the total loss to the Treasury \n     from offshore tax evasion alone approaches $100 billion a \n     year, including $40 billion to $70 billion from individuals \n     and another $30 billion from corporations engaging in \n     offshore tax evasion. Abusive tax shelters add tens of \n     billions of dollars more.\n\n  You want to lock in these abuses? You prefer to pay more in taxes \nyourself so that people can engage in these scams? Vote for this \namendment. Vote for the legislation that is before us. Vote for what is \non the floor because you will protect them forever more.\n  I end as I began. This is perhaps the most ill-conceived, ill-\nconsidered, internally inconsistent legislation I have ever seen in my \n25 years in the Senate. I hope my colleagues have the wisdom to vote \nno.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Indiana.\n\n\n               Honoring the 88th Birthday of Robert Dole\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I would like this Chamber to know that \ntoday marks the 88th birthday of one of the great Members of this \nSenate body, a true American hero, former majority leader Bob Dole.\n  As I reflected on the extraordinary life he has led--I had the \nprivilege of serving under him as a Senator and working with him in the \nprivate sector, getting to know him and his wife--I could not help but \nnote that the leadership he provided in comparison to the lack of \nleadership that is being provided in this body now stands in great \ncontrast. There is an absence of leadership and seriousness of purpose \nthat Bob Dole would never have allowed had he been majority leader.\n  I say that because I come to the floor today greatly troubled by the \nremarks that were made here in this Senate yesterday and again this \nmorning by the majority leader regarding the bill that is before us.\n  The issue here takes two tracks, one of which is the content of the \namendment and the bill that is before us that was voted on by the House \nof Representatives, passed by the House of Representatives, and sent \nover for us to debate and pass. We can disagree--and I think there has \nbeen some misrepresentation of what this bill actually does--we can \ndisagree about the contents of it, but we have an obligation and a \nresponsibility to debate those contents and to put every Member of this \nbody in a position of saying ``yea'' or ``nay'' on amendments that \nmight be offered to improve it or to change it or to modify it and, \nfinally, whether to support it or not support it. The vote here this \nmorning denies us that opportunity. This is a vote on a motion to \ntable.\n  You know, there are a couple of definitions of ``table''--more than a \ncouple. One of those is getting to the table to negotiate something, \njust as the NFL players and owners are doing and, much more seriously \nand with many more consequences to the future of this country, what we \nought to be doing--putting it on the table, debating it, addressing it, \nexpressing your support or nonsupport, defending it, characterizing, \nmischaracterizing. That is what this body is about. It is the world's \ngreatest deliberative body, and we are deciding not to deliberate this \nbill at all.\n  The second definition of ``table'' is taking it off the table. So the \nmajority leader has said: I am not going to allow you to debate it. I \nam not going to allow amendments. I am not going to allow up-or-down \nvotes so the American people know where we are.\n  This is a motion to table, so we don't even have the opportunity to \ndebate it.\n  It was the majority leader himself who said: We are going to be in \nsession every day until we get this settled. Now he comes down here and \nsays: I am not going to waste 1 more day on this. Yet there is nothing \non the agenda. Senators who were told to be here every day, that there \nwill be a vote on Saturday, are now told: We are having a vote this \nmorning--on Friday at 10 o'clock--and then you can go home for the \nweekend. He hasn't even told us when we need to come back. What kind of \na contradiction is that? What kind of leadership is that? We don't know \nwhether we are supposed to be here or are not supposed to be here. Are \nwe supposed to be debating what is happening with one of the most \nserious crisis we are facing, that the country has ever seen? \nParticularly in the financial area, it is the most serious, perhaps \nexcept for the Great Depression. And we are told we do not even have \ntime to debate this, that this is a waste of time.\n  I quote the unbelievable statement that has been made by the majority \nleader:\n\n       This piece of legislation is about as weak and senseless as \n     anything that has ever come on this Senate floor.\n\n  Really? I can spend half an hour talking about senseless legislation, \negregious legislation, discriminatory legislation that has come to this \nfloor and been debated and not just tabled. To characterize the serious \nefforts of the Members of the House of Representatives and the Members \nof the Senate, including some Democratic Members, to try to fix this \nproblem--to characterize that as ``senseless and wasteful''--``I am not \ngoing to spend one more day of time,'' he said, ``on this senseless \nlegislation.''\n  I thought on reflection the majority leader would come here this \nmorning and say: Perhaps I overstated the problem. Let me better \nexplain where I think we are, where we need to go.\n\n  But, no, he comes down and he doubles down this morning--doubles \ndown--and says: ``It is a very, very bad piece of legislation.'' \n``Without merit.'' ``It gets in the way.'' It gets in the way? We are \ntalking about dealing with cutting spending that we know we cannot \nafford. We talk about putting some caps on it so we don't keep doing \nthis in the future, so we have a path to\n\n[[Page S4816]]\n\nfiscal responsibility. We are talking about a balanced budget so we \nlive within our means. That is getting in the way?\n  This body has failed its responsibility to be faithful to the \nConstitution and faithful to the people of America. As a consequence of \nthat, we are sitting here saying we are not even going to debate \nsomething that was brought forward with hundreds, if not thousands of \nhours of effort. Maybe you don't like it, and maybe you don't agree \nwith it. Well, stand up and say so and tell us what you want to do \nabout it.\n  The majority leader and his party have not brought one piece of \nlegislation to this floor. The President of the United States has not \noffered one proposal in writing that we can work with. We have not had \nthe opportunity to debate for 1 minute anything the other side has \noffered. So we bring something forward, and it is called a ``worthless \npiece of junk.'' Is that what the American people sent us here to do?\n  I came here to find a result to the dire fiscal situation our people \nare in, and the majority leader comes down here and says we are not \nresponding to the will of the people. Where has he been? What planet is \nhe on? Responding to the will of the people? They are sick and tired of \ngovernment spending more than it has. They are sick and tired of being \ntold they are handing over debts to their children that are never going \nto be repaid. And we are told that we want to take this off the table \nso we can't even debate it.\n  I woke up in the middle of the night so frustrated and so angry after \nspending last evening saying I am hopeful that we can come together and \nwork something out, and the well gets poisoned last evening by the \nmajority leader and gets poisoned again this morning. Those of us who \nhave worked our tails off to try to get something done are told this is \na piece of junk. That is not what I came here to do. That is not what \nwe came here to do.\n  I didn't come here to get mad this morning. But I am just tired of \nthis stuff that goes on around here. When Democrats and Republicans--\nand the majority leader knows it--are meeting in back rooms together, \nsigning letters together to the President to ask him to step up--32 \nDemocrats and 32 Republicans--the President ignores that and does \nnothing until the very end, and he comes here and says: Look at me. I \ntook care of everything.\n  America is worried to death about the future. To say we haven't done \nanything except put forward a worthless piece of legislation--it is so \nworthless we are not even going to allow you to talk about it or debate \nit, we are not allowing amendments to take place, we are not going to \ngive it the respect it is due. So if you do not like it, come down here \nand tell us you do not like it, and let's have a vote on why you do not \nlike it instead of just simply saying: Take it off the table.\n  I guess we are all getting frustrated. There is a 100-and-some degree \nheat index outside. I can understand people getting worked up about all \nof this sort of thing. But the future of America is at stake. This \nmajority leader is not allowing us to deal with it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I stand here today as a cosponsor of the \ncut, cap, and balance legislation and as a supporter of that \nlegislation. Here is the insanity that has gripped not only this body \nbut all of Washington. We are literally in here where we will have the \nthird year in a row of deficits over $1 trillion.\n  In fact, current projections are that this annual deficit will set a \nrecord--a very dubious record, I might add--of $1.6 trillion-plus. We \nwere promised 3 years ago if this enormous, gargantuan effort to force \nmore spending into the economy with the stimulus plan were passed, that \ntrillion-dollar effort would put this country on a path to recovery. It \nhas done nothing except raise our debt and pass the problem on to our \nchildren and grandchildren.\n  After weeks and months of work on an idea to rein in the spending and \nto come to grips with where we are in this country, we are literally at \na point where, within minutes, we will vote on a motion to table that \neffort. We will be right back to where we are today. We will be right \nback to a situation where we will face trillion-dollar deficits. We \nwill be right back to a situation where every economist in the world is \ntelling the United States of America--the largest economy--that its \nspending is not sustainable. We will be right back to rating agencies \nlooking at our government debt and saying: You have not come up with a \nplan to rein this in, so you are being targeted to be downgraded.\n  What we are really right back to is this: We have a government that \nis too big. We have too many promises that have been made, where no one \nhad any idea how they would be paid for. By the end of the year, we \nwill have a deficit of $15 trillion, which is significantly \nunderstated. In 4 more years, we will have a debt of $20 trillion, \nwhich will still be significantly understated. Somehow there are \nMembers of this body who are arguing that this is a better way--to \ntable cut, cap, and balance so we can return to where we are today.\n  Is it any wonder that those of us who are concerned about this and \nconcerned about the future of our children and grandchildren are coming \nto the floor and saying: Wait a minute. This is destroying our Nation.\n  Mr. President, I have risen today, as I have many times over the last \ndays, to say: Support this effort. Support cut, cap, and balance. I am \npleased to be a cosponsor of this very important legislation which has \nthe potential to change the direction of what we are doing. I am going \nto be one of the people who support this legislation.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I echo the comments of my colleagues from \nNebraska and Indiana who have expressed their support for the cut, cap, \nand balance approach to dealing with our debt crisis. It had 234 votes \nin the House, and it is the only plan out there.\n  As my colleague from Indiana said, the Democratic leadership in the \nSenate has yet to produce a plan that will meaningfully deal with the \ngreatest crisis our country has faced in my service in the Congress; \nthat is, this massive, out-of-control debt the Senator from Nebraska \npointed out which could lead to much higher interest rates along the \nlines of what we are seeing in some of the European countries, which \nwould absolutely crush this economy.\n  If we are serious about growing the economy and creating jobs, we \nhave to get Federal spending under control. We need a smaller Federal \neconomy and a larger private economy. What has been happening since \nthis President took office is that we continue to grow government. We \nhave added 35 percent to the debt. Spending has increased by 24 \npercent--non-national security discretionary spending--at a time when \ninflation was 2 percent. Federal spending has been growing at 10 times \nthe rate of inflation. The number of people receiving food stamps has \ngone up by 40 percent. The unemployment rate is up by 18 percent, and \n2.1 million more people are unemployed today than when this President \ntook office.\n  The policies of this administration are not working when it comes to \ngetting people back to work and getting spending and debt under \ncontrol.\n  I was listening to my colleague from North Dakota with great interest \nwhen he was here earlier denouncing the whole idea of a balanced budget \namendment--like it was coming from some foreign planet. He talked about \nhow ill-conceived and ill-considered and stupid this approach is--cut, \ncap, and balance.\n  Well, my observation about that is, the failure of the Democrats to \nproduce a budget in over 800 days is exhibit No. 1 for why we need a \nbalanced budget amendment. We ought to be embarrassed in Washington, \nDC; we are not doing the people's work; we have not passed a budget in \nover 800 days. Yet the other side comes down here and denounces the \nidea of a balanced budget amendment, which all 49 States have some form \nof, that requires them to balance their budgets every single year.\n  My colleague from North Dakota knows that. His State has it and my \nState of South Dakota has it. It is a very straightforward concept that \nthe people of this country clearly understand.\n  Now, he takes issue with the way this particular balanced budget \namendment is written. Fine. Come up with your\n\n[[Page S4817]]\n\nown proposal. But don't suggest that having a constitutional amendment \nthat requires this place to do something that it hasn't been doing for \nthe last 25 or 30 years is literally a bad idea. What we have today is \ndysfunctional. It is broken. It doesn't work for the American people. \nIt is an embarrassment. That is why we need to put something on the \nbooks that will impose a discipline on this Congress to get spending \nand debt back under control and help us do something about the runaway \ndebt that is putting a crushing burden on future generations of \nAmericans.\n  If you don't like this balanced budget amendment and think the cut, \ncap, and balance proposal is not prescriptive about this particular \nbalanced budget amendment that many of us are cosponsors of, then come \nup with another one. But let's put something in place that enshrines a \nresponsibility and obligation and a requirement for us to live within \nour means every single year.\n  We cannot continue to spend money we don't have. We have demonstrated \nyear after year around here that we continue to add more and more and \nmore to this debt. Under the President's budget proposal, that debt \nwould have doubled in the next decade. That is why I think when his \nbudget proposal was put on the floor of the Senate it got zero votes. \nNot a single Democrat or Republican voted in favor of what this \nPresident put forward in his budget submission earlier this year.\n  Since that time there has been an absolute lack of leadership out of \nthe White House. The President has been completely missing in action. \nThe Democratic leadership has put forward no plan of their own. We have \nin front of us something that achieved majority support in the House a \nfew nights ago when 234 Members of the House voted for this proposal. \nIt is a serious, meaningful effort to cut spending now, cap it in \nfuture years, and put in place a balanced budget amendment which is \nlong overdue and, frankly, if it had passed 15 years ago in the Senate, \nwe would not be in the position we are today. It failed by a single \nvote--one vote--in the Senate in 1997.\n  I cannot help but think how much better off we would be today in \nterms of the spending situation had we gotten the necessary two-thirds \nvote in 1997. But it is never too late to do the right thing. We have \nan opportunity to do that today.\n  To hear our colleagues on the other side get up and belittle the \neffort that has been made by a lot of people who are trying to do \nsomething about a problem that will wreck this country if we don't fix \nit is not befitting of this institution.\n  This is going to be a tabling motion instead of a debate on cut, cap, \nand balance because my colleagues have decided this isn't worthy of \nconsideration on the floor of the Senate. I think it is a terrible \nreflection on this institution, when something is brought forward in \ngood faith--a serious, meaningful effort to address spending and debt \nand to put this country back on a sustainable fiscal course--and we are \nnot even going to debate it. We are going to have a tabling motion in a \nfew minutes.\n  I hope my colleagues will defeat that motion and allow us to continue \nto debate this proposal and get an up-or-down vote on what will \nmeaningfully address the problems this country faces.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, unlike any Republican in the House or the \nSenate, I have voted for a balanced budget. We balanced the budget \nunder President Clinton. Not only balanced the budget, started paying \ndown the national debt. He was able to leave hundreds of billions of \ndollars in surplus to his successor, who determined with Republican \nvotes to go to war in Iraq and pay for the war with a tax cut. That is \nwhy we had to borrow the money from China and Saudi Arabia. Not a \nsingle Republican voted for a real balanced budget when they had a \nchance to. In fact, it passed the Senate only because Vice President \nGore came and broke the tie.\n  I was proud to have voted for that balanced budget. Not a gimmick, \nbut a real balanced budget. We had to actually make tough choices. We \ndid it. We balanced it. We had a surplus.\n  When we talk about amending our Nation's fundamental charter, the \nConstitution of the United States, it is not something Congress and the \nAmerican people should feel forced to do in the face of a financial \ncrisis. I take seriously my senatorial oath to support and defend the \nConstitution.\n  I know there are a lot of pressure groups demanding that elected \nrepresentatives sign pledges about what they will and will not do. The \npledge I follow, which is the one I was honored to make again at the \nbeginning of this Congress, is to uphold the Constitution. That is what \nI intend to do as I represent the people of Vermont.\n  The House-passed bill, H.R. 2560, which the Senate is now \nconsidering, claims to impose a balanced budget on future Congresses, \nbut it doesn't even contain the proposed constitutional amendment that \nsupporters are seeking to adopt. Nor did the bill pass with two-thirds \nof the Republican-controlled House voting in favor.\n  That threshold is what is required for us to pass a constitutional \namendment. The House vote was more than 50 votes short of that \nnecessary number.\n  The process by which this bill has been brought to the floor of the \nSenate is an affront to the Constitution that we are sworn to protect \nand defend. Instead, the House still denies authority needed to meet \nthe Nation's obligations until Congress passes a type of constitutional \namendment that will actually make it more difficult for us to reduce \nour national debt. That kind of constitutional blackmail has no place \nin our democracy, no place in our laws.\n  I wonder whether anyone who respects the Constitution can support \nsuch an approach. Here is the convoluted language the House bill \nincludes about an amendment to our Constitution:\n\n       H.J. Res. 1 in the form reported on June 23, 2011, S.J. Res \n     10 in the form introduced on March 31, 2011, or H.J. Res. 56 \n     in the form introduced on April 7, 2011, a balanced budget \n     amendment to the Constitution, or a similar amendment if it \n     requires that total outlays not exceed total receipts, that \n     contains a spending limitation as a percentage of GDP, and \n     requires that tax increases be approved by a two-thirds vote \n     in both Houses of Congress.\n\n  The Founders didn't include a constitutional requirement for a \nbalanced budget or a prohibition against incurring debt in our \nConstitution. They knew full well that would have been foolish, \ndangerous, and self-defeating for the Nation they were seeking to \nestablish.\n  I respect the wisdom of the Founders and will uphold the \nConstitution, which has served this Nation so well for the last 223 \nyears. Let's not be so vain as to think we know better than the \nFounders what the Constitution should prescribe.\n  I reject the notion that for political reasons we need to rush \nconsideration of an ill-conceived and evolving proposal for a \nconstitutional amendment. I will stand with the Founders. I will defend \ntheir work and our Constitution, and I will oppose the proposed series \nof constitutional amendments, which, incidentally, haven't even had a \nhearing.\n  Have we forgotten how the Revolutionary War was financed? Have we \nforgotten how the national government took on the debt of the states \nafter the Revolutionary War? Have we forgotten that in 1792, just four \nyears after the ratification of the Constitution, the budget deficit \nwas 38 percent of revenues? Have we forgotten how President Jefferson \nfinanced the Louisiana Purchase expanding the country westward? Do we \nnot remember what happened during the Civil War, how we emerged from \nthe Great Depression, and won World War II? Do we not even recall that \nduring the administration of the last Democratic President, we had \nbalanced the budget after defeating a proposed constitutional amendment \nand were reducing the deficit with billions of surpluses?\n  Amendments to the Constitution of the United States are permanent. \nThey are not bills or resolutions that can be abandoned or fixed. They \nare not just a bumper sticker or a sound bite. Each word matters to \nhundreds of millions of Americans and future generations.\n  I have never seen--and I have been here 37 years--the solemn duty of \nprotecting the Constitution treated in such a cavalier manner. I wish \nthose who so often say they revere the Constitution would show it the \nrespect it deserves rather than treating it like a blog entry.\n\n[[Page S4818]]\n\n  We have already seen scores of proposed constitutional amendments on \nbudgetary matters. None has been adopted and for good reason. The \nSenate amendment referenced in the House bill is one of approximately \n60 proposed so far this Congress. It remains a moving target, not a \nfinished product worthy of consideration as an addition to our \nfundamental charter. The House bill itself proposed three different \nconstitutional amendments and a catchall to include some proposal not \nyet introduced. Last night some members claimed that this catchall \nsomehow allows flexibility. If we are going to limit the authority on \nthe debt ceiling by requiring a constitutional amendment, there should \nnot be ambiguity in what the amendment would actually do to hardworking \nAmericans. This shows the lack of seriousness with which Republicans \nhave approached this entire matter.\n  These partisan constitutional amendment proposals are inconsistent \nwith the views of our Founding Fathers. George Washington did not want \nour Constitution to constrain the national government from being able \nto respond to events as warranted. He led this Nation into being and \nknew that financial constraints had no place in the Constitution. The \nConstitution expressly provides for the power ``to borrow money on the \ncredit of the United States'' and for Congress ``to lay and collect \ntaxes'' and duties and ``to pay the debts and provide for the general \nwelfare of the United States.'' That is what Congress has been required \nto do since the outset and that is our responsibility today. We should \nbe acting without further delay to preserve the credit of the United \nStates and to provide for our people.\n  The proposed amendments are also inconsistent with the views of \nAlexander Hamilton, a key author of the Federalist Papers and the \ncreator of the American financial system that allowed us to become the \ngreatest economic engine in the history of the world. The United States \nwas born in debt, of course, and debt has been needed to fund some of \nAmerica's greatest chapters. Hamilton even termed national debt at \ntimes ``a national blessing.'' The Constitution allows for the Federal \nGovernment to borrow money at certain times, for wars, infrastructure \nbuilding, and economic bad times. That fiscal policy can help drive \ndevelopment and unite the Nation. It should not be turned into a \ndivisive wedge against the least powerful among us.\n  I am concerned this is another example of how some in recent years \nhave sought to impose their view by unilateral objection to compromise \nwith minority obstruction. That has, at times, seemed to be the rule in \nthe last few years. Some have tried to undermine the legitimacy of \nPresident Obama. Filibusters and requirements for supermajorities have \nbecome routine. They have stymied congressional action on behalf of the \nAmerican people.\n  This year should be a cautionary tale that convinces all Americans \nthat the risks of default and ideological impasses to them, to interest \nrates, to financial markets, and to our household budgets are too \ngreat. We need only recall the game of chicken some played with the \ngovernment shutdown earlier this year. The threat to push the United \nStates into default on its obligations for the first time in our \nhistory is wrong. It is made possible by rules that empower a partisan \nminority.\n\n  I cannot help but think if we don't take the steps we should, we will \nsee our interest rates go up. We will spend hundreds of billions of \ndollars in extra interest to China, which they can spend on \ninfrastructure, medical research and education, but we won't have it \nhere in the United States. That is what the other side seems to want.\n  We saw this before, in 1996, when a Government shutdown and a debt \nlimit crisis went on for months as part of a partisan ``train wreck'' \nintended to extort President Clinton. It is happening, again, this year \nas some seek to gain political advantage over President Obama. The \ncreditworthiness of the United States is too important to be sacrificed \nfor partisan political advantage but that is what is being threatened. \nIndeed, this House-passed bill, with its proposed constitutional \namendments, makes that more likely, not less.\n  Charles Fried, President Reagan's Solicitor General, said a few years \nago that supermajority requirements ``are against the spirit and genius \nof our Constitution, which is a charter for democracy; that is, for \nmajority rule.'' He was right then, when the Senate rejected an earlier \nconstitutional amendment on budgetary matters, and that truth remains \nthe same today.\n  We have seen the danger that irresponsible brinksmanship promotes. We \nshould guard against building into the Constitution a supermajority \nrequirement for fiscal policy. That invites political blackmail and \ngridlock. We have seen enough of that already.\n  I suggest that Congress should not subject our ability to govern to \nany greater hurdles that would empower the tyranny of the minority on \neconomic policy. Instead of hamstringing Congress with more \nsupermajority requirements, we should be looking for ways to increase \nour ability to take necessary action to deal with a fast changing and \nincreasingly interdependent global economy.\n  The source of our budgetary problems does not lie with the \nConstitution. The Constitution remains sound. What is lacking is the \npolitical judgment and the courage to do what is right.\n  Having again sought to use the debt ceiling to create a political \ncrisis, congressional Republicans refuse to enact a program of shared \nsacrifice to put us on a better financial path. In fact, Senate \nRepublicans filibustered the debate of a resolution calling for such a \nplan.\n  It is telling that the Republican posture is now to require the \nConstitution to be amended.\n  The last time we balanced the budget, not a single Republican voted \nfor that balanced budget, and yet it created enormous surpluses. These \nproposed constitutional amendments will not cut a single dime of debt \nfrom the Federal budget. Rather than deal with our problems, some want \nto require that we deface the Constitution with a measure that will, by \nits own terms, not be effective for 5 years, if it were to be adopted \nby two-thirds of both Houses of Congress and then ratified by three-\nfourths of the States. Put another way, that is at least three election \ncycles from now. They get their bumper stickers today, but kick the can \ndown the road for three election cycles.\n  Economists have noted that all of the last five Democratic Presidents \nhave reduced public debt as a share of GDP. The last four Republican \nPresidents did the opposite with the country's indebtedness increasing \nduring their administrations. During President Reagan and Bush's \nadministrations the Federal debt more than tripled. During the Clinton \nadministration, budgets were balanced and we were paying down the debt \nfrom the budget surplus being generated. Then, during the \nadministration of George W. Bush the debt nearly doubled again to more \nthan $10 trillion dollars.\n  We should not amend our Nation's fundamental charter of liberty to \ninclude arbitrary and inflexible requirements in order to look tough on \nspending, but without regard to the consequences.\n  A respected Republican Senator from Oregon, Mark Hatfield, had it \nright 15 years ago when he said that a ``balanced budget comes only \nthrough leadership and compromise.''\n  In 1992, the Senate and House took the hard votes to enact a \nbudgetary plan that led us to a balanced budget and budget surpluses \nduring President Clinton's time in office. Not a single congressional \nRepublican supported the plan. They favored talking about \nconstitutional amendments then, as well. The balance we achieved was \nlater squandered by the next President, as his policies also wreaked \nhavoc with the financial sector and threatened the entire economy. The \nnear meltdown of the financial markets during the last year of the Bush \nadministration and the resulting recession threatened to drive our \neconomy and that of the world into depression just 3 years ago. \nPresident Obama and the Congress responded to pull it back from the \nbrink.\n  In a recent editorial, USA Today put it this way:\n\n       [A] funny thing happened after that amendment failed in \n     1997. Thanks to prior deficit-reduction deals and a strong \n     economy, the federal government ran a surplus in 1998 and for \n     the next three years. Then an economic downturn, huge tax \n     cuts, two unfunded wars and unfunded expansion of Medicare \n     plunged the budget back into the red, where it has been ever \n     since.\n\n[[Page S4819]]\n\n       The moral is, Congress doesn't need a constitutional \n     amendment to balance the budget. It just needs the will to do \n     it and the willingness to compromise over how. But rather \n     than make the tough decisions about spending cuts and revenue \n     increases, it's always easier to vote for a balanced budget \n     amendment.\n\n  I will ask that copies of this and other editorials and opinion \npieces from leading newspapers be printed in the Record.\n  The House-passed bill is an end-run around the Constitution's \nrequirements for amendment. It does not have the required support of \ntwo-thirds of even the House Chamber. Equally important, it is not \nnecessary. Congress has the power now to take steps to avoid a \ngovernment default and get us on the path to balancing the budget, just \nas we did at the end of the Clinton administration. This debate is a \ndistraction from the hard work and hard choices that need to be made.\n  The good news is that we do not need to amend the Constitution to \nbalance the budget. Never have. Never will.\n  The proposed constitutional amendments would also perpetuate bad \npolicy. They are intended to enshrine tax breaks for millionaires and \nwealthy corporations. It is no wonder that Alexander Hamilton described \nsupermajority vote requirements as ``poison.'' We need a balanced \napproach to fix the deficit problem. We cannot merely cut our way to \nbalance any more than eliminating congressional earmarks will balance \nthe budget. We will need to close the most egregious tax loopholes and \neveryone will have to sacrifice and contribute their fair share.\n  There should be no mistake: The proposed amendments to the \nConstitution are not just unnecessary, they are unwise, unsound, and \ndangerous. In my view, the House-passed bill and the proposed \namendments it requires demeans our Constitution. Never in our history \nhave we amended the Constitution--the work of our Founders--to impose \nbudgetary restrictions or to require supermajorities for passing \nlegislation. Yet now we are saying: Let's do it on a whim. Let's do it \nwithout any hearings. Let's do it because we can do it.\n  It would for the first time enshrine minority rule and undermine our \nconstitutional democracy. It will destabilize the separation of powers \namong our three branches of Government and put into the hands of \nbureaucrats and judges the fiscal policy of the United States.\n  Who is to decide what the ``GDP'' was for a particular time period, \nwhat is to be included and what is not? How often do those estimates \nand artificial constructs get revised? Since when do economic surveys \nand extrapolations become embedded in the Constitution? What justifies \nthe constitutional permanence of the number 18, as opposed to 17 or \n18.5 or 20? Do we really want judges deciding whether an economics line \nwritten into the Constitution has been breached? What remedies could \njudges order if they find a breach? Who has standing to bring those \nchallenges? None of these questions has been adequately debated or \nconsidered.\n  Alternatively, we could end up with future Congresses having to slash \nSocial Security or Medicare or Medicaid, unable to respond to natural \ndisasters or national security emergencies. I note that the budget \nproposed this year by Representative Ryan and the House Republicans \nwith all its draconian cuts and the end of Medicare as we know it would \nnot satisfy this arbitrary limit. Nor would the budgets of President \nReagan. Consider whether we could witness future Congresses unable to \nmeet the arbitrary limit and going into violation of that unsound \nconstitutional prescription and the Constitution itself?\n  At the beginning of our Republic, the national Government took on the \ndebts of the States. These proposed constitutional amendments are a \nrecipe for pushing costs and responsibilities onto the states. And \ndoing so at a time when State governments need our help, not more unmet \nneeds.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee has considered several balanced budget \namendments over the years. The Senate proposal this year is even more \nextreme than the version the Senate rejected in 1995 and again in 1997. \nIt is reckless and foolish to rush Senate consideration of such a \nradical proposal to change our Constitution, without process or \nconsideration.\n  All Senators swear an oath to ``support and defend the Constitution \nof the United States.'' That is our duty and responsibility. The \npending amendments to the Constitution threaten the constitutional \nprinciples that have sustained our democratic form of government for \nmore than 200 years. The Constitution allows America to flourish and \nadapt to new challenges. We have amended it only 17 times since the \nBill of Rights was added.\n  Our Constitution deserves protection. I stand with the Constitution \ntoday and I will support the motion to table this ill-conceived \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe materials to which I referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            [From USA Today]\n\n      Our View: Budget Amendment Wrong Vehicle for Right Principle\n\n       In 1997, the Senate came within a single vote of passing a \n     constitutional amendment mandating a balanced federal budget. \n     Backers made all the same arguments you'll hear today when \n     the House takes up a new version of the old elixir: An \n     amendment will finally force Congress to balance the budget, \n     we'll never have a balanced budget without one, and so on.\n       But a funny thing happened after that amendment failed in \n     1997. Thanks to prior deficit-reduction deals and a strong \n     economy, the federal government ran a surplus in 1998 and for \n     the next three years. Then an economic downturn, huge tax \n     cuts, two unfunded wars and an unfunded expansion of Medicare \n     plunged the budget back into the red, where it has been ever \n     since.\n       The moral is, Congress doesn't need a constitutional \n     amendment to balance the budget. It just needs the will to do \n     it and the willingness to compromise over how. But rather \n     than make the tough decisions about spending cuts and revenue \n     increases, it's always easier to vote for a balanced budget \n     amendment.\n       And not just any balanced budget amendment. Rather than \n     embrace the same legislation that almost passed in 1997 and \n     would surely attract Democratic votes this time around, \n     backers have made the latest version so extreme that it's \n     virtually certain not to pass both chambers of Congress, much \n     less the three-fourths of states required for ratification.\n       This new version--part of the Republicans' ``Cut, Cap and \n     Balance'' plan-- sets a permanent limit on spending equal to \n     18% of the economy, a level it hasn't achieved since 1966. \n     (The plan of conservative House Budget Committee Chairman \n     Paul Ryan, R-Wis., would leave spending at around 20% of GDP \n     for the next two decades as Baby Boomers retire.) Raising \n     taxes would require two-thirds of votes by the House and \n     Senate.\n       Reading between the lines, it's clear that many supporters \n     care less about cutting the deficit than about rewriting the \n     Constitution to embrace an economic theory that shrinks \n     government and makes it almost impossible to raise taxes.\n       Certainly, balancing the budget is a sound goal. We've been \n     supporting it in this space for more than 20 years. Congress \n     and successive presidents have demonstrated an inability to \n     match revenue and spending. Something has to be done to \n     change the incentives.\n       But the fatal flaw in virtually any balanced budget \n     amendment is that it ties the government's hands in times of \n     economic distress. When those sorts of crises hit, the \n     government needs to be able to move quickly to rescue major \n     financial institutions and deploy ``automatic stabilizers,'' \n     such as unemployment benefits and food stamps that steady the \n     economy until private-sector forces can create a recovery. \n     Failure to intervene caused the Great Depression of the \n     1930s, and had a balanced budget amendment been in place when \n     the financial crisis struck in 2008, there's no doubt at all \n     that we'd be living through another one now.\n       Backers also argue that because states have to balance \n     their budgets, the federal government should, too. But the \n     federal government has responsibilities the states don't, \n     most notably to protect national security. And when state \n     revenues collapse, the federal government serves as a \n     critical lifeline.\n       Preferable alternatives to a constitutional amendment \n     include pay-as-you-go requirements and firm spending caps \n     that require lawmakers to make choices, rather than run up \n     debt. But why make tough choices now when you can vote for a \n     gimmick that someday, maybe, would address the problem?\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 4, 2011]\n\n                   More Folly in the Debt Limit Talks\n\n       Congressional Republicans have opened a new front in the \n     deficit wars. In addition to demanding trillions of dollars \n     in spending cuts in exchange for raising the nation's debt \n     limit, they are now vowing not to act without first holding \n     votes in each chamber on a balanced budget amendment to the \n     Constitution.\n       The ploy is more posturing on an issue that has already \n     seen too much grandstanding. But it is posturing with a \n     dangerous purpose: to further distort the\n\n[[Page S4820]]\n\n     terms of the budget fight, and in the process, to entrench \n     the Republicans' no-new-taxes-ever stance.\n       It won't be enough for Democrats to merely defeat the \n     amendment when it comes up for a vote. If there is to be any \n     sensible deal to raise the debt limit, they also need to \n     rebut the amendment's false and dangerous premises--not an \n     easy task given the idea's populist appeal.\n       What could be more prudent than balancing the books every \n     year? In fact, forcibly balancing the federal budget each \n     year would be like telling families they cannot take out a \n     mortgage or a car loan, or do any other borrowing, no matter \n     how sensible the purchase or how creditworthy they may be.\n       Worse, the balanced budget amendment that Republicans put \n     on the table is far more extreme than just requiring the \n     government to spend no more than it takes in each year in \n     taxes.\n       The government would be forbidden from borrowing to finance \n     any spending, unless a supermajority agreed to the borrowing. \n     In addition to mandating a yearly balance, both the House and \n     Senate versions would cap the level of federal spending at 18 \n     percent of gross domestic product.\n       That would amount to a permanent limit on the size of \n     government--at a level last seen in the 1960s, before \n     Medicare and Medicaid, before major environmental legislation \n     like the Clean Water Act, and long before the baby-boom \n     generation was facing retirement. The spending cuts implied \n     by such a cap are so draconian that even the budget recently \n     passed by House Republicans--and condemned by the public for \n     its gutting of Medicare--would not be tough enough.\n       Under the proposed amendments, the spending cap would apply \n     even if the government collected enough in taxes to spend \n     above the limit, unless two-thirds of lawmakers voted to \n     raise the cap. More likely, antitax lawmakers would vote to \n     disburse the money via tax cuts. Once enacted, tax cuts would \n     be virtually irreversible, since a two-thirds vote in both \n     houses would be required to raise any new tax revenue. It \n     isn't easy to change the Constitution. First, two-thirds of \n     both the Senate and House must approve an amendment, and then \n     at least 38 states must ratify the change.\n       But expect to hear a lot about the idea in the days ahead \n     and in the 2012 political campaign, with Republicans eagerly \n     attacking Democrats who sensibly voted no.\n       Democrats, undeniably, have a tougher argument to make. A \n     fair and sustainable budget deal will require politically \n     unpopular choices on programs to cut and taxes to raise. \n     Americans deserve to hear the truth: There is no shortcut, no \n     matter what the Republicans claim. Nor is their urgency to \n     impose deep spending cuts now, while the economy is weak, as \n     Republicans are insisting.\n       What is needed is enactment of a thoughtful deficit-\n     reduction package, to be implemented as the economy recovers. \n     If politicians respect the voters enough to tell them the \n     truth, the voters may reward them at the polls.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 14, 2011]\n\n              A Balanced Budget Amendment Isn't the Answer\n\n                              (Editorial)\n\n       Amending the Constitution to require a balanced budget is a \n     bad idea that never dies. It's not surprising that the \n     current avalanche of debt has inspired renewed calls. Given \n     that the political system appears unable to discipline itself \n     not to spend more--trillions more--than it takes in, why not \n     tie lawmakers' hands to prevent them from piling ever more \n     debt on the national credit card?\n       The answer: The constitutional cure, while superficially \n     tempting, would be worse than the underlying disease. A \n     balanced-budget amendment would deprive policymakers of the \n     flexibility they need to address national security and \n     economic emergencies. It would revise the Constitution in a \n     way that would give dangerous power to a congressional \n     minority.\n       The latest push from lawmakers advocating the amendment is \n     to couple a vote on the proposal with an agreement to raise \n     the debt ceiling. On the surface, this argument seems benign \n     enough: Why not give states the chance to decide whether the \n     Constitution should mandate a balanced budget? But \n     policymakers have an independent responsibility to assess \n     whether an amendment is wise. This one, especially in its \n     latest incarnation, is not. It would require a two-thirds \n     vote in both houses of Congress to run a deficit in any year. \n     The same supermajority would be needed to enact any tax \n     increase. Compare those hurdles to the version of the \n     amendment that passed the House in 1995, which called for a \n     slightly lower three-fifths vote in each house to pass an \n     unbalanced budget or increase the debt ceiling and a mere \n     majority vote to increase taxes.\n       Worse yet, the latest version would impose an absolute cap \n     on spending as a share of the economy. It would prevent \n     federal expenditures from exceeding 18 percent of the gross \n     domestic product in any year. Most unfortunately, the \n     amendment lacks a clause letting the government exceed that \n     limit to strengthen a struggling economy. No matter how shaky \n     the state of the union, policymakers would be prevented from \n     adopting emergency spending, such as the extension of \n     unemployment insurance and other countercyclical expenses \n     that have helped cushion the blow of the current economic \n     downturn. The 18 percent cap on spending is so severe that \n     House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan's economic plan \n     would violate its strictures. So would any budget passed \n     under President Ronald Reagan. With health-care costs rising \n     and the number of retiring baby boomers increasing, it would \n     be next to impossible to keep spending to that low share of \n     the economy.\n       Both houses of Congress are expected to vote on the \n     amendment next week, but a responsible lawmaker's obligation \n     does not end at voting against this version. Even a less \n     draconian rendition--without the spending cap or with lower \n     thresholds for approving tax increases or running deficits--\n     would be the wrong approach. If a balanced-budget amendment \n     had been in place when the economy crashed in 2008, Congress \n     would have been unable to respond with a stimulus package or \n     efforts to stabilize banks and auto manufacturers. Even if \n     you believe that was the wrong policy response, it is \n     important that Congress retain the flexibility to craft the \n     correct one.\n       The fiscal situation is perilous. It's commendable that \n     members of Congress are trying to right it. The balanced-\n     budget amendment remains a deeply flawed approach to \n     achieving a noble goal.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 17, 1990]\n\n                   No to a Balanced Budget Amendment\n\n       The balanced budget amendment that the House will vote on \n     today is impractical, unenforceable and wouldn't end Federal \n     deficits. But it would litter the Constitution with a vacuous \n     promise, and invite greater cynicism in budget-making.\n       Deficits are arbitrarily defined and easily manipulated. \n     Achieving a specific level, like zero, has no special \n     economic significance. And trying to hit that target could \n     play havoc with valuable Federal programs and a declining \n     economy that might need deficit spending.\n       Yes, Congress should keep deficits from spiraling upward. \n     But there is no immediate crisis, and the deficit--compared \n     with the size of the economy--has already been cut in half \n     under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget law. More needs to be \n     done. The prudent way is to amend Gramm-Rudman to make it \n     work better, not spoil the precious Constitution in a \n     quixotic search for a quick fix.\n       The proposed amendment would require a three-fifths vote in \n     both houses to run a deficit. That, say the sponsors, would \n     provide the flexibility to run deficits when they are needed \n     but stymie unnecessary borrowing. But nowhere does the \n     amendment come to grips with political reality. Evasion would \n     be simple. Congress could move programs ``off budget,'' like \n     funds for the savings and loan crisis.\n       The amendment also would require Congress and the President \n     to agree on revenue and expenditure estimates. But \n     politicians have a common interest in fudging such \n     projections and pretending to pass a balanced budget. The \n     amendment's only safeguard against self-serving projections \n     is the proposed three-fifths vote to raise the debt ceiling. \n     That way legislators eventually would be forced to confront \n     the issue. Yet garnering enough votes would be easy since to \n     vote otherwise would bring the Government to a screeching \n     halt.\n       As for states that have balanced budget amendments, they \n     also have separate capital accounts. That allows them to \n     borrow money for long-term investments in infrastructure. \n     There is no separate capital account in the Federal budget. \n     So a requirement to balance the budget would create a \n     horrific incentive for Congress to avoid costly investments \n     in railroads, education and research.\n       Congress has been unable to make the Gramm-Rudman budget \n     law work fully as intended. But amending it to plug loopholes \n     would be far easier, and better, than drafting a skimpily \n     worded constitutional amendment.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 18, 2011]\n\n              Why a Balanced-Budget Amendment Is Too Risky\n\n                        (By Norman J. Ornstein)\n\n       It is no surprise that a constitutional amendment to \n     balance the budget would reemerge now--there's the symbolism \n     of standing for fiscal rectitude and wrapping that position \n     in the cloak of the Constitution. And nearly all states have \n     constitutional provisions to balance their budgets, so why \n     should the federal government be different?\n       But the answer to that question is a key reason a \n     constitutional amendment to balance the federal budget would \n     be disastrous.\n       A sagging economy requires what we call countercyclical \n     policy, stimulus to counter a downturn and provide a boost. \n     The need for countercyclical policy became apparent in the \n     1930s, after the opposite response to economic trouble caused \n     a dizzying collapse; its application early in Franklin \n     Roosevelt's presidency succeeded in pulling the United States \n     out of the Depression (until a premature tightening in 1937-\n     38 pulled us back down into it).\n       Countercyclical policy is what every industrialized country \n     in the world employed when the credit shock hit in late 2008, \n     to avoid a global disaster far more serious than the one we \n     faced. Under a balanced-budget amendment, however, no \n     countercyclical policy could emanate from Washington. \n     Spending could not grow to combat the slump. And while the \n     Obama stimulus did not jump-start a robust economic recovery,\n\n[[Page S4821]]\n\n     any objective analysis would find that absent the $800 \n     billion stimulus, the economy would have spiraled down much \n     further.\n       State balanced-budget requirements make the option of a \n     federal balanced-budget amendment dangerous. When state \n     revenue declines during economic downturns, state spending on \n     unemployment and Medicaid increases. To balance their \n     budgets, states have to raise taxes and/or cut spending, the \n     opposite of what is needed to emerge from a fiscal funk. This \n     is the economic equivalent of the medieval practice of \n     bleeding to cure any ailment, including anemia. In 2009, the \n     fiscal drag from the states amounted to roughly $800 billion; \n     in effect, the stimulus from Washington merely replaced the \n     blood lost by the state-level bleeding.\n       Even balanced-budget amendments that have a waiver for \n     recessions are a risk because there is often a lag between a \n     recession itself and when it is recognized. That lag could \n     produce more inopportune bleeding.\n       The amendment under consideration has its own deep flaws. \n     The Republican proposal would cap spending each year at 18 \n     percent of gross domestic product. Because the formula is \n     based on a previous year's economy, it would mean, according \n     to Republican economist Don Marron, a cap of more like 16.7 \n     percent of GDP. This in turn means that the House-passed \n     budget proposed by Rep. Paul Ryan, which calls for draconian \n     cuts in Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and discretionary \n     domestic programs, would not be nearly draconian enough. \n     Accounting for population changes, the 16.7 percent limit \n     would mean slashing Social Security and Medicare well below \n     the levels contemplated by the bipartisan Simpson-Bowles \n     fiscal commission, and cutting discretionary spending by half \n     or more. It is hard to make the case that decapitating food \n     inspection, air traffic control, scientific research, Head \n     Start, childhood nutrition programs and more, as the \n     amendment would almost certainly require, would lead to a \n     healthier economy, itself a necessity to solve the debt \n     problem.\n       To be fair, the amendment has a safety valve--a two-thirds \n     vote of both chambers can authorize a deficit. But imagine \n     the chances of securing a two-thirds vote in this Congress. \n     Similarly, its requirement that 60 percent of both houses \n     vote to increase taxes or the debt limit would result in \n     political gridlock and opportunities for legislative \n     blackmail.\n       That this amendment has been endorsed by all 47 Republicans \n     in the Senate, and that a dozen Republicans have pledged not \n     to increase the debt limit without the amendment, are sad \n     commentaries on our politics. But the effects should this \n     amendment be adopted would be frightening.\n       Norman Ornstein is a resident scholar at the American \n     Enterprise Institute and coauthor of ``The Broken Branch: How \n     Congress Is Failing America and How to Get It Back on \n     Track.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the News Leader, July 17, 2011]\n\n                    Balanced Budget Amendment Unwise\n\n       Instead of making a good faith effort to work toward a \n     compromise and actually do something good for the country, \n     Republicans in Congress once again are bandying about a feel-\n     good piece of legislation that could only further hogtie the \n     government.\n       The balanced budget amendment is a flag conservatives love \n     to run up the pole when they think they can get the American \n     public to hate free-spending Democrats a little bit more. \n     It's disingenuous at best. Congress should not require a \n     special rule that says its members use common sense when \n     making vast and expensive decisions. When it comes to \n     international conflicts, domestic terror threats and economic \n     recessions, the added steps of arguing to get around a \n     balanced budget amendment is not what is needed.\n       But when it comes to running the government, members of \n     Congress need to use forethought and that not-so-common \n     common sense to avoid unproductive tax cuts, conflicts \n     without reasonable exit strategies and the ability to find \n     solutions when deficits grow too large.\n       The timing of our own Rep. Bob Goodlatte's amendment might \n     sound quite reasonable to a lot of people right now. But it \n     isn't reasonable. It's another ploy by those who don't want a \n     solution to the real problem, but just a way to make gullible \n     followers believe they've found a solution to our budgetary \n     woes.\n       A balanced budget amendment does not equal smaller \n     government with less spending. Like any household, the only \n     way to balance a budget is by trimming expenses and adding \n     revenue. Pressed to balance a budget would force Congress to \n     raise taxes, especially if we are to hang on to high-cost \n     government entities like Social Security and Medicare.\n       It's not a solution. Demanding that a balanced-budget \n     amendment go along with any agreement toward raising the debt \n     ceiling simply will drag the whole thorny mess down even \n     more.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 5\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I would appreciate the Chair letting me know when 4 \nminutes has expired.\n  Let us put this debate in context. In 2010, we had a major election \nin the country. The people who were elected in the House made promises \nto their constituents: If you send me to Congress, I will try to change \nthe system and deal with the fact our Nation is being run into the \nground.\n  We have more debt than any future generation can ever pay off, with \n40 cents of every dollar we spend being borrowed money. If you are born \ntoday, you inherit about $48,000 of debt. We are spending more on \nSocial Security payments than we collect in taxes. Medicare is \nunderfunded by $30-something trillion over the next 75 years. When you \nadd up all entitlement programs, we are about $50 trillion short of the \npromises we have made.\n  Simply put, the House Republicans who were elected, during their \ncampaigns said: I believe Congress is out of control. We are going to \nbecome Greece, and I want to do something about it.\n  What did you expect when they got here? They would say: Okay, I have \nbeen taught the real way the Congress works, and it is all okay. They \ndid something about it. Congratulations. Anytime a person running for \noffice fulfills the promises they made to their constituents, they have \ndone a great service to democracy.\n  Cut, cap, and balance is the House effort to reduce spending not 10 \nyears from now but this coming year. The problem with all these plans \nand the very sincere efforts in the past to solve our debt problems--\nGramm-Rudman-Hollings, the Balanced Budget Agreement of 1997 between \nPresident Clinton and the Republicans--and I was here then when we \nachieved balance, because we restricted the growth of entitlements such \nas Medicare, we restricted doctor and hospital payments, and we \nactually balanced the budget for a year or two, but then we found out \nhow much it was hurting doctors and hospitals. We didn't institute real \nreform. We began to nickel and dime doctors and hospitals, and guess \nwhat. We stopped the program and we spent all the surpluses.\n  How do you get $14-trillion-plus in debt? Both parties are working \ntogether. This has been a bipartisan effort for about 30 years to run \nthe country into the ground. I want a break. I want to have a \nbipartisan effort to save the country from becoming Greece, and the \nonly way you can do that is to put ideas on the table.\n  Please, I say to my Democratic colleagues, let this debate go \nforward. If this is not worth debating, what would be? How do you save \nthe country from becoming a debtor nation to the point the next \ngeneration can't inherit the American dream? If you have a better plan \nthan cut, cap, and balance, please show it to us. We are willing to \nraise the debt limit, but we are not going to do it without changing \nthe reason we got in debt.\n  The cut part reduces spending in 2012 by $100 billion. That will \ncause some pain, but it is eminently doable. It is about 3 or 4 percent \nof the Federal budget. I think most people at home believe they can cut \ntheir budget 3 or 4 percent. If they had to do it to save their family, \nthey would. We are talking about saving the country.\n  The cap is an effort to control spending over 10 years to wipe out \nthe $1.4 trillion deficit. We are going to become Greece because we are \ngoing to have 100 percent of debt to GDP in about the next 20 years, \nand a trillion-plus deficit has to be changed. You can't do it \novernight, but you should be able to do it over 10 years.\n  The centerpiece of the House legislation is the balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution. What rational person believes that \nRepublicans on this side and Democrats on that side are ever going to \nfind a way to fix our Nation's problems without something new \nhappening?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 4 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Chair.\n  After 40 years, the evidence is in. The Congress is broken, and \nunless you change the system fundamentally, we are going to run our \nNation into the ground. So I support a balanced budget amendment.\n  Here is the way it works: You have to get two-thirds in the Senate \nand the House and three-fourths of the States\n\n[[Page S4822]]\n\nhave to ratify the balanced budget amendment. Give the people of \nAmerica a chance to have their say. Let's pass a balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution before we take the country and put it in \na situation beyond redemption. The only thing that is ever going to \nchange this body, I am sad to say, is some discipline imposed by the \nConstitution itself.\n  I promise my colleagues to work with you where I can. But for the \nrest of my time in the Senate--and I don't know how long it is going to \nbe--I am going to push a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, \nbecause I don't trust the Congress to do the hard work on its own. And \nwhen I say that, I mean Republicans too.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the motion to table \nthe motion to proceed to H.R. 2560, the Cut, Cap, and Balance Act of \n2011. At this critical juncture in our Nation's history, the Federal \nGovernment's record of fiscal recklessness proves we must work to \nguarantee fiscal responsibility not just for our time, but for all \ntime. In that light, I believe it deserves debate and an open process \nthat would allow for changes and improvements so we can ultimately pass \na measure ensuring we are never again confronted with a vote to raise \nour Nation's debt ceiling. And I am therefore deeply disappointed and \ntroubled that the majority in the Senate is not permitting us to \nproceed to any further discussion or votes on this bill.\n  To achieve that goal, an indispensible element of the cut, cap, and \nbalance bill is the balanced budget amendment--and I have been a \nchampion of balanced budget amendments throughout my tenure. And in \nfact, this legislation before us represents the one and only \nopportunity we will likely have as we lead up to the debt ceiling \ndeadline to consider and pass just such an amendment. Given our \nhistoric $14.3 trillion national debt, the record $1.6 trillion deficit \nfor the current fiscal year, and the unrestrained and skyrocketing \ngrowth of government programs and services, we have little choice but \nto seriously and thoroughly debate measures to bring certainty and \nsolutions to our broken budget process. We must commence a process that \nwill force our government to reevaluate priorities and live within its \nmeans.\n  Indeed, this is a threshold moment in our Nation's history to \ndetermine precisely what kind of nation we want to be. Will our fiscal \nfuture be held hostage to interests overseas, threatening both our \nnational and economic security? Will we cede our destiny to countries \nlike China, which already holds approximately one-fifth of our gross \ndebt? Or will we seize the financial reins, pass a constitutional \nbalanced budget amendment, and reclaim our future?\n  Given what is at stake and Congress's perpetual disregard for fiscal \nresponsibility, frankly, the burden is squarely upon the opponents of \nthis resolution to justify how business as usual is sustainable for our \nNation. Indeed, last week the President asserted that, ``we don't need \na constitutional amendment to do our jobs.'' Well, if that were true, \nif such an amendment isn't required for us to do our jobs, why then do \nwe find ourselves wallowing in this economic morass? If Congress \nactually possessed the capacity to forestall skyrocketing debt of its \nown volition, why are we mired in a major debt crisis?\n  So let us not be confused as we hear all of the usual diversionary \nexcuses why this amendment shouldn't pass. And having cosponsored a \nbalanced budget amendment 18 times since my very first days in \nCongress, and having made statements in favor of it 35 times on the \nSenate and House floor, believe me, I could recite them all by rote--\nhow a balanced budget amendment will be overly restrictive, spending \nreductions too substantial, and that other measures would be equally \neffective without changing our Constitution. I recall during a House \nfloor debate in 1992, colleagues asked: What if appropriations exceed \nestimated revenues? What if the President and Congress underestimate \nthe amount of federal revenues in a fiscal year? What if it requires \nbudgetary adjustments as a result of a contracting economy, or \ninaccurate estimates?\n  And my response then was the same as it is now--welcome to the real \nworld! That is what families, businesses and frankly, 49 States that \nhave adopted balanced budget requirements confront day in and day out. \nState governors and legislators cannot leave their Capitols if their \nbudgets aren't balanced and the U.S. Congress should be no different.\n  Instead, we have not only a fiscal gap in Washington but a shameful \nimbalance between the trust the American people have placed in us, and \nthe responsibilities we must carry out if we are to demonstrate \nworthiness of that trust. The demonstrable reality is that, absent a \npermanent mechanism that forces the Federal Government to set and \nfulfill its fiscal priorities, Congress will blithely continue its \nwayward practices. Indeed, the reason many lawmakers don't want a \nbalanced budget amendment is the exact reason why it's essential--and \nthat is to permanently end the types of legislative trickery that have \nbrought our country to the edge of a fiscal chasm.\n  The facts speak for themselves. On March 4, 1997, when the balanced \nbudget amendment failed to pass in the Senate by one vote, our gross \ndebt was $5.36 trillion, a number we rightly all found staggering! But \napparently it wasn't staggering enough, as the abysmal track record \nfollowing 1997 dramatically demonstrates.\n  In 1999, just 2 years after that fateful vote in which the balanced \nbudget amendment failed to pass, the debt rose to $5.6 trillion. By \n2002--it was $6 trillion. In 2004--$7 trillion. In 2006--$8 trillion. \nBy 2009--it rose to $11 trillion, and last year to $13.5 trillion. The \nbottom line is that from 1997 to 2011, the national debt has almost \ntripled. Tripled--to an unprecedented $14.3 trillion. And now we are \nasked to raise the ceiling again to $16.5 trillion.\n  Our government has balanced its budget only five times in half a \ncentury. Five times. Our 1997 deficit was $22 billion; this year's is \nprojected to be 73 times as high, at $1.6 trillion. Does anyone know \nany families out there in America who are voluntarily spending 73 times \nwhat they spent in 1997? Families across the country have been paying \ndown their credit cards. They are facing reality, while Congress \ncontinues to binge-spend, unabated.\n  In 1992, I said on the House floor that, ``we have no way of knowing \nhow bad things might get if we continue without the balanced budget \namendment.'' Well, regrettably, now we do know, and the situation is \ndire as our outstanding debt now projected to reach 100 percent of GDP \nthis year--which some economists have labeled an ``economic danger \nzone.'' In fact, economists report that gross debt levels above 90 \npercent of GDP slow economic growth by 1 percent per year, resulting in \napproximately 1 million jobs lost. So I defy anyone to explain how we \ncould have amassed these mind-numbing levels of debt relative to our \nGDP, and yet a balanced budget amendment is not a necessity.\n  We have tried every statutory structure possible yet nothing we have \nimplemented has withstood the test of time, circumvention, or clever \ngimmickry to successfully and consistently bind both the House and the \nSenate to provide continuity from Congress to Congress, to act in a \nfiscally responsible manner. Nothing. And no one can disavow the \nconsequences of this lack of self-imposed accountability, which has \nengendered shockingly deficient oversight and review of our spending \nand Federal programs, both those already existing, and those proposed. \nAs a result, we continue to pile on program after program with \nimpunity.\n  We have witnessed the positive effects of statutory limits with past \nbudget enforcement mechanisms such as the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act, \nthe 1990 Budget Enforcement Act, and the 1997 Balanced Budget Act that \nsaved upward of $700 billion, and those measures led to 4 years of \nsurpluses. But we allowed them to lapse, to wither on the legislative \nvine, and that has led us directly to the ``wild west'' mentality of \ntoday in which our entire budget and appropriations processes have \nvirtually disintegrated.\n  Congress is required by law to adopt a budget resolution by April 15, \nyet in the past 36 years Congress has met that deadline just six times. \nThroughout the last 10 years, Congress has approved a budget resolution \non only six occasions. Congress failed to complete action on a budget \nresolution for 5 fiscal years--1999, 2003, 2005, 2007, and 2011--\n\n[[Page S4823]]\n\nthat all ended with large, spendthrift, omnibus appropriations measures \nor continuing resolutions.\n  Last year, no budget and no appropriations bills passed for the first \ntime since the current budget rules were put into place in 1974, almost \nresulting in a shutdown of the Federal Government in April 2011. We \nhave had 87 continuing resolutions in the past 14 fiscal years and \npassed not even a single one of the 12 individual appropriations bills \nfor the current fiscal year. This tacit acceptance of dysfunction in \nour budget and appropriations processes has only exacerbated the trend-\nline of unbridled federal spending, and it is symptomatic of the \nminiscule value Congress has assigned to averting economically \ncorrosive deficits and debt.\n  It is certainly not as though we lack the time to fulfill our legal \nrequirement to complete budgets by April 15--and just ask the American \npeople if they aren't required to meet their tax filing deadline on \nApril 15! In fact, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service \nreports that from January 5, 2011, through July 1, 2011, the Senate has \nbeen in session for 541 Hours, 243 hours of which have been spent in \nMorning Business--that is 45 percent of our time spent in \nnonlegislative activity. We couldn't have voted on a budget resolution? \nNo wonder only 18 percent of the country believes Congress is doing its \njob, which only makes me wonder--who exactly are those 18 percent?\n  Even when we had the historic opportunity of 4 consecutive years of \nFederal surpluses beginning in 1998, we squandered it with a deplorable \nlack of foresight. In 2001, the last year of surpluses when our debt \nwas $5.8 trillion, I introduced a legislative trigger mechanism to link \nlong-term Federal budget surplus reductions with actual budgetary \noutcomes and later led a bipartisan, bicameral group with Senator Bayh \nto offer a subsequent amendment, recognizing that federal surplus \nprojections were merely that--projections. Yet both measures were \ndismissed and derided.\n  And what has been the result? Since 2002, the Nation has run a \ndeficit each and every year and our gross debt has increased from $6.2 \ntrillion to almost $15 trillion. Over the past 5 years alone, \ngovernment has managed to increase spending by a remarkable 40 percent, \ncontributing to the largest budget deficits in our history over the \nlast three consecutive years. We are now borrowing roughly 40 cents of \nevery dollar we spend.\n  The reality could not be more stark--the balanced budget amendment is \nthe only vehicle before us that will guarantee that a balanced budget \nwill be the rule, rather than the exception--because it will compel \nCongress, through the ultimate authority of the Constitution--to return \nto the regimentation and discipline of the budget and appropriations \nprocesses, and thereby force the government to establish priorities and \nabide by those priorities.\n  To paraphrase a statement I made during one particular balanced \nbudget debate in the House, the Constitution is not for window \ndressing. It is not to score political points for any particular party. \nIt is not for more games and gimmicks--and in fact, as I have stated \nmany times, if it were a gimmick Congress would have passed it long \nago! Rather, the purpose is to protect current and future generations \nfrom the crushing weight of ever-escalating debt that threatens \nAmerica's security and our very way of life.\n  There should be no mistake--debt and deficits are always a dangerous \ncombination, and especially at a time when we are experiencing an \nunprecedented period of long-term unemployment with more than 22 \nmillion Americans unemployed or underemployed, and another 2.2 million \nwho want a job, but are so discouraged they stopped looking for work \naltogether. Consider that, in the 29 months since President Obama took \noffice, unemployment has dipped below 9 percent for only 5 months, and \nactually increased to 9.2 percent in June. And yet at a moment when \nevery dollar government spends should be wisely dedicated to job \ncreation to return us on the path to prosperity, we are forced to \ncommit an astounding $200 billion per year just to service our debt.\n  The cost of net interest alone will more than triple in the next 10 \nyears to reach nearly $1 trillion per year in 2021. In fact, the CBO's \nmost recent long-term outlook states that by 2035 interest costs on our \nNation's debt would reach 9 percent of GDP, more than the U.S. \ncurrently spends on Social Security or Medicare! And if interest rates \nwere just one percentage point higher per year, over ten years the \ndeficit would balloon by $1.3 trillion from increased costs.\n  Ironically, the conversations in Washington are about how the markets \nwill react if we do not raise the debt ceiling, but the markets are \nalready reacting. Standard & Poor's recently downgraded the Nation's \noutlook from ``stable'' to ``negative,'' Moody's warned that our \n``AAA'' rating could be lost if we do not reduce deficit spending, and \nlarge funds like PIMCO are divesting holdings of U.S. bonds.\n  And let's be perfectly clear--it is not only our economy that may \nsuffer should we dive into the fiscal abyss. When ADM Mike Mullen, the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, identifies the national debt as \nthe single biggest threat to our national security--that ought to \ncompel us to stand up and take notice. Yet in the absence of a balanced \nbudget amendment, any fiscal foothold we may gain with measures \nimplemented in this Congress could be summarily reversed by subsequent \nCongresses--whereas, a balanced budget amendment would establish an \nindissoluble contract with future generations that would cement fiscal \nresponsibility in perpetuity.\n  So let us be unambiguous what this debate is about. It is a \nfundamental disagreement between those who are concerned about our \nfuture economic standards, and those who are willing to erode the \neconomic opportunities that have become the very hallmark of the \nAmerican dream. You see, the dirty little secret is that those who \noppose a balanced budget amendment don't want their hands tied . . . \nthey don't want the fiscal restraints. Well, to them I say, this is \nAmerica--can't we do better?\n  Well, we can do better, and we must--and therefore, I will vote to \nproceed with this legislation. Critically, it contains a provision that \nexempts Medicare, Social Security, and veterans benefits from the \nspending caps. At the same time, I recognize it is not a perfect bill. \nIn fact, again I believe there should be a full and open debate during \nwhich members can offer amendments to improve this legislation and I \nregret that the majority here in the Senate will preclude that \npossibility.\n  I can foresee a number of improvements I would propose, including the \naddition of a ``pay-for'' title in the legislation that would provide \nfor additional, mandatory savings including eliminating ethanol \nsubsidies and direct agricultural payments to high-income farmers, and \nrescinding unspent stimulus and TARP funds, that could be better \nutilized within Medicare and Medicaid. And we must also enact \nstraightforward budget policy reforms so that Congress no longer relies \non accounting gimmicks. These are but a number of the improvements that \nwould save billions of dollars and put our nation on a path toward \nfiscal responsibility.\n  Again, the central question before us is as old as the founding of \nour great republic--and that is, what kind of nation do we want to be? \nThat was the same question that historian David McCullough addressed \nyears ago before group of legislators when he discussed the milestones \nachieved by Congress when leaders worked together.\n  ``Think what your institution has achieved,'' he observed. ``It was \nCongress that created the Homestead Act. It was Congress that ended \nslavery. It was Congress that ended child labor. It was Congress that \nbuilt the Panama Canal, the railroads and the Interstate System. It was \nCongress that created Social Security. It was Congress that passed the \nVoting Rights Act. It was Congress that sent Lewis and Clark to the \nWest, and sent us on voyages to the moon.'' And some acts of Congress, \nhe pointed out, like the Marshall plan and lend lease, were achieved \nunder crisis conditions.\n  I honestly believe that this spirit of accomplishment can be re-\ncaptured--and what could be a more fundamental place to start than with \nthe future fiscal health of our Nation? We can either bring disrepute \nupon ourselves by continuing to mortgage our future to\n\n[[Page S4824]]\n\ncover the fiscal offenses of today or we can rise to the occasion, meet \nour moral responsibility, and bequeath the generations to come a nation \nunencumbered by the shackles of perpetual debt. The choice is ours, and \nhistory awaits our answer.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the path to deficit reduction is difficult, \nbut some of the essentials are clear for all to see. We must cut \nspending, which will require real sacrifice on the part of American \nfamilies. We must also add revenue, which has plunged so dramatically \nthanks to Bush-era tax cuts that flow primarily to the wealthiest among \nus. And we must avoid proposals that would see the most vulnerable \namong us pay the highest price for deficit reduction.\n  That is the path a broad array of budget experts, Democratic and \nRepublican, tell us is the only way to relieve our debt problem. And it \nis the path the American people tell us they understand that we need to \ntake. In survey after survey, poll after poll, Americans voice their \nsupport for a balanced approach to deficit reduction, one in which we \ncut spending, yes, but also address revenues by closing tax loopholes \nand asking the wealthiest among us to share in the sacrifices that are \nrequired to bring down the deficit. And they tell us, unequivocally, \nthat they do not want us to fall short of our commitment to the most \nvulnerable, especially those who depend on Social Security and Medicare \nfor a secure retirement.\n  So this is the true path to deficit reduction: targeted and sometimes \npainful spending cuts; closing tax loopholes, asking wealthy taxpayers \nto join in the sacrifices we must make; and protecting the social \nsafety net on which our most vulnerable citizens depend.\n  We can choose that path, difficult though it may be. Or we could take \na path like the one laid out in this legislation--a path leading \nstraight off a cliff. The American public has made it clear to the \nRepublicans in the House of Representatives that its budget objectives, \nas laid out in the draconian budget plan they sent to us earlier this \nyear, are unacceptable. Rather than heeding that message, Republicans \nhave sent us a plan that's even worse than the first.\n  The budget championed by House Republicans this year would have added \nmore than $6,000 a year to the typical senior's medical bills. The plan \nbefore us today tacks another $2,500 or more onto that bill.\n  The budget plan from House Republicans this year cut billions from \nMedicare to clear the way for billions in tax cuts for the wealthy. The \nplan before us today would enshrine protection for those tax cuts in \nthe Constitution by requiring two-thirds majorities in both Houses to \nenact any revenue increase, making it virtually impossible for future \nCongresses to reverse such disastrous policies, or to remove tax \nloopholes for oil companies or tax incentives for companies that ship \njobs overseas.\n  The budget plan from House Republicans this year would cost an \nestimated 700,000 jobs by removing support from an already weakened \neconomy. The economy has, if anything, become more worrisome since that \nbudget came to us, but the legislation before us today follows the same \ndestructive path.\n  Let us be clear: What Republicans have proposed is to abandon our \ncommitments to the safety, security and prosperity of the American \npeople. They would slash Medicare and Social Security, and leave the \nrest of the budget so threadbare that it could not cover our important \npriorities. The American people want us to reduce waste and redundancy \nin Federal spending. But they do not want us to stop protecting the air \nwe breathe and the water we drink, stop inspecting our food supply, \nstop patrolling our streets or borders or educating our young people or \nensuring safe air travel or any of the things that help keep them safe \nand healthy and secure. And yet there is no doubt that under this plan, \nwe would stop doing some or all of those things. We would have no \nchoice.\n  It is especially disturbing that many of the same people arguing for \nthese destructive policies are responsible for the policies that \nbrought on our deficit to begin with. Republicans are quick to blame \nPresident Obama's policies for the deficit, but the vast majority of \nour current woes stem from policies adopted during the previous \nadministration by Republican majorities in Congress. Republicans pushed \nfor massive tax cuts, tax cuts that weren't paid for and that flowed \noverwhelmingly to the wealthy. Republicans pushed for a war of choice \nin Iraq that was not paid for.\n  Our Republican colleagues like to compare the Federal Government to a \nfamily. Families have to balance their budgets, they say; why can't the \ngovernment? Well, the Federal ``family'' had a balanced budget under \nDemocrats. Republicans wrecked our fiscal discipline with the Bush tax \ncuts and wars that were not paid for, and now they want middle-class \nand vulnerable Americans to pay the price. If the government is a \nfamily, then Republicans are the guy who gets a big raise, blows the \nwhole raise plus the family savings on a hot rod, gets fired from his \njob, loses his income, and decides to stop paying the kids' tuition so \nhe can keep the hot rod.\n  That is the path they propose, in this legislation. We can't follow \nthat path. The better path is difficult, but it is clear. I hope our \nRepublican colleagues will abandon the path of ruin, reject this \ndestructive bill and join us in making the hard choices that the people \nwe serve need us to make, and soon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak of one of my \ngravest concerns, which is our Nation's fiscal future.\n  All of us--Democrats, Republicans, liberals, moderates, \nconservatives--face a choice about whether we will seize the moment \nbefore us and confront our great fiscal nightmare or whether we will \nlet this moment pass us by. Clearly, we face tough and difficult \ndecisions. The decision we make as Members of Congress must be the \nright and responsible ones or our beloved Nation and our hard-working \nfamilies will needlessly suffer.\n  In my State, when I became Governor, we faced challenging times--\ngrowing debts and tough budget choices. When I was first elected in \nNovember of 2004, the first thing I did afterwards was go to New York \nand talk to the rating agencies--the people who knew our State best--to \nfind out what our gravest challenges were. I went back home and we \nstarted making changes.\n  I did not blame anyone--any past administration, Republican or \nDemocrat or any other body. I was elected to fix things, not to put \nblame on people. As West Virginians, not as Democrats or Republicans, \nwe set about fixing the problems of our State. We didn't raise tax \nrates. People came to me and said we needed to do that, but I couldn't \nlook people in the eye and do that without trying to run our State more \nefficiently.\n  The difference between what we did back home and what is happening \nhere in Washington is that we faced these choices together. We worked \nacross party lines in a responsible way to address our fiscal \nchallenges. In doing so, we set our State on the right fiscal path \nand--let me stress again without sacrificing our moral responsibility \nor obligations to our seniors, our veterans, and the people most \nchallenged in our society. We did that without raising their tax rates.\n  Right now, because we made the right choices, our State is doing \nwell. Even in these most difficult, challenging financial times, we \nhave had record surpluses every year--6 years in a row. For the last 3 \nyears, we have been one of the few States in the Nation that has an \nincrease in our rating from Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch, the \nrating agencies. We did this by living within our means. It is the \nreason why I am such a strong supporter of a balanced budget amendment. \nIt makes you put in place your priorities based on what your values \nare. I truly believe most Americans support a balanced budget. Every \nfamily I know in my State and in this Nation works off of some sort of \na budget. Nearly all our State governments operate on a balanced \nbudget. I have never seen another place, except here in our Nation's \nCapitol--our government in Washington--that puts a budget together \nbased on what they want to spend, not on how much they have to spend.\n\n[[Page S4825]]\n\n  But how we balance our budget is critically important. We have a \nmoral responsibility and an obligation to our seniors, our families, \nand those who are the most fragile in our challenged society. That is \nwhy I cannot support the cut, cap, and balance plan passed in the \nHouse, which we will be voting on shortly. As a moderate Democrat who \nis also a proud fiscal conservative, I agree with the bill's goal of a \nbalanced budget. However, I cannot support the path it takes.\n  The cut, cap, and balance plan does not reflect who we are or what we \nwant to be as Americans. I believe we need to cut but not so deeply and \nwithout regard for our seniors and the most vulnerable. I believe we \nneed a cap on our spending but not at a level that could destroy the \nmost important and vital programs we have in our society. I strongly \nbelieve we need a balanced budget amendment but only one that takes a \nresponsible and reasonable approach.\n  Clearly, we can all agree it is time for us to make the difficult \nchoice that will get our financial house in order, but we must do so \nwith the right plan in a responsible manner--one that keeps our \npromises to our seniors, our veterans and, most importantly, our \nchildren. And like it or not, neither Democrats nor Republicans can \ntackle this enormous challenge on their own. This is not a political \nproblem, this is an American problem, one we all face. We should put \npolitics aside and truly put our country first.\n  Earlier this week, I saw that spirit at its finest. On Tuesday of \nthis past week, the Presiding Officer, along with 49 of our other \ncolleagues, came together to listen to the Gang of 6, who worked so \nhard on ideas based on the President's fiscal debt commission. \nDemocrats and Republicans rolled out the first bipartisan proposal to \naddress the Nation's fiscal nightmare. At that meeting, 50 Senators \nfrom both parties--evenly split--came together to listen to the hard \nwork of the Senators who spanned the ideological spectrum. At that \nmoment, the Gang of 6 turned into what we affectionately called the \n``Mob of 50.''\n  And for the first time in these negotiations about our fiscal future, \nwe had a bipartisan plan with momentum that was putting our country \nfirst.\n  We should not waste this moment. We must work together to cut \nspending and attack waste, fraud, and abuse in every sector of our \ncountry, every department, every program that needlessly costs our \nNation hundreds of billions of dollars every year.\n  We must work together to reform our Tax Code, not to raise tax rates \nbut to make fairness a priority. It is simply unfair that hard-working \nmiddle-class families in West Virginia and all around this great \ncountry would pay more in taxes than a Fortune 500 company such as GE, \nwhich didn't pay a cent, or billionaires such as Warren Buffett who \npays a lower effective tax rate than his secretary. Democrats and \nRepublicans must work together to remove unnecessary loopholes, \nsubsidies, and tax credits we simply cannot afford in light of our \nballooning debt.\n  It is time to end the three wars we have that we are spending so much \non and the resources we can't afford and the lives we can't spare.\n  I say to all this is a time for us to come together as Americans, to \nput our politics aside, and do what is right for all of the future of \nthis generation and for this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to say to my friend from West \nVirginia, he has been a great addition to the Senate. We of course know \nhe replaced the great, the legendary Robert Byrd. The people of West \nVirginia should be very happy with the performance of Joe Manchin and \nhis executive experience as the Governor of the State of West Virginia, \nwhich had an impeccable record with surpluses every year he was there. \nHe has brought this talent to Washington, and it has been very helpful \nto us all.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, 5 months ago, President Obama unveiled \nthe only concrete statement he has made to date on our Nation's budget \ncrisis, a 10-year budget plan so preposterous, so unequal to the moment \nthat it was rejected in the Senate by a vote of 97-0. The President's \nresponse to this crisis was to pretend it didn't exist.\n  Two months later, the President doubled down on his vision for a \nfuture of debt by demanding that Congress raise the debt limit, without \nany cuts to spending or a plan to rein it in. It was a total abdication \nof leadership and it wasn't sustainable.\n  So over the past several weeks, the President has been doing his best \nimpersonation of a fiscal moderate. He has talked about balance and \nleft it to others to fill in the blanks.\n  Here is what Democrats in Congress have proposed as a solution: more \nspending and higher taxes to a debt crisis.\n  Yesterday, with the clock ticking, we heard reports of a volcanic \neruption among Democrats at the suggestion that we should solve this \ncrisis by focusing on reducing Washington spending.\n  The solution to this crisis is not complicated. If you are spending \nmore money than you are taking in, you need to spend less money. This \nisn't rocket science. We could solve this problem this morning if \nDemocrats would let us vote on cut, cap, and balance and join us in \nbacking this legislation that Republicans support.\n  But the first step in solving a problem is to admit you have one, and \ntoo many Democrats refuse to admit that Washington has a spending \nproblem. That is why Republicans have insisted that we focus on \nspending in this debate.\n  The reason we have a $14 trillion debt is because no matter how much \nmoney Washington has, it always spends more; and the only way to cure \nthe problem is to stop enabling it. Americans get it, and I want to \nthank every American who has spoken out in favor of cut, cap, and \nbalance. Today, the American people will know where we stand.\n  A vote to table this bill is a vote to ignore this crisis even \nlonger. A vote to get on this bill is a vote for getting our house in \norder.\n  I urge my Democratic colleagues one more time to reconsider their \nposition. Join us in support of a future we can afford.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to all my friends, and new Senators, \nwelcome to the United States.\n  This is a vote on the piece of legislation that was described by my \nfriend, the chairman of the Judiciary, as well as anyone else: It is \nviolative of our Constitution.\n  This is a vote on this matter, and we are going to dispose of this \nlegislation as it needs to be so President Obama and the Speaker can \nmove forward on a matter that will have some revenue in it and send it \nover here, and we can move forward to complete our work to make sure we \ndon't default on our debt.\n  As a result of our conversation here, I move to table the motion to \nproceed to H.R. 2560 and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I was necessarily absent for the \nvote on the motion to table the motion to proceed to the Cut, Cap, and \nBalance Act, H.R. 2560. If I were able to attend today's session, I \nwould have supported the motion to table the motion to proceed to the \nCut, Cap, and Balance Act, H.R. 2560.\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I regret that due to my attendance \nat a dear friend's funeral this morning, I was not in the Senate to \ncast my vote for the cut, cap and balance legislation. I fully support \ncut, cap and balance and I am proud that Republicans put forward a \nconcrete proposal to cut spending, balance the budget, reign in the \nspiraling debt that imperils our children's future and ensures that our \nNation continues to meet its obligations.\n  The Democratic leadership has failed to put forward any meaningful \nproposal to break this impasse, but instead continues to set up \nprocedural road blocks to keep Republican plans from passing and force \nvotes on nonbinding legislation that will do nothing to solve our \nproblems. The Democrats, led by President Obama, continue to insist \nthat our fiscal difficulties can be fixed by raising taxes on \nindividuals and small businesses--the exact policies that will deepen \nour economic woes, not fix them.\n  Both parties must now find a reasonable, responsible path forward to \naddress head-on our debt crisis, end the mortgaging of our children's \nfuture and make certain that our Nation meets its debt obligations, as \nwe Americans always have. If Speaker Tip O'Neill and President Ronald \nRegan could find agreement on such matters, we can too. We must put \npolitics aside and do what is right for our Nation.\n Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, no one disputes that we must \nact now to reduce our growing debt. The interest we pay on our debt \ncosts us dearly in lost opportunity to invest in America. We spend \nmillions of dollars a year paying interest to countries, like China, \nthat we should be investing here in America to create jobs and get our \neconomy moving again. At the same time, it is essential that we do not, \nfor the first time in history, fail to pay our obligations and default \non our debt. Doing so will only make our economic and debt challenges \nmore difficult, and could make it almost impossible to turn our economy \naround.\n  Unfortunately, I think this legislation is shortsighted and mistaken. \nIt neither guarantees that the United States will not default on its \nobligations, nor does it provide a balanced blueprint to addressing our \nlong-term budget obligations. Instead, it would constitutionally \nprotect tax breaks for millionaires and special interest while forcing \nbenefit cuts to Social Security and Medicare beyond those proposed in \nthe House Republican budget.\n  This legislation also distracts from making the hard choices we need \nto make to reduce the deficit and at the same time create jobs and grow \nour economy. The legislation makes it almost impossible to increase \nrevenues, even on the millionaires and billionaires who are doing just \nfine in this economy. It also fails to reduce Pentagon spending, which \naccounts for more than half of our discretionary spending budget, \nforcing more pain on families, seniors and other hard-working \nAmericans.\n  We must address our budget challenges, but we cannot do so on the \nbacks of our seniors and working families. For these reasons, I am \nopposed to this legislation, and while I was ill and could not vote, I \nwould like the record to show that I would have voted to table the \nmotion to proceed on HR 2560, the Cut, Cap and Balance Act. I am \nstrongly opposed to this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/22/senate-section/article/S4826-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4826]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, the Senate just conducted a very important \nvote. We have now demonstrated that the House Republicans' cut, cap, \nand balance bill is over, done, and dead. This was a necessary step, \nand this step now allows the process to move forward.\n  Let me take a moment to discuss where we go from here.\n  Earlier this week, the Republican leader and I were working together \non a path to avert insolvency. It was a fallback plan. It was the \nsecond choice for everyone, including me, and the Republican leader I \nam sure. But earlier this week, it looked as though we needed to go to \nthat fallback plan as soon as possible. Thus, earlier this week, it \nlooked as though the Senate would have to originate that legislation, \nperhaps as soon as today, to avoid default.\n  During the course of the week, however, circumstances have changed. \nThe Speaker and the President have been working diligently together to \nreach an agreement on a major deficit-reduction measure. As I said \nearlier this morning, I wish them both very well. That is very \nimportant to our country.\n  The product on which they are working would address, I understand, \nboth taxes and spending. Under the Constitution, the House of \nRepresentatives must originate all revenue measures. Therefore, the \npath to avert default now runs first through the House of \nRepresentatives--that is what the Constitution demands--and we in the \nSenate must wait for them. Therefore, the Senate does not need to \noriginate legislation today.\n  Earlier this week, I had announced the Senate would need to be in \nsession this weekend. But based on these changed circumstances--and \nthey change fairly rapidly--that is no longer the case.\n  So at the close of business today, the Senate will be out until \nMonday. Over the weekend, of course, there will be all kinds of \nmeetings going on, and I will do my best to monitor closely the talks \nbetween the President and the Speaker, and I will await word of their \nhoped-for success.\n  We will be back on Monday. The Senate will have at least one vote \nMonday evening, and the Senate will wait anxiously for the House of \nRepresentatives to send us their work product so we can later next week \npass legislation to prevent a default in our great country.\n  I am going to consider moving other legislation in case that does not \nwork in the House of Representatives. I received a letter from Senators \ntoday as to some suggestions they have. There is a meeting that is \ngoing to take place at 11 o'clock today with the Gang of 6. The \nRepublican leader and I will be in on that meeting. We are doing our \nvery best to keep all Senators, Democrats and Republicans, on top of \nwhat is going on. But, frankly, in fairness to the Republican leader \nand to me, a lot of what is going on we don't know. So we are, because \nof the negotiations--at least I am speaking for myself; I can't speak \nfor the Republican leader, but I have not been in the day-to-day \nnegotiations as to what is going on between the President and the \nSpeaker.\n\n[[Page S4827]]\n\n  For the third time today, I say as sincerely as I can, I wish them \nwell. It is extremely important we address the debt, and it is \nextremely important we understand we are no longer talking about credit \nratings. We are talking about the default of our debt. I hope this \nweekend brings good sense and common sense and vitality to the work \nbeing done between the President and the House of Representatives.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Abraham Lincoln once said:\n\n       I am a firm believer in the people. If given the truth, \n     they can be depended upon to meet any national crisis. The \n     great point is to bring them the real facts.\n\n  I think that is where we are today. I think we need to bring the \npeople the facts about our Nation's debt. People in my State see \nthrough the games being played in Washington. They want solutions, \ncourage, and leadership--the kind that puts us on a more secure fiscal \npath for the future.\n  Mr. Bryant of Hot Springs Village, AR, writes:\n\n       We know we have to increase the debt ceiling, so let's get \n     serious about finding a solution. . . . Why is this a problem \n     for our politicians? The public expects responsible \n     leadership not the demagoguery we are getting from both sides \n     of the aisle.\n\n  That is the sentiment I hear around my State, and I am certain many \nof my colleagues are hearing this around the Nation.\n  So here are the facts: For over 230 years, the U.S. Government has \nhonored its obligations. Even in the face of the Civil War, two World \nWars, and the Depression, America has paid its bills. Yet now we stand \non the brink of tarnishing the full faith and credit of the United \nStates. We stand here because Congress has failed to bring the American \npeople the real facts.\n  The easiest thing for politicians to do is say they are for lower \ntaxes and for increased spending. This mindset has rung up a $14.2 \ntrillion national debt. We now borrow 41 cents of every dollar we \nspend.\n  Under this debt, combined with the theatrics playing out in the House \nand the Senate, the unthinkable could happen. The 80 million bills the \nFederal Government pays could come to a screeching halt. That means \nmillions of seniors may not receive their Social Security checks in the \nmail, troops may not receive paychecks, Medicare patients could be \ndenied care, and the stock market could significantly drop.\n  Moreover, credit rating agencies have warned us that we will likely \nlose our AAA credit rating without immediate action. Interest rates \nwould permanently rise, piling on additional costs for families. The \ncosts of owning a home, buying food, filling a gas tank, sending kids \nto college, and buying a car will become even more expensive.\n  There is one more real fact I wish to highlight. A default adds \nheavily to our debt. For every 1-percent increase in the interest rates \nwe pay, it adds $1.3 trillion to the debt. It is no wonder last summer \nthe Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said, ``Our national debt is \nour biggest national security threat.''\n  The Gang of 6 offers an alternative--a comprehensive roadmap that \nallows us to tackle the debt in a reasonable, responsible, and fair \nmanner. I applaud Mark Warner, Saxby Chambliss, Kent Conrad, Tom \nCoburn, Mike Crapo, and Dick Durbin on this bipartisan effort. By \nleaving out political agendas, these Senators--these statesmen--\nproduced a plan to slash deficits by $3.7 trillion over 10 years. This \nplan follows the blueprint put forth by the fiscal commission following \na year's worth of study and collaboration.\n  In addition to an immediate $500 billion downpayment, the plan puts \neverything on the table. It balances the need to reduce spending, \nadjusts entitlement programs, and reforms our Tax Code. While I may not \nagree with every provision, I do like that it falls on every citizen to \ncontribute to debt reduction. It allows us to achieve measurable \nresults without jeopardizing safety net programs meant to protect the \nmost vulnerable among us.\n  Furthermore, it avoids gimmicks such as a constitutional amendment or \ncut, cap, and balance, which offer a nice sound bite but falls short.\n  I am hopeful a gang of 60 will embrace this plan and that we can \ninclude it as part of the final debt ceiling solution.\n  Congress has created this cliffhanger moment. Americans and leaders \nall over the world are now watching. The question for Congress remains: \nWill we rise to the occasion or will we fail?\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am disappointed by the outcome of the \nvote today in which a proposal I believe had the most merit for moving \nus in the right direction in regard to raising the debt ceiling and \nmoving us toward the direction of a balanced budget failed in the \nSenate.\n  I have spoken this week several times about the importance of cut, \ncap, and balance. It is the plan that has passed the House of \nRepresentatives and was the path we could take here, and I have \nencouraged my colleagues throughout the week to come together to try to \nmake this cut, cap, and balance plan the framework by which we resolve \nthis issue of the impending necessity of raising the debt ceiling.\n  I have said on every occasion it would be irresponsible not to raise \nthe debt ceiling. I do not know exactly what the consequences are and \nat what point in time those consequences occur, but I do know it would \nbe damaging to the economy. I also believe it would be equally, if not \nmore, irresponsible to simply raise the debt ceiling without taking the \nnecessary steps to put our country on the right path toward a balanced \nbudget in the future.\n  I thought cut, cap, and balance really did present that opportunity \nin which we cut spending back to previous years' levels, we cap that \nspending so it is not more than a certain percentage of our gross \nnational product, our country's economy, and, finally, that we pass a \nbalanced budget amendment, something I have supported since I came to \nCongress each and every year. I believe we do not have the necessary \ndiscipline and courage, the necessity we need to make the decisions to \nput us on the path toward balancing the budget. Of course, if we \napproved a balanced budget amendment in the House and the Senate, it \nstill would be considered by the American people through the State \nlegislatures.\n  So I speak this morning with disappointment that on a straight party-\nline vote, this issue, this legislation was tabled. But I have also \nsaid throughout my conversations about the debt ceiling and about \ngetting our country back on the right path that I believe there is a \nfourth component to cut, cap, and balance.\n  In my view, that fourth component is grow--cut, cap, balance, and \ngrow the economy. Certainly, in my view, the Federal Government does \nnot create jobs. But we have millions of Americans across our country \nwho are looking for work, looking for better work, looking for full-\ntime work, and we have way too many people who are discouraged, who \nhave looked for a long time with no success.\n  In my view, the primary message of the November elections of last \nyear was this insistence that Congress get it right in order to help \nAmericans find employment. It is important. These two things are \nrelated in regard to how our country progresses.\n  As I have indicated, the last time our budget was balanced was at the \nend of President Clinton's term in office. Yes, there was some spending \nrestraint. There was an inability of Republicans and Democrats to come \ntogether and create new programs and big government spending. But what \nreally was happening, what was the primary reason for a balanced budget \nback in those days was a growing economy.\n\n[[Page S4828]]\n\n  So if we want to balance our budget, I am one who says, yes, we need \nmore revenue. But that revenue comes not from tax increases but from a \ngrowing economy that puts people to work and generates the revenue that \nthen flows to the Federal Treasury to pay down our debt.\n  It is actually the most enjoyable aspect of how we could balance the \nbudget. The side benefits beyond an improved fiscal house in \nWashington, DC, is that Americans would have jobs. We help create an \nenvironment in which they can put food on their families' tables, in \nwhich they can save for their kids' education, and have the opportunity \nto save for their own retirement.\n  So today I once again, in the absence of an agreement between the \nWhite House and the House and the Senate--as has been indicated, there \nare ongoing negotiations about this issue of the debt ceiling. But we \nought to be looking also at that opportunity to grow the economy, put \npeople to work, creating those opportunities and raising the revenue \nnecessary to fund, in my view, a much smaller government.\n  So we ought to be promoting a Tax Code that is fair, that is \nefficient, is not overly bureaucratic, that is certain. We need a \nregulatory environment in which every businessperson is not fearful of \nadding employees or investing in the plant and equipment because they \ndo not know what next government regulation is going to come their way.\n  I spent much time this year as a member of the Senate Banking \nCommittee where we have heard from bankers across the country, \nparticularly our community banks, where the uncertainty of what next \nhappens under Dodd-Frank determines whether it is desirable to make a \nloan. What next is the examiner going to say? What next are the \nregulations going to be?\n  Access to credit for our small business men and women in Kansas, our \nfarmers and ranchers--the ability to borrow money has a significant \nrole to play in whether we have a growing economy that puts people to \nwork. So we certainly need to have that fair and certain Tax Code. We \ncertainly need to make certain the regulatory environment is totally \ndifferent than what it is today. And we need to make certain there is \nno doubt about the ability--due to regulations--that a bank can make a \nloan to a creditworthy borrower.\n  We also desperately need a policy in place that encourages domestic \nproduction of oil and gas, that helps us reduce the cost of energy. I \ndo not know how we have a booming economy if energy prices are going to \ncontinue to escalate at the rates they are. The more that cost of \ngasoline reduces the spending power of American families, the less \nlikely we are going to have any opportunity to see a growing economy.\n  Certainly, we have challenges in our housing market that need \nattention, and it is difficult for many of us to make decisions about \nspending more money if we do not have the sense of security that comes \nfrom knowing there is value in our homes.\n  Finally, I want to point out--and the issue I want to focus on for a \nmoment because of what appears to be coming from the Obama \nadministration in regard to trade--there is an indication that, once \nagain, the ability for Congress to consider the trade agreements with \nColombia, Panama, and South Korea is being delayed. Much of our \ncountry's economy--and certainly in my home State of Kansas--is \ndependent, and many people by the millions work in the United States \nbecause of things we manufacture and agricultural commodities we grow \nthat are exported abroad.\n  The last three trade agreements that have been negotiated have been \npending now for a very long time. The consequences of those trade \nagreements are significant. I certainly know this as a Kansan. We \nmanufacture airplanes and general aviation. We grow lots of \nagricultural commodities: wheat, cattle, corn. Much of that is \nexported, and these countries present opportunities for us to grow our \neconomy and put more people to work.\n  The South Korea Free Trade Agreement, for example, if approved, is \nestimated to create 70,000 new jobs. It is estimated that it would be \nan increase in U.S. exports of $9.7 billion, and our gross domestic \nproduct would increase by over $10 billion. Yet the framework by which \nwe can begin to increase our exports to those three countries is once \nagain stalled.\n  The White House announced this week those trade agreements will not \nbe presented to Congress before the August recess. In my view, that is \na terrible mistake, and it is particularly a problem because, as we \nspeak, other countries are assuming the role of exporting to those \ncountries, assuming the role that the United States has historically \nplayed, and we are being left out in the market.\n  A free-trade agreement just recently took effect between South Korea \nand the European Union. Colombia and Canada have an agreement that \ncomes into force on August 15. The more time we delay in approving the \nopportunity for Americans to export to those countries, the more likely \nit is that the markets are going to be taken by exporters from other \ncountries.\n\n  So while we continue to work to see that an agreement is reached in \nregard to this issue of the debt ceiling, let's not take any steps back \nin regard to this issue of growing the economy. Let's continue to work \nin regard to that Tax Code, in regard to that regulatory environment \nthat so hinders the ability of business to expand, in regard to an \nenergy policy that returns those jobs back home and creates greater \nstability in the price and cost of energy. We also need to make certain \nwe have access to credit.\n  But, finally, today, let me again ask the administration to \nreconsider their position, and let's put these trade opportunities--the \nability to increase exports--back on the table so Congress can \nadequately address the terms of those agreements and get them in place \nbefore we lose more market opportunity around the globe.\n  This is not about taking care of big business. This is about making \ncertain that business has the opportunity to sell goods and \nagricultural commodities to those countries, so that in the process of \ntheir business growing they put more and more Kansans and Americans to \nwork.\n  So we have our agenda, and it is an important one for America. Yes, \nfiscal sanity has to return, but let's not forget the fourth component \nof cut, cap, balance, and grow the economy. If we do these things, \nAmerica will be a better place today. But, more importantly, every \nAmerican child will have the opportunity to pursue the American dream.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, As we continue to debate our economic future \nI would like to announce July's Silver Fleece Award winner. This \nmonth's most wasteful spending project is another example of the \negregious Federal spending habits of this government and demonstrates \nwhy exactly we need to enact the Cut, Cap and Balance Act.\n  The Silver Fleece Award for the month of July goes to a $64 million \nstimulus award to provide broadband service to Gallatin County, MT. \nAccording to an analysis conducted by Navigant Consulting, 93 percent \nof the households in the project's proposed service area were already \nserved by five or more broadband providers. The fact that tens of \nmillions of taxpayer dollars were spent to subsidize broadband service \nin an area with already strong private sector representation is \nreprehensible. Perhaps even more staggering, though, is the taxpayer \ncost of these services per unserved household.\n  According to the program's own definition of ``unserved household,'' \nthis project cost taxpayers more than $340,000 per unserved household.\n  However, many of these so-called unserved households have access to \n3G\n\n[[Page S4829]]\n\nwireless broadband. Not only are 3G speeds approaching or even meeting \nadministration broadband standards, but 3G will soon be replaced with \n4G broadband, which will far exceed current standards. Subtracting the \nnumber of homes that had existing access to 3G wireless leaves only \nseven households in the Gallatin County service area unserved by \nbroadband. It cost the U.S. taxpayer an astounding $7,112,422 per \nhousehold to provide broadband service to the truly unserved \npopulation.\n  I wish I could say this project is the exception, but I cannot. This \nfunding was provided through the stimulus' $3.5 billion Rural Utility \nService Broadband Initiative Program. On average, this program cost the \ntaxpayer over $1,000 per household. In the projects analyzed by the \nNavigant study, 85 percent of the households served already had access \nto broadband.\n  Unfortunately, rural broadband subsidization has been long mismanaged \nby the Rural Utility Service. A 2009 inspector general report found \nthat just 2 percent of Federal broadband buildout funds provided \nbetween 2005 and 2008 went toward unserved communities. The same IG \nreport found that funds were also going to areas that were not rural at \nall. In fact, 148 of the communities provided with subsidized broadband \nbetween 2005 and 2008 were within 30 miles of cities with at least \n200,000 inhabitants. We continued to see this occur in the stimulus \nfunding, where in my home State, Cook County, home of Chicago with a \npopulation of 2.79 million, and suburban Will County received funds.\n  Ensuring connectivity in rural America is a worthy endeavor that will \nbring much needed economic development to small communities around the \ncountry. But as we face budget shortfalls and a crippling debt, we \ncannot afford to subsidize duplicative broadband service to urban and \nsuburban areas.\n  Now, during the stimulus debate when the bill was considered by the \nfull Appropriations Committee, I raised concerns with the then chair of \nthe Agriculture Subcommittee, Rosa DeLauro on this issue. I said it was \na waste of money. I said that we should probably redirect the funds. I \nsaid that we should not support this legislation.\n  I was defeated in the House of Representatives and the stimulus bill \nwas put forward. I even wrote a memo highlighting the waste in this \nrural broadband initiative.\n  Unfortunately now seeing--especially in Gallatin County, where we \nhave now subsidized each recipient of unserved broadband services at a \ncost of $7,112,422 per person--we have seen that the remarks that I \nmade in opposition to this funding when I was a member of the House \ndramatically understated the waste to the U.S. taxpayer.\n  As we face a future of deficits and debt, we need to highlight the \nwaste of the Rural Broadband Program, which is why the July Silver \nFleece award went to this program in Gallatin County, MT.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/22/senate-section/article/S4829-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4829]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CUT, CAP, AND BALANCE ACT\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, you should see the folks back in Montana \nand across this country as they watch the news and read the papers, \nshaking their heads. I do not blame them. I am shaking my head too \nbecause we just wasted 2 precious days debating a plan that wipes out \nMedicare and Social Security, a plan that guts veterans' benefits.\n  Yes, that is exactly what the plan did. That is exactly why I opposed \nit. It is incredible to me that some folks have no problem turning \ntheir back on America's seniors and America's veterans while at the \nsame time preserving tax loopholes that benefit millionaires and Big \nOil and Wall Street and corporations that ship our jobs overseas. That \nis why Montana and folks across this country are shaking their heads. \nThey do not think much of what is going on in Washington, DC, these \ndays.\n  My friends in the House know full well this bill is no friend of the \nseniors and it is no friend of the veterans. They know full well it \nwould force deep cuts in Medicare and Social Security. They know this \nall so very well. So you know what they did. What do career politicians \ndo when they want people to believe their plan to cut Medicare somehow \nexempts Medicare? They add language saying ``exempt Medicare.'' That is \nwhat they did. Montanans deserve better, and Americans deserve better.\n  Let's look at the whole truth. Let's first talk about the cuts that \nare in the cut, cap, and balance plan.\n  This plan locks in cuts proposed by the controversial House budget \nplan--otherwise known as the Ryan plan in the House--and it locks them \nin for a full decade. That means you are going to see more than $111 \nbillion in cuts this year alone. That is 10 percent. Will it be a 10-\npercent cut to veterans health care or highway or water infrastructure \nor education? They will not tell us how they plan to make those cuts. \nMaybe they will take a little less out of our veterans but at the \nexpense of the police and firefighters. Maybe they will take a few less \ndollars out of agricultural research but then kick a few more kids out \nof Head Start.\n  Now let's talk about the ``cap.'' The plan caps Federal spending at \n18 percent of gross domestic product, requiring even further spending \ncuts. Now, 18 percent brings us to a level this country has not seen \nsince 1966, about the same time Medicare was created. Even Ronald \nReagan advocated for a higher rate than 18 percent.\n  Here is the kicker: The small print you will not hear from the people \nwho already voted for this bill is that the annual interest on our debt \nand the very things this bill claims to exempt--Medicare, Medicaid, \nSocial Security, veterans' benefits--will cost more than what is \nallowed under the cap. That means there is to be nothing left to spend \non any other program--nothing. That includes the military, our \ninfrastructure, homeland security, and just about everything else. So \nhow is that going to work so that this bill protects Social Security \nand Medicaid? It will not unless you invent your own math. What are the \nlawmakers going to do? Do they really intend to close down the \nPentagon? I doubt it. But that means they are going to have to go back \nand cut Medicare and Social Security. Under this bill, it is their only \nchoice. The numbers simply do not add up.\n  The fact is, we were wasting time even giving it daylight in the \nSenate, and it is exactly why the folks back home are shaking their \nheads. They expect us to get a job done responsibly, using common sense \nin a way that does not dismantle Medicare, Social Security, or hurt our \nveterans.\n  I look forward to debating a bipartisan plan to responsibly cut the \ndebt and cut spending. There is one being worked on right now. But the \nbill the Senate just voted on was not responsible. The Senate rejected \nit, and rightfully so. Now we need to move to a bipartisan plan that \ncomes out of the middle, not from the partisan extremes.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/22/senate-section/article/S4829-2", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4829-S4832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, occasionally, political people say things \nthey probably wish they hadn't said because they are quite foolish.\n  It is with great disappointment that I focus on something our \nPresident recently said. I do so not out of disrespect for him but \nbecause what was said is so fundamentally wrong that it deserves to be \nput out into the public for discussion and, frankly, to get some \nresponse from the President if he wishes to do that.\n  According to the National Journal, an article by Rebecca Kaplan, from \nJuly 21, the President said this:\n\n       I think what's absolutely true is that core commitments \n     that we make to the most vulnerable have to be maintained. A \n     lot of the spending cuts that we are making should be around \n     areas like defense spending, as opposed to food stamps.\n\n  We are in a great debate about how we should figure out a way to end \nour deficit spending, get our debt under control. We have to raise the \ndebt ceiling here in a few days. We have had a\n\n[[Page S4830]]\n\nlot of discussion about the best way to do that. Most people approach \nthe problem by saying: What are the core functions of government, the \nmost important things that are critical to America? You build a budget \nfrom that point up. As every family does, you finally get to some \nthings that are good to have, if you can, but sometimes you cannot \nafford them or not in the same way you have been paying--maybe not \ngoing to a movie or going out to dinner.\n  I think most people would believe that when we all take our oath of \noffice to defend the country, probably the first obligation the Federal \nGovernment has is to defend the people, provide for our national \nsecurity. If we are not able to provide for our national security, \nthere is not much point in trying to protect anything else. That is why \nthe defense of the United States has always been pretty well supported \nin a bipartisan way, by people in both political parties, in times of \npeace and in times of war. That is not to say there haven't been \ndebates about defense spending, and whether defense spending sometimes \ncan be cut but, rather, to at least acknowledge that if any function of \nthe government is a core function or, as the President said, ``core \ncommitments,'' it surely ought to be providing for the defense of the \nAmerican people.\n  We have also decided over the years that there are ways in which we \ncan help to take care of American citizens who have trouble meeting \ntheir own needs. We start with people who are very sick and infirm, or \nelderly, and we have programs such as Social Security, Medicare, and \nthe Medicaid Program for those economically less fortunate. Over the \nyears, we have developed programs to provide other benefits to American \ncitizens. We provide some housing benefits. We provide what is called \nfood stamps. There is another name for it in the agriculture budget: \n``Nutrition assistance.'' It is known as food stamps for people having \ntrouble making ends meet. The government will actually provide them an \nability to buy at the grocery store what they need to eat. That is \nimportant.\n  America got along without food stamps for the first couple centuries \nof its existence. Certainly a lot of people endured hardship. When a \ncountry is wealthy enough to be able to afford to do things for its \npeople, it is certainly an appropriate thing to do. That is certainly \nthe category of food stamps.\n  But I find it remarkable that the President would conflate the \nobligations of the government for national security and a program such \nas the nutritional assistance program the way he has. To describe one \nas a core commitment of the country--food stamps--and to say the rest \nof it we can go talk about making cuts that should be around areas of \ndefense spending as opposed to food stamps--I am not trying to pick on \nfood stamps, but the President is the Commander in Chief. He, among all \nAmericans, is responsible for our national security. And for him to \nsuggest that food stamps is a core mission of the government and that \nnational security is less than that, so that if we need to make cuts we \nshould take them from national defense, I find remarkable.\n\n  Are food stamps close to what is the core of the American people? As \nI said, we got along without food stamps for a long time. Churches and \nfamilies and others took care of folks. When the government was wealthy \nenough to be able to help folks with food stamps, we decided to do it. \nWe have all been supporters of programs that provide that kind of \nassistance. But when you have to begin trimming expenses--and, by the \nway, I am not suggesting there is a proposal here on the table to trim \nfood stamps. What I am saying is that what you don't do is to say there \nis one thing we are going to protect above all else, and that is food \nstamps, and we can, instead, get our savings from the defense budget. \nWe have already effectuated enormous savings from the defense budget \nover the last 3 years.\n  I thought it might be useful to quote a few things that our most \nrecent Secretary of Defense said. He is retired now. For the last 3 \nyears, he acted as Secretary of Defense, and now he has been out of \nthat job for the last couple of weeks. But at the end of his term as \nSecretary of Defense, he gave several speeches, and in each one of \nthose he stressed the commitment of the United States not only to the \nsecurity of the American people but to peace around the world and \nreminded us there is evil in the world. There are always those who \nwould do us harm. And unless there is somebody in the world--a country \nsuch as the United States--willing to stand up to these despots, these \ntroublemakers, we are likely to end up with trouble on our own shores \nsooner or later. He cautioned, therefore, against further reductions in \ndefense spending, as the President has said.\n  On several occasions, Secretary Gates said defense had already had \ncut as much as was advisable. So the question is, Why should we \nautomatically be assuming it is easy to cut another $400 billion out of \ndefense, for example; that our key mission here is to protect the core \nmission, as the President put it, such as food stamps?\n  I am going to select a few things Secretary Gates has said and then I \nwill ask to have printed in the Record a couple of the pieces.\n  On May 24, Secretary Gates made some remarks to the American \nEnterprise Institute, and here is a sampling of what he said. In this \nfirst quote he is talking about the inventory of military weapons in \nour arsenal:\n\n       The current inventory is getting old and worn down from \n     Iraq and Afghanistan. Some equipment can be refurbished with \n     life-extension programs, but there is no getting around the \n     fact that others must be replaced. When it comes to our \n     military modernization accounts, the proverbial ``low hanging \n     fruit''--those weapons and other programs considered most \n     questionable--have not only been plucked, they have been \n     stomped and crushed. What remains are much-needed \n     capabilities--relating to air superiority and mobility, long-\n     range strike, nuclear deterrence, maritime access, space and \n     cyber warfare, ground forces, intelligence, surveillance and \n     reconnaissance--that our nation's civilian and military \n     leadership deem absolutely critical.\n\n  He gave examples of a new tanker. He noted the ones we have are twice \nas old as many of the pilots who are flying them. A new generation \nstrike fighter, the F-35. He said we have to build more ships. The size \nof the Navy has sunk to the lowest number since prior to World War II. \nThe Army and Marines are doing the bulk of our fighting on the ground. \nTheir combat vehicles and helicopters are worn down after a decade of \nwar. He points out that, at some point, we have to replace our aging \nballistic missile submarines, and he calls that a program that \nillustrates the modernization dilemmas we face.\n  He said this--again at the speech he gave at AEI:\n\n       So as we move forward, unless our country's political \n     leadership envisions a dramatically diminished global \n     security war for the United States, it is vitally important \n     to protect the military modernization accounts--in absolute \n     terms, and as a share of the defense budget.\n\n  Let me quote once more from his speech at AEI, and then I wish to \nmove to some remarks he made at some commencement addresses.\n  One thing Secretary Gates noted is that when we decide we want to \nreduce defense spending, we have to remember our potential enemies \nalways have a vote. We can assume certain things are of a low \nprobability to happen around the globe, but we can't always be sure \nthat some despot isn't going to try to create trouble somewhere. Here \nis how he concluded this speech to AEI:\n\n       If we are going to reduce the resources and the size of the \n     U.S. military, people need to make conscious choices about \n     what the implications are for the security of the country, as \n     well as for the variety of military operations we have around \n     the world if lower priority missions are scaled back or \n     eliminated. They need to understand what it could mean for a \n     smaller pool of troops and their families if America is \n     forced into a protracted land war again--yes, the kind no \n     defense secretary should recommend any time soon, but one we \n     may not be able to avoid. To shirk this discussion of risks \n     and consequences--and the hard decisions that must follow--I \n     would regard as managerial cowardice.\n\n  Then he said this:\n\n       In closing, while I have spent a good deal of time on \n     programmatic particulars, the tough choices ahead are really \n     about the kind of role the American people--accustomed to \n     unquestioned military dominance for the past two decades--\n     want their country to play in the world.\n\n  That is a serious and sobering reminder by the Secretary of Defense \nthat the American people expect the leaders of the country to \nunderstand that when we need our military, it is\n\n[[Page S4831]]\n\nthere, it is capable; that we are being fair with people we have put \ninto harm's way; and that we have given them the very best training and \nequipment possible.\n  By the way, my colleague from Arizona, John McCain, has visited Iraq, \nAfghanistan, and other places where our military men and women have \nbeen fighting for many years. One of the thoughts that always strikes \nme most about his observations when he returns is the quality of our \nfighting force--the quality of their equipment and their training. They \nare, clearly, the best military force ever fielded.\n  We expect that. We have come to expect it. But it doesn't happen \nautomatically. It requires stewardship, and we here in the Congress, as \nwell as the Presidents, are stewards of our national security and all \nof those who provide it. That is a lesson we can't forget, even in the \ncontext of a deficit and debt debate where we are trying desperately to \nfind more ways we can achieve savings.\n  When Secretary Gates spoke to the Notre Dame graduates on May 22, \nhere are a few of the things he said:\n\n       The lessons of history tell us we must not diminish our \n     ability or our determination to deal with the threats and the \n     challenges on the horizon, because ultimately they will need \n     to be confronted. If history--and religion--teach us \n     anything, it is that there will always be evil in the world, \n     people bent on aggression, oppression, satisfying their greed \n     for wealth and power and territory, or determined to impose \n     an ideology based on the subjugation of others and the denial \n     of liberty to men and women.\n\n  He continued:\n\n       . . . make no mistake, the ultimate guarantee against the \n     success of aggressors, dictators, and terrorists in the 21st \n     century, as in the 20th, is hard power--the size, strength, \n     and global reach of the United States military.\n\n  He also discussed what we are doing around the world, and he said \nthis:\n\n       All of these things happen mostly out of sight and out of \n     mind to the average American, and thus are taken for granted. \n     But they all depend on a properly armed, trained and funded \n     American military, which cannot be taken for granted.\n\n  He concluded those remarks by saying:\n\n       Throughout this process we should keep in mind historian \n     Donald Kagan's observation that the preservation of peace \n     depends upon those states seeking that goal having both \n     the preponderant power and the will to accept the burdens \n     and responsibilities required to achieve it. And we must \n     not forget what Winston Churchill once said, that ``the \n     price of greatness is responsibility . . . and the people \n     of the United States cannot escape world responsibility.''\n\n  Another way of saying this was one of Ronald Reagan's famous \nsayings--that the best way to preserve peace was to have strength. \n``Peace through strength.'' That is, when you become weaker, you tempt \nthe despots around the world to see whether they can gain some \nterritory or some advantage, and to make trouble. You are then playing \ncatchup, having to fight a problem that could have been avoided, \nperhaps, if that despot knew you had the strength and will to defeat \nhim if he had made any kind of aggressive move. Having the ability to \ndeter is at least as important as the ability to win if the fight \noccurs because you can avoid a lot of trouble, expense, casualties, and \nproblems if you deter aggression in the first place.\n  At North Dakota State University, in another commencement speech on \nMay 14, Secretary Gates said this:\n\n     . . . while I don't foresee a repeat of the Cold War days--\n     when we faced off against another military superpower--I \n     believe there is a growing competition underway for global \n     leadership and influence.\n\n  It was part of the same message he had spoken of earlier about the \nimportance to be prepared and why we should not just look to the \ndefense budget for savings; that we had to keep our priorities in mind. \nOne of those priorities was our role and responsibility around the \nworld, confirming again what he said, which was:\n\n       If the political leadership of this country decides that it \n     must reduce the investment in defense by hundreds of billions \n     of dollars, then I don't think we can afford to have anything \n     that is off the table.\n\n  It would seem to me that would include something such as food stamps. \nAgain, what Secretary Gates said was that ``defense had already cut as \nmuch as was advisable.''\n  All right. I get back to my original point. Maybe I am making too \nmuch of a casual observation of the President here, but when the \nPresident of the United States describes a core commitment as food \nstamps and says that, instead, the cuts we are making should be around \nareas such as defense spending, it tells me the President has his \npriorities turned around, that they are wrong. His first responsibility \nis to the American people as Commander in Chief, and our first \nresponsibility in the Congress is exactly the same--for the security of \nour country.\n  We are not going to be a strong country if we are bankrupt. One of \nthe key components to a strong defense is a strong economy so we can \ngenerate the wealth we need to produce the kind of military equipment \nand to field the kind of forces we need to protect our interests. That \nis why we are focusing so much on the deficit, on spending, and the \nlike. But when we talk about areas that need to be cut, let's remember \nwhat the former Secretary of Defense said--defense has been cut enough \nalready. If we are going to keep our commitments around the world, we \nhave to prioritize our spending. I submit that putting food stamps on a \nhigher level of commitment than the national security of the United \nStates is to grossly misplace our priorities. So I hope the President \nand others within the House and the Senate, in getting about the \nserious business of finding where we can make cuts--and we surely have \nto do that--will help to prioritize those things that are absolutely \ncritical and essential to the core of the United States; and those \nthings where, if we have the wealth to do them, we definitely should; \nand where we can make cuts, we need to; but that the end result of that \nequation, those tradeoffs, will mean the first priority is the security \nof the United States.\n  As we make our decisions here going forward, I will be speaking more \nabout the areas in which we have already slashed defense spending and \nthe areas in which, as Secretary Gates noted, defense spending is going \nto have to be enhanced if we are going to have the kind of force the \nAmerican people have come to rely upon.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \ntwo publications. One is from the Weekly Standard, dated July 18, by \nMax Boot; and the other is a piece by Jamie Fly, posted on July 8 on \nNational Review Online.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From weeklystandard.com, July 18, 2011]\n\n                            Grand Old Doves?\n\n                             (By Max Boot)\n\n       Opinion polls consistently show that the U.S. military is \n     the most trusted institution in America. Republicans have \n     benefited indirectly from that hard-won reputation because \n     since the 1970s they have been seen as the strong, hawkish \n     party, while Democrats have had to fight the stigma that they \n     are weak and dovish. Republicans wouldn't throw away that \n     aura--one of their strongest electoral assets--just to reach \n     a budget deal with President Obama. Or would they?\n       There are persistent and worrisome reports that they might. \n     The Hill newspaper, for instance, claims that Republican \n     budget negotiators have been discussing cutting defense by \n     $600 billion to $700 billion--considerably more than the \n     already indefensible $400 billion in cuts that Obama has said \n     he would like to see over the next decade.\n       Obama's proposed cuts are bad enough; as former Defense \n     Secretary Robert Gates implicitly warned before leaving \n     office, such deep reductions would seriously impair the \n     military's ability to meet its global commitments. Going \n     beyond what Obama has proposed is simply suicidal--on both \n     substantive and political grounds.\n       Start with substance: The defense budget did experience a \n     rapid increase during the past decade because of the post-9/\n     11 wars. But the budget is already shrinking--down from $708 \n     billion this fiscal year to $670 billion in the next fiscal \n     year. That's a $38 billion cut, and the budget will decline \n     even more as troops leave Iraq and Afghanistan.\n       Already the military is feeling the strain of maintaining \n     all of its commitments, including a new war in Libya. Those \n     who suggest, with a straight face, paring back a whopping \n     $700 billion more--even over the course of a number of \n     years--should be forced to explain which missions currently \n     performed by the U.S. armed forces they are willing to \n     sacrifice.\n       Should we completely pull out of Afghanistan? Even with the \n     overly hasty withdrawal of surge forces ordered by Obama, we \n     still will have 70,000 troops there at the end of next year, \n     costing at least $70 billion. Pulling out troops even faster \n     risks giving jihadists their biggest victory since 9/11.\n       Perhaps we should stop fighting pirates off the coast of \n     Africa? Stop fighting in Libya so\n\n[[Page S4832]]\n\n     that arch-terrorist Muammar Qaddafi can claim a victory over \n     the West? Stop targeting al Qaeda in Pakistan and Yemen and \n     elsewhere? Stop deterring China, North Korea, or Iran? Stop \n     patrolling the Persian Gulf through which much of the world's \n     oil flows? Stop fighting cyberattacks emanating from China \n     and Russia? Stop developing missile defenses to protect the \n     American homeland? Stop supporting Mexico and Colombia in \n     their fights against narcotraffickers? Stop holding military \n     exercises with friendly armed forces from Egypt to the \n     Philippines--exercises that allow us to exert soft power at \n     low cost?\n       Maybe advocates of budget cuts think we should continue \n     performing all, or most, of those missions with less \n     resources. But that's a cop-out. It's a recipe for stinting \n     on training and personnel, thus creating a ``hollow force'' \n     of the kind that we last saw in the late 1970s.\n       The reality is that there is no way the armed forces can \n     perform all, or even most, of their current missions with \n     less money. In fact, despite the growing spending of the past \n     decade for contingency operations, the military has already \n     cancelled a number of important procurement programs. These \n     include the Army's Future Combat System and the Air Force's \n     F-22, the best-in-the-world stealth fighter that was canceled \n     just before China unveiled its own stealth fighter.\n       For the most part, the armed forces remain reliant on \n     weapons systems designed in the 1960s and 1970s and procured \n     in the 1980s: aircraft such as the A-10, F-15, and F-16, \n     helicopters such as the Apache and Black Hawk, warships such \n     as Los Angeles-class submarines and Ticonderoga-class \n     cruisers, and armored vehicles such as Abrams tanks and \n     Bradley Fighting Vehicles. These are all superb weapons, but \n     they are rapidly aging--and are either being overtaken, or \n     soon will be, by competing models produced abroad that are \n     certain to fall into the hands of our enemies.\n       Moreover, competing powers such as China and Russia are \n     designing weapons such as computer bugs and antisatellite \n     missiles that could render much of our current equipment \n     useless. We will have to develop defenses. And that won't be \n     cheap.\n       At the same time, the Department of Defense must take care \n     of its people--our most precious asset. There are 1.5 million \n     active-duty military personnel, 750,000 civilian Defense \n     Department employees, and 1.5 million personnel in the \n     Reserves and National Guard. We already spend more on \n     personnel costs ($157 billion this year) than on weapons \n     procurement ($151 billion) and the imbalance is likely to \n     grow in future years, thereby making it even harder to \n     increase our power-projection capabilities. Yet Congress \n     rebuffed Gates's attempts to institute modest co-payments for \n     the fiscally unsustainable Tricare medical system. That was \n     deemed too politically sensitive.\n       This is part of a pattern: Congress finds it difficult or \n     impossible to cut specific defense programs because they all \n     have powerful constituencies. But mandating ``top-line'' cuts \n     may be politically palatable as part of a budget deal because \n     lawmakers won't have to make tough choices about which \n     programs to eliminate and which areas of the world to leave \n     undefended.\n       Cutting defense won't solve our budget woes. The ``core'' \n     defense budget, $553 billion, is small as a percentage of GDP \n     (3.7 percent) and of the federal budget (15 percent). Nor is \n     it the reason why we are piling up so much debt. To reduce \n     the deficit, lawmakers will have to do something about out-\n     of-control entitlement programs.\n       If Republicans acquiesce in ruinous cuts to the defense \n     budget, they will cease to be known as Ronald Reagan's heirs. \n     Instead they will be remembered as the party of William E. \n     Borah, Hamilton Fish III, and Gerald Nye. Remember those GOP \n     giants of the 1930s? They thought a strong defense was \n     unaffordable and unnecessary. But their reputations collapsed \n     on December 7, 1941, when we learned (not for the last time) \n     the price of unreadiness. That is a lesson today's \n     Republicans should remember as they negotiate over the \n     budget.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                       [From nationalreview.com]\n\n                   Short-Sightedness on Defense Cuts\n\n                           (By Jamie M. Fly)\n\n       As the debt-limit talks enter their final stages, reports \n     are emerging that significant defense cuts may be part of the \n     negotiated package. President Obama, for his part, already \n     proposed cutting $400 billion in security spending over 12 \n     years in his April 13 speech on fiscal policy. The White \n     House is now apparently trying not just to lock that \n     proposal in, but possibly convince Republicans to even go \n     beyond it via the debt-limit negotiations.\n       Now that Secretary of Defense Gates--who had warned of the \n     implications of the $400 billion in cuts--has left the \n     Pentagon, the White House is increasingly highlighting \n     defense as a potential source of significant savings.\n       On Wednesday, at his ``Twitter Town Hall,'' Obama said, \n     ``the nice thing about the defense budget is it's so big, \n     it's so huge, that a one percent reduction is the equivalent \n     of the education budget. Not--I'm exaggerating, but it's so \n     big that you can make relatively modest changes to defense \n     that end up giving you a lot of head room to fund things like \n     basic research or student loans or things like that.''\n       Obama's statement was very misleading. One percent of the \n     president's proposed defense budget for 2012 equals only a \n     fraction of his $77.4 billion education budget request--that \n     is, 7.1. percent. Also, the Obama administration has \n     significantly increased education funding (by more than 50 \n     percent), over the course of its three budgets, while defense \n     spending increases have barely matched the rate of inflation.\n       Indeed, defense has been targeted by the White House Office \n     of Management and Budget each year as the administration \n     compiled its budget requests. It has not been spared the axe \n     by the appropriators on Capitol Hill, who have consistently \n     funded defense at levels less than those requested by the \n     president. In fact, projected defense spending over the next \n     ten years in the current House budget resolution is already \n     $315 billion less than the amounts the Obama administration \n     projected in its FY2011 request.\n       All of this is despite the fact that the defense budget is \n     not the source of America's current fiscal woes. \n     Unfortunately, it appears that in the debt-limit talks, both \n     Republicans and Democrats are tempted to avoid the difficult \n     choices posed by significant entitlement reform. Instead, \n     they are contemplating going after defense spending, perhaps \n     assuming there is not a constituency to defend the defense \n     budget at a time when the nation is weary of overseas \n     commitments and many Americans want a renewed focus at home.\n       This short-sightedness is not a surprise coming from the \n     White House. It is, however, sad to see Republicans heading \n     down this path.\n       Congressional Republicans should ask themselves whether \n     they want to enter 2012 by surrendering the GOP's traditional \n     credibility on national security. If they endorse Obama's \n     ridiculous $400 billion in defense cuts--or even worse, agree \n     to deeper cuts--Republicans risk assisting the president's \n     management of American decline, just as the United States \n     enters a very turbulent and uncertain period.\n\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, it was 10 years ago that my office in \nChicago, IL, was contacted by a young woman. Theresa Lee, who is Korean \nby birth, had been part of something known as the Merit Music Program \nin Chicago. It is an amazing program. A lady in the later years of her \nlife decided to leave some money to a program that would offer to \nchildren in the public schools a musical instrument and instruction. \nHer belief was that many of these students would take up the offer and \nthat learning a musical instrument could be an important part of their \nfuture lives.\n  She was right. The Merit Music Program, at least as of last year, had \na 100-percent placement rating of graduates in college. It turned out \nthat giving a musical instrument to a young person and giving them a \nchance to develop that skill did a lot more than create music. It \ncreated self esteem, confidence, and a belief they could do something \nwith their lives, even for many students who were from poor families.\n  Ten years ago, the Merit Music Program contacted us and told us about \na young woman named Theresa Lee who was one of their star pupils. She \nhad learned piano and had graduated to a level of competence they had \nseldom seen in their program. In fact, she had played in a concert and \nnow, as she graduated from high school, she was accepted at several of \nthe major music schools around the United States, including Julliard. \nAs she filled out the application to go to school, though, she found \nout she ran into a problem. They asked on the application for the \nJulliard School of Music what her nationality or citizenship was.\n  She turned to her mother and said: What do I put down there?\n  Her mother said: Theresa, when we brought you to this country you \nwere 2 years old, and I never filed any papers. I don't know what your \nstatus is in terms of your nationality.\n  The mother was an American citizen. Her brother and sister were \nAmerican citizens. But she had never established her citizenship or \nclaim for citizenship.\n  At the age of 18, she contacted my office and asked: What should I \ndo?\n  We took a look at the law, and the law was very clear. Under the law \nof the United States of America, that young woman who came here at the \nage of 2 and had not filed any papers had to leave the United States \nand go to Brazil, which was the last country her parents traveled \nthrough on their way to America, and wait 10 years before she could \napply to become legal in America. It did not sound fair to me. Two-\nyear-olds do not have much voice in terms of whether they should file \npapers.\n  If anybody made a mistake, it was her parents, and they knew it. They \ncould not correct it, though, and the law did not correct it. The law \npunished her, ultimately sending her back to Korea, a place she could \nnever remember, with a language she did not speak.\n  So I introduced the DREAM Act, and the DREAM Act said: If you came to \nAmerica under the circumstance that if you are brought here as a child, \nif you grew up in this country and graduated from high school, if you \nhad no serious questions about your moral standing in the community, no \nserious problems with any criminal activity or background, we would \ngive you a chance--just a chance.\n  The chance was they could either enlist in our military for at least \n2 years or they could complete 2 years of college. If they did that, we \nwould allow them to work toward legal status. All along we would be \nasking the same questions as the years went by: Have you done anything \nthat would suggest to us that you should not be part of the United \nStates of America? That was the DREAM Act. I introduced the bill 10 \nyears ago.\n  An interesting story, what happened to Theresa. She went on to school \nat Julliard, and she did become an accomplished concert pianist. She \nhas played a concert at Carnegie Hall. She has now married an American \ncitizen, and she is legal in the United States. So the story had a \nhappy ending. But for many of these young people it has no happy \nending. They end up deported at the age of 18 or 19 because their \nparents did not file papers or could not file papers on their behalf.\n  That is why I introduced the DREAM Act, to give these young people a \nchance. Last month I chaired the first Senate hearing on the DREAM Act. \nThere was compelling testimony from a number of witnesses. The \nSecretary of the Department of Education, Arne Duncan, testified about \nthe talented students who would be eligible under the DREAM Act: the \nclass valedictorians, the star athletes, honor students, and leaders in \nROTC. Their options, however, are limited because they are \nundocumented. Secretary Duncan explained that the DREAM Act would make \nAmerica a better and stronger country by giving these young people a \nchance to fulfill their potential.\n  Dr. Clifford Stanley testified. He is the Under Secretary for \nPersonnel and Readiness from the Department of Defense. He testified \nthat the DREAM Act would strengthen our national security by giving \nthousands of highly qualified, well-educated young people a chance to \nenlist in the Armed Forces.\n  Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano also testified in favor \nof the DREAM Act and said this law would strengthen our homeland \nsecurity by allowing immigration agents to focus their time, attention, \nand resources on those who clearly are a danger in the United States \nand should be deported rather than on these young people who had never \nposed any threat to anyone.\n  LTC Margaret Stock, who taught immigration law at West Point Military \nAcademy, testified about important restrictions included in the DREAM \nAct to prevent abuse.\n  The most compelling testimony came from this young woman, Ola Kaso. \nOla Kaso was brought to the United States by her mother from Albania in \n1998 when she was 5 years old. Last month she graduated from high \nschool in Warren, MI, with a 4.4 grade point average. She has enrolled \nin the honors program at the University of Michigan as a pre-med \nstudent.\n  Ola has so much to contribute to America, but even today she faces \ndeportation back to Albania, a country she barely remembers, a country \nshe left when she was 5 years old.\n  She spoke for thousands of people just like her, young people who \ncall themselves now the Dreamers. I often come to the floor of the \nSenate to tell their stories, and today I want to tell you about three \nothers.\n  This is Tapiwa and Dominique Nkata. Tapiwa is on the left, Dominique \nis on the right. Their parents, John and Joan Nkata, brought the family \nto the United States from Malawi, in Africa, in 1990. At the time, \nTapiwa was 4 years old and Dominique was only 11 months old.\n  The Nkatas came here legally, so they had work permits. John, an \nordained Christian minister, worked as a Hospice counselor, his wife \nJoan worked as an accountant. The Nkatas filed papers to stay here \npermanently. For years their case was stuck in immigration court. \nFinally, in 2009 John and Joan Nkata were granted legal permanent \nresidency in the United States, but by this time Tapiwa and Dominique \nwere adults and unable to obtain legal status through their parents. \nHad the court moved more quickly and the decision made while they were \nstill children, there would be no question about their documented \nstatus.\n  Earlier this year these two young women were placed in deportation \nproceedings. Dominique sent me a letter, and here is what she said \nabout being deported to Malawi:\n\n       The looming fear of having everything I know, including \n     part of my family, here in the United States while I am \n     removed to the other side of the world, is crippling.\n\n  And Tapiwa wrote a letter and said:\n\n       I can't imagine my life in Africa. I am an American. I know \n     this culture and speak this language. I pledge allegiance to \n     this flag.\n\n\n[[Page S4834]]\n\n\n  The Department of Homeland Security decided to give a 1-year stay in \ntheir deportation to Tapiwa and Dominique. I think that was the right \nthing to do. It would just be wrong to send these young women, who grew \nup in America and have so much to contribute, back to Malawi, a country \nthey don't even remember.\n  Tapiwa is now 25. In 2007--listen to this--Tapiwa--on the left here--\ngraduated summa cum laude from the University of Cincinnati with a \ndegree in finance. For the past 2 years she worked at an accounting \nfirm and dreams of being a certified public accountant. She cannot as \nlong as she is undocumented. In her letter to me she said what America \nmeans to her:\n\n       Quite simply, when you say `The American Dream' all around \n     the world they know what you are talking about.People who \n     have never been to our shores, eaten our food, or even spoken \n     our language have heard of a prosperous nation that above all \n     else grants freedom and rights to all people.\n\n  Dominique, on the right, is now 21. Last month she graduated from the \nUniversity of Cincinnati with a double degree in chemistry and \npremedicine. She is now working at University Hospital and the Jewish \nHospital in the research department as a clinical studies assistant. \nDominique is studying for the MCAT and plans to apply to medical school \nwhen her immigration status is resolved.\n  Dominique told me:\n\n       I dream of being a doctor and giving back to a country that \n     has given so much to me.\n\n  So would America be better off if Tapiwa and Dominique are deported \nto Malawi or if they are allowed to continue to stay in the United \nStates realizing their dreams and making us a better nation?\n  Let me introduce you to another dreamer. This is Jose Magana. He has \na big smile on his face. Jose was brought to the United States from \nMexico when he was 2 years old. Jose grew up in Arizona. He graduated \nas the valedictorian of his high school class. He enrolled in Arizona \nState University, becoming the first member of his family to attend \ncollege. Then Arizona passed a law prohibiting public universities from \ngiving financial aid or instate tuition rates to undocumented students. \nHundreds of students were forced to drop out of school. But Jose \npersevered. He found his calling on the speech and debate team where he \nranked fifth in the Nation.\n  In 2008 Jose Magana graduated summa cum laude from Arizona State \nUniversity with a major in business management. Jose couldn't work \nbecause of his legal status, so he went to law school. Next year Jose \nwill graduate from Baylor University Law School in Waco, TX.\n  Despite his potential to give to this country, Jose will not be able \nto work as a lawyer because of his undocumented status. Jose sent me a \nletter, and here is what he said:\n\n       The worst part of being undocumented is the fact that \n     legally the United States is not considered my home. I have \n     not been to Mexico since I left when I was 2 years old. I \n     don't have any friends or close family in Mexico. If I were \n     to be deported, it would literally be like being thrown into \n     a foreign country with a different language and culture. The \n     United States is my home. I want to give back to this country \n     I love.\n\n  Could we use someone with Jose's talent in America? Of course we \ncould. For the last 10 years I have been working on the DREAM Act. \nThere has been one constant: I have had the support not only of my \ncolleagues in the Senate, but I have also had the support of the \nlegislators across the United States. The faith community supports the \nDREAM Act because it is based on a fundamental moral principle that is \nshared by every religious tradition, and it is this: It is wrong to \npunish children for the actions of their parents.\n  Earlier this month I held a press conference to announce DREAM \nSabbath. The DREAM Sabbath will take place this fall on Friday, \nSeptember 23; Saturday, the 24th; and Sunday, the 25th. On the DREAM \nSabbath, churches, synagogues, mosques, and temples around the country \nwill be asked to dedicate time during their regular weekly worship \nservice to have a conversation about the DREAM Act. When I announced \nthe DREAM Sabbath, I was joined by religious leaders from a variety of \nfaith traditions. One of my real heroes and friends, Cardinal Theodore \nMcCarrick, a good friend, who has been in the fight for social justice \nfor years; Bishop Minerva Carcano, the first Hispanic woman to be \nelected bishop in the Methodist Church; Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, the \npresident of the Nation's largest Hispanic Christian organization, with \nmore than 30,000 member churches; Rev. Derrick Harkins, pastor of one \nof the most prominent African-American churches in our Nation's \nCapital; Rabbi Lisa Grushcow, representing the Hebrew Immigrant Aid \nSociety; and Imam Mohamed Magid, the head of the Nation's largest \nMuslim organization.\n  Mr. President, I want to enter into the Congressional Record the \nstatements of two religious leaders who participated in that DREAM \nSabbath announcement: Sister Simmone Campbell, executive director of \nNETWORK of the Catholic Social Justice Organization; and Bishop Richard \nGraham of the Lutheran Church.\n  I ask unanimous consent that those two statements be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DURBIN. In her statement, Sister Campbell quotes the prophet \nJoel, who spoke of our sons and daughters as prophets. Sister Campbell \nsaid:\n\n       Our sons and daughters are prophesying to us. They are \n     telling us of a way that our nation should go in order to be \n     whole, to be creative, to lead into the twenty-first century. \n     We, the older generation, need to listen and act. Congress \n     needs to enact the DREAM Act.\n\n  At the DREAM Act Sabbath announcement, we were joined by Gaby \nPacheco. Gaby has become a great friend of mine. She is a wonderful \nyoung lady. She is one of the leaders of the DREAM Act students. Her \nparents brought her to America from Ecuador when she was 7 years old. \nShe was the highest ranking Junior ROTC student in her high school. The \nAir Force tried to recruit Gaby. She was unable to enlist because she \ndoes not have legal status in the United States. She was brought here \nas a child. She is working on her bachelor's degree in special \neducation and wants to teach autistic children.\n  I met her last year after she and three other DREAM Act students \nliterally walked 1,500 miles from Miami, FL, to Washington, DC, to \nraise awareness of the DREAM Act. Along the way these four students \nwere joined by hundreds of supporters who came out to welcome them. \nThey called their trip the Trail of Dreams.\n  The goal of the DREAM Sabbath is to put a human face on the plight of \nthe undocumented students, like Gaby, and educate America about the \nDREAM Act and, of course, the ultimate goal is to build up support to \npass the DREAM Act. DREAM Act students need more than our prayers; they \nneed our help. They need our help to pass the DREAM Act. Dreamers like \nTapiwa and Dominique Nkata, Jose Magana, Ola Kaso, and Gaby Pacheco are \nAmericans in their hearts. They have stood every day in the classrooms \nacross America, pledging allegiance to our flag and singing the only \nNational Anthem they know to the only country they know, a country that \nthey love.\n  They are willing to serve in our military. They are willing to pursue \nan education to add to a better America. All they need is the \npermission slip of Congress to give them that chance. I ask my \ncolleagues to support the DREAM Act. It is the right thing to do. It \nwill make America stronger.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                   [From the Network, July 12, 2011]\n\n        Statement by Sister Simone Campbell, Executive Director\n\n       I have worried that the DREAM Act has been mis-named. \n     Calling something a DREAM indicates that it is not real, has \n     no substance, is far beyond reality. That has led me to \n     wonder if it is actually making getting the legislation \n     passed more difficult because everyone thinks dreams don't \n     really come true.\n       Then I met students who would qualify for an earned path to \n     citizenship if the bill passes. I found out that their dreams \n     are rooted in the daily reality of their lives. They work to \n     learn, support their families, encourage siblings and \n     friends. They strive for better lives for themselves, their \n     families and their communities. They work daily to make \n     dreams come true.\n       This brought me to the realization that perhaps it is just \n     in Washington where the American dream has become fantasy. \n     The American dream has been built on the imagination and toil \n     of immigrants. Our nation has prospered because of the \n     innovation and creativity of all of the people who have come\n\n[[Page S4835]]\n\n     to create something new. In Washington it is tempting to \n     forget the vision in exchange for partisan wrangling. This is \n     wrong. We must step away from cynicism that second guesses \n     every action and embrace the founding spirit of our nation.\n       As a person of faith I hold to the prophet Joel echoed in \n     the Acts of the Apostles trusting that the day will come when \n     ``Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your young men will \n     see visions, your old men will dream dreams.'' Our sons and \n     daughters are prophesying to us. They are telling us of a way \n     that our nation should go in order to be whole, to be \n     creative, to lead into the twenty-first century. It is now \n     time for the ``old men'' (and women) of Congress to dream \n     their dream and take this first step toward comprehensive \n     immigration reform. We the older generation need to listen \n     and act. Congress needs to enact the DREAM Act this year.\n                                  ____\n\n\n   Statement of the Rev. Richard Graham, Bishop of the Metropolitan \n   Washington, DC Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America\n\n       As the bishop of the Metropolitan Washington, DC Synod of \n     the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, ELCA, I strongly \n     support the Development, Relief and Education for Alien \n     Minors, DREAM Act. The DREAM Act is critical legislation that \n     would provide lawful permanent residency to undocumented \n     youth who attend college or serve in the U.S. military for \n     two years. DREAM Act supporters include President Obama, a \n     number of former President George W. Bush administration \n     officials, and the ELCA Presiding Bishop, the Rev. Mark S. \n     Hanson.\n       Last year I joined Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service \n     and Lutheran leaders to urge Congress to pass the DREAM Act. \n     Although I was disappointed that the Senate failed to pass \n     the bill, I stand committed to working with congregations in \n     my synod to advance just and humane solutions for these \n     ambitious and talented young people.\n       The DREAM Act is envisioned to bear fruit for young people \n     who came to this country as children. They are Americans in \n     every way except that they are not U.S. citizens. The DREAM \n     Act would provide a path to U.S. citizenship for children who \n     arrived in the United States before the age of 16, graduate \n     high school or receive a GED, go to college or serve in the \n     military and demonstrate that they are of good moral \n     character. These young people should be allowed a path to \n     become U.S. citizens because they have already proven that \n     they are Americans and they should not be deported back to a \n     country they do not know.\n       This issue is important to Lutherans in the United States. \n     Lutherans and Lutheran congregations have strong immigrant \n     roots. Almost all Lutherans can remember back a generation or \n     two to when their grandparents or great grandparents \n     struggled as new immigrants in this country. It is this \n     immigrant tradition and our commitment to welcoming the \n     stranger, regardless of immigration status, that compels the \n     ELCA to support and call for the immediate passage of the \n     DREAM Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/22/senate-section/article/S4835-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4835-S4836]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO DOUG AURAND\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to thank a friend \nof mine who is leaving public service soon after more than four decades \nof service in Winnebago County, IL. Doug Aurand won his first political \nrace in 1970 when he was elected Winnebago County treasurer. Truth be \ntold, he wasn't supposed to win that race. The voters of Winnebago \nCounty had not elected a Democrat to a countywide position in 138 \nyears. Apparently, nobody told Doug. He ran as a write-in candidate and \ncampaigned in his first election like it was the most important race he \ncould possibly run.\n  He filled out the campaign schedule every day by knocking on every \ndoor and talking to every voter he could find. When the votes were \ncounted on election night, Doug Aurand made history by becoming the \nfirst Democratic treasurer in Winnebago County, IL. He was reelected \nseven times.\n  Doug Aurand was born in Dixon, IL, hometown of Ronald Reagan, and he \nwas every bit as proud to be a Democrat as President Reagan was to be a \nRepublican. But Doug never allowed his political affiliation to \ninfluence the way he treated his constituents. When you walked into the \ncounty treasurer's office in Rockford, you weren't Republican or \nDemocrat; you were a taxpayer who deserved straight answers, good \nservice, and respect. That is how Doug saw it, and that is why voters \nreelected him to the treasurer's office many times.\n  Two stories will tell you what kind of treasurer he was. One of the \nfirst actions Doug took as county treasurer was to put the local banks \non notice that they would have to bid for Winnebago County's bank \nbusiness. No more awarding the county's banking business on the basis \nof friendship and political connections. Whichever bank offered the \nhighest interest rates would get the job. Competitive investing brought \ntens of millions of dollars and higher interest payments to the county, \na real savings for taxpayers.\n  Doug also whittled down his staff. When he came in there were 30 \npeople. By the time he left, they were down to 9, and their service \nnever suffered.\n  Another example of the sort of treasurer Doug was, in the late 1970s \nan elderly man came in the office to pay his tax bill, and he pulled \nout a big bag of coins. He was literally counting his coins to pay his \ntax bill. Doug went up to say hello to him, and he noticed that the \ncoins were all silver--mercury dollars and silver dollars--valuable \ncollector's items.\n  Doug told the man his coins were worth more than face value, and he \ndidn't just stop there. He arranged for a professional appraisal of the \ncoins. In the end, not only was the elderly man able to pay his tax \nbill, but he also took home a nest egg. That is the kind of \nconscientious public servant Doug Aurand is.\n  In 1999 Doug announced he was stepping down after 28\\1/2\\ years as \ncounty treasurer. At that time he was in a life-and-death struggle with \nsmoking-related cancer and his prognosis was not good. He defied the \nodds, beat cancer, resumed his political career, winning election as \nHarlem Township supervisor and a Winnebago County board member.\n  After 10 years, he lost his reelection bid to the county board last \nNovember, and he will step down from the Harlem Township board next \nmonth. It will be shortly after his 70th birthday, leaving behind 40 \nyears and 8 months of public service.\n  Doug Aurand grew up on a farm in rural Winnebago County. He was one \nof six kids, including three foster children. His family raised \nminiature horses. Doug's dad also worked in the factory. Doug served in \nthe Air Force during the Vietnam war, came home and started working as \na mail carrier. That is when he got the political bug.\n  Federal law prohibits public employees from running for office, so \nDoug gave up the security of the Postal Service job for the insecurity \nof public life.\n  He is a passionate supporter of ordinary working people and the \nAmerican labor movement, and he considers himself a fiscal conservative \nwhen it comes to saving taxpayers money. Ask Doug's friend who his \npolitical hero is in life, and he will tell you one name: Hubert \nHoratio Humphrey. Doug is a happy warrior. He loves politics, shaking \nhands, talking to voters, and debating the issues.\n  The high point of his year was at the Winnebago County Fair where he \nspent hours and hours talking to every one of the visitors at the fair.\n  Doug gives back to the community in ways other than politics. Only 2 \npercent of the boys who enter the Boy Scouts ever make it to Eagle \nScout. I was in the other 98 percent, Doug was one of those in the 2 \npercent. He was an Eagle Scout leader for more than 30 years. He has \nbeen a leader and friend to hundreds of Eagle Scouts. Doug and his wife \nJulie have attended scores of graduations and weddings of Doug's former \nEagle Scouts.\n  He also speaks frequently to young people about the health dangers of \nsmoking, which he learned through his own life experience. Cancer cost \nDoug Aurand a small part of his tongue. That would have been a loss for \nany of us who fancy ourselves to be public speakers, and for Doug it \npresented some special challenges. But Doug's problem wasn't in his \nexpression and diction; it was in his mastery of malapropisms. Everyone \nwho knows him has a favorite example of Doug's creative way with words. \nOne common ``Dougism: In speaking about events that are over and done \nand can't be changed, he often refers to ``water over the bridge'' or \n``water under the dam.'' Another friend says his favorite is the way \nDoug pronounces the word ``protege.'' He calls it ``proto-joy.''\n\n  Because of Doug's decades of service as a public officeholder, Eagle \nScout leader and friend to so many, Doug Aurand does indeed have \n``proto-joys'' all across Winnebago County and beyond.\n  Doug and his wife Julie are going to retire in Florida, but their \ninfluence will continue to be felt in Illinois for\n\n[[Page S4836]]\n\nyears to come. Julie's famous donkey cookies--and she always had a box \nwaiting for me when I got up to Rockford--are certainly going to be \nmissed by this Senator.\n  In closing, I wish Doug a happy 70th birthday and happy retirement. I \nthank Julie, the Aurand children, David and Christine, and the \ngrandchildren, Bill and Tom, for sharing their husband, father, and \ngrandfather with the people of Illinois and Winnebago County. Doug \nAurand's service to America has made a real difference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, there are so many things here we can \ndisagree about, but I wish to say thank you to all of my colleagues. \nOne hundred of us have joined together in overwhelming numbers to \nsupport this historic legislation which creates a national moment of \nremembrance to commemorate the tragedy of 9/11.\n  Few events, if any, have done more to change the course of American \nhistory as much as the horrifying terrorist attacks on September 11, \n2001--nearly 10 years ago. It was one of the worst days in American \nhistory on our soil--a day that placed a permanent cloud over America \nand the free world. Few, if any, Americans can forget where they were \nthat fateful Tuesday morning when our country was gripped with shock \nand disbelief and it felt as though our world had turned upside down.\n  I was traveling at the time. I was in the Middle East. When the news \ncame that an airplane struck the trade towers, the first conclusion I \ncame to was it was a stray airplane from a nearby airfield, and that \nwas it. But the news\n\n[[Page S4837]]\n\nkept coming, and people in the streets of the city I was in were \ntearing at the terrible news about what happened to America.\n  Almost 3,000 people, including more than 700 people from my own State \nof New Jersey, were brutally massacred in that attack. That is more \nAmerican lives lost than on D-day when thousands of Americans stormed \nNormandy.\n  Many of the victims were hard at work. On a typical weekday, 50,000 \npeople worked in the Twin Towers, with another 200,000 passing through \nas visitors. It is impossible to believe that these towering \nfacilities, with their huge infrastructure, could be burned, melted, \nand brought to the ground. Many of the people who lost their lives lost \nthem saving others, including 343 firefighters, 60 police officers, and \nother first responders, as they answered the call of others who \ndesperately needed their help. Some became heroes that day, such as \nthose on United Flight 93, who took on the hijackers who were in the \naisles to try and bring that airplane to its target. But the people \nstood up and fought against them--heroes, brave and courageous--to \nprevent that airplane from reaching its intended target.\n  Tragically, a decade after the Twin Towers fell, the toll of 9/11 is \nstill climbing. More than 85,000 first responders, cleanup workers, and \ncommunity residents are dealing with the aftermath of this tragedy. \nThere are victims who are being monitored or receiving medical \ntreatment after breathing the toxic fumes and the dust at Ground Zero.\n  As we all know, the wounds that came from 9/11 are not just physical. \nwitnesses of the tragedy saw people jumping from high stories of the \nbuildings because they could no longer stand the heat, the smoke. The \nwitnesses of the tragedy, the thousands of survivors who narrowly \nescaped the attacks, and the families of the victims who will never see \ntheir loved ones again still bear the scars of that awful day.\n  Life changed in countless ways for all Americans on September 11, \naffecting every move we make. All of us are reminded of 9/11's legacy \nalmost every day as we wait in line to present our ID when we travel, \ngo to work, or when we hear news of further attempts on the lives of \nAmericans.\n  There are approximately 50,000 baggage checkers and screeners working \nevery day to keep us safe at airports across the country. In fact, the \nFederal Department of Homeland Security--created in the wake of 9/11--\nhas more than 230,000 employees and spends more than $40 billion each \nyear protecting us from similar onslaughts.\n  As is Pearl Harbor, 9/11 can be described as a day that will live in \ninfamy. With Pearl Harbor, with all of its pain and sacrifice, an end \nto that conflict finally came and normalcy was restored to our country \nafter some years. But our enemy today continues its search for ways to \nbring pain and suffering to Americans. They keep searching for \ntechnology and weapons, and 10 years later we are still fighting them.\n  As we near the 10th anniversary of 9/11, it is important for us to \nremember what brought us to this point. That is why I am so proud and \ngrateful to see the Senate unanimously approve this legislation, \nwhich--as we approach the 10th anniversary of 9/11--calls on our \ncountry to pause on September 11 for a moment of remembrance. What is \nplanned is that at 1 p.m. eastern time that day, all Americans will be \ncalled upon to cease all work and activity and spend a moment in \nsilence reflecting on what happened on 9/11, 2001. Our local, State, \nand national institutions--from sports teams and railroads to \nbroadcasters and places of worship--will be called upon to mark this \nminute with church bells or sirens to recall the honor of those \nvictims. This will be a striking symbol of American solidarity, \nsignaling to the world that we remain united against those who threaten \nour freedom. It will also be a powerful nationwide expression of \nAmerica's patriotic spirit and our refusal to forget the thousands of \ninnocent lives we lost in the destruction of 9/11.\n  Many of us recall the love of country we experienced in the days and \nweeks and months after the attacks in 2001. During that period, it \nseemed as though everywhere we turned, we saw an American flag. As a \nnation, we were willing to set aside our differences to mourn our \nlosses and mourn the losses of friends and acquaintances and neighbors, \nand we decided to work together to defeat those who threaten our way of \nlife. I believe the national moment of remembrance can help us \nrecapture that spirit of unity and remind everyone how strong we are \nwhen we stand together.\n  I thank my colleagues for the outpouring of support for this \nlegislation and hope they will be able to encourage their constituents \nto participate in this moment of remembrance. Every Member of the \nSenate joined together as cosponsors to create this moment of \nremembrance, representing all political views in every corner of this \ngreat Nation. We want everybody to participate, including State and \nlocal governments, the military, veterans organizations, the news \nmedia, houses of worship, and sports teams.\n  The 9/11 Moment of Remembrance will be a way to pay tribute to the \nlives lost and forever changed by the events in Pennsylvania, the \nPentagon, and at Ground Zero. Let there be no doubt: 9/11 changed our \ncountry forever, and a tragedy of this magnitude demands memory and \nvigilance. As a nation, we must keep alive the memories of the many \ncourageous Americans we lost that day. We must be vigilant on behalf of \nthe thousands of families who suffered incalculable losses--losses that \nmust never be forgotten. During the past decade, through our pain and \nsorrow has come the realization that this vigilance must be maintained \nso nothing like that can happen again.\n  So once again I say thank you to my colleagues for supporting this \nmeasure. It will send a powerful signal to the rest of the world and \nremind us how strong America is when we all stand together.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor, and note the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/22/senate-section/article/S4837-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4837-S4839]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CUT, CAP, AND BALANCE\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the American people deserve an accounting \nof what happened on the floor this morning. The citizens of Utah, whom \nI am honored to represent, and citizens all over this country thought \nthe Senate would be voting on the cut, cap, and balance bill later this \nweek. I am an original cosponsor of this bill in the Senate. I have \nsigned the cut, cap, and balance pledge. I have always supported a \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution.\n  This year, it is one of my proudest achievements to have introduced \nS. J. Res. 10, a balanced budget amendment that is supported by every \nRepublican in this body for the first time in all the balanced budget \namendments brought to this floor. It is the strongest balanced budget \namendment ever written--one that fundamentally deals with our spending \ncrisis. I am honored to have worked with my colleague and friend from \nUtah, Senator Lee, in crafting this amendment. We worked with Senator \nCornyn and 44 other Republicans as well. I am honored to be working \nwith old and new friends, such as Senators Cornyn, Kyl, Paul, Toomey, \nRubio, and many other Republicans in pursuing this constitutional \namendment for the American people.\n  The cut, cap, balance legislation the Senate tabled today culminates \nin a balanced budget amendment, but also includes the short-term \ndeficit reduction that families and markets are demanding.\n  Cut, cap, balance provides meaningful deficit reduction for the next \nyear and spending caps for the years that follow. It sets us on a path \ntoward a balanced budget. It addresses the gross overspending of the \nFederal Government in the short term, taking on the deficits and debt \nthat are holding back economic growth and permanently burdening \nAmerican families and businesses.\n  Most importantly, cut, cap, balance would fix the problem of \ngovernment overspending permanently. It would\n\n[[Page S4838]]\n\neliminate the bias in Washington for ever more spending by requiring \nCongress to send a balanced budget constitutional amendment to the \nStates for ratification prior to any increase in the debt ceiling.\n  The more the American people hear about this plan, the more they like \nit. They know the President has no plan. They know the markets are done \nwith promises to cut spending down the road. They know raising taxes is \nnot the solution to a government spending problem. The President and \ncongressional Democrats know the people know this. That is why they \nhave pulled out all the stops to kill this bill's momentum.\n  The President threatened to veto cut, cap, balance. But that did not \ndo the trick. So after the House passed cut, cap, balance, the \nPresident all of a sudden supported the so-called Gang of 6 proposal. \nHis advisers knew they had a problem. All of his clever talk about \nraising taxes on oil companies and corporate jets and yachts was not \ndistracting the American people from a simple fact: My friends on the \nother side of the aisle have no credible plan for balancing the budget. \nThe President has no credible plan for balancing the budget. He has not \noffered anything that would help us get to a balanced budget, nor do I \nbelieve he ever will offer anything. They have speeches and executive \nsummaries of bills that will be written down the road; they have plans \nand proposals for future spending cuts that remain a mystery to \neveryone; they have budget frameworks; but they have no plan.\n  The chairman of the Senate Budget Committee has a budget outline. But \nhere is the Senate Democratic caucus budget proposal. Let me refer to \nthis goose egg up here on the chart. That is the Democratic caucus \nbudget proposal--a big goose egg.\n  As meager as this is, I have to hand it to them, it beats the \nPresident's budget proposal. The President has offered us nothing, and \nwe have a big goose egg here in the Senate.\n  The American people are done with this. The people of Utah know the \nsame people who brought you the stimulus--the policy equivalent of \ntaking $1 trillion in taxpayer dollars and throwing it into the Potomac \nRiver--the same people who brought you $2.6 trillion in new spending \nand $\\1/2\\ trillion in new taxes with Obamacare, are not credible when \nthey now boast of their commitment to deficit reduction and balanced \nbudgets.\n  The most recent proposal is from the Gang of 6. We are still looking \nat this proposal. I will not condemn anyone who makes a good-faith \neffort to get to the bottom of our serious problems. Their efforts \nmight be on the side of the angels, but the devil is in the details, \nand many of us have real questions about this proposal. Specifically, \nwe want to know what the revenue impact will be, because by some \naccounts it will raise taxes by between $2 trillion and $3 trillion.\n  At the very least, the American people understand that the \nPresident's desperate embrace of this plan is to avoid, once again, \ndealing with the deficit. Whatever its substantive merits or demerits, \nthis proposal is a commitment to dealing with deficit reduction later. \nBut later is too late. We need to deal with deficit reduction now. The \npeople of this Nation are telling us this over and over. They are \nlighting up the Capitol switchboard. I am confident that my colleagues \non the other side are hearing the message loudly and clearly: Balance \nthe budget now. Get spending under control now. A last minute op-ed \nfrom the President telling us to ``go big'' on a debt deal is a little \ntoo late. We are facing our third straight year of trillion dollar \ndeficits. Our debt is now over $14.3 trillion.\n  The President has shown no serious signs of getting this fiscal \ncrisis under control. He offered up a dead-on-arrival budget in \nFebruary. When even his friends in the mainstream media panned his \nbudget for its total lack of attention to our looming debt crisis, he \noffered his budget mulligan with a much ballyhooed speech on deficit \nreduction. But a speech is not a plan. Meanwhile, it has been over 800 \ndays since Senate Democrats have produced a budget, thus abdicating \ntheir most basic of duties.\n  The American people are finished with this dithering. They know what \nthe solution is. The President and the majority leader no doubt saw the \npolling yesterday on the cut, cap, balance plan.\n  Here is the bottom line: Nearly two-thirds of the American people \nsupport it. But that is only half the story. Here is the rest: Everyone \nlikes cut, cap, balance--not just Republicans, not just Democrats. It \nmakes sense.\n  American families want deficit reduction, and with this plan they get \nit. No vague platitudes or speeches or rallies about reducing the \ndeficit. This plan reduces the deficit and it fixes the underlying \nproblem, which is Washington's predisposition toward more spending.\n  The President frequently demands that Congress put partisanship aside \nand come to a deficit reduction agreement. But the American people are \none step ahead of them. The cut, cap, balance plan, along with the \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution, wins support across the \nboard. Sixty-three percent of Democrats back cut, cap, balance. Fifty-\nthree percent of those who oppose the tea party support it.\n  Democrats threw everything they had at this bill. They absurdly \ncalled it the ``cut, cap, and destroy Medicare plan.'' What bull. The \nleft is becoming a caricature of itself when it comes to demagoguery on \nthe issue of Medicare. I think the American people have caught on that \nliberals claim that when the Republicans turn on the lights in the \nmorning, they are working to destroy Medicare. Bull. These claims no \nlonger have credibility. The left is out of talking points. Their \nconstituents are telling them to pass cut, cap, balance. They know it \nwon't destroy anything. It will save this country.\n  So instead of having a vote on it, Democrats decided to pull the plug \non the vote. Ordinarily, it is not a good idea to actively undermine \nthe will of the people.\n  But in this case, there is a method to their madness. The President \nand his hard-left supporters are in a real pickle. They refuse any \nstructural reforms to our biggest spending programs--the programs that \nare driving our country toward a fiscal collapse--but they know they \ncannot come clean with the American people about the tax increases that \nwill hit squarely on the middle class if these structural reforms fail \nto occur. So they do nothing. Unable to talk straight with citizens who \nare demanding a balanced budget, they do nothing. They focus on $21 \nbillion in tax benefits that go to energy companies over 10 years when \nwe have a $1.5 trillion deficit this year--this year.\n  This is how Peter Roff at U.S. News and World Report put it:\n\n       The president and congressional Democratic leaders are \n     still dug in, trying to pull a rabbit out of their hat that \n     will get them what the political coalition behind them \n     demands: new taxes, new spending, and no real cuts.\n\n  This is not going to happen. So unable to thread the needle between \nthe President's hard-left base that refuses spending reductions and the \nmajority of taxpayers demanding deficit reduction, what do they do? \nThey punt.\n  Today, they managed to avoid a vote on the bipartisan cut, cap, and \nbalance plan. There was a great deal of bluster surrounding this dodge. \nTo distract the American people from the fact that they were running \nfrom a fight, the rhetoric was laid on pretty thick. This is what we \nheard about this bill. According to my friends on the other side, cut, \ncap, and balance is ``as weak and senseless as anything that has ever \ncome on this Senate floor.'' It is ``anathema to what our country is \nall about.'' This is ``some of the worst legislation in the history of \nthis country.'' Now, let's be clear what they are talking about. They \nare smearing a bill that would balance the budget. They are trashing a \nbill that requires a balanced budget constitutional amendment.\n  I personally am glad to know where the other side stands, but they do \nnot stand with the American people. They certainly don't stand with my \nhome State of Utah. The American people think balancing the budget is \nprecisely what America is all about. Reining in spending, restoring the \nConstitution, and securing the liberty and prosperity of America's \nfamilies is exactly what Congress should be doing.\n  I am disappointed in what happened here today, but I am also \nconfident this fight is not over. The left might be able\n\n[[Page S4839]]\n\nto hide from a vote on balancing the budget by a simple motion to \ntable--which they are hoping obscures their desire to not balance the \nbudget--but they cannot hide from the markets and the legacy of debt \nPresident Obama has given this country because that is a real threat to \nour credit rating.\n  Yesterday, Standard & Poor's made clear that avoiding the default was \nonly one variable in their rating of U.S. credit. This is what Standard \n& Poor's said:\n\n       We have previously stated our belief that there is a \n     material risk that efforts to reduce future budget deficits \n     will fall short of the target set by Congressional leaders \n     and the administration. In this light, we see at least a one-\n     in-two likelihood that we could lower the long-term rating by \n     one or more notches on the U.S. within the next three months \n     and potentially as soon as early August . . . if we conclude \n     that Washington hasn't reached what we consider to be a \n     credible agreement to address future budget deficits.\n\n  Now, after years of reckless spending by President Obama and his \nDemocratic allies, the chickens are coming home to roost. We face an \nimminent debt crisis, and a failure to take it on will impose a \ncrushing burden on America's families and businesses. Our economy is \nstagnant, and the failure of the President to lead on deficit reduction \nnow threatens higher interest rates and will slow it even further.\n  This is Standard & Poor's analysis of the impact of a debt downgrade \ndue to a failure of deficit reduction:\n\n       We assume that under this scenario we would see a moderate \n     rise in long-term interest rates (25-50 basis points), \n     despite an accommodative Fed, due to an ebbing of market \n     confidence, as well as some slowing of economic growth (25-50 \n     basis points on GDP growth) amid an increase in consumer and \n     business caution.\n\n  For an economy that is slogging along with anemic growth and job \ncreation, this warning should wake people up. It should make the \nPresident and the left get serious about deficit reduction. But, \ninstead, the President is still casting about for a plan.\n  It is important to remind people that we have a plan. It is called \ncut, cap, and balance. It culminates in a balanced budget amendment to \nthe Constitution, and it is supported broadly by the American people. \nSome folks on the other side claim to be for a balanced budget. They \nclaim to stand with the people. But on a party-line vote they voted to \ntable this proposal today.\n  When America's Founders came together in the summer of 1787 to draft \nour Constitution, they faced many challenges. But at heart they had a \nrespect for republican government, they had a respect for the sovereign \npower of the American people, and they understood that the fundamental \nprinciple of popular sovereignty gave the Constitution its legitimacy. \nFor that reason, the Constitution they wrote was clear that the voice \nof the people should be loudest on the most pressing issues.\n  The provisions for amending the Constitution provided that on the \nmost important issues, the people rule directly. The Constitution \nbelongs to the people. It only became law because it was ratified by \nthe people, and it can only be changed by the people.\n  Our Nation is deeply in debt, and this debt now threatens the very \nliberty of our families and the vitality of our economy. It is a threat \nto current and future prosperity. Most importantly, it is a threat to \nlimited constitutional government. The people know this. They know it \nin their guts. They know the problem here is spending. Our problem is \ntoo much spending, not too little taxation, and they know what the \nsolution is: cut, cap, balance, and a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution.\n  There will be talk now about moving on, but I am not moving on. \nDemocrats want to write the obituary on this bill and turn to some new \nplan or framework this President produces one way or the other, I \nguess. But no plan this President produces will get us to balance. Cut, \ncap, and balance does.\n  I am not so sure what my friends on the other side are afraid of. The \nfounder of their party, Thomas Jefferson, had a deep respect for the \ndemocratic process and the sovereignty of the people. What are they so \nafraid of? Why not pass cut, cap, and balance? Why not send a balanced \nbudget amendment to the States for ratification? If liberals have a \nbetter argument, they can lead a fight against the amendment in the \nStates. All they need is 13 States to defeat the balanced budget \namendment. Why not let the people decide?\n  During the last Presidential campaign, the President frequently told \nhis admirers: Yes, we can. Well, now the American people are saying it \nback to him. They are telling him they want to balance the budget and \nthat we can balance the budget. We can and we should pass cut, cap, and \nbalance and send a balanced budget constitutional amendment to the \nStates for ratification.\n  I will just repeat it: If the Democrats so hate the idea of a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget, all they have to do is \nget 13 States to vote against ratification. We have to get 38 States to \nvote for ratification. That may seem like an overwhelming job, but I \ndon't think so. I think the amendment would be ratified so quickly, \nDemocratic heads would be spinning and, I might add, maybe even some \nRepublican heads as well.\n  All I can say is this country is in trouble. This country is on the \nway down to self-destruction unless we get it under control, and I \ndon't see one program from the other side that even comes close to \nshowing how we get this under control--except more taxes and more \nspending. I guarantee, if we raise taxes, they would spend every \nstinking dime of it. That has been the history of my 35 years in the \nSenate, as the most senior Republican. All I can say is we are not \ngoing to let them get away with it anymore. We are a minority now, but \nI believe we can get back in the majority.\n  I think the Democrats would do themselves a great favor if they would \nvote for cut, cap, and balance and a constitutional amendment and let \nthe people--let the people--decide. Let them make this decision. Come \non, Democrats, all you need to do is get 13 States. What are you so \nafraid of? I think what is so fearful is that this waltz that has been \ngoing on of big spending all these years is going to come to an end.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday the space shuttle \nAtlantis came back in the early morning darkness with those xenon \nlights illuminating that 3-mile-long runway at the Kennedy Space \nCenter. That is a location that a century ago a set of grandparents of \nmine had homesteaded under the old Homestead Act, worked the land for \nthe required 4 years. I have a copy of the deed signed by Woodrow \nWilson in 1917 to my grandparents. Over three-quarters of a century \nlater, the thought was not lost on me, when we went in that early \nmorning darkness to the launchpad, that my grandparents would have \nnever, ever believed that, so many years later, a grandson was going to \nliterally leave the face of the Earth from almost the old homestead \nwhere they had to swat mosquitoes and fight off rattlesnakes and \nalligators as they eked a living out of that Florida soil.\n  That was the location Atlantis came back to yesterday morning after a \n13-day flawless mission after having been launched by the finest launch \nteam in the world. That launch team is now having to disperse in part \nbecause we are shutting down the space shuttle program after 30 \nglorious years. It is an incredible flying machine, with 135\n\n[[Page S4840]]\n\nvery successful missions that allowed us to do incredible work in space \nwith human beings interacting and, of course, 2 tragic missions--the \ndestruction of Challenger on ascent 25 years ago and the destruction of \nColumbia on reentry just a few years ago, in the early part of this \nlast decade.\n  There would not be as much angst in the space community if the new \nrockets were ready. The problem is that the rockets are being designed, \nand in some cases being built, but they then have to be human-rated; \nthat is, all the redundancies for safety as well as the escape systems \nhave to be designed and developed for the new rockets. One of those new \nrockets is going to fly this fall. It will launch and rendezvous with \nthe International Space Station and will deliver cargo, but it is going \nto take a few years to rate that for humans. That all the more adds to \nthe angst, the angst of people who have lost their jobs and now do not \nsee the American rocket that is ready to fly immediately upon the \nshutdown of the space shuttle program.\n  I have been surprised that we have a lot of people in America who \nthink the space program is being shut down. We have an International \nSpace Station up there at about 225 miles. This thing is huge. It is \n120 yards long. From one end zone to another of a football field, that \nis how big it is. There are six human beings up there doing research \nright now.\n  We have trials in the Food and Drug Administration on drugs that have \nbeen developed on that International Space Station. The first one that \nis in trials right now is a vaccine for salmonella. Another one that is \ngetting ready to start trials is a vaccine for MRSA, the highly \ninfectious bacterial disease in hospitals that we find so difficult to \ncontrol because you cannot get an antibiotic that will control it.\n  I wanted to say for America's space team, ``a job well done.'' A \nnumber of us, including Senator Hutchison and myself, had introduced \nand we passed last week the resolution commemorating the men and women \nof NASA. Indeed, their congratulations and commendations are certainly \nin order on a job well done.\n  The space program lives. The space program will go to greater \nheights. We will go to Mars, and we will see Americans venture out into \nthe cosmos for even greater discoveries.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are facing a deadline tonight. At \nmidnight, the current reauthorization of the Federal Aviation \nAdministration expires. That expiration will mean that no funds can be \ncollected or paid out of the airport and airway trust fund starting \ntomorrow, July 23. The trust fund provides the primary source of \nfunding for the Federal Aviation Administration through excise taxes \nimposed on airline tickets, aviation fuel, and air cargo shipments.\n  We asked the Federal Aviation Administration and the Secretary of \nTransportation what would happen if the extension is not passed today \nin the Senate, and he said as follows: There will be a partial shutdown \nof Federal Aviation Administration operations. Approximately 4,000 \nnonessential FAA staff will be furloughed. Mr. President, 143 of these \nemployees, incidentally, work in my State, mostly in Chicago.\n  The Airport Improvement Program, which provides construction project \ngrants to airports, will be shut down and unable to obligate grants for \nprojects. Projects already obligated will be able to continue--for \nexample, the O'Hare Airport, Quad City's runways in Illinois--but \nobligating funds for new projects will be suspended. If the extension \ncontinues for a period of time, there may be reimbursement issues with \nprojects that are underway.\n  There is an unresolved question as to whether this failure to extend \nthe FAA authorization will have an impact on the fees we collect, the \naviation taxes and fees we collect from airlines for their operations. \nIt is not clear yet whether we will lose that revenue or whether we can \ncapture it if we reach an agreement at a later time.\n  Majority Leader Reid and Chairman Jay Rockefeller have told House \nleaders that a shutdown is likely unless a clean extension can be \npassed. The Senate is hotlining a clean extension today, which I will \ngo to next. There are no objections to this clean extension on the \nDemocratic side, but we do expect an objection from the Republican \nside.\n\n  I want to tell you the request I make for this extension, this clean \nextension, is in the name of chairman Jay Rockefeller from your State \nof West Virginia. This is a sad commentary on the political state of \naffairs in Congress today. This is the 21st extension of this \nauthorization. How could we possibly explain to America that we have \nbeen unable so many times to extend this authorization for something so \ncritical to our commerce and our economy? But now we are facing the \nmost serious challenge we ever had when it comes to this extension, and \nthat is the expiration of it this evening. It will have a direct impact \non the people who work for the FAA and a direct impact on their \noperations.\n  Now, I might add, very quickly, to give peace of mind to people, this \nwill not have an impact on air traffic control or the safety of our \nairlines. Not at all. But the orderly operation of the FAA is at risk.\n  What is this all about? It is a battle over a program called \nEssential Air Service. Essential Air Service, if I am not mistaken, was \ninitiated by your predecessor, Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia. \nAt the time of deregulation of airlines a decision was made that the \nsmaller communities across America needed a helping hand to maintain \nair service. We have it in Illinois. Over the years we have \nreconsidered it, amended it, changed it. It is a shadow of what it \nstarted out to be. It is a very small program by standards of the \noriginal program.\n  There is a battle going on between the House and the Senate now, \nbetween Republicans in the House and the Democratic leadership in the \nSenate, about the future of this program. I just want to say in all \nfairness and all honesty, for goodness' sake, to both sides, save that \nbattle for another day. Let us not jeopardize the operations of the \nFederal Aviation Administration because of a squabble over an important \nbut relatively small program, and that is what is going to happen. What \nwe are going to hear after I make this request is an objection on the \nRepublican side to extending this authorization of the Aviation \nAdministration with a clean extension, making no statement about \nchanging policy. It just says don't jeopardize the operations of the \nFAA. Let's keep them in business. Let's fight this out next week or the \nweek after on the Essential Air Service issue, but let's move forward \nand let the FAA do its business with a clean bill that does not take \nsides over who is right and who is wrong on Essential Air Service.\n  What I am offering is neutrality, political neutrality, a clean \nextension, but I am afraid what I will get back is an insistence if you \ndon't take the House Republican proposal, we will shut it down. I don't \nthink that is a good choice for America. Let us, as politicians, do our \nbattles. Let's never do them at the expense of ordinary people across \nAmerica who are trying to do good work to improve our airports and make \nsure we have the safest runways and safest air operations in the world. \nThat should be our highest priority.\n  So I am going to make this request for a clean extension without \ngetting into this political squabble at all. I hope the Republicans \nwill not object. I hope we can extend this authorization for the \nFederal Aviation Administration.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of Calendar No. 109, H.R. 2553, that a Rockefeller-\nHutchison substitute amendment which is at the desk be agreed to, the \nbill, as amended, be read a third time and passed, and the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.\n\n[[Page S4841]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HATCH. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to explain my \nobjection to the legislation just offered by my esteemed colleague. I \nwant to make it absolutely clear that a long-term FAA reauthorization \nis a priority for this country and a priority for myself, and I have \nsaid as much repeatedly. The consent request just offered by my \ncolleague, even if accepted, would not prevent a lapse of current law. \nAs my colleagues are likely aware, the House has completed legislative \nbusiness for the week, so the only way to prevent a disruption to FAA \nfunding is to pass Chairman Mica's bill the House passed earlier this \nweek. I worked with Finance Committee Chairman Baucus to report a tax \ntitle from the Finance Committee to the bill that passed the Senate \nearlier this year.\n  However, since then progress on a long-term reauthorization has been \nslow. I share House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee \nChairman Mica's frustration that favors to organized labor have \novershadowed the prospects for long-term FAA reauthorization.\n  Last year the National Mediation Board changed the rules under which \nemployees of airlines and railroads are able to unionize. For decades \nthe standard has been that a majority of employees would have to agree \nin an election to form a union. However, the new National Mediation \nBoard rules changed that standard so that all it takes to unionize is a \nmajority of employees voting. This means that the NMB wants to count an \nemployee who doesn't vote as voting for big labor. Somehow, organized \nlabor is able to claim that it is democratic to appropriate someone \nelse's vote without that person's input and participation. The FAA \nreauthorization bill that passed the House earlier this year will undo \nthis heavyhanded rule and lets airline employees decide for themselves \nhow to use their own votes. The House bill would merely undo a big \npartisan favor done at the behest of big labor, and put efforts to \nunionize airline workforces on the same footing they have been on for \nyears. The House bill does not create a new hurdle for unionization; \ninstead it restores the longstanding ability of airline employees to \nmake decisions for themselves.\n  As I said, it is unfortunate that kowtowing to big labor has \neffectively grounded efforts to get a long-term FAA reauthorization off \nthe ground. The lack of a long-term bill is bad for airports all across \nthe country because they don't have the funding stability to plan and \ncomplete projects. Kicking the can further down the road is not a \nviable alternative to actually doing what is in the best interest of \npassengers, commercial users of air transportation, and our airlines \nand airports.\n  As a Senate conferee to the FAA bill, I stand ready to do everything \nI can to break the cycle of short-term extensions, and to do something \nthat hasn't been done around here for more than 7\\1/2\\ years, and get \nFAA reauthorization off the ground.\n  So, Mr. President, having said all of that, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 2553, \nwhich was received from the House; that the bill be read a third time \nand passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that \nany statements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, the Senator \nfrom Utah is my friend. We have worked on many issues together and in \nthis particular moment in time we are in disagreement. What he has \npresented to you is one side of a story, one side of a debate and said \nunless you accept the House Republican position, which has not been \nresolved, we are going to lay off 4,000 people at midnight tonight. Do \nyou think that means anything to them?\n  What I offered was a clean extension of which I didn't get into the \nmerits, which said let's put this debate aside and that debate aside \nand keep the agency working, the Federal Aviation Administration. He \nsaid, no, either take the Republican approach or else, and, \nincidentally, he told me at the outset the House Republicans have gone \nhome. They are gone. They sent this over and said take it or leave it \nor close it down. That is not a very sound choice for our country. I am \nsorry if the Senator from Utah objected to a clean extension so we can \nkeep up these operations. I object because I don't believe it is a fair \napproach.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am getting a little tired of the National \nLabor Relations Board usurping the power of the Congress of the United \nStates and enacting labor laws by fiat of the Board that are hardly \ngoing to be upheld by the courts, but nevertheless it will take years \nto reduce them and take them away. In this particular case the National \nMediation Board has changed the longstanding rule when you vote to \nunionize, it is the vote of all employees. This means that you could \nhave a vote, and this is what I think the House is trying to stop and \nto change. That means you can have a vote with less than half of the \nemployees and it would be the majority of those who vote. Now, that has \nnever been the law, it has never been the case, and it is clearly a \nheavyhanded approach towards the FAA, and I think that is one reason \nwhy the House has taken this very strong position.\n  I understand my friend on the other side, and we are friends and we \nhave worked together on some of the issues, and I have a tremendous \namount of admiration for him and his ability to lead and express \nhimself. He is one of the best people of expression in the history of \nthe Senate, and I have great respect for him. But that is one of the \nmain reasons why the House is up in arms and I have to say our side is \nup in arms as well.\n  We have to stop this changing laws without the consent of Congress \njust by the fiat of those on the National Labor Relations Board and the \nNational Mediation Board. It is not right and upturns hundreds of years \nof labor law, and, frankly, it is wrong and I am on the side of the \nHouse in this matter because of it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, perhaps if I were as persuasive as my \ncolleague just said, he would not have objected. Having said that, when \nwe speak about heavy hands, we don't have to worry about the heavy hand \nof the House on this issue because they went home. They took off. They \nleft, which means that 4,000 people would be furloughed this evening.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/22/senate-section/article/S4841-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4841-S4843]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DR. PAUL SMITH\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Dr. Paul Smith, a \nphysician whose story has been chosen to be recorded as part of the \nLondon, KY, ``Living Treasures'' project.\n  Dr. Smith's career path began when he graduated pre-med from \nCumberland College in 1949 at age 19. After attending the University of \nKentucky, where he hitchhiked to class every day, Dr. Smith was \naccepted into the University of Louisville medical school. Unable to \nobtain a rural scholarship through traditional channels, Dr. Smith \nreceived a scholarship from the Tri-County Women's Club in Knox, \nWhitley, and Laurel counties. The only condition was that he return to \none of the counties and practice medicine there for 4 years.\n  Before being called up for service in the U.S. Air Force, Dr. Smith \nworked for a doctor in Cumberland, where he met his wife. After a year \nof dating, Dr. Smith and his wife of 53 years, Ann, were married and \nmoved together to the Lake Charles Air Force base in Louisiana. Their \ndaughter Jan was born on base as Smith trained and served as a doctor.\n  After completing his service with the Air Force, Dr. Smith moved to \nLondon and opened up his own practice. He routinely made dozens of \nhouse calls to London residents--both in the city and out in the \ncountry. Dr. Smith also offered OB services and often worked in the \nemergency room of nearby Marymount Hospital when other doctors were too \nbusy.\n  After 38 years of dedicated service to the London community, Dr. \nSmith retired in 1998. Even in his retirement,\n\n[[Page S4842]]\n\nDr. Smith volunteers at the free medical clinic run at the Community \nChristian Church.\n  The State of Kentucky is lucky to have individuals like Dr. Paul \nSmith, who dedicate their lives to better those of others. As he has \nshown us all, Dr. Smith is truly a great Kentuckian.\n  Mr. President, the Laurel County-area newspaper the Sentinel Echo \nrecently published a detailed interview with Dr. Smith and his wife in \nwhich they discuss Dr. Smith's accomplishments and contributions. I ask \nunanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Sentinel-Echo, May 25, 2011]\n\n                   London's Living Treasures: Part 2\n\n       Following is the second installment of the Living Treasures \n     Project. It is the story of Dr. Paul Smith, who served Laurel \n     County as a family physician for 38 years. Dr. Smith shared \n     fascinating details about his life as a medical student and \n     doctor, which meant hitchhiking to class, making house calls \n     and working with the nuns at Marymount Hospital. During his \n     interview, Dr. Smith was joined by his wife of 53 years, Ann.\n       ``I used to go to the library when I was in high school and \n     read all the books I could about family physicians, some of \n     them from Kentucky and otherwise, just the real stories of \n     rural physicians. I took pre-med at Williamsburg's Cumberland \n     College, graduated with a diploma after two years, in 1949. I \n     was 19.\n\n\n                            Working student\n\n       After I finished Williamsburg, I needed funds to go on to \n     the University of Kentucky. I ended up getting an emergency \n     certificate to teach at Henderson Settlement in Frakes, Ky., \n     for one year and saved up enough. I had an aunt who worked \n     there, and I had room and board pretty much for free except \n     I'm sure my parents gave them a lot of vegetables. I saved \n     all my money and went to University of Kentucky in 1950.\n       Those years were very lean and, unfortunately with no car \n     or transportation, I hitchhiked every day back and forth to \n     the university. I went to work at the narcotic hospital out \n     at Leestown Pike in Lexington usually at 4 p.m. After \n     classes, I'd have to scurry over to Leestown Pike and put my \n     thumb out and just barely make it to work, usually.\n       Before I finished my degree, the Korean War started. I had \n     applied for medical school, but I hadn't heard anything. I \n     had already been called up for the draft, passed my physical \n     for the Army. They would defer you a semester at a time but \n     by then they were getting hard up to give deferrals to \n     everybody, so there was a good possibility I was going to \n     have to go to the service.\n       When I was home for Christmas vacation, I got my letter of \n     acceptance to the medical school at the University of \n     Louisville, the only one I could afford even though the \n     tuition was just $800 a year. It felt great because that's \n     what I wanted. When I got accepted, my father went to the \n     bank in Pineville to try to borrow money and the banker said, \n     ``No, not on a medical student, too many of them flunk out.''\n       I got deferred and finished the year and went on to \n     Louisville.\n       When I went back to medical school my sophomore year, I got \n     a job as an extern at Baptist. We'd do histories and \n     physicals of patients and, every third night, I was on call \n     for the lab.\n       When I finished medical school, there was still a doctor's \n     draft. You had to do two years in the service unless you were \n     over 35 or unless you were in the service before. That was \n     looming over me when I finished medical school, but I still \n     had my internship to complete, which I did at Good Samaritan \n     Hospital in Lexington in 1957.\n       When I finished, I joined the Air Force. I knew I'd be \n     called in six to 12 months, so I had to look for a job. \n     Finally, one of the surgeons told me that he knew this \n     surgeon in Lynch and Cumberland that could use a doctor. I \n     signed on with him and that's the best thing I did in my life \n     because that's where I met my wife.\n\n\n                           Marriage material\n\n       How'd we meet? Her mother had to have her gallbladder out \n     and she can tell it better than I can.\n       ANN: I went back home to teach school, but they put me in \n     first grade. I did everything to try to do a crash course on \n     elementary. I was cutting paper dolls for my students, \n     preparing for the next day. Paul walked in and when he walked \n     out, I said, ``Mother, I think I'm going to marry that guy.'' \n     She said, ``Just hush.'' He's the only person I ever pursued.\n       DR. SMITH: I was real impressed with her, but I was a \n     little leery. I rented a room in Cumberland. I'd usually go \n     to the drive-in at night and eat. Well, she and another girl \n     started showing up there about every night. I got suspicious, \n     but my impression was good all along.\n       I was in Cumberland almost a year to the day. I was called \n     into the service on the 5th of July. In the meantime, though, \n     we dated and got married June 14, 1958, Flag Day. It was a \n     nice wedding. Like most people, I thought we were going to \n     have a little wedding and when I went in, the church was \n     full.\n       ANN: It was a small church. And my mother had decorated it \n     with a lot of mountain flowers.\n       DR. SMITH: We went together to the service and we went to \n     basic training. I had to go four weeks in Montgomery, Ala. \n     That was an awakening too because neither one of us liked the \n     racism. I didn't like that at all.\n       In training, doctors had to go out and shoot one time. I \n     can't say I hit a thing. I'd shot a BB gun before and a .22, \n     but they put a .45 in my hand for the first time. I aimed \n     perfectly at the target and when I pulled it, it went up like \n     that. I shot my however-many rounds I had to shoot. I only \n     went to the rifle range once but we marched and flew in \n     airplanes a lot.\n       In October '58, I was assigned to Lakes Charles, La. It was \n     a small base, the hospital was constructed during the war so \n     it was not very fancy, but it was a nice base. That's where \n     we had our first daughter, Jan.\n       Now, I've got to go back and fill in before I went to \n     medical school, because that's important. I'd applied for a \n     rural scholarship and I was sure with my grades I would get \n     one. But it seemed they'd given all of them out. At that \n     time, I was going to have to hold up medical school for a \n     year to earn what I needed, but one of the students ahead of \n     me knew the Tri-County Women's Club from Knox, Whitley and \n     Laurel had raised money for a rural scholarship and, to their \n     knowledge, it had never been filled. I interviewed and they \n     were in favor of me getting it. With the scholarship, I \n     agreed I would go back to practice in Knox, Whitley or Laurel \n     for four years.\n       That was one reason I didn't even consider staying in the \n     service because I had that obligation, and I felt it was a \n     deep obligation.\n\n\n                          Laurel County-bound\n\n       I found out Dr. Robert Pennington in London might need a \n     doctor. I came over here and it was a Wednesday afternoon and \n     Dr. Pennington was off on Wednesday afternoon and he showed \n     me all around town.\n       I didn't have an office, but it turns out that Dr. \n     Pennington and his brother had an office built up over the \n     old fire department on Broad Street. It had a space for a lab \n     and space for three examining rooms and a waiting room, \n     already plumbed and wired. So that looked good and the rent \n     looked good, $65 a month.\n       Then the next day, Dr. Pennington located me a house I \n     could rent. It was up on Falls Road. We unloaded on July 5, \n     1983 and I got busy getting my office together because, see, \n     I had no equipment. Marymount Hospital was nice to me, they \n     loaned me one or two of the bedside tables. My brother was \n     doing a residency in surgery in Lexington and they wanted to \n     get rid of an old surgical table. Owner of The Sentinel, \n     Martin Dyche, through him, I got a Cole metal desk, a filing \n     cabinet and a chair.\n       Next to my office, there was the taxi park and they had \n     five or six taxis there. They were busy all the time. They \n     had a ringer out there on the telephone pole so you could \n     hear it ring all the time.\n       London was a rural town, everything closed on Wednesday at \n     noon except me. I decided, since most of the doctors took off \n     on Wednesday afternoon that I was going to work and I'd take \n     off on Thursday afternoon.\n       We had three drug stores, the original Begley's, Robert \n     Dyche had Dyche Drug Store and then there was City Drug \n     Store, it was down near where the theatre is now, where the \n     old Hob Nob used to be. Of course London Bucket was here, \n     which handled plumbing, Hoskin's Five and Ten, and then the \n     department stores, you had Hackney's, Daniel's, and several \n     others. Where Weaver's is now was their pool hall and women \n     were not allowed in the pool hall. If Ann or somebody wanted \n     their hotdog, they had a window up there and they'd sell you \n     the hotdog out the window. It was a bustling little Main \n     Street, but don't expect anything after 5 o'clock.\n       I opened my practice about July 15, and I averaged four to \n     five patients a day the first year and I couldn't have paid \n     my rent with that because an office visit was $3 and a house \n     call was $5 in the city and $10 outside in the county. But I \n     made a lot of house calls, some I got paid for, some I \n     didn't.\n       ANN: We ate well. In those first years I learned to can \n     beans, freeze corn, I learned to do so much. They brought not \n     just a bushel of beans, but two or three. It was \n     overwhelming, by then I had three little kids to take care \n     of--Jan, Elizabeth and Paul Ray--but I felt like it was a sin \n     not to use that food. But anyway, we did know it would be \n     slow for the first couple of years, so we planned ahead.\n       DR. SMITH: We didn't want to go in debt and we didn't. I \n     probably made most of my money in the E.R. The other doctors \n     were all so busy they didn't care about leaving their office \n     full of patients and running to the emergency room. So I got \n     called all the time to the E.R. and that's how I picked up a \n     lot of patients, because they had to be healthy to climb two \n     floors of steps up to my office.\n       In 1961, in March or April, Dr. D.D. Turner decided he was \n     going to quit general practice and go into the health \n     department in western Kentucky. He came to see me about \n     taking over his practice. I was happy because then I'd be on \n     a ground floor, they wouldn't have to climb those steps. Then \n     things started picking up.\n       Our days were 24-7. Five of us physicians did OBs. When I \n     came here, three of the doctors were still delivering at \n     home. I told them up front I wasn't going to do home \n     deliveries. I told them I was charging $50 for\n\n[[Page S4843]]\n\n     delivery, $10 for a circumcision. I tell you, you didn't make \n     any money back then if you were in medicine. Not here. Many \n     of a time I would leave at 7 in the morning and make rounds \n     and I'd come home for dinner, maybe, but I'd go out again and \n     make house calls. I would make 10 or 12 house calls a day.\n       A year after I started, we moved from the house on Falls \n     Street.\n       ANN: But then Dr. Pennington, he was always finding stuff \n     for us. He knew this house on Ninth Street was going on the \n     market. He said don't tell a soul.\n       DR. SMITH: So we moved here. Dr. Pennington decided for us. \n     For one thing, look how close it is to the hospital. I could \n     go over there and be in the delivery room in three or four \n     minutes.\n       Marymount was run by the Sisters. It was great to work with \n     them, I never could remember all their names, I was bad about \n     that, I'd call them all ``Sister.'' We had eight or 10 of \n     them up here. They were great to work with, they were very \n     good nurses.\n\n\n                          Changes in medicine\n\n       When I first came here, polio was dying down because the \n     first vaccine had come out. But measles was the big thing. We \n     didn't have any measles vaccinations, and it wouldn't be \n     unusual to go out to a house and see a kid with 104, 105 \n     temperature with measles and two or three other siblings with \n     measles. The only thing you could do is advise them how to \n     bathe them, how to cool them off.\n       Mumps, had a lot of mumps. And, of course, pneumonias and a \n     lot of hepatitis. One year, just in my practice, I had two or \n     three kids from the high schools where they still had outdoor \n     toilets. They would come in with jaundice and they had \n     hepatitis, and of course we didn't have any vaccines.\n       A lot of changes have occurred. Technology is one of the \n     biggest changes and it's good and bad. It's good because we \n     can now do a better job with some things. In the 1960s, we \n     didn't have any Echocardiograms. CT or MRI hadn't been heard \n     of. The part that I don't like that's changed is doctors no \n     longer sit and do history and physicals and talk to people. \n     When I was externing during medical school, each history and \n     physical, you'd spend 30 to 40 minutes. None of this five-\n     minute stuff.\n       I quit OB in '85 because we were getting some OB doctors in \n     and also malpractice had gotten so bad. When we got more \n     lawyers, that's when things changed, that's it, that's what \n     changed it. I want to say around early '70s.\n       Medicine changed so. The insurance companies would fight \n     you constantly in your office and you had to fight constantly \n     to get people in the hospital. You'd be arguing with some \n     nurse up in Chicago or somewhere. That's when my blood \n     pressure started going up, honestly.\n       I closed my office in 1998, but I've worked some since \n     then, I'd work some now if I didn't have back trouble. I \n     loved being a doctor, listen, I still do. I help with the \n     free clinic now at the Community Christian Church. I liked \n     that you could see people from the time they were born until \n     they died. And you followed them all the way through. I loved \n     all of it, really, just taking care of the families, getting \n     to know the people.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/22/senate-section/article/S4843-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4843-S4844]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CAMPUS SEXUAL VIOLENCE ELIMINATION ACT\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about legislation I \nhave introduced, the Campus Sexual Violence Elimination Act, or Campus \nSaVE Act, and to urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  I want to start by sharing some deeply disturbing statistics with \nyou:\n  Between 20 and 25 percent of all female undergraduates in America are \nvictims of sexual assault or attempted sexual assault each year.\n  Most cases of sexual assault occur between acquaintances--between 85 \nand 90 percent of reported sexual assaults on college women are \nperpetrated by someone they know, and nearly half of such sexual \nassaults occur on a date.\n  Young adults age 18 and 19 experience the highest rates of stalking \namong any age group.\n  As the father of four daughters, one of whom who just graduated from \ncollege and another who is in college now, these statistics are \nterrifying. But I was even more distressed to learn that many of these \nvictims never come forward. Those who do often do not get the support \nand the assistance they need to heal and to be able to continue their \neducation safely and successfully.\n  The Campus SaVE Act will address many of these issues by setting out \na clear framework to promote transparency and accountability. The \nlegislation consolidates existing polices under both the Jeanne Clery \nAct and title IX to ensure that institutions of higher education have \ncomprehensive procedures in place to address domestic violence, dating \nviolence, sexual assault and stalking.\n  Institutions of higher education are already required to report \ncertain crime statistics as a result of the Clery Act, a law championed \nby our former colleague, Senator Specter, after Jeanne Clery was raped \nand murdered in her college dorm room in 1989.\n  But only one-third of U.S. colleges correctly report their crime \nstatistics, leading to misclassification and underrepresentation of \nattempted and completed instances of sexual assault. They are not \ncurrently required to break down their data on different types of sex \noffenses, leading to confusion and unclear data about reports of \ndomestic violence, dating violence, and stalking.\n  The Campus SaVE Act will also address the need for education and \nawareness in the entire campus community. Currently, less than half of \nall colleges and universities offer any sexual assault prevention \ntraining; the Campus SaVE Act will require that these institutions \nprovide prevention and awareness programs for all incoming students and \nnew employees.\n  This education is essential. Many students attending college are away \nfrom home for the first time and are still in their teenage years and \nlearning about adult relationships. We cannot assume that they know \nwhat dating violence is; we cannot assume that they know what \nconstitutes consent in a sexual relationship.\n  A victim also may not know what to do when something bad happens: \nless than 5 percent of rapes or attempted rapes are reported, and fewer \nthan half of colleges and universities spell out policies for filing \ncriminal charges and campus reports. However, when students know how to \nreport victimization and how their school will respond, students are \nmore likely to report instances of sexual assault or attempted sexual \nassault.\n  Dickinson College in Carlisle, PA, recently saw students hold a sit-\nin for 3\\1/2\\ days, displaying their frustration over the college's \nweak sexual assault policy. One student remarked, ``We don't have a \nconsolidated document that runs you through what you should do and also \nallows you to understand that there are federal laws that protect \nyou.''\n  This is exactly what the Campus SaVE Act would require. It sets \nstandards for institutions so that everyone in the community \nunderstands their rights and responsibilities. Fortunately, the \nadministration at Dickinson College later agreed to strengthen its \npolicies relating to sexual assault.\n  Under the Campus SaVE Act, students will know that if they report \nbeing a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, \nor stalking, they will receive an explanation of their rights. They \nneed to know they have a right to report these offenses to law \nenforcement authorities. They need to know that the college or \nuniversity has an obligation to help them seek a protective order, if \nthey want such an order. They need to know that they will receive \ncontact information for the resources available to them, such as \ncounseling and legal assistance. Finally, they need to know about \nsafety planning such as changing their living arrangements, class \nschedule, work schedule, and travel options so that they feel safe in \ntheir environment.\n  The bill will also ensure that these incidents are properly reported \nby making institutions include in their annual security reports \nstatistics on domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and \nstalking that were reported to campus police or local police agencies.\n  Many colleges and universities are doing this right: they have \nprocedures in place to deal with domestic partner violence, dating \nviolence, sexual assault, and stalking; they provide support to \nvictims, and they have prevention programs to educate the community \nabout these terrible acts.\n  In another case in Pennsylvania this year, a student at Kutztown \nUniversity told authorities that she had been raped on campus by a male \nstudent. After this young woman reported the assault, a second female \nstudent came out and said that she had been raped a few weeks earlier. \nThese two instances of young women standing up and reporting their \nassaults pulled others out of the shadows.

Mr. President, I rise today to submit for the Record an \narticle written by Bobbie Frank, executive director of the Wyoming \nAssociation of Conservation Districts and published on July 16, 2011, \nin the Wyoming Livestock Roundup. The article's title is ``Muddy \nwaters: EPA, Army Corps Seek to Define More Jurisdiction as Federal.''\n  I have concluded, just as this article has, that the Clean Water Act, \nCWA, jurisdictional guidance being proposed by the Environmental \nProtection Agency, EPA, allows the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and EPA \nto regulate waters now considered entirely under State jurisdiction. \nThis unprecedented exercise of power will allow EPA to trump States \nrights, and vitiate the authority of State and local governments to \nmake local land and water use decisions. This is particularly troubling \nwhen we have seen no evidence that the States are misusing or otherwise \nfailing to meet their responsibilities.\n  Enormous resources will be needed to expand the CWA Federal \nregulatory program. Not only will there be a host of landowners and \nproject proponents who will now be subject to the CWA's mandates and \ncosts of obtaining permits, but an increase in the number of permits \nneeded will lead to longer permitting delays. Increased delays in \nsecuring permits will impede a host of economic activities in Wyoming \nand across the United States. Commercial and residential real estate \ndevelopment, agriculture, ranching, electric transmission, \ntransportation, energy development, and mining will all be affected, \nand thousands of jobs will be lost.\n  In May of this year, 19 Senators joined me in a letter to EPA \nexpressing our strong opposition to this guidance. I will continue to \nfight to protect our States from this Washington power grab.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe article to which I referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Muddy Waters: EPA, Army Corps Seek to Define More Jurisdiction as \n                                Federal\n\n     (By Bobbie Frank, Executive Director, Wyoming Association of \n                        Conservation Districts)\n\n       The conservation districts in this state are definitely \n     committed to watershed health and water quality work, and \n     their commitment is evident through their actions: \n     conservation district employees who are several months \n     pregnant wade streams in the winter to collect water samples, \n     and retired conservation district supervisors volunteer their \n     time to help with water quality monitoring and implementing \n     water quality management practices.\n       Many landowners, community leaders and homeowners have and \n     continue to volunteer hundreds of hours working on watershed \n     plans, and then they work hard to implement those plans. \n     There is no shortage of dedicated and concerned citizens \n     working to maintain and improve the water quality of this \n     state, and every two years the Wyoming Association of \n     Conservation Districts (WACD) publishes its ``Watersheds \n     Progress Report'' to show all of the incredible efforts at \n     the local level across Wyoming. The 2009 edition is available \n     on our website.\n       Highlighting the dedication to water quality is important \n     to recognize, in the context of this discussion, because, \n     inevitably, when one starts debating the issue of regulatory \n     jurisdiction--federal versus state--if one leans toward less \n     federal intervention and regulation, then it is easy for \n     others to try to paint one as anti-clean water. As one \n     district supervisor put it, ``The only conservation that \n     matters is that which gets put on the ground.''\n       In April 2011 the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \n     published draft guidance that would replace previous agency \n     guidance issued in 2003 and 2008, detailing modifications to \n     which waters EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) \n     would regulate under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act \n     (commonly referred to as the Clean Water Act). Who should \n     have the authority over water quality issues, the federal \n     government or the respective states, continues to be a hot \n     topic of debate. Key Supreme Court decisions have refined the \n     EPA's and the Corps' authority over the regulation of certain \n     types of waters.\n       In the past several years there have also been attempts in \n     Congress to advance legislation to redefine ``waters of the \n     United States.'' These bills would have resulted in a \n     definition that would have included a number of waters that \n     are currently not subject to federal regulation, or are in a \n     ``gray'' area. These attempts did not move forward. As a \n     result, that which cannot be done through the appropriate \n     processes, i.e. legislation and/or rules, apparently will be \n     done through the development of ``guidance.''\n       The two primary decisions, the Solid Waste Agency of \n     Northern Cook County v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (SWANCC) \n     and Rapanos v. United States (Rapanos), resulted in \n     restricting federal authority over certain types of waters.\n       First, the SWANCC decision removed from federal regulation \n     isolated wetlands by nullifying the ``migratory bird rule.'' \n     In a nutshell, the agencies, via regulation, exerted \n     jurisdiction over these types of isolated waters by arguing \n     that isolated wetlands will have waterfowl in them that would \n     fly to another state and land in another isolated wetland, \n     hence there was interstate commerce occurring on these waters \n     to render them under federal jurisdiction.\n       The other suit, Rapanos, resulted in what is argued by the \n     agencies to be a complicated and unmanageable approach to \n     determining jurisdiction. Many lauded the decision as a win \n     for reining in the heavy hand of the agencies. In Rapanos, \n     the court addressed CWA protections for wetlands adjacent to \n     non-navigable tributaries, and issued five opinions with no \n     single opinion commanding a majority of the court. The \n     plurality opinion, authored by Justice Scalia, stated that \n     ``waters of the United States'' extended beyond traditional \n     navigable waters to include ``relatively permanent, standing \n     or flowing bodies of water.'' There is a lot more detail to \n     this opinion, but suffice it to say, the outcome was \n     additional limitations placed on federal jurisdiction.\n       A comparison of the December 2008 memorandum issued by EPA \n     and Corps guiding agency personnel on which waters would be \n     jurisdictional and this new proposed guidance, provides for \n     some significant changes in what waters would be regulated. \n     The agencies specifically state in the draft guidance: \n     ``However, after careful review of these opinions, the \n     agencies concluded that previous guidance did not make full \n     use of the authority provided by the CWA to include waters \n     within the scope of the Act, as interpreted by the Court.''\n       The 2008 guidance established a ``significant nexus'' \n     standard, whereby the agency would have to determine on a \n     fact-specific basis whether certain types of waters, such as \n     wetlands, tributaries or traditional navigable waters, fell \n     under federal jurisdiction. This significant nexus standard \n     would contemplate the flow functions of the tributary itself \n     and the functions performed by all wetlands adjacent to the \n     tributary to determine if they significantly affect the \n     chemical, physical and biological integrity of downstream \n     traditional navigable waters. The significant nexus also \n     included consideration of hydrologic and ecologic factors.\n       This 2011 draft guidance takes the same type of approach, \n     but expands on the significant nexus approach by establishing \n     that waters that are in ``close proximity'' or ``proximate \n     other waters'' to traditional navigable waters will also fall \n     under jurisdiction. Basically, the guidance establishes a \n     watershed approach to determining significance. In essence, \n     based on our analysis, most waters in a watershed draining to \n     a ``traditional navigable water'' or interstate water, would \n     ultimately meet the ``significant nexus'' test and be subject \n     to federal regulatory oversight.\n       There is a list of certain types of waters that would \n     ``generally'' not fall under federal jurisdiction. Note the \n     term ``generally.'' There is a potential that some of the \n     specifically exempt waters, such as reflecting pools, \n     ornamental waters, gullies, etc., could also be \n     jurisdictional.\n       Also of import is the application of the above as it \n     pertains to the different provisions of the Clean Water Act. \n     The agencies acknowledge in the guidance that ``although \n     SWANCC and Rapanos specifically involved section 404 of the \n     CWA and discharges of dredged or fill material, the term \n     `waters of the United States' must be interpreted \n     consistently for all CWA provisions that use the term. These \n     provisions include the section 402 National Pollutant \n     Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit program, the \n     section 311 oil spill program, the water quality standards \n     and total maximum daily load\n\n[[Page S4845]]\n\n     programs under section 303, and the section 401 State water \n     quality certification process.''\n       This issue is not about whether our water resources should \n     be protected or not, which is often the spin on this issue. \n     It is about whether the authority to regulate certain types \n     of waters should lie with the federal government or should be \n     retained by the states. WACD's comments reflect the opinion \n     that, on those waters falling outside of the traditional \n     ``navigable,'' interstate waters' realm should be regulated \n     by the states. It has been our experience that those closest \n     to the issue are typically most knowledgeable and capable of \n     commonsense, cost effective approaches to resource protection \n     and management.\n       WACD and the conservation districts have a solid record of \n     projects that do successfully protect water quality in a \n     commonsense, cost effective approach that benefits all water \n     users and the state. The EPA's 2011 draft guidance document \n     hinders our ability to continue this mission by oftentimes \n     placing districts in a position of reacting to federally \n     driven requirements and priorities versus the highest \n     priority resource issues in our communities.\n       Thanks to Senator Barrasso for his diligent efforts on this \n     issue. We appreciate his work to ensure that the federal \n     agencies don't try to evade the appropriate processes and \n     expand their authorities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/22/senate-section/article/S4845-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4845]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     REMEMBERING TOM WILLIAMS, JR.\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, today I wish to remember a great \nman and a wonderful friend, Mr. Tom Williams, Jr. Mr. Williams passed \naway on June 21, 2011, in Scottsdale, AZ, and leaves behind his wife \nGloria; son Tom Williams, III; daughter Nicol Williams-Pruitt; son-in-\nlaw Jason Pruitt; and grandson Nicolas Pruitt. To Mr. Williams' family, \nplease accept my condolences for your loss.\n  Mr. Williams and I met through a shared passion for the advancement \nof America's small businesses. In fact, Mr. Williams started his own \nsmall business in 1982 in Oakland, CA, an accounting firm called \nWilliams, Adley & Company. In the beginning, Williams and Adley were \nthe only two employees, but over the next few decades, they grew to be \na three-office firm with two locations in California and one in \nWashington, DC. The firm now boasts over 100 employees.\n  In addition to his professional success, Mr. Williams has been a \nchampion for small business-friendly legislation. He was a leader in \nchanging the size standards for the accounting industry and fought \ntirelessly to improve access for small accounting firms to government \ncontracts. Similarly, my colleagues in the Senate may remember language \nin the Small Business Jobs Act mandating annual reviews of the \naccounting firm size standards, a provision suggested by Mr. Williams.\n  Mr. Williams was also a pillar in his community. He helped establish \nthe San Francisco Chapter of the National Association of Black \nAccountants, NABA, served in a number of NABA positions, including \npresident, and was awarded their Small Business Entrepreneur of the \nYear Award. He was also an active member of the California Society of \nPublic Accountants.\n  But perhaps the best description of Mr. Williams comes from the motto \nof the very company he created: ``Good people, doing great things.'' \nMr. Williams, you were indeed a good person who did great things. I \nsincerely thank you for all of your contributions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/22/senate-section/article/S4845-2", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4845]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/22/senate-section/article/S4845-3", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4845]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/22/senate-section/article/S4845-4", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4845]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:55 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1315.

Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 1408. A bill to require Federal agencies, and persons engaged in \ninterstate commerce, in possession of data containing sensitive \npersonally identifiable information, to disclose any breach of such \ninformation; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am very pleased to introduce today \nthe Data Breach Notification Act of 2011.\n  This bill would require that consumers be notified when their \nsensitive personally identifiable information has been exposed in a \ndata breach and also that law enforcement receive notice of major \nbreaches of data security.\n  In 2003, California was the pioneer in requiring data breach \nnotification. Forty-six States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, \nand the Virgin Islands now have similar laws.\n  Consumers in all states deserve to benefit from these protections; \nbusinesses should not be subject to 46 different and at times \nconflicting laws; and Federal law enforcement critically needs to \nreceive information about major breaches occurring across the country.\n  I have introduced data breach notification legislation in several \nprior Congresses. During the last Congress, that legislation, called \nthe Data Breach Notification Act, S. 139, passed through the Judiciary \nCommittee and was reported to the Senate floor. Unfortunately, the bill \nstalled there and went no further.\n  President Obama included similar data breach notification provisions \nin his broad cybersecurity proposal, released just last month.\n  The bill I am introducing today is identical to the bill I have \nintroduced in the past. This legislation is long overdue and should \nfinally be enacted now, during this Congress.\n  I have 3 points to make about this bill.\n  First, this bill will protect consumers, who need to know when their \nsensitive data has been exposed so they can take measures to protect \nthemselves.\n  According to the Federal Trade Commission, between 8 and 10 million \nAmerican consumers are victims of identity theft each year.\n  In April of 2007, a Zogby survey found that an astonishing 91 percent \nof adult users of the Internet said they were\n\n[[Page S4847]]\n\nconcerned that their identities might be stolen.\n  They have good reason to be concerned.\n  According to the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, over 500 million \nrecords containing sensitive personally identifiable information have \nbeen exposed in data breaches since 2005.\n  Earlier this year, a giant security breach at Epsilon, an online \nmarketing firm, exposed the personal information of millions of \nAmerican consumers, along with information about stores where they had \nbeen customers. The breach raised serious concerns that data thieves \nwould use this personal information to subject consumers to targeted, \nfraudulent e-mails, used to try to trick people into turning over even \nmore personal information.\n  Last year, data thieves acquired identity data on roughly 3.3 million \nstudent loan borrowers from the Educational Credit Management Corp.--a \nnumber that accounts for almost five percent of all Federal student \nloan recipients. The data included names, addresses, social security \nnumbers, and other personal data, creating the opportunity for identity \ntheft.\n  In 2009, Federal officials indicted three men on charges of stealing \ndata linked to more than 130 million credit cards by hacking into five \nmajor companies' computer systems. The companies were Heartland Payment \nSystems, 7-Eleven, the Hannaford Brothers supermarket chain, and two \nother companies not named in the indictment.\n  The problem is getting worse, not better. Recently, one major breach \nhit Citibank, exposing information of more than 360,000 bankcard \ncustomers. Another massive data breach exposed information about more \nthan 100 million Sony customers.\n  Nor is the problem limited to businesses. In my home state of \nCalifornia, the state Department of Public Health was hit by its second \nmajor data breach in this year alone, affecting thousands of current \nand former state employees.\n  It is long past time for Congress to pass a national breach \nnotification standard to ensure that when consumers' information is at \nrisk, they know it and can take the necessary steps to protect \nthemselves.\n  Second point: what works for consumers here also is a winning \nproposition for the business community.\n  Under some estimates, the business community loses as much as 48 \nbillion dollars each year in fraudulent transactions involving stolen \nidentities.\n  Additionally, under the current legal framework, businesses must \ncomply with 46 different State laws to determine what kind of notice is \nnecessary when a breach occurs. As long as it is not watered down, one \nFederal standard makes much more sense than 46 different State laws. It \nwould ensure consumers are notified about dangerous breaches and can \nprotect themselves, while also giving companies one clear law to \nfollow.\n  Third and finally, this bill will help Federal law enforcement \nofficials as they work to protect our cyber security.\n  Jeffrey Troy, Deputy Assistant Director of the FBI's Cyber Division, \nurged businesses in 2009 to support Federal breach notification \nlegislation. As he explained, Federal officials need to receive \ninformation about data breaches in order to link those attacks to \nothers and potentially stop similar attacks at other organizations. \n``Connecting the dots'' is critical to this effort.\n  We live in a new world today, where attacks come not only through \ntraditional means but also through cyberspace with hackers breaking \ninto our electrical grid or viruses like the Conficker worm making \ntheir way through private computers across the country. It is essential \nthat we give the FBI and other law enforcement agencies the tools they \nneed to identify and eliminate potential cyber-threats.\n  The Federal Trade Commission, former President George W. Bush's \nIdentity Theft Task Force, and the Business Software Alliance have all \ncalled for federal data breach notification legislation. The Data \nBreach Notification Act also has been supported by the Consumers Union \nand the Information Technology Association of America.\n  This bill will protect consumers, cut costs for businesses, and give \nlaw enforcement officials additional resources they need.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important measure.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1408\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Data Breach Notification Act \n     of 2011''.\n\n     SEC. 2.
