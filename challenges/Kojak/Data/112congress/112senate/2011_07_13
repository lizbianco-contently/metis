Madam President, sometimes it is very hard to find common \nground in Washington. But there is one thing on which Republicans and \nDemocrats agree: It is absolutely necessary that Congress prevent a \ncatastrophic default on the Nation's debt that would put our economy at \ngrave risk. I have said it, and so have my Republican colleagues.\n  The business community is shouting out very loudly the same thing. \nThis week, business leaders wrote to Congress--in fact, it was \nyesterday--and the White House to ask us to put our differences aside \nand avert a default crisis before it is too late. Literally hundreds of \nCEOs, including executives of some of the Nation's largest companies \nand the most respected business groups, signed the letter--more than \n300. They wrote, ``This is a risk our country must not take.'' They \nsaid that if we don't reach a deal soon, the stock market will be in \n``disarray.'' We all know that. We all know we cannot afford to have \nour country crash. Our economy is already struggling to stay on course \nto recovery. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce president Tom Donahue, who \nsigned the letter, also said earlier this week that a default would \nhave ``dire consequences for our economy, our markets, and Main Street \nAmericans.''\n  Business leaders are begging us to do something and to do it quickly. \nThat is why I was shocked to hear the Speaker of the House say \nyesterday that averting a default crisis was President Obama's problem, \nnot his. That is not what he said a few months ago when he urged us to \n``deal like adults'' with the problem. It wasn't what he said when he \nvoted to raise the debt ceiling seven times while George W. Bush was \nPresident, increasing the debt limit by $4 trillion. In fact, when the \nSpeaker voted to increase the debt limit by nearly $1 trillion one time \nalone in 2003, he didn't demand that it be accompanied by massive \nspending cuts or any spending cuts. Instead, a Republican Congress \napproved hundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts for the wealthy, \nwhich contributed to our massive debt, and they were all on borrowed \nmoney. All those massive tax\n\n[[Page S4536]]\n\ncuts people received around the country were on America's credit card \nthat has now come due.\n  Congress has raised the debt limit 89 times since it was created in \n1939--54 times with Republican Presidents and 35 times under Democratic \nPresidents. Ronald Reagan asked Congress to raise the limit 18 times--\nand we raised it--twice as many as any other President. Republicans \nnever claimed then that the issue was the President's problem. For \nRepublicans to claim now that the deficit is a problem only for the \nPresident or Democrats in Congress is irresponsible. It is even more \nirresponsible considering President Bush, with the help of Republicans \nhere in Congress, doubled the debt while he was President. That is more \ndebt accumulated than any President in history, by far.\n  This problem belongs to all of us in Congress, and it will take all \nof us working together--political parties aside--to make a deal \npossible. This is not money being borrowed to spend more money; it is \nmoney we need to raise the debt ceiling so we can pay the bills we have \nalready accrued.\n  Democrats realize finding common ground isn't always easy. If it \nwere, we would have hammered out an agreement a long time ago. But \nreducing the deficit and getting our fiscal house in order is too \nimportant to quit when the going gets tough.\n  Theodore Hesburgh, the famous president of the University of Notre \nDame, said this about making difficult decisions:\n\n       You don't make decisions because they are easy; you don't \n     make them because they are cheap; you don't make them because \n     they're popular; you make them because they're right.\n\n  It is time for Democrats and Republicans to get together to do what \nis right for our Nation. We simply cannot allow our country to fail to \npay its bills for the first time in its history. I am confident we will \nfind a way to get this done. The risks to our economy are too great not \nto.\n  I was happy to hear yesterday--I received a phone call from the \nRepublican leader at 12:30 yesterday. He has come forward with a \nproposal to address the debt limit. I am studying it and discussing it \nwith my Senators. I have another meeting at 11 o'clock. Senator \nMcConnell has spent a great deal of time working on this, and I commend \nhim for his thoughtful and unique proposal. It is something we have to \nlook at very closely. I am heartened by what I read. This is a serious \nproposal, and I commend the Republican leader for coming forward.\n  I believe the Republican leader's proposal, combined with ideas he \nand I have been discussing to force a vote on deficit-reduction \nproposals, could go a long way toward resolving the impasse in which we \nnow find ourselves. We both agreed a long time ago that the problem is \nnot the President's. It is our problem, it is every American's problem, \nand certainly it is the problem of every Member of Congress.\n  In the meantime, this afternoon congressional leaders will again meet \nwith President Obama and his senior advisers to try to advance our \ndiscussions.\n  Democrats realize finding common ground isn't always easy. As I said \nbefore, if it were, we would have hammered out an agreement a long time \nago. But I say again, reducing the deficit and getting our fiscal house \nin order is too important to quit when the going gets tough. I am \nconfident that somehow, someway, we will find a way to get this done. \nWe can't allow our country for the first time in its history to fail to \npay its bills. The risks to our economy are far too great not to.\n  In that letter we received yesterday, American business leaders said \nit very well:\n\n       Now is the time for our political leaders to put aside \n     partisan differences and act in the Nation's best interests. \n     It is time to pull together rather than pull apart.\n\n  So I urge my Republican colleagues to remember this: We are not \nopponents, squaring off across a baseball diamond or some playing \nfield. We are on the same team with the same goal in mind. Let's take, \nfor example, the baseball team I just talked about. If the catcher \ndoesn't show up or refuses to play, it doesn't matter how good the \npitcher is, it doesn't matter how good his curve is or how fast he can \nthrow that ball, the team doesn't stand a chance without a catcher. A \nteam is needed to accomplish the goals of a baseball team. We need a \nteam to accomplish the goals this Congress has. It is time each and \nevery one of us here in Congress remembered that. In the words of \nAmerican business leaders, ``It's time to pull together rather than \npull apart.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/13/senate-section/article/S4536-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, there \nwill be 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled between the two \nleaders or their designees.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I rise to speak in morning business.\n  I wish to thank my colleague, the Democratic majority leader, for his \nopening remarks. He and I have been given an assignment of going to the \nWhite House each day to sit down with the leaders--Democratic and \nRepublican leaders in the House and the Senate, as well as the \nPresident, Vice President, Secretary of the Treasury, and leaders in \nthe President's staff--to deal with this pending crisis over the debt \nceiling limit.\n  On August 2, we are required to extend the debt ceiling of the United \nStates of America. It is an interesting exercise which usually goes \nunnoticed.\n  Senator Jeff Bingaman from New Mexico presented to us yesterday a \nhistory of the debt ceiling. I was glad to learn a little bit more. In \n1939, we passed a law which said we could extend the debt ceiling of \nthe United States as needed, rather than have congressional approval of \nevery bond issued by the Government of the United States. It made it a \nmuch more efficient way for the government to operate. As Senator Reid \nsaid earlier, since 1939, we have extended the debt ceiling 89 times, \nand on most every occasion it has gone unnoticed because the United \nStates has quickly extended its debt ceiling and kept its credit rating \nin the eyes of the world because of our timeliness. There was only one \nexception--a technical lapse that led to perhaps an increase in costs \nof government for just a brief time--but by and large, on 88 occasions \nthis was done without any fanfare or notice.\n  It is interesting to look at the Presidents who extended the debt \nceiling. The alltime recordbreaker when it comes to extending the debt \nceiling was Ronald Reagan, who extended the debt ceiling 18 times in a \nmatter of 8 years. So more than twice a year, Congress was extending \nthe debt ceiling as our national debt increased dramatically under \nPresident Reagan. The same thing happened under President Bush. He \nholds the record--the second highest record, I believe--with eight or \nnine extensions of the debt in his 8-year tenure as President. On both \noccasions, under President Reagan and under President George W. Bush, \nthe debt of the United States increased dramatically.\n  As Senator Reid said earlier, under President George W. Bush, the \ndebt of the United States of America in 8 years nearly doubled. In \nfact, some say it more than doubled. This was a period of time when we \nwere doing things that, frankly, cost us a lot of money in terms of our \nnational expenditures.\n  President George W. Bush waged two wars without paying for them. When \nwe do that, of course, the cost of the war is added to the Nation's \ndebt. President George W. Bush also did\n\n[[Page S4537]]\n\nsomething no President had ever done: He cut taxes on American \ntaxpayers in the midst of a war. Most Presidents understand we have to \ndo just the opposite--we have to raise more money to wage a war because \nwe have the ordinary costs of government that have to be met as well. \nSo the idea of cutting taxes in the midst of a war added even more to \nthe deficit under President George W. Bush. Then he had this theory \nthat there were major programs we could enact and not pay for, such as \nMedicare prescription Part D.\n  All of these things accumulated together with the basic philosophy of \nthe Republican Party that if we just keep cutting taxes, the economy \nwill get well. It didn't happen. Just the opposite occurred. When \nPresident George W. Bush took office, our Nation's budget was in \nsurplus. When he left office, it faced the largest deficit in its \nhistory. Instead of giving President Obama a positive economy when \nPresident Obama was sworn in as President, we were losing hundreds of \nthousands of jobs each month. Now we face a deadline of August 2 on \nwhether we extend the debt ceiling.\n  I see the Republican leader has come to the floor. I commend him for \nwhat I consider to be a positive and thoughtful response. He \nunderstands, as most all of us do, that extending the debt ceiling is \nessential for the economy of the United States and for our recovery \nfrom this recession. I asked my staff what would happen--what would \nhappen if we defaulted on our debt ceiling and didn't pay and interest \nrates went up 1 percent. They are around 2.8 percent, 2.9 percent now.\n\n  What if interest rates went up 1 percent because of this self-\ninflicted wound of a failure to extend the debt ceiling? The \nconsequences are real, and not just for the government but for families \nand businesses across America. A 1-percent increase in the interest \nrate, if we would default and not extend our debt ceiling--here is what \nthe Third Way reports: Treasury rates, if it increased 1 percent, would \ncause deficits to increase by $20 billion in the first year and by $150 \nbillion in the outyears. In other words, the debt of the United States \nwould increase by a dramatic amount.\n  Increased Treasury rates would cause the gross domestic product; that \nis, the economic activity of America, the sum total of our goods and \nservices, to decrease by 1 percent, according to J.P. Morgan. That \nwould cause the U.S. economy to lose 640,000 jobs. At a time when we \nare losing jobs in the public sector but gaining them in the private \nsector, the failure to extend the debt ceiling would, in fact, increase \nunemployment in America.\n  J.P. Morgan predicts that a 1-percent increase would cause a stock \nmarket loss of 9 percent. What does that mean to the savings and 401(k) \nplans of American families? They would lose, on average, $8,816--\nsomething no family would like to see. And raising mortgage rates by 1 \npercent would cause the typical mortgage to increase by somewhere in \nthe range of $38,000--$38,000 in payments that need to be made.\n  So why would we inflict this wound on ourselves? As we sit with the \nPresident and try to find our way through this crisis, we should \nunderstand that as the business leaders reported to us yesterday, this \nwould be a disaster--a self-imposed disaster, a failure of political \nleadership.\n  The President has called us together, and he has said: You are going \nto meet every single day until we get it done. That determination by \nthe President is keeping us at the table and focusing us on the mission \nat hand.\n  I will tell you, I believe we can reduce this deficit if we are \nhonest about the spending in Washington. To focus only on domestic \ndiscretionary spending--a part of the budget that has not increased in \nreal dollar terms in the last 10 years--and to ignore the costs that \nare growing on the security side, the defense side, as well as the cost \nof entitlement programs, is not only being blinded to reality, it \nreally means the cuts that are made in domestic discretionary spending \nare outrageously deep.\n  What we need to do, what the Bowles-Simpson commission told us needed \nto be done was painful but necessary: Put everything on the table--\neverything on the table. That means all spending, all entitlements, and \nrevenue.\n  I find it hard to understand the Republican position that says we can \nimpose new obligations on the families of children going to college to \npay more for student loans but we cannot impose any additional burden \non the wealthiest people in America to pay more taxes. To think that \nthe George Bush tax cuts means that for a person making $1 million in \nincome each year--that is $20,000 a week in income--to think that \nGeorge Bush tax cut is worth $200,000 a year in tax cuts for a \nmillionaire and that we would blithely hear from the other side that we \nshould allow that to continue while asking everyone else in America to \nsacrifice is upside down.\n  It is instructive to me that, when asked, people across America \nbelieve we should put everything on the table, including taxes and \nrevenue. We can do this.\n  The argument that this is the wrong time to raise taxes on anybody \nbecause of the state of the economy is not borne out by history. \nWhenever taxes have been increased in recent times, we have seen the \nopposite occur. If they are increased in a thoughtful way--not imposed \non working and middle-income families and lower income groups--in fact, \nwe have seen in the past that the economy has grown. It has not stopped \nus from growing.\n  We now have a top income tax rate of 35 percent. When it was over 39 \npercent under President Clinton, we had the fastest and most dynamic \ngrowth in our economy in modern time. There is no linkage between taxes \non the wealthy and the growth of our economy other than the exact \nopposite of the Republican argument. Where taxes have been raised on \nhigher income groups, we have actually seen our economy expand time and \ntime and time again.\n  So I would hope we would have a balanced approach to dealing with \nthis deficit and put everything on the table. I would hope that as we \nmeet with the President, we get the job done. And we ought to do it \nsoon. The longer we wait, the more the uncertainty, and it is not good \nfor our economy in a world where we have a volatile economic situation, \nparticularly in Europe. It is not good for job growth, where we know we \ndesperately need to create more good-paying jobs right here in America. \nAnd it is certainly not good for our reputation in Congress. We were \nelected to lead, to make hard decisions. We have that opportunity, and \nwe need to do it now.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                       Balanced Budget Amendment\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, yesterday morning I came to the floor \nto announce my conclusion that, despite his repeated claims to the \ncontrary, the President has no real intention of cutting spending or \ndealing with our deficits and debt. It has been my fervent hope that \nthe President could be persuaded to view the upcoming debt limit vote \nas an opportunity--an opportunity--to change direction, to cut \nspending, to cut debt, and to preserve entitlement programs. But those \nhopes have evaporated as the President began to insist in recent weeks \nthat he would only consider spending cuts later if Republicans agreed \nnow to one of the biggest tax hikes in history. Republicans refused to \nbe drawn into this legislative trap.\n  When Democrats proposed a smaller plan that they claimed, without any \ndetails, amounted to more than $1 trillion in cuts, we refused to go \nalong again because we knew that it really did not cut $1 trillion. We \nrefused to pretend that a bad idea was a good one. Our bottom line is \nthis: The White House would have to prove that the cuts it was claiming \nto support were real and enforceable before Republicans would sign off \non any plan to endorse them.\n  As it turned out, our skepticism was well founded.\n  Earlier this week, I asked an administration official point blank \nwhat the cuts they were proposing as part of their so-called bipartisan \ndeal would amount to next year; that is, year 2012. He said they were \ntalking about a $2 billion reduction--$2 billion--for next year. We \nwill borrow more than $4 billion today. That, Madam President, is not a \ndeal in which I am particularly\n\n[[Page S4538]]\n\ninterested. This is what they were planning to spin as more than $1 \ntrillion over 10 years. It was at that point that I realized the White \nHouse simply was not serious about cutting spending or debt. The only \nthing they were serious about was putting together a plan that appeared \nserious but really was not, and they wanted Republicans to go along \nwith it. Well, we are not interested in playing that game.\n  In the end, the White House gave us three choices in exchange for a \nvote to increase the debt limit: a massive tax hike, smoke and mirrors, \nor default. And none of these options is acceptable. So yesterday I \nproposed a possible fourth option as a last resort if the President \ncontinues to shirk his duty to do something about our dire fiscal \nsituation. If the White House continues to insist on either tax hikes \nor default, then we would send legislation to the President that \nrequires him to propose spending cuts greater than the debt limit he \nrequests; make the President show in black and white the specific cuts \nhe claims to support. If he refuses, he will have to raise the debt \nceiling on his own. But he is not going to get Republicans to go along \nwith that. That way, the President cannot pretend to support cuts when \nhe does not. He is forced to simply put up.\n  I understand the reluctance the American people have in concluding \nthat a serious solution is not going to happen. I hope I am wrong. The \nidea of not doing something serious about the debt before August, \nfrankly, sickens me. Like most Americans, I previously did not believe \nanyone in this country could seriously deny the need to rein in \ngovernment spending. Like most Americans, I previously did not believe \nanyone could be so shortsighted as to propose massive tax hikes in a \nweakened economy. Like all of you, I did not think even the most \nliberal among us would go to such lengths to protect the expansion of \ngovernment. I am sorry to report there are people who believe all of \nthose things, and they currently reside right down at 1600 Pennsylvania \nAvenue. But Republicans refuse to let the President use the threat of a \ndebt limit deadline to get us to cave on tax increases or on phony \nspending cuts that future Congresses could just as easily reverse with \na single vote. We are not gambling our Nation's fiscal future on the \npromise of spending cuts tomorrow for tax hikes today.\n  It is time to change the conversation altogether. It is time to \nrefocus this debate on the kinds of real cuts and debt reduction \nAmericans are demanding of us. It is time to show there are two \ndifferent versions of our Nation's future at work here. So over the \nnext several days, Republicans will redouble our efforts to avoid all \nfour scenarios. Americans do not want tax hikes, they do not want phony \nspending cuts, they do not want a debt disapproval plan, and they do \nnot want us to default on our debts. They want real cuts and real \nreforms now, and that is what Republicans will spend the next 2 weeks \nfighting for--the one thing that will ensure that Washington gets its \nhouse in order and forces future Congresses to live within their means.\n  The time has come for a balanced budget amendment that forces \nWashington to balance its books. If these debt negotiations have \nconvinced us of anything, it is that we cannot leave it to politicians \nin Washington to make the difficult decisions they need to to get our \nfiscal house in order. The balanced budget amendment will do that for \nthem. Now is the moment. No more games. No more gimmicks. The \nConstitution must be amended to keep the government in check. We have \ntried persuasion. We have tried negotiations. We have tried elections. \nNothing has worked. If the President will not do something about the \ndebt, we will go around him and take it to the American people. We will \nhave a real debate. Those who support endless spending and debt will \nvote against it. It is time we all stand up to be counted.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I thank the Republican leader for his \nefforts in this regard. I know for a fact that Senator McConnell and \nthe leadership on our side hoped and believed it was possible to take \nadvantage of the opportunity of the discussion over raising the debt \nlimit to create a major alteration in our plan of spending in this \ncountry. It has been disappointing to not have been met halfway in that \nregard.\n  When Senator McConnell was told the White House's plan included only \na $2 billion cut next year in spending, I found it stunning. Our \ndeficit this fiscal year will have added $1,500 billion to our debt. We \nare going to save $2 billion next year? This is not acceptable, and I \nam disappointed. I appreciate the Republican leader's efforts in that \nregard.\n  I would note, as to the discussion about that the war is causing our \ndeficit, it has been expensive over 10 years. The war on terrorism, \nIraq, and Afghanistan together have cost about $1.5 trillion. This next \nyear, we are projecting a little over $100 billion to be spent. So I \nwill just say that the amount of the deficit this one year will equal \nthe cost of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars over 10 years. The deficit \nthis year is $1,500 billion. The cost of the war this year is about \n$150 billion. It is about 10 percent of the deficit we are running this \nyear. Although we hope to bring those numbers down and are already \nprojecting next year those numbers to come down to closer to $100 \nbillion from $150 billion, the cause of our deficit is not the war. It \nrepresents about 10 percent of the total deficit we are running this \nyear. That is just a fact. That is what the numbers show.\n  One of the few things mandated for Congress to do every year is to \npass a budget. According to the Congressional Budget Act, contained in \nthe U.S. Code, signed into law in 1974, the Senate Budget Committee \nmust produce a budget resolution by April 1 and adopt a conference \nagreement on that budget by April 15. Furthermore, a budget must \ninclude total levels of spending, expected revenue, and deficits for no \nless than 5 years, and frequently we do 10-year budgets.\n  Once a budget is in place, Congress is prohibited from passing \nlegislation with spending that exceeds the levels that were in the \nbudget--sort of like we do in our homes. In essence, a budget is both a \nconcrete plan for the future, and an enforcement mechanism to help us \nstay within the limits we set, and to ensure honest accounting.\n  One of these enforcement mechanisms in the Budget Act as set forth in \nthe code is a prohibition against the consideration of any \nappropriations bills in the absence of a budget. We should not move \nforward with spending bills until we have established a budget. How \nsimple is that? That is why we are supposed to have it done by April \n15, because the appropriations bills come along afterwards.\n  This is the essence of good government. We should not spend taxpayer \ndollars without a plan for how to officially allocate the dollars and \nin a way that maximizes the effectiveness of our spending and minimizes \nwaste and abuse and fraud. We have too much of that in our government.\n  This point of order--and there is a point of order in the code--\ncontained in section 303(c) of the Congressional Budget Act, once that \npoint of order is raised, the legislation in question cannot move \nforward unless a majority of the Senators vote to waive the budget \nrequirement that taxpayer money should not be appropriated without a \nbudget--without a plan.\n  This is what the law dictates. I believe this is our responsibility \nas legislators and as Senators. This is what the organizational \nstructure of this very Senate requires, and this is the duty the \nDemocrat-led Senate has refused to fulfill for 805 days. Senate \nDemocrats have failed to adopt a budget in more than 2 years, and this \nyear they have refused to even produce a budget for public review. They \nclaim they have one. They claim it does some good things, and they leak \nportions of it to the public and spin it as being a positive document. \nBut when asked to produce it, they do not do so. When asked to have \nhearings on it, they do not do so.\n  If they are proud of it, if it will sustain public scrutiny, why do \nthey not bring it forward? I have never imagined that I would serve 2 \nyears in the Senate and now be ranking member of the Budget Committee, \nand we would not have a budget even presented. Today we are scheduled \nto vote on a motion to proceed to the Military Construction \nappropriations bill for fiscal year 2012, beginning October 1 of this \nyear.\n  Regardless of my feelings about the legislation or my high admiration \nfor\n\n[[Page S4539]]\n\nthose who have worked on it, I think I have a responsibility, a duty, \nas ranking member of the Budget Committee during this time of extreme \nfiscal danger, the greatest debt we have ever seen, to oppose cloture \non this measure and to raise the 303(c) point of order should cloture \nbe invoked.\n  My objection does not mean I do not support the bill. To any who \nwould suggest otherwise, let me say that this action is at its core a \ndefense of our men and women in uniform. No one understands duty better \nthan those who wear the uniform, and it is our duty to write a budget \nthat sets priorities and ensures the needs of our troops are met. The \nmilitary is a priority of the highest order. To protect that priority, \nwe must have a budget, especially in these challenging economic times.\n  The Senate has failed those in uniform if it chooses political \nexpedience over drafting a budget that includes a military spending \nplan. How can we protect the military from unwise cuts if spending \nplans are not even made public?\n  The only area of government significantly cut in the unseen \nDemocratic budget proposal that I have referred to previously--that I \nhave called a ``phantom budget''--appears to be the Pentagon's.\n  If we take the numbers that were leaked from their budget plan, it \ncalls for $900 billion in cuts to the Pentagon, to the government, to \nthe military. Well, if this is their plan we ought to know it. So I do \nnot want to hear people say that I am objecting to the Military \nConstruction bill because I do not appreciate the military, while the \nDemocratic majority, who is producing this Military Construction bill, \nclaim they have a budget that hammers the Defense Department by $900 \nbillion.\n  Indeed, while that appears to be the plan, the budget submitted by \nPresident Obama earlier this year--not one produced by the Senate \nDemocrats but the President's own budget--calls for a 9.5-percent \nincrease in the Energy Department, a 10.5-percent increase for the \nEducation Department, a 10.5-percent increase for the State Department, \nand a 60-percent increase for high-speed rail and the Transportation \nbudget without money to fund it.\n  While they are proposing major cuts in defense, we have major plans \non the table to increase spending next year when we are, again, going \nto run a $1 trillion-plus deficit. The authors of the Congressional \nBudget Act likely did not contemplate a future in which the governing \nparty believes budgets are no longer necessary. That seems to be the \ncase today. That is why I am also bringing forward legislation that \nwill raise a 303(c) point of order threshold to 60 votes--no \nappropriations without a budget unless 60 Senators choose to waive that \nrequirement. That is in the law.\n  We sometimes put requirements in the law. We do not have very good \nenforcement mechanisms. The danger we face from continuing to operate \nthis government without a clear, concrete budget is simply too great. \nAdmiral Mullen, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, warned that \nour Nation's debt is the gravest of all national security threats we \nface. It is so. We are reaching a point where our economy could enter \ninto a financial crisis as a result of our national debt.\n  We owe it to the extraordinary men and women who serve this country \nto defend at home the way of life they have defended abroad. That means \nthe Senate must confront the debt problem that threatens us with \neconomic disaster. Already, as economists Rogoff and Reinhart \ndemonstrated, we are losing at least 1 million jobs a year as a result \nof our high debt, which is now 95 percent of GDP and soon to be 100 \npercent of GDP.\n  In just a little over 2 months our Nation's gross debt will be as \nlarge as our entire economy and growing larger. This year we will take \nin $2.2 trillion, but we will spend $3.7 trillion. By the end of the \nfirst 3 years of the Obama administration, we will have accumulated $5 \ntrillion in gross debt--new debt.\n  Over the next 10 years we are projected to spend $46 trillion, adding \nanother $13 trillion to our national debt. That is 13,000 billion. The \nPresident proposed saving $2 billion next year. He proposes we increase \ntaxes on corporate jets that over 10 years would save $3 billion, while \nhe has a budget submitted to the Senate that would increase the debt by \n$13,000 billion over the next 10 years.\n  I do not defend corporate jets. We can eliminate that as far as I am \nconcerned and change our whole tax structure, which needs simplifying \nand more integrity and more effectiveness in it. But that is not a \nresponsible way for a leader to suggest that we are going to fix our \ndebt problems--by changing the corporate tax rate for jets. No nation \ncan sustain this level of debt, nor can any nation ever raise enough \ntaxes to cover this level of spending. The course we are on is not \nmerely unsustainable, it is unimaginable. The American people have \nevery right to be angry with their Congress. We are sitting here \nrunning a government and borrowing 40 cents of every dollar we spend. \nThey should be furious with us. It is unacceptable. It is \nunexplainable.\n  We spend and borrow all we can. That is the fact. There is only one \nsound answer: control spending and grow the economy, not tax it into \nsubmission. For Americans to regain prosperity, Washington must regain \ndiscipline. Hiking taxes to bail out the Washington spenders who have \nput us in debt by increasing domestic nondefense spending in the last 2 \nyears--not war, not Social Security, I am talking about general \nexpenditures of our government have gone up 24 percent in the last 2 \nyears. They have run up huge debts, and now they want the American \npeople to pay more so they can continue to spend at this irresponsible \nlevel. I say no to that. I am not for that.\n  Since the Democratic-led Senate last passed a budget, we have spent \n$7.3 trillion and increased the debt by $3.2 trillion. When President \nObama took office the public debt of the United States was about $5.7 \ntrillion. In 3 years we have added close to $4 trillion in debt. In 4 \nyears President Obama's debt that he will have run up at this rate will \nbe larger than the debt that has been accumulated in the entire history \nof America.\n  We are on an unsustainable course. This fiscal abandon has brought us \nto the brink of the debt ceiling that we have. We have a limit on how \nmuch debt we can run up statutorily. Yet, still, the Senate Democrats \nwill not produce a budget, and the White House will not put together an \nhonest plan with real spending cuts that they will stand behind and let \npeople analyze and score. Just more gimmicks, tricks, and games. That \nis not acceptable. That is why we are in this fix today.\n  Majority Leader Reid actually declared it would be ``foolish'' to \nhave a budget--``foolish'' to have a budget. Would you tell a family \nwho is having difficulty with their finances it is foolish to have a \nbudget? Would you declare to a family who is running up credit card \ndebt and 40 percent of what they are spending is put on a credit card \nevery month that they should not have a budget?\n  The United States Code requires us to have a budget by April 15. It \nis easy to claim deficit reduction as a priority, but if our leaders \nwere actually to put a plan on paper it would become all too clear that \ntheir real desire is for larger taxes and only meager cuts to spending. \nThat is the truth. That will not get the job done. Numbers do not lie. \nTheir rhetoric creates the appearance of savings, but those savings do \nnot exist when you look at the numbers carefully.\n  But while the White House and Senate Democrats may think their \nstrategy is clever, I do not think the American people should be \namused. I do not think the American people are amused. Until the \nmajority, who asked for the responsibility to lead this Senate--that is \nwhat they wanted. They have it. Until they allow this Chamber to adopt \na badly needed budget, I am going to continue to raise points of order \non appropriations bills.\n  Now more than ever, we should fulfill our legal duties, not shirk \nthem. More than ever today we should. We were not elected to preside \nover the financial decline of this country. We were not elected to shut \ndown the committees, deny them the right to function, to shut down \ndebate or cede our constitutional responsibility to secret meetings and \nclosed-door proceedings.\n  The debt limit is not only about fulfilling our obligation to \ncreditors, it is about fulfilling our obligation to the all of the \npeople we serve, good Americans. We owe them a Senate that\n\n[[Page S4540]]\n\nworks, that works openly and tirelessly on their behalf, which casts \nvotes on these important matters and has to respond and be accountable \nto the American people. We owe the people an honest, competent, \nlimited, efficient government. We owe them a Senate that is worthy of \ntheir faith and trust.\n  We are not there. We are not fulfilling that responsibility. \nTherefore, I expect that I will object and raise a budget point of \norder against movement to the Military Construction bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I want to echo some of the remarks made \nby my colleague from Alabama regarding a budget. He is the ranking \nRepublican member on our side on the Budget Committee.\n  It is ironic that we are on the floor of the Senate this week, as we \nwere last week, debating a nonbinding sense-of-the-Senate bill that \nstates ``those earning $1 million or more per year make a more \nmeaningful contribution to the deficit reduction effort.''\n  It doesn't specify what that is. It doesn't say there should be tax \nincreases or spending cuts that should have an impact on these high-\nincome earners. I echo what was stated by my colleague, which is that \nthis is no substitute for a budget. Congress's job is to pass a budget. \nThat is why we are here. That is why the taxpayers elected us. It is to \nset priorities and make decisions about where we are going to allocate \ntheir hard-earned tax dollars.\n  The Democrats have not passed a budget for 805 days. Now, this sense-\nof-the-Senate bill--which is vague, ambiguous, and meaningless--does \nnot do anything to address the fiscal challenges our country faces or \nachieve any level of budgetary savings.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. THUNE. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The Senator from South Dakota is an experienced member \nof the Budget Committee and a member of the leadership on the \nRepublican side in the Senate. Isn't it true that we had more interest \nfrom Members wanting to join the Budget Committee this year, \nparticularly new Members who had gotten elected and talked to their \nconstituents about their fear of America's debt and they wanted to be \non the Budget Committee, and only a few could be selected out of the \ngroup who wanted to be on it?\n  What has been the Senator's observation as to how they have reacted \nto the fact that no budget has been presented; that the committee has \nnever met or even marked up and held hearings as the United States Code \nrequires? Maybe the Senator can share how they feel about this.\n  Mr. THUNE. My colleague is absolutely right. There was tremendous \ninterest this year. If we look at the last election, the 2010 election, \na lot of the people who were elected in the House and Senate were \nelected because they ran on a message to their constituents of getting \nAmerica's fiscal house in order, getting spending and debt under \ncontrol.\n  Where does that start? It starts with a budget. So they got here and \ntried to get on the Senate Budget Committee. We have all these bright \nnew Members of the Senate who have a lot to contribute and who have had \nno opportunity to do that because we haven't had a budget, a markup, \nand we haven't done the necessary things in order to move the budget \nprocess forward.\n  I am completely in agreement with the Senator from Alabama when it \ncomes to what the priorities should be. It ought to be doing a budget \nthat actually focuses on cutting spending and getting this debt under \ncontrol.\n  I tried to offer an amendment to this nonbinding sense-of-the-Senate \nbill, but the majority is blocking amendments. That amendment would cut \nall nonsecurity discretionary spending for the current fiscal year by \n2.5 percent. It is a nominal amount, I recognize that. It is not a big \nspending cut. It is a small haircut. It will not solve our problem. It \nwould produce about $11 billion in savings from some of these accounts \nthat have seen, as the Senator noted, extraordinary growth since 2008.\n  Spending has increased in the discretionary part of the budget by 24 \npercent in 2 years, when inflation was about 2 percent. The government \nwas spending at a rate of 10 or 12 times the right of inflation. It is \nunsustainable.\n  We cannot argue to the American people with a straight face that that \nis the kind of spending that ought to be going on in Washington, DC. \nBecause the amendments have been blocked, we are probably not going to \nhave a chance to vote on that. But the amendment says: Let's cut by 2.5 \npercent the discretionary spending, given the fact that it has \nincreased 24 percent in the last 2 years.\n  These accounts started to feel downward pressure when the continuing \nresolution passed earlier this year, but more needs to be done. We need \nto put pressure on the spending side of the equation, not the tax side. \nAll of my Republican colleagues have said it multiple times, but I \nthink it bears repeating and explaining that our problem in Washington \nisn't that Washington taxes too little; it is that it spends too much. \nThat is true.\n  Revenues are below their historical average, but spending is \ndramatically higher than its historical average. The reason we have \nrevenues that are lower than the historical average is because we have \nan anemic economic recovery. If we get the economy growing and \nexpanding and creating jobs again, we will start to see some of the tax \nrevenue pick up. Just as a point of fact, in 2006 and 2007, we had a \nvery similar income tax system to what we have today. At that time it \nraised more revenue than our historical average. Our historical average \nis around 18 percent of our entire economy--what we raise in tax \nrevenues. In 2006 and 2007, in the Tax Code, the rates were similar to \ntoday. We have exceeded the average.\n  The issue is not that we have too little revenue in Washington, not \nthat Washington taxes too little; it spends too much. Once the economy \nstarts to turn around, we know we are going to be raising a substantial \nand sufficient amount of revenue without having to resort to tax \nincreases. In fact, if we were to enact tax reform that was revenue \nneutral--and by that I mean it doesn't generate more revenue for \nWashington to spend--but if we were to lower the rates on people and \nbusinesses and broaden the tax base, our economy would grow and expand \ndramatically, and we would see even more revenue generated for the \nFederal Government and more jobs created, which is what everybody wants \nto see. We should not, however, simply increase taxes to pay for ever-\nincreasing spending for programs that aren't sustainable.\n  This year Federal government spending will comprise 24.3 percent of \nour Nation's entire economic output. So almost a quarter of every \ndollar spent in this country will be spent by the Federal Government. \nThat doesn't take into consideration spending by State and local \ngovernments. But it is 18 percent more than our historical average. We \nspend about 20.6 percent, historically, of our entire economy on the \nFederal Government. This year it is 24.3 percent. We are almost at a \nquarter out of every dollar being spent by our Federal Government in \nWashington, DC.\n  What happens? That means there is less activity in the private \neconomy, which is where the real jobs are created. When the Federal \nGovernment is spending this much and borrowing this much, it crowds out \nprivate investment and makes it difficult for the private economy to \ncreate jobs that are permanent, good-paying jobs for the people of this \ncountry.\n  Perhaps an even more pertinent statistic is the years in which our \nbudget has been balanced since 1969. These budgets were balanced \nbecause spending was constrained. If we look at the 5 years when the \nbudget was balanced, the Federal Government's spending in those 5 years \ncomprises just under 18.7 percent of our GDP, our economic output. So \nif we look at the problem that we are trying to diagnose in this \ncountry, our colleagues on the other side diagnose it as a revenue \nproblem. I submit that the problem we are trying to solve is \nfundamentally a spending problem. Five times, when the budget was \nbalanced since 1969, in every instance it was because we were spending \nless than the historical average.\n  This year's spending is over 30 percent more than the years in which \nwe\n\n[[Page S4541]]\n\nbalanced the budget; that is, as a percentage of our entire economy. \nThat is how much higher it is than the years in which we balanced our \nbudget. That is how much and how fast government spending is growing. \nUnfortunately, it remains above the historical average every year in \nthe President's budget. He submitted a budget that borrows more, spends \nmore, and taxes more. I can't think of a worse way to get out of an \neconomic downturn and start creating jobs than to continue to spend at \nthis uncontrollable rate, to continue to borrow more and more money, \nand impose higher taxes on an American economy that is already \nstruggling.\n  After 2018, according to the President's budget, spending increases \nevery single year. That is a spending problem; that is not a revenue \nproblem. Despite that, the administration wants to take what they call \na ``balanced approach'' and to have shared sacrifice.\n  Only in Washington, DC, would spending more and taxing more be \nconsidered a balanced approach. Only in Washington would shared \nsacrifice mean taking more of taxpayers' hard-earned money to spend on \nthe administration's priorities.\n  To put a fine point on that, this week, the President said he would \n``rather be talking about things that everyone wants, like new \nprograms.'' This is code for: I need more of your money so I can spend \nmore.\n  I reject that notion. We don't need more spending in Washington, DC. \nWe don't need more programs. We don't need to expand government. \nGovernment is too big already, at 25 percent of our entire economy.\n  Let's pretend for a minute that deficit reduction really was the \nPresident's priority. What has happened in the past with these \n``balanced budget'' deals? In 1990 the budget agreement reached by \nPresident Bush at Andrews Air Force Base was supposed to have spending \ncuts that outnumbered tax increases by a 2-to-1 margin. Spending was \nsupposed to be cut by $274 billion, and taxes were going to be \nincreased by $137 billion.\n  What actually happened? Tax hikes certainly materialized, but the \nreality is that spending actually increased. So in the 1990 \n``balanced'' budget approach, we got increased spending and increased \ntaxes. In 1982, under President Reagan, the exact same thing happened.\n  Madam President, I simply say to my colleagues that this is \nfundamentally a debate about the size of our government. We believe in \na debt crisis we ought to make government smaller, not larger, and not \ncreate more programs. Our colleagues on the other side have a different \nview. We ought to be talking about what we can do to get people in this \ncountry back to work and small businesses hiring.\n  There was a Chamber of Commerce survey that said 64 percent of small \nbusinesses will not add to their payrolls this year, and 12 percent \nwill cut jobs. Why? Because of the economic uncertainty created in \nWashington and because we are unwilling to deal with the spending and \ndebt issue that is in front of us and to put policies into place that \nwill enable job creation and economic growth.\n  I hope my colleagues will work with us to reduce the size of \ngovernment, not grow it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. On the Democratic side, 15 minutes \nremains, and there is no time on the Republican side.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I rise to speak about the budget and \ndeficit issues that are facing us. The first point, which is becoming \nclearer and clearer to the American people, is how bad a default would \nbe.\n  The bottom line is very simple: America has never defaulted on its \ndebt--nor should any country, particularly the greatest country in the \nworld--debt that is a promise of expenditures that have already been \nmade. When we raise the debt ceiling, we are simply saying we are going \nto pay our bills.\n  The bottom line is that every family in America has to do that. If \nyou own a mortgage, you can't say, after you have signed the mortgage \nand lived in the house: I am not going to pay my mortgage unless ABC \nhappens.\n  If you have credit card debt and you have incurred significant debt, \nyou can't say to the credit card company: I am not going to pay that \ndebt unless you do ABC.\n  Yet some of our colleagues on the other side--and particularly in the \nHouse of Representatives--seem to say that. It would lead to disaster. \nIt would lead to disaster for the government. In August America has \n$306 billion--this government, this Federal Government, has $306 \nbillion in obligations and $172 billion in income. If we don't raise \nthe debt ceiling, we are going to have awful choices: Do we pay the \nSocial Security recipients and not the veterans? Do we pay the veterans \nand not those to whom we owe money? Do we say we will pay veterans but \nnot pay people who inspect food or guard our borders? The choices are \nawful, and choices the American people should not have foisted on them \nby an irresponsible Congress that says we will not raise the debt \nceiling.\n\n  It will also hurt American homeowners and debtors. If you are a \nmortgagor, your debt will go up. If you have a variable-rate mortgage, \nand we don't raise the debt ceiling, you will pay perhaps hundreds of \ndollars more each month. If you have credit card debt, which most \nAmericans have, the rates are likely to go up.\n  Overall, at a time when we need jobs and the economy is so \nprecarious, it could send us back into a recession and perhaps even \nworse, according to some economists. So not raising the debt ceiling \nand defaulting on our debt is not an option.\n  Yesterday, Senator McConnell realized that. The substantive good news \nhere is that the plan Mitch McConnell offered, for all its faults, \nmakes the likelihood of our not paying our bills, of not raising the \ndebt ceiling less likely. However, the plan has a good deal of fault to \nit. It seems to be a political document. It says what we care most \nabout is two things: It says we want to throw the responsibility of \nraising the debt ceiling to the other side, and it says the Republican \nParty cares more about preserving tax breaks for the wealthy and \ncorporate America than actually bringing down our debt.\n  All the talk about deficit reduction, all the talk about getting a \nhandle on our debt has been thrown to the wind, all in an effort to \nsay: We know if we raise the debt ceiling there will be trouble. \nSenator McConnell is well aware--he is very smart when it comes to the \npolitics of it--that had the debt ceiling not been raised, the blame \nwould have fallen on the party that has been saying they don't care \nabout raising the debt ceiling.\n  Hundreds of members of the Republican Party throughout the country--\nscores in this Congress both in this House and the other--have said: We \nare not going to raise the debt ceiling. Senator McConnell, realizing \nthe consequences of doing that would fall on the party that doesn't \nbelieve it is important to do so, had to act. But at the end of the \nday, where is the debt reduction? Where is the deficit reduction we \nhave heard about in speech after speech after speech from the other \nside?\n  The bottom line is very simple: Again, when President Obama offered a \nplan that would remove tax breaks from the rich, that would close \ncorporate loopholes, the other side said: We can't tolerate that, even \nif it means debt reduction. The McConnell plan shows what the other \nparty, the other side of the aisle, cares about: preserving tax breaks \nfor the rich and preserving corporate loopholes much more than reducing \nour deficit and bringing down our debt.\n  Having said that, as I said, Senator McConnell has at least \nrecognized, even if partially politically, the gravity of the \nsituation, and he joins the other leaders in Washington in doing that. \nPresident Obama has as well, and that is why he put out his $4 trillion \nplan. Speaker Boehner has also. That is why he was willing to \nentertain--until the rug was pulled out from under him--a big plan. \nLeader Reid and Leader Pelosi have constantly talked about their views \nand ways we can reduce the deficit and avoid default. There is only one \nperson who hasn't come up with a plan, who hasn't compromised, and who \nhasn't reached out to the other side in an effort to move forward, and \nthat is the majority leader in the House, Mr. Cantor. He is the only \none\n\n[[Page S4542]]\n\nwho still says: My way or the highway. Every other leader has said they \nare willing to make certain concessions--even though they do not like \nthem--to avoid default.\n  The Nation, and, of course, this Congress is waiting for Leader \nCantor to step to the plate in a similar way so that maybe we can come \nto a compromise that actually avoids default and, at the same time, \ngets a handle on the debt and deficit problems and reduces both of \nthose.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I know we have a vote that is \ncoming up momentarily, but I just wanted to say my wish for those folks \nwho are huddling up down at the White House every day: Don't miss this \nopportunity for a grand bargain to do something serious about deficit \nreduction. That is why I am concerned about Senator McConnell's \nproposal because it would take us off that practice.\n  When they look at that real opportunity for $4 trillion of deficit \nreduction, they ought to look at the proposal of the Senate Budget \nCommittee--$4 trillion, $2 trillion of which over 10 years comes out of \nthe $14 trillion of the tax expenditures--or tax preferences that \nspecial interests have. We would only have to take from 9 to 17 percent \nof all that $14 trillion of tax preferences in order to produce the $2 \ntrillion of revenue over 10 years.\n  I have just put that issue to a panel of experts in a joint Ways and \nMeans-Finance Committee meeting as to what they would recommend, and I \nwill talk about that later today.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that all \ntime be yielded back.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

This would be our first appropriations bill. I think it \nwould be, especially in that we are working on these budgets, deficit-\nreduction programs right now here and at the White House, a good \nmessage to everybody\n\n[[Page S4543]]\n\nthat we can do an appropriations bill and stay within our legislative \nframework as far as spending.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent to speak \nas in morning business for--well, it will not be 20 minutes but let me \nask for up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           State of the Ocean\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, nothing is more important in the short \nterm than resolving our debt limit impasse, and I would urge my \ncolleagues to take Social Security out of their gun sights. It has not \ncontributed to our debt or deficits.\n  I would urge my colleagues to focus not on Medicare benefit cuts but, \nrather, on health care system reforms that will save not only Medicare \nand Medicaid costs but private health care and health insurance costs \nas well--cost savings throughout the system. I would urge my colleagues \nto yield a bit on defending every tax loophole, every tax gimmick and \ntax preference as if they were tax hikes. They are not. They are just \nnot. They are earmarks in the Tax Code. They are special benefits in \nwhich ordinary Americans usually do not share, and we should not put \nthe special interests first, ahead of ordinary Americans who did not \nget special tax deals.\n  But as important as all of that is in the short term, there are some \nthings that are more important in the long term than our debt limit, \nand I rise to speak about one.\n  In April of this year a group of scientific experts came together to \ndiscuss an issue with consequences that will influence the planet and \nour American society for generations to come. They met at the \nUniversity of Oxford to discuss the current state, and eventual fate, \nof our oceans. ``The ocean,'' as stated in the workshop's summary \nreport, ``is the largest ecosystem on Earth, supports us and maintains \nour world in a habitable condition.''\n  For 3 days, 27 scientists representing 18 prominent research and \nconservation organizations worldwide, reviewed the latest findings on \nocean stressors--and in particular the consequences of multiple, \ncombined stressors--for marine life and for the human population. The \nscientists found that stressors in combination magnify the negative \neffect of each one occurring alone.\n  Based on this determination, the scientists at this meeting \nconcluded:\n\n       We have underestimated the overall risks and that the whole \n     of marine degradation is greater than the sum of its parts, \n     and that degradation is now happening at a faster rate than \n     predicted.\n\n  In short, things for the ocean are worse than we thought and getting \nworse faster than expected.\n  All too often, we take for granted the fact that our oceans feed us, \nsupport our coastal communities, and drive our tourism economies. \nUnfortunately, these ocean ecosystems are severely stressed, from \nnutrient pollution, chemical dumping, overfishing, marine debris, \ninvasions of exotic species, warming waters and, perhaps most alarming, \na drop in ocean pH to levels not seen for more than 8,000 centuries: \nacidification of our oceans. Individually, these stressors would be \ncause for concern. In combination with each other, this expert group of \nscientists concluded, they are driving our ocean toward the brink of a \nmass extinction and ecosystem collapse.\n  One example of the multiplier effect on marine life comes from \nplastic debris and toxic chemicals. Plastics make their way as trash \ninto the ocean where they break down into small particles that are \nconsumed by marine life, like sea turtles, sea birds, and microscopic \nplankton. Consumption of plastic alone becomes fatal for marine life, \nwhen they consume so much indigestible material that they stop eating \nall together and starve to death. But the surfaces of plastic particles \nalso easily absorb chemical pollutants, so they amplify the load of \nchemical pollution on these creatures.\n  The levels of chemical pollution are themselves on the rise in even \nthe most remote seas where no human development exists. Many of these \nchemical pollutants, like flame retardants and fluorinated compounds \nare poured down home sinks, or expelled as waste from industrial \nfacilities, directly into the ocean. Plants and animals have not \nevolved ways to break down these new synthetic compounds, so they \n``bioaccumulate,'' meaning they become increasingly concentrated as \nthey are passed up the food chain, or passed in marine mammals from \nmothers to calves in their milk, until many of our top oceanic \npredators, our most majestic creatures, are now swimming toxic waste.\n  Another example of what the scientists call ``negatively \nsynergistic'' environmental harms is the combination of destructive \nfishing practices, nutrient runoff, and the presence of hormone-\ndisrupting pharmaceuticals in our wastewater on coral reefs. But now, \nthese precious ecosystems, known as the rainforests of the sea, do not \nhave to just contend with overfishing, nutrient, and wastewater \npollution. Now the reefs, like the mangroves, salt marsh estuaries, and \nseagrass meadows, in their damaged and less resilient state, must also \nface a rapidly changing climate and its dual effects of ocean warming \nand acidification. Coral reefs are more likely to bleach when exposed \nto both increased temperature and acidification than if they are \nexposed to either condition separately.\n  Add both conditions to pre-existing stressors, and 35 percent of the \nworld's reefs are classified as in a critical or threatened stage. \nScientific projections indicate that without urgent action, coral reef \necosystems could be eliminated in 30-50 years.\n  The death and decline of coral reefs, the most diverse ecosystems on \nthe planet, dramatically impairs the reproduction and development of \nhundreds of other species that call them home. When a reef ecosystem \ncollapses and does not recover, it quickly becomes dominated by algae, \nand the phenomenal biodiversity once present disappears. For human \nsociety, this is accompanied by a loss of food, loss of income, and \ndamage to the billion-dollar per year tourist industries.\n  The workshop report echoes the overwhelming body of peer-reviewed \nscience and literature on climate change and carbon pollution, stating \nthat:\n\n       Human actions have resulted in warming and acidification of \n     the oceans and are now causing increased hypoxia (lack of \n     oxygen). Studies of the Earth's past indicate that these are \n     the three symptoms . . . associated with each of the previous \n     five mass extinctions on Earth.\n\n  We are now talking about changes whose precedents can only be found \nin geologic time. I have often said how we have veered outside of the \nbandwidth of carbon concentration that has prevailed for 800,000 years. \nThis comparison is to mass ocean extinction events 55 and 251 million \nyears ago. Back then, the rates of carbon entering the atmosphere in \nthe lead-up to these extinctions are estimated to be 2.2 and 1.2 \ngigatons of carbon per year, respectively, over several thousand years. \nBut, as this new report identifies, ``Both these estimates are dwarfed \nin comparison to today's emissions of roughly 30 Gt of CO2 \nper year.'' Such a massive dumping of carbon pollution into our \natmosphere creates the prospect of devastating damage to our oceans.\n  And, in fact, we may already be witnessing this devastation. In one \nbreathtaking part of the report, the scientists remark that, ``The \nspeeds of many negative changes to the ocean are near to or are \ntracking the worst-case scenarios from the IPCC and other \npredictions.'' The IPCC, or Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, \ncreated several scenarios predicting how the Earth's natural systems \ncould respond to ever-increasing amounts of carbon dioxide in the \natmosphere. This report says observations are worse than the IPCC's \nworse case scenarios. The predictions of the IPCC have received a lot \nof special-interest-sponsored mockery on this floor, but these are not \npredictions now, they are observations. For instance, the decrease in \nArctic Sea ice cover and the melting of the Greenland and Antarctic ice \nsheets, which hold enough water to\n\n[[Page S4544]]\n\nraise sea levels by more than 200 ft, are actually occurring, and \nfaster than expected. Correspondingly, sea levels are rising.\n  Likewise, the report observes that ``acidification is occurring \nfaster than in the past 55 million years, and with the added man-made \nstressors of overfishing and pollution undermining ocean resilience.''\n  These observations should be sobering. Not only are the changes \ngreat, but they are happening so quickly that marine life cannot adapt.\n  Numerically, the average ocean pH has decreased from 8.2 to 8.1 since \nthe industrialized revolution. This seems like a small change, but the \npH scale is logarithmic, so the change is profound. If that same amount \nof change in pH occurred in our blood, we could suffer respiratory or \nkidney failure. It is not difficult to imagine how this change has huge \nconsequences for marine life and especially the calcifying organisms, \nlike coral reefs, shellfish, and plankton, which are increasingly \nbecoming soluble in their environment as it becomes increasingly \nacidic. If this unprecedented rate of change in ocean pH continues it \ncould mean an almost 200 percent decrease by mid century. It is not an \nexaggeration to say that we are on the verge of an ecosystem collapse \nthat we could see happen in a single generation.\n  Though mass extinction events have occurred in the past, workshop \nparticipants state that, ``comparing the current environmental change \nwith these events is difficult because the rates of environmental \nchange are unprecedented. It is therefore difficult to predict what the \noutcome of the current anthropogenic experiment will be.'' However, the \nreport continues: ``it can be said that we are pushing the Earth system \nto its limits.''\n  The workshop participants concluded, ``Unless action is taken now, \nthe consequences of our activities are at a high risk of causing, \nthrough the combined effects of climate change, overexploitation, \npollution and habitat loss, the next globally significant extinction \nevent in the ocean.'' Again, they mean in geologic time.\n  So what will we do? This is not the first report to state with \ncertainty that our oceans, and thus our ocean dependent populations and \neconomies, are in serious jeopardy. In 2003 the Pew Ocean Commission \nreport led off with the following, ``America's oceans are in crisis and \nthe stakes could not be higher.'' In 2004, the U.S. Commission on Ocean \nPolicy, as mandated by Congress in the Oceans Act of 2000, published \ntheir final report and pronounced, ``The importance of our oceans, \ncoasts, and Great Lakes cannot be overstated; they are critical to the \nvery existence and wellbeing of the nation and its people. Yet, as the \n21st century dawns, it is clear that these invaluable and life-\nsustaining assets are vulnerable to the activities of humans.''\n  Nearly two centuries ago, the poet Byron could write:\n\n     Roll on, thou deep and dark blue Ocean--roll.\n     Ten-thousand fleets sweep over thee in vain;\n     Man marks the earth with ruin--his control\n     Stops with the shore.\n\n  Well, no more. Now, in 2011, this international group of scientists \nreminds us that we are now marking the oceans with ruin and that ``the \nhuman interactions with the ocean must change,'' to quote their report, \n``to sustainable management of all activities that impinge marine \necosystems.''\n  Mr. President, we must work together to preserve and protect the \nocean ecosystems we rely on so heavily, for we too are greater than the \nsum of our parts. In a bipartisan effort, Senator Snowe and I have \nintroduced the National Endowment for the Oceans to provide dedicated \nfunding for ocean and coastal research, restoration, protection, and \nconservation. Too often, the knowledge and the information we need to \nbetter protect and understand these ecosystems comes too late or comes \nnot at all. We hope to change that.\n  Together, we can still turn the tide to protect our ocean and our \nsociety, but if we are to have any chance, we must act soon, and we \nmust make progress quickly. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to confront these looming challenges.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I am in somewhat of a unique position as a \nreturning Senator after being out of Congress for 12 years. I never \ncontemplated running for the Senate again or being back on this floor \nin any capacity except as a former Senator, but I had a chance to do it \nover, I guess is the best phrase, and assess what is important and why \nI am here.\n  I ran for only one reason. I am deeply concerned about the direction \nof our country and our plunge into debt. I want to try and avoid coming \nhere and assessing blame, but rather set aside who is responsible. I \nwant us to avoid the politics of all this and simply recognize this is \nthe situation we face. Our fiscal situation has potentially dire \nconsequences for the future of this country, not just for our children \nand grandchildren, but even for this generation.\n  Our economy is not in good shape. We still have not recovered from \none of the deepest recessions since the Great Depression. There are a \nlot of people out of work. The official unemployment number is 9.2 \npercent. The real number is a lot higher than that because many people \nhave given up looking for work, or they extended their time in school \nbecause they know that if they graduate and get out into the job market \nthey are not going to be able to find work in the area they are trained \nfor, or perhaps in any area. A lot of people have tried and tried and \nsimply cannot find work.\n  It is clear and I think there is a consensus--if not total consensus \nat least pretty close to total consensus--that we simply have run out \nof money. As a government we have made promises that we can no longer \nafford to pay for and fulfill, without serious financial restructuring. \nWe have enjoyed a lot of largess and a lot of prosperity in the past. \nAs a result, commitments were made for spending in discretionary \nprograms, building highways, and sewer systems, etc.--a lot of good \nthings but things we simply no longer can afford.\n  We see this happening across the world. There has been a 60-year \nspurt or commitment to credit and now the money has run out to pay for \nall that. Whether it is southern Europe, other parts of the world or \nthe United States, this is a very difficult situation. For the last 6 \nor 7 months a lot of us have worked very hard to try to find a \nsolution. We are now in the month of July, and we are approaching the \ndate in which we reach our debt limit. We no longer can continue to \nborrow without raising that limit.\n  About 40 percent of everything we spend now has to be borrowed. That \nis unsustainable. We are told that funding for the basic programs that \nhelp the senior citizens of our country enjoy the rest of their lives--\nMedicare and Social Security--are drying up, and it will not be long \nbefore either benefits have to be cut or programs become insolvent. No \none here wants to see that happen. What we do want to see happen, \nthough, are necessary steps to preserve those programs for the future.\n  This crisis is occurring all over the world. We are watching it take \nplace as it creeps through different countries, and now we are facing \nthat. Whether it is a liberal economist or conservative economist or \nsomeone in between, or someone with no political interest, there is \nconsensus that we have to take action and we need to take it now. We \ncannot postpone it. We have been doing this for years.\n  We all knew the baby boomers would retire and put tremendous pressure \non our budget, and that is exactly what has happened. The quicker we \ntake action, the less painful it will be. It is going to be painful \nbecause we have put fixing this problem off for so long.\n  For 6 or 7 months there has been a sincere effort by a lot of people \nto solve this problem--Republicans and Democrats. These are people who \ngenuinely have concern for the future of this country and believe we \nneed to address these issues, as painful as they are. It goes against \npolitical instincts of preparing and positioning oneself for \nreelection, whether it is 2012 or beyond.\n  But as I said from the beginning, we must find a way to transcend \npolitics\n\n[[Page S4545]]\n\nand the 2012 election. Unfortunately, the closer we get to the crisis, \nthe more we see politicians positioning themselves so as not to be \nblamed.\n  The reason we came here was not to position ourselves politically so \nwe can succeed in the next election. The reason we came was to deal \nwith the problem in front of us right now and that needs to be \naddressed right now. What is the rough consensus? The rough consensus \nis that if we don't have at least, over the next 10 years, $4 trillion \nto $6 trillion of cuts in discretionary spending and in some of the \nmandatory programs, we are not going to have a credible program the \nfinancial world will be able to look at and say: You can still trust in \nthe value of the dollar and ability to continue viewing America as a \nsafe haven to place investments.\n\n  There is a consensus that unless we make structural changes--not just \ncuts and nicks and little slices here and there, but structural \nchanges--in the entitlement programs, they will not be solvent in the \nyears ahead. Then we will have to turn to those senior citizens and \nbeneficiaries and low-income people and say: I am sorry. We simply \ncannot pay you what we had committed to pay you. Your benefits are \ngoing to have to be reduced, or we are going to have to raise taxes to \npay for it.\n  Without comprehensive tax reform, we are not going to have the kind \nof package we need to create a dynamic, growing economy that can solve \nsome of our revenue problems. It is not just cutting, it is not just \ngrowth, but it is a combination of those items and structural reform \nthat is necessary in a package, and that is what we have been debating: \nhow to get there.\n  What is disturbing to me lately is that we have shifted away from \nthat central focus, and now we are focusing on who will take the blame \nwhen we default or don't default on August 2. There is a lot of \npolitical posturing around here. This is not about corporate jets. It \nis not about all these ads out there and mailings and so forth saying: \nCongress is going to take away your Social Security. Congress is going \nto slash your Medicare benefits.\n  I guess I am asking that we acknowledge the reality of the situation \nwe are in, that we do our very best to put this above the politics of \n2012, and work to find some sensible solution to all of this.\n  I believe comprehensive tax reform can potentially provide a way to \naddress the need for revenue and the need for growth. As we know, there \nare hundreds, if not thousands, of special expenditures, exemptions, \nsubsidies, credits in the Tax Code that were put in for the few and not \nfor the many, that have complicated our Tax Code to the point where no \none can understand it except for someone with an advanced degree in \naccounting or law.\n  So I believe tax reform is essential as a part of whatever reform \npackage we finally come up with to address the debt. Senator Wyden and \nI, on a bipartisan basis--a Democrat from Oregon, a Republican from \nIndiana--have put together a comprehensive tax reform package. We don't \ncall it perfect. We are open to suggestions. But it eliminates those \nspecial exemptions and uses the revenues gained from cutting loopholes \nto lower tax rates for Americans. Our corporations pay the highest \ncorporate tax rate of every one of our global competitors except one. \nThere are 36 countries that compete and sell their products around the \nworld, and we are 35 out of 36 when it comes to our tax rate. We want \nto level playing field with the rest of them because we think we can \noutcompete, and that will be a significant and positive impact on our \neconomy. So using those revenues from eliminating loopholes as a way of \nlowering tax rates and addressing some of the needs we have is \ncertainly something we ought to be exploring.\n  Lastly, let me just say we need to focus on the reality of the \nsituation in a personal way because we get caught up in numbers, and we \nget caught up in generalities. What are we trying to do? We are trying \nto get this economy moving again so people who have been searching for \nwork for 2 and 3 years can get their jobs back; so young couples who \nwish to raise a family have the opportunity to buy a home; so parents \nwho are saving and trying to get their children into good schools for \npostsecondary education have the ability to do that; so college \ngraduates can come out of school with a degree and find a place to work \nand begin a career.\n  We owe it to the people of our country who are suffering right now, \nand there are many. We owe it to this Nation that has provided so much \nopportunity and so much prosperity for so many people. No country in \nthe world has come close to what America has achieved. We owe it to our \nchildren and our grandchildren who will inherit what we have done or \nnot done. The reality is, we are going to transfer a debt load onto our \nchildren and future generations that they may not be able to overcome. \nI don't want to leave that legacy. I don't want to be part of a \ngeneration that does that. So I think it is time for us to stand up and \ndo what is necessary to address this problem.\n  Letters and emails from Indiana are running 100 to 1 in favor of \ncutting government, and running 100 to 1 against cutting anything in \nSocial Security or Medicare. I have people coming into my office every \nday saying: We know we have to get our fiscal house in order, but let \nme tell you why our program needs to be exempted.\n  As politicians, we want to say yes to people. As responsible, elected \nofficials faced with a very difficult situation, we have to, with \ncompassion, look at people and say: No, we are not able to do this. We \nare not able to afford this, but we are taking this action today so we \ncan afford it in the future. We are taking action now so we can leave \nfuture generations with the same types of opportunities our generation \nhas enjoyed and the benefits that come from living in America. That may \ncost some people their elections. There are a number of people here who \nare willing to sacrifice for that purpose.\n  Do we want to leave and say: Well, I survived all these years \nunscathed politically, or do we want to leave here saying at the right \ntime we did the right thing? At the time of crisis, at a time when our \ncountry desperately needed us to come together to address this very \nserious problem that could plunge our country into a deep recession, if \nnot depression, at a time when financial institutions around the world \nare fragile, at a time when wars and conflicts are popping up all over \nthe globe, did we do the right thing? What do we want our legacy to be \nregardless of the consequences?\n  We are 2 or 3 weeks away from defaulting on our debt. There are a lot \nof excuses around here about that and some even think it will not have \nmany consequences. It will. The idea of using that as leverage to gain \nwhat we need to do doesn't appear to have worked.\n  I think if we keep our focus simply on default or not default, we \nstill have a major problem. Just simply finding a way to get through \nthis and raising the debt limit does not solve the underlying problem. \nThat has to be addressed. I wish we had been able to do that because \nthe situation is dire. We cannot wait until 2013. We need to do it now.\n  So here I am. I don't have answers. I have some guidelines from \npeople who know a lot more about this than I do, people who do not have \na political stake in this in terms of what they think we need to do to \nput together a package. We need a plan that has credibility with the \nfinancial world, so that what has happened in Greece, Portugal and \nIreland and maybe now in Italy or Spain, and other places in the world \nwill not happen here because we have restored some confidence and faith \nin the American people and the investment see the United States as a \nsafe haven for their money. We need credibility so others know we have \nseen the problem, we have recognized it, we have taken meaningful \nsteps, and while it will be painful and take time--America has come \nthrough.\n  To paraphrase Winston Churchill: America always will do the right \nthing after it has tried all the wrong things. Well, we spent a lot of \nyears doing the wrong things and not recognizing that we were building \nup an unsustainable fiscal situation that would come back to haunt us. \nWe have tried a lot of methods and postponements and deferments and \neverything else. What we have not done is stand up to the problem we \nhave and do what is necessary, take this above politics, and do what is \nright for America.\n  Mr. COATS. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from Alaska.\n\n[[Page S4546]]\n\n                                croatia\n\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I rise to speak briefly about progress in \nthe nation of Croatia, which I was honored to visit recently.\n  At the invitation of the Croatian Minister of Defense, I participated \nin what is known as the ``Croatian Summit,'' a gathering of leaders \nfrom Eastern Europe.\n  The theme of this year's summit was: ``A New Decade for Southeast \nEurope: Finalizing the Transition.''\n  Less than 15 years after a terrible ethnic war that devastated \nCroatia, the nation is making enormous progress. It is rapidly making a \ntransition to a market-based economy and its government leaders are \ncommitted to a strong and lasting partnership with the United States.\n  They are a great partner of ours in Afghanistan and in other trouble \nspots across the globe.\n  That is personally important to me because 100 years ago this year, \nmy grandfather emigrated from Croatia to this country. John Begic--then \nit was spelled B-E-G-I-C--then 17 years old, left his farm and \neventually settled in northern Minnesota's Iron Range.\n  John Begic and his young bride, Anna Martinich had four children. \nTheir youngest, Nicholas, made his way to America's new frontier of \nAlaska even before we were a state. He was my father.\n  Nick Begich was an educator and eventually was elected Alaska's lone \nMember of the U.S. House of Representatives in 1970. I am honored to \nfollow in his footsteps as a Member of the Senate, where I am the only \nMember of Croatian decent.\n  My recent visit to Dubrovnik was my first to Croatia. I was honored \nto represent this body at the summit, along with officials from the \nState Department and U.S. Embassy.\n  I was impressed with the great progress underway there, as well as \nthe excellent job being performed by our embassy personnel. There are \nenormous opportunities for partnership between the United States and \nCroatia, and I am anxious to pursue those.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my remarks at the Croatia Summit be \nprinted in the Record to document my participation in the summit and \nthe strong partnership between our nations.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Croatia Summit Panel: Security Challenges in the Altered Mediterranean\n\n       Thank you, Defense Minister Bozinovic, for that kind \n     introduction.\n       Thanks to all the government leaders of Croatia and to the \n     people of Croatia for the warm hospitality you have extended \n     to me in the short time I've been here. It's also an honor to \n     meet with many of the other leaders of the region at this \n     Summit.\n       Visiting Croatia has been a life-long dream of mine, never \n     realized until yesterday. It was exactly 100 years ago that a \n     17-year-old farmer by the name of John Begic left the family \n     farm in the small village of Podlapaca, over the mountains \n     from the Adriatic not far from Zagreb.\n       Upon landing at Ellis Island, they gave him a new name--\n     Begich--with an H. And permission to establish himself in \n     America. John Begic was my grandfather. He eventually settled \n     in Minnesota's Iron Range.\n       John Begic and his young bride, Anna Martinich, had four \n     children. Their youngest--Nicholas--made his way to America's \n     new frontier of Alaska even before we were a state. He was my \n     father.\n       Nick Begich was an educator and eventually was elected \n     Alaska's lone member of the United States House of \n     Representatives in 1970. I'm honored to follow in his \n     footsteps as a member of the United States Senate, where I am \n     the only member of Croatian decent.\n       From the moment of my election nearly three years ago, the \n     people of Croatia have treated me as a long-lost son. In \n     fact, I've had better coverage in the Croatian press than my \n     hometown newspapers back in Alaska!\n       When I was invited to participate in this Croatian Summit, \n     I jumped at the opportunity. Not because I'm an expert in the \n     issues of this region, but more to commend the people of \n     Croatia for your enormous progress and your great partnership \n     with my country.\n       Croatia has made remarkable political progress since the \n     end of the war more than 15 years ago. You are a welcome \n     member of NATO and will soon become the 28th member of the \n     European Union. Both of these landmarks came with enormous \n     challenge, and I salute your achievement. There will be bumps \n     in the road to this new future.\n       And there is no doubt that Croatia has earned membership in \n     both. As a NATO member, Croatia has stepped up to the \n     responsibility of providing security in both the region and \n     internationally.\n       As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I am \n     closely tuned to military engagements across the globe. By \n     the end of this year, nearly 10,000 soldiers from my own \n     state of Alaska will be serving in harm's way in Afghanistan. \n     This is one of the highest percentages of any state. Their \n     service on the front lines is not without controversy back \n     home, and I know you face the same questions here. So I thank \n     you for your partnership.\n       Croatia's troop commitment in Afghanistan--330, soon to be \n     350--is one of the highest per-capita contributions in the \n     International Security and Assistance Force there. And \n     Croatia has taken the lead in establishing a military police \n     training center in Afghanistan, to which other members in the \n     region will also contribute trainers.\n       This cooperation alone, in faraway Afghanistan, involving \n     countries that not long ago were embroiled in a vicious war, \n     brings a certain stability to the region of the former \n     Yugoslavia and creates a unique opportunity.\n       Fifteen years ago Croatia was a security consumer, with UN \n     Peacekeeping troops deployed throughout the country. It is \n     now a security provider, with 472 troops deployed across the \n     globe, including in Kosovo, the Golan Heights, Afghanistan, \n     Western Sahara, India-Pakistan, and in counter-piracy \n     operations in the Gulf of Aden. They even have staff officers \n     assigned to NATO operations in Libya.\n       One impressive observation: Croatia recently hosted the \n     U.S.-led ``Immediate Response'' military exercise involving \n     troops from countries throughout the region. Most \n     importantly, Serbian troops participated.\n       Imagine, just more than 15 years since Serb and Croat \n     troops fought it out throughout this country, Serbian and \n     Croatian troops cooperated side by side in an exercise to \n     ensure security in the region. This is a testament to the \n     determination of the governments of Serbia and Croatia to put \n     the past behind them. This type of cooperation ensures that \n     this region will have a secure and prosperous future.\n       Croatia has also demonstrated a desire to play a \n     constructive role in assisting neighboring Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina. Bosnia's stability and prosperity are absolutely \n     key to security in the region.\n       Croatia is in a position to play a positive and leading \n     role in assisting countries in the region in their efforts at \n     Euro-Atlantic integration. Joining the EU and NATO, with \n     their shared values of democracy, human rights and rule of \n     law, is perhaps the best way to ensure security and \n     prosperity in the region.\n       In early May, I was honored to welcome to my office \n     Croatian President Josipovic. I congratulated him then on the \n     enormous progress Croatia has achieved in a little more than \n     a decade after a devastating war.\n       I understand that per capita income is the second highest \n     in the former Yugoslav states. Health, education and other \n     quality of life factors are on par with many European \n     countries. Despite these signs of progress, the president \n     reminded me that Croatia's economy remains troubled, with \n     high unemployment and outdated industries. That's a situation \n     we can certainly sympathize with in my country.\n       One note of caution: Croatia still has a long way to go to \n     reform its overly bureaucratized economy in a way that will \n     ensure prosperity ensures stability and encourages \n     investment.\n       Croatia, like many of its European neighbors, is in a \n     position to play a positive role in providing security in a \n     Mediterranean that is in transition. I noted earlier that \n     Croatia has provided staff officers as members of the NATO \n     team conducting operations in Libya. Croatia has also stated \n     publically that it is working with the anti-Ghadafi \n     Transitional National Council, and has recognized it as the \n     legitimate voice of the Libyan people.\n       Just as the countries of East and Central Europe had their \n     own European Spring in 1989 and after, North Africa and the \n     Middle East is groping toward a kind of democracy and social \n     justice that for the most part had eluded them. The nations \n     of Europe, especially those like Croatia who made the \n     transition from dictatorship to democracy, can and are \n     playing a special role to help all the people of the \n     Mediterranean achieve democracy, rule of law and prosperity. \n     Euro-Atlantic engagement with the pro-Democracy movements in \n     North Africa and the Middle East is the best way to ensure \n     their revolutions do not take a turn down the wrong path.\n       The U.S. is anxious to assist with economic partnerships \n     with this region. One specific area is with increased \n     tourism.\n       From what little I've been able to see of Dubrovnik, you \n     have an enormously attractive city which many Americans would \n     love to visit. And we'd certainly welcome Croatian visitors \n     to our states, including Alaska. I am working with Senator \n     Mikulski of Maryland on her visa waiver bill to ease the \n     ability of Croatians to get visas to visit the United States.\n       Let me conclude by restating how excited I am to be here in \n     Croatia and to commend you for a productive and lasting \n     partnership with the United States. I hope this conference \n     creates many more opportunities for cooperation within this \n     region.\n\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I wish to say thank you for the \nopportunity to\n\n[[Page S4547]]\n\nput on the Record my experiences in Croatia this last weekend and, \nagain, seeing the country after 15 years ago going through incredible \ndevastation to where they are today.\n  I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Budget Listening Tour\n\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to report to the Senate on \nthe completion of my North Carolina Budget Listening Tour. While people \nin this town were mired in political gamesmanship that seems to be \npushing parties further apart, I wanted to hear directly from community \nleaders and business leaders in North Carolina about how they think we \nshould be approaching the responsibility we have to reduce our deficit \nand our debt. I held listening sessions all over the State--from \nRaleigh to Greensboro and Charlotte to Wilmington--and I heard from \nNorth Carolinians of every kind: small business owners, health care \nworkers, veterans, entrepreneurs, and more.\n  The message I heard could not have been more different from the \npartisan bickering in Washington that is dominating the airwaves. In \nWashington, we see negotiators walking away from the table, refusing \nany and all compromise, putting politics ahead of what is best for the \nAmerican people. In North Carolina, people were coming to the table and \nputting party aside for commonsense solutions to meet our shared budget \nobligations. To me, the message was crystal clear: Washington needs to \ntake a lesson from North Carolina. It is far past time to put \npartisanship aside and do what is right for the American people.\n  At the Charlotte listening session, I heard from the executive \ndirector of a health care nonprofit responsible for caring for the \nelderly. She told me about important ways we can reduce health care \ncosts and save lives, such as expanding access to preventive care for \nseniors to reduce the onset of expensive chronic diseases. Gayla Woody, \nthe director of aging at the Centralina Council of Governments, told me \nthe story of how one of her clients--a man caring for his wife with \nAlzheimer's--was able to continue to care for her at their home thanks \nto the comparatively small investments made in the Family Caregiver \nProgram rather than a more expensive nursing home. They both also told \nme we cannot afford an extreme plan to turn Medicare into a voucher \nprogram for vulnerable seniors. Balancing the budget on their backs is \nnot a solution I can support.\n  I also heard from small business owners, economic development \ncoordinators, and community bankers at our Wilmington and Raleigh tour \nstops. They told me about how Washington's partisan paralysis is \npreventing them from having the sort of certainty they need to be able \nto make the hard decisions to invest in their businesses and to grow \njobs in this economy for their companies. If these businesses don't \nknow whether they ought to be investing in new equipment or new \nemployees, then we are not going to be able to sustain the economic \ngrowth that is a necessary component to reducing our deficit and our \ndebt.\n  I also heard from a veteran of the U.S. Marines Corps and current \nchaplain for the Onslow County Special Incident Response Team. This \ndedicated public servant talked about the importance of protecting \nservices for our veterans. And I will fight for them just as hard as \nthey fought for us. He also talked to me about the importance of \npriorities. He said we ought to keep our promises to those who \nsacrificed for us--our seniors and our veterans--but we also need to \ninvest in our children and their education. It was important for the \nfuture, he believed, and I agree he was right.\n  While the challenge of reducing our deficit may appear daunting, I \ndon't believe meeting it is impossible if Washington takes to heart the \nmessage I heard all over North Carolina last month. Both sides--\nDemocrats and Republicans--need to put aside partisanship and come to \nan agreement that is bipartisan and balanced, one that includes a \nshared sacrifice but also fulfills the sacred promises made to our \nseniors and our veterans and makes the critical investments necessary \nfor a prosperous American future. Above all else, they do not want us \nto kick the can down the road one more time. They sent us here to make \nhard decisions. Putting them off to resolve during some future crisis \nis simply not an option.\n  These broad goals and values are widely shared across party lines. I \nrecognize turning them into a bipartisan, balanced solution to our \nfiscal challenges will not be easy, but the consequences of failing to \ndo so are simply too great to ignore.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor and note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                The Debt\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor today as a Member of \nthe Senate--specifically, though, as a Senator from Wyoming because in \nWyoming our families know they have to live within their means. Wyoming \nis a State that lives within its means. In Wyoming, our very \nconstitution requires that our State live within its means.\n  Washington has a total debt now that is over $14 trillion and \ncontinues to climb every day. Wyoming's total debt is zero. How did \nWashington fail where Wyoming succeeded? Well, in Washington, this city \noverspends in Washington there is nothing really to stop it. In \nWyoming, we live within our means because our constitution demands that \nwe balance our budget every year. It is time for Washington to take a \nlesson from Wyoming and the other States that balance their budgets \nevery year.\n  The President says, ``All of us agree that we should use this \nopportunity to do something meaningful on debt and deficits.'' Well, \npassing a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution is possibly the \nmost meaningful thing we could do.\n  This city's finances are in disarray. Our Nation's finances are in \ndisarray. It has been over 800 days since this body has passed a budget \nresolution. Since the last time a full budget was passed, our country \nhas spent over $7 trillion, and $3.2 trillion of that was money we did \nnot have.\n  Our total debt now is over $14 trillion. People say: How much money \nis that? The number is astonishingly large. Let's try to put it a \nlittle bit into perspective. Every day, Washington borrows over $4 \nbillion. We borrowed over $4 billion yesterday, $4 billion today, and \nif someone will lend us the money, we will borrow over $4 billion \ntomorrow. That is over $2 million a minute, every minute. Every single \nday, Washington borrows enough money to buy tens of thousands of new \nhomes. Every single hour, Washington borrows enough to buy nearly 2 \nmillion barrels of oil. Every single minute, Washington borrows enough \nto send 53 students to private college for a full year. Every single \nsecond, Washington borrows enough to buy two new automobiles. We paid \nover $200 billion last year in interest on the debt alone. The \nPresident talks about a tax on private jets. That is enough money--the \ninterest alone--to buy over 200 private jets every day.\n  It is not enough to think about this in the large terms; you have to \ntry to put it in terms that people understand. Because we are spending \nand borrowing so much money, it is difficult to put it into terms that \npeople grasp and that they see. It is good to hear the President \nacknowledge that we have to stop making more than the minimum payments \nin order to pay off and deal with this incredible debt.\n  The President has also announced his willingness to make a deal that \nhe says involves meaningful changes to Medicare, to Social Security, \nand to Medicaid. To his credit, the President has accepted that much of \nthe problem with saving these programs springs from his own side of the \naisle. He says, and I agree, that now is the time to do it.\n\n[[Page S4548]]\n\n  The Associated Press quoted the President asking the most important \nquestion of all: ``If not now, when?'' Well, the clock is ticking. In \njust 13 years, Medicare will be bankrupt. We have to strengthen \nMedicare. In 25 years, the same will be true of Social Security. Unlike \nour debt limit, this is not a limit Congress can simply legislate away. \nWe have to act now to prevent these programs from failing not just \ntoday's generation but future generations.\n  The Senate minority leader said: I commend the President for putting \nSocial Security and Medicare on the table.\n  He is correct in doing that. So with the President seeing the light \non so many issues, why are we still talking about finding a solution \ninstead of actually getting one passed here in the Congress? Because, \nfor all that he claims to understand, the President has still fallen \nback on the same tax-and-spend policies that made this economic \nsituation worse. It is clear that the policies of this administration \nhave taken a tough problem and may have made it worse. On the \nPresident's inauguration day, the unemployment rate in this country was \njust under 8 percent. Today, it is 9.2 percent. Every American child \nwho is born today will owe roughly $45,000. Let's compare that to the \nday President Obama was inaugurated. Every child then owed roughly \n$35,000. So in just those short years, the debt on a child born in \nAmerica, the debt they are born with has gone up from $35,000 to \n$45,000. These disturbing economic results are the direct result of the \npast 2 years of policies.\n  Liberals want to hold the U.S. credit rating hostage for more tax \nhikes, and the President is leading the charge. He is trying to push \nmore tax hikes despite the very fact that even he has now said it is \nthe worst time to raise taxes. Back in 2009, President Obama said: The \nlast thing you want to do is raise taxes during a recession. So why, \nthen, is he calling for $400 billion in tax increases today? And why is \nthe Senate Budget Committee chairman trying to one-up the President by \ncalling for $2 trillion? Well, of course, the President will not admit \nhe wants to raise taxes. He likes to use wiggle words. He uses words \nsuch as ``revenue'' or the ``spending in the Tax Code'' instead. But \nwhen you translate this Washington doublespeak, it comes out ``higher \ntaxes.''\n  With the spin exposed, liberals are trying another tack: They are \ntrying to claim they will delay the tax increases until the economy \nrecovers. They are not saying they are not going to raise taxes; they \nsay: Let's put it off for a while. This week, the President showed what \nthis really means. He said, ``Nobody is going to raise taxes right \nnow.'' He said, ``We are talking about potentially 2013 and the \noutyears.'' So, in other words, this is not really about waiting until \nthe economic recovery comes; it is about waiting until 2013, until \nafter the President's reelection campaign.\n  More troubling still, the President has already signaled that he \nwants to spend more in the future. Our problem is not that we are taxed \ntoo little, it is that we spend too much. Yet the President wants to \nspend even more. At his press conference, he said he is only tackling \nour debt so we can be ``in a position to make the kind of investments I \nthink are going to be necessary to win the future.'' When the President \ntalks about investment, it is common knowledge that what he is talking \nabout is spending.\n  Finally, for all his posturing about getting this done, now it is \nreally the President who seems to want to kick the can down the road. \nHis plan may cut trillions, but Washington would be able to take as \nlong as 10 years to do it.\n  Minority Leader McConnell has already blown the liberal cover on \nthese very cynical political bluffs. He said, ``The President has \npresented us with three choices: smoke and mirrors, tax hikes, or \ndefault.'' Well, Republicans choose none of the above.\n  As a doctor, I have taken the Hippocratic Oath. The oath says: Do no \nharm.\n  Raising taxes will harm our economy. Cutting spending at a snail's \npace will do very little to help. We have to tackle our fiscal problems \ntoday. The first step toward solving these problems should be to pass \nan amendment to our Constitution requiring Washington to balance its \nbudget.\n  A balanced budget amendment would require Washington to spend no more \nmoney than it takes in every year. Such an amendment would force \nWashington to live within its means as many States do and as families \nacross the country do.\n  I come to the floor as cosponsor of the balanced budget amendment. As \na matter of fact, every Republican in the Senate is a cosponsor of the \nbalanced budget amendment, 47 Republican Senators. Every one is a \ncosponsor of the balanced budget amendment. We are united and will \nremain united. This is a commonsense approach, and it will show the \nAmerican people that they can trust their government with their money \nonce again because right now the American people have little confidence \nthey are getting value for the money they send to Washington.\n  I believe we need to lead today, not defer leadership until tomorrow. \nAmericans are courageous; they deserve a courageous government. That is \nwhy I know the American people overwhelmingly support a balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution.\n  The President said the other day that it is time to ``eat our peas.'' \nWe all saw him on television saying it is time to ``eat our peas.'' I \nagree with another President, Ronald Reagan, who said it is time to \n``starve the beast.'' The beast is Washington and the Washington \nwasteful spending that the American people are seeing every day.\n  Mr. President, Americans pay their debts. They want their country to \ndo so too. It is time for Washington to listen. It is time for a \nbalanced budget constitutional amendment, and then it is time to start \npaying off this massive debt.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNET. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BENNET. Madam President, like you, I have heard a lot of loose \ntalk over the past months invoking the Founding Fathers--loose talk to \nunderscore an expedient argument about what they would be doing if they \nwere legislating today. But the way our Founders are often used is as a \ncaricature to distort history for the benefit of partisan and narrow \ninterests.\n  To hear some people talk about it, you would think the Founders were \nengaged in a process of dismantling a country rather than building one. \nThat version of events is not only wrong but it also thoroughly \ndiminishes the founding generation's extraordinary accomplishments and \nthe lessons we should draw from them.\n  Our Founders met enormous challenges with great courage and sacrifice \nto start a country around an ideal. In the same vein, our modern \nhistory has been characterized by meeting great challenges with \ndistinct qualities. We are hard working. We meet our challenges by \nrefusing to allow their complexities or attendant political difficulty \nto lead us toward accepting failure as an option. We are inclusive. We \nmeet our great challenges by meeting them as one, by crafting solutions \nthat involve buy-in, participation, and sacrifice from all parts of the \npolitical landscape, and the American people.\n  We act with courage. We meet our great challenges when, and only \nwhen, the leaders of the day have the courage to decide they will be \nthe ones who meet those challenges, that they will transcend the short-\nterm incentives and political imperatives of their time to do something \nof greater importance.\n  These traits have enabled us to end a Civil War, overcome the Great \nDepression, and march toward civil rights. But they have also allowed \nus to do smaller and still very important things such as work together \nin the 1980s to protect and preserve Social Security.\n  Today, that honorable past and the sacrifice it entailed has been \nhijacked to protect and defend narrow interest group politics and tax \nloopholes.\n  Our tax and regulatory codes are backward, facing in a way that is \nstraining our recession-battered middle class and failing to drive \ninnovation in our economy. As a result, middle-class\n\n[[Page S4549]]\n\nincome continues to fall, the gap between rich and poor grows wider, \nand all of us wait for a 20th-century economy to produce 21st-century \njobs. That wait will be in vain.\n  It will particularly be in vain for those of our citizens unlucky \nenough to be born poor and who therefore stand a 9 in 100 chance of \never graduating from college in the United States of America in the \nyear 2011. That is because year after year we have torn each other up \nso much on issue after issue, because of the smallness we have \nexhibited in the face of what our big challenges are, and now we find \nourselves at a crisis point without a politics capable of even \naddressing the kinds of challenges we face each year, let alone a \ngenerational crisis like our deficit and debt.\n  I have come to the floor for months arguing for the need for a \ncomprehensive approach to addressing our deficits and debt. What \nColorado wants is nothing more than what this country has seen from \npast generations of leaders in past times of crisis. As I have said \nover and over, what people in red parts of the State and what people in \nblue parts of the State want is a solution that materially addresses \nthe problem. They know we are not going to fix it overnight, but they \nwant it materially addressed. They want a demonstration that we are all \nin it together, that everybody has something to contribute to solving \nthe problem. They emphatically want it to be bipartisan because they \ndon't believe in an either-party-going-it-alone approach when it comes \nto our debt and our deficit.\n  I add a corollary to that, which is that we need to assure our \ncapital markets that the paper they bought is actually worth what they \npaid for it.\n  It was in the spirit of getting together on a solution like that my \ncolleague, Senator Mike Johanns, and I wrote a letter to the President. \nSixty-four Members of the Senate--evenly divided between both parties--\nsigned onto an approach that called for entitlement reform, tax reform, \nand discretionary spending cuts. The math compels this answer. The \neconomy needs this certainty. Colorado and the country want this \nresult. It should achieve the $4.5 trillion in deficit reduction over \n10 years and should have a 3-to-1 ratio of spending cuts to revenue \nincreases. That is what the Bowles-Simpson Commission recommended.\n  Our political system seems intent on thwarting an approach supported \nby Senators in both parties. Both parties seem willing to submit to \nthat flawed system's perverse incentives.\n  While I am convinced that many in this body and the House would \nactually like to make this deal, these interests distort the \nconversation into a partisan war and rip it apart from the inside.\n  On one side, some advocate for no changes to the Medicare Program; on \nthe other, for no changes to revenue. Yet these are among the two \nbiggest drivers of our long-term debt--and everybody knows it.\n  Only in Washington could people pretend that significant deficit \nreduction could be accomplished while ignoring the two biggest fiscal \nchallenges we face. I am a former school superintendent, and what that \ntells me is that Washington has a severe math problem. We are in need \nof remediation.\n  When it comes to a solution on the debt, the contrast between \nWashington's dysfunction and Colorado's common sense could not be \nclearer. Yesterday, I had a call with Colorado business leaders who \nspanned the ideological spectrum--both Democrats and Republicans--to \ntalk about our deficit and debt. Despite their differing party \naffiliations, there was clearly a consensus that everything needed to \nbe on the table when it comes to the debt--including both tax revenue \nand entitlement changes. But somehow this common sense gets lost in the \ncurrent debate.\n  If changes to entitlements are off the table, we as leaders will \nfail. If changes in revenue are off the table, we as leaders will fail.\n  I turn to the American people watching this debate with worry or \ndisgust and say: If challenges to our ideological beliefs or to the \npolitics that historically define our debate are off the table, then as \na generation we cannot meet the challenges we face, and we are not \ngoing to be able to support the aspirations we have for our kids and \nour grandkids.\n  This is about courage: courage on the part of Democrats who know \nrefusing to touch Medicare is an argument we could win, but the price \nof winning that argument may be losing America's ability to pay its \nbills; courage on the part of Republicans who know revenues are \nunpopular but who secretly understand that we can't simply cut our way \nout of this budget hole. And in a moment of such crisis, this should be \nthe least Americans can expect of us.\n\n  During the worst recession since the Great Depression, Madam \nPresident, it was my privilege to spend the last 2\\1/2\\ years traveling \nmy State while we were going through this horrible economic turmoil. \nAmericans and Coloradans have made gut-wrenching decisions in their \npersonal lives--about where to send their children to school, how and \nwhere to live, what medicines they can afford, and what medicines they \nmight hope to live without. Local officials have been held accountable \nto citizens for the decisions they have had to make. Yet Congress has \nstruggled to reflect the ideals and aspirations of the people we \nrepresent.\n  This DC political culture serves special interests but it doesn't \neven register the needs of Coloradans. No business would sacrifice the \neconomic interests of its shareholders, because the ones that do are \ngone. No mayors in Colorado would threaten their bond rating for \npolitical ideology--not one. It wouldn't occur to one of them to \nthreaten their credit rating, because mothers, fathers, taxpayers, and \neveryday citizens would have their heads, and rightfully so. I think \nthe difference is that no special interest stands between a Colorado \nlocal government official and the people he or she represents.\n  Having served in local government, I have to say what often seems to \nbe an unattainable standard for a high officeholder is simply life in \nthe real world for the rest of us. Last week, we came to Washington to \ncast a series of inconsequential votes. But by the end of the week, \nsome of us were encouraged by the talk coming from the President and \nthe Speaker.\n  My friend John McCain came to the floor pushing the need for a \nbreakout strategy, referenced a Wall Street Journal editorial that \ncalled for a far more comprehensive and far-reaching plan. But now we \nlearn a comprehensive deal feels once again out of reach. We are told \nwe will have to settle for something small that one more time kicks the \ncan down the road; that taxes and entitlements are just too hard for \nWashington politics.\n  I may not have spent enough time here to see through these political \ngames. This may all be part of an elaborate strategy to get to yes. But \nI shudder--I shudder--when I wonder what investors, our creditors, and \nthe American people think of this political game of chicken. Unlike \nCongress, they do not conduct their business with winks and nods, and \nthey solve their problems before they become insurmountable.\n  All of which brings me back to our Founders and the political \nleadership of other generations past that made these enormous and \ndifficult decisions. As for us, we have chosen to put them off time \nafter time, and now we are at an inflection point where we need to get \nthis done. We have a $1.5 trillion deficit and almost $15 trillion in \ndebt. Revenue is at a 60-year low and spending is at over a 60-year \nhigh. And we have the path to begin to bridge this. The Simpson-Bowles \ncommission has given us that path forward.\n  I am the first to say--and I should say--this debt is something we \nall own. I voted for things that contributed to it, as have all of my \ncolleagues, and of all the things that comprise the debt, there is \nsomething each member of our great Nation wants or needs. We all share \nin the responsibility for how we arrived at this point.\n  So to be clear, if anybody thinks this is merely an attack on the \ninstitution, we need to understand this massive debt is something for \nwhich we are all responsible. Those who voted to fight the wars and to \npass the tax cuts did so as a reflection of what they believed was a \nmoment of truth. These decisions were not made in a vacuum. We got here \nbecause we aspire to be a society that is better than our competitors. \nWe are all responsible. We are all responsible for the crisis that \nlooms. But the inflection point we have reached has\n\n[[Page S4550]]\n\nled to a different mandate, a different moment of truth. The American \npeople are asking us to lead.\n  This is a country of patriots, of incredibly courageous people who \ntake on challenges little and big every day. I have tremendous respect \nfor my colleagues and for this institution, and I am well aware that \nuntil about 6 months ago I had never even been elected dogcatcher. So I \nrecognize how much I have to learn. But clearly--clearly--we are not \nliving up to the standard of courage that past generations of leaders \nand every generation of ordinary Americans have set for us. Congress is \ncertainly not living up to the standard the people of Colorado and of \nthis country expect from us.\n  I wonder if maybe we have looked at this the wrong way. The President \nhas put entitlement cuts on the table, and that is the right thing to \ndo. I encourage him to do more.\n  As for the question of revenue, I will tell any politician that this \nis not the time to be wedded to the status quo. There is nothing \nmagical about current revenue levels, about our Tax Code, or about all \nthe loopholes and special interest perks that we account for only by \nborrowing more and more money.\n  But there is something else important to mention, which is also lost \nin the debate. We have waged two long and costly wars. I don't want to \nre-litigate today the wisdom of going to war. My colleagues in the \nSenate and House--many of whom are still here in the Congress--had to \ncast difficult votes to send our young men and women into harm's way. \nBut regardless of your position for or against, Congress ultimately \nmade a decision to layer those costs on top of our current budget. We \ndid this instead of accounting for them as part of our annual expenses. \nThat was the decision that Congress made, and it began our slide from \nsurplus to deficit.\n  So for a moment let us separate the costs of these wars from the \nimportant and robust debate we are having about entitlement spending--\nMedicare, Social Security, and our discretionary programs--and resolve \na threshold question, or maybe two: Are we, as a generation, going to \npay for these wars or are we going to continue to borrow from foreign \ngovernments and stick our kids with the bill? Are we even willing to \nmake just a down payment on their incremental costs? Because that is \nwhat we are talking about.\n  The amount outlined by the Debt and Deficit Commission--$785 billion \nin tax reform--which, by the way, would lead to lower rates, doesn't \neven cover the incremental expense of the war commitments we have made. \nBut it would be a good start. Are we willing to walk away from this \nmoment and say we put the burden of fighting and dying in these wars on \nour sons and daughters, and at the same time leave the burden of paying \nit to our grandchildren?\n  And, after all, are we really willing to threaten the full faith and \ncredit of the United States by failing to raise the debt ceiling for \ndebts we already owe? This is not like cutting up your credit card. \nThis is like getting your mortgage this month and saying, I'm not going \nto pay it because I spent my money somewhere else. Are we really \nwilling to do that by failing to act comprehensively against our debt \nat a moment of global fragility in the capital markets? Would we risk \nall of this just for politics?\n  Interestingly enough, in their wisdom, the Founders understood and \nanticipated this very problem. They had a spirited debate about whether \nthe Federal Government should have what they called ``a general power \nof taxation'' or whether we should have a system of ``internal and \nexternal taxation''--a system where the States could impose taxes but \nthe Federal Government would be limited to collecting its revenue \nthrough duties on imports.\n  Ultimately, the Founders resolved the question in favor of the \ngeneral power of taxation for the exact reasons that are staring us in \nthe face today. So rather than talk about the Founders, I actually want \nto read what they said on this subject, in the hopes it will give us \nsome guidance. Let me quote from Federalist No. 30. I apologize for the \nlength, Madam President, but, as always, their words impoverish our \nown.\n\n       If the opinions of those who contend for the distinction \n     [between internal and external taxation] were to be received \n     as evidence of truth, one would be led to conclude that there \n     was some known point in the economy of national affairs at \n     which it would be safe to stop and say: Thus far the ends of \n     public happiness will be promoted by supplying the wants of \n     government, and all beyond this is unworthy of our care or \n     anxiety.\n\n  They went on to say:\n\n       Let us attend to what would be the effects of this \n     situation in the very first war in which we should happen to \n     be engaged. We will presume, for argument's sake, that the \n     revenue arising from the impost duties answers the purposes \n     of a provision for the public debt and of a peace \n     establishment for the Union. Thus circumstanced, a war breaks \n     out. What would be the probable conduct of the government in \n     such an emergency? Taught by experience that proper \n     dependence could not be placed on the success of \n     requisitions, unable by its own authority to lay hold of \n     fresh resources, and urged by considerations of national \n     danger, would it not be driven to the expedient of diverting \n     the funds already appropriated from their proper objects to \n     the defense of the state? It is not easy to see how a step of \n     this kind could be avoided; and if it should be taken, it is \n     evident that it would prove the destruction of public credit \n     at the very moment it was becoming essential to the public \n     safety. To imagine that such a credit crisis might be \n     dispensed with, would be the extreme of infatuation. In the \n     modern system of war, nations the most wealthy are obliged to \n     have recourse to large loans. A country so little opulent as \n     ours must feel this necessity in a much stronger degree. But \n     who would lend to a government that prefaced its overtures \n     for borrowing by an act which demonstrated that no reliance \n     could be placed on the steadiness of its measures for paying? \n     The loans it might be able to procure would be as limited in \n     their extent as burdensome in their conditions. They would be \n     made upon the same principles that usurers commonly lend to \n     bankrupt and fraudulent debtors, with a sparing hand and \n     enormous premiums.\n\n  I am going to paraphrase that in a minute. But it is almost as though \nAlexander Hamilton, who wrote these words in 1787, were sitting here \ntoday. And from the bottom of my heart, I wish he were. He closed the \nFederalist Paper No. 30 with an admonition to ideologues, writing that:\n\n       . . . [s]uch men must behold the actual situation of their \n     country with painful solicitude, and deprecate the evils \n     which ambition or revenge might, with too much facility, \n     inflict upon it.\n\n  As we have at other times in our history, we experienced the kind of \nevils that Hamilton anticipated on 9/11. We responded. And now, at this \nextraordinary time, it is left for us to get our house in order.\n  In truth, these are small decisions, when we consider them in the \ncontext of what our Founders faced. Their greatness is measured by the \nlarge task they took on and conquered. Ours is merely a junction \nbetween our own institutional impulse toward fecklessness and our \nindividual love for our country and for our kids. When faced with \nsimilar decisions, families cut back; they sacrifice. And now we must \ndo the same. Now, to paraphrase Hamilton, the last thing we need to do \nnow is act in a way that jacks up our interest rates.\n  The 100 of us who are here in the Senate didn't create the system in \nwhich we operate. None of us decided it would be fun to have special \ninterest groups scoring our every move or lobbyists hounding us about \nthis or that tiny little provision or television channels reducing \neverything we do and say to a story line of endless minute conflict. \nAnd look, I understand what the incentives are here. It is possible we \ncould fail and get away with blaming somebody else. It is possible \ncutting off our nose to spite our face could be a smart political move \nin this insane system. But there is a reason we venerate the Founders \nand Lincoln and the great legislative and executive figures of the last \ncentury. They were great not only because of what history threw at \nthem, but because of the way they threw themselves at history.\n  They raised their hands. They showed real courage not only when they \nhad to but when they didn't. They made themselves of use.\n  The Founders were practical people--dare I say it, Madam President, \npractical politicians searching for an ideal that became the United \nStates of America, and they created in their practicality what Lincoln \ncalled the last, best hope of Earth. Think of that. Think of our actual \nhistory, not a cartoon, and imagine that we stumble, not because the \nFounders in their time failed to form a union but because in our time \nwe failed to act as one.\n\n[[Page S4551]]\n\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I think it is fair to say we have two \nreally major problems we are grappling with here in this Congress. More \nimportantly, the people all across our country are grappling with them.\n  First, there is an economy that is far too weak. It is growing far \ntoo slowly, if at all, and it is certainly producing far too few jobs. \nThe latest data is particularly discouraging on the job-creation front. \nUntil we turn this around and get strong growth, we are not going to \nproduce nearly the number of jobs we need.\n  The second big problem that strikes me as very disturbing is the \nunsustainable level of Federal spending and corresponding deficits and \ndebt that have mounted as a result of all that spending. Federal \nspending since the year 2000, from 2000 to 2010, has doubled from just \na couple of years ago when spending was less than 20 percent of our \ntotal economic output. Today, it is nearly 25 percent of our total \neconomy, and that is way too large and unsustainable.\n  All this spending has predictably led to huge deficits. We have been \nrunning annual deficits these last couple of years of nearly 10 percent \nof our entire economy--really staggering in size, $1.5 trillion for the \nlast couple of years running. The deficits are covered by issuing debt, \nso we have been accumulating debt at this really breakneck pace.\n  Of course, all of this debt has caused us to crash into our debt \nlimit, and we are now mired in this debate, in this discussion, in \nthese ongoing, very difficult negotiations over what to do because we \nhave reached the statutory ceiling of the amount of money the Federal \nGovernment is permitted by law to borrow--$14.3 trillion. That is a \nnumber which is very difficult to grasp because of its sheer enormity, \nbut there we are. We are at the limit, and we have to decide what we \nare going to do about it.\n  I am not impressed with where the current negotiations seem to be and \nwhere they have been. I think we have yet to see a plan from the \nPresident that lays out exactly what he is willing to cut in spending \nto put us on a sustainable path.\n  The President proposed a budget. I sit on the Budget Committee. We \nlooked at that budget, we had testimony about that budget, and what we \nlearned was it is not a serious budget. It would continue with huge \ndeficits and mounting debt. It did not address any of the fundamental \nproblems. When that budget was on the Senate floor for a vote, the \nPresident's budget got zero votes. The President subsequently backed \naway from his own budget but has not proposed an alternative. \nUnfortunately, my colleagues in this Chamber on the other side have \nproposed no budget whatsoever.\n  So here we are, the world's largest enterprise, the U.S. Government, \npreparing to spend this year--as we did last year--something on the \norder of $3.7 trillion without so much as a blueprint for how we are \ngoing to spend that, rules that would govern how it gets allocated in \ndifferent categories, guidelines for where the revenue is going to come \nfrom, how big the deficit will be--none of that. We are simply \nproceeding along without a budget. I have to say I think that is \nshockingly irresponsible. Now we go into these discussions about the \ndebt limit. Frankly, it is not clear to me that we are any closer to a \nresolution today than we were several weeks ago.\n  Some of us have suggested a solution. We have suggested a way out of \nthis impasse that I would like to describe today. The solution we are \nproposing is that we go ahead and raise the debt limit by the amount \nthe President has asked. Many of us are not particularly enthusiastic \nabout that, but we acknowledge that failure to do so will at some point \nin, presumably, early August result in a considerable disruption and a \npartial government shutdown. It will not result in a default on our \ndebt, and there are many of our ongoing expenses we could continue to \ncover from ongoing tax revenue, but it would nevertheless be very \ndisruptive, and it is my hope that we never get there and instead find \na resolution.\n  The resolution some of us are proposing--specifically Senator Mike \nLee from Utah, whom I credit a great deal for his leadership--Senator \nLee and I have introduced a bill, together with a number of other \ncolleagues--I think we have over 25 cosponsors in the Senate--based on \nthe idea we call cut, cap, and balance. We would agree to raise the \ndebt limit by $2.4 trillion, as the President has requested, provided \nthat we get ourselves on a path to a balanced budget. By that, we see \nthree pieces: cuts in immediate spending; statutory caps in spending \nover the next few years; and a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution, which we acknowledge would take several years to achieve. \nBut the point is that the combined effect of these measures would \nclearly put us on a path to a balanced budget, end the practice of \nrunning deficits, and eventually end the need to raise debt limits \nbecause we would not be issuing new debt. We would, instead, as a \ngovernment be living within our means.\n  If you ask me, this is very reasonable, to suggest that the Federal \nGovernment ought to live within its means. It is reasonable for \nfamilies. Families do not have any choice; they live within their \nmeans. Businesses have to live within their means or they do not \nsurvive. And 49 of the 50 States have a requirement that they balance \ntheir budgets every year, and they find a way to do it.\n  This President would not be the first Democratic President to embrace \nthis if he were to embrace this idea. President Clinton, working with a \nRepublican-controlled Congress in the 1990s, first embraced the idea \nthat we ought to strive for a balanced budget, that it was a worthwhile \ngoal, that it was an achievable goal, and within a few years, in fact, \nthey achieved it, two different parties working together--not always \nenjoying each other's company as much as one might like, but the fact \nis they got it done. I think we ought to consider using that model \ntoday.\n  As recently as 2007, we were actually quite close to a balanced \nbudget. Our deficit was just over 1 percent of our total economy, as \nopposed to today, where it is nearly 10 percent of our total economy. I \nfully acknowledge that we cannot get there overnight, as much as many \nof us would like to. We have dug a deep hole. We are borrowing almost \n40 cents of every dollar we spend. It would be too sudden and Draconian \nto think we could balance the budget overnight. So we suggested a path \nthat might take 8 or 9 or 10 years to actually reach a balance, but it \nwould surely put us on a path that would get us there, and that would \nbe enormously constructive, not only in the sense that it would ensure \nthe long-term fiscal viability of our country, which is in and of \nitself an absolutely vital goal, but it would also create some \ncertainty in the market, reduce the risk of huge inflation and huge \ninterest rates and the other dangers that accompany the irresponsibly \nlarge deficits, and in the process help to encourage stronger economic \ngrowth and job creation.\n  I think we ought to be flexible in how we get there. We have proposed \none way. It is not the only way to do it, but it, importantly, is \npremised on this principle that we can reach a balance and we ought to \ndo that. It is absolutely critical that we demonstrate that we have the \npolitical will and the ability to tackle this, arguably the biggest \nchallenge we face.\n  We have seen what has been unfolding in Europe because they chose not \nto tackle these problems in recent years. I suggest we are not that far \nbehind some of the countries in Europe that are in the middle of truly \ndevastating sovereign debt crises. We are not quite there yet, but if \nwe do not change the path we are on, that is the direction we are \nheading.\n  Let me walk through the particular items in this approach we are \nadvocating in which we would cut, cap, and balance.\n  First is to cut spending. We are suggesting a cut from the 2011 \nlevels of $142 billion. That is actually less than\n\n[[Page S4552]]\n\n4 percent of the amount of money the government spent last year--we are \nstill in the current year, but the fiscal year of 2011. It would still \nspend more than we spent in 2010, so it is very hard to see how this \ncould fairly be described as any kind of Draconian cut. It is a very \nmodest cut in spending. By 2012, the levels will be almost $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion more than the levels of spending in 2008. But that is the \nfirst step, to cut spending in the immediate future, in this next \nfiscal year.\n  The second is to cap spending over the next several years. To do \nthis, we have established a set of caps, statutory limits on how much \nthe government can spend each year based on the level of spending in \nthe budget resolution I introduced on the Senate floor, which had \nalmost all the Republicans' support. I wish we had some Democratic \nsupport, and I still hope we will get some. But the important thing \nabout this budget resolution and these cap levels is they reach a \nbalance--not overnight; it takes 9 years. But by controlling spending \nand adopting progrowth policies that encourage an expanding economy, we \nwould, following these cap levels, be able to balance our budget. Then, \nfinally, we are advocating that as part of this package, as part of an \narrangement, we would agree to raise the debt ceiling. We would also \npass in both the House and Senate a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution and send it off to the States.\n\n  We would not suggest the increase in the debt limit be contingent \nupon State option, but I am confident the States would, in fact, pass a \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution if we in Congress would \nsend it to them. It would have three big features and, again, the \ndetails ought to be a subject of discussion. One that would not be open \nfor negotiation would be that the first outlays need to equal revenues. \nThat is obviously the fundamental definition of a balance. We don't run \ndeficits; we make sure we spend no more than we take in.\n  The second aspect some of us feel strongly about, and I am one of \nthem, is we ought to limit spending as a percentage of our economy so \nthe economy doesn't keep growing, which is what happens when the \ngovernment occupies too large a segment of our economy.\n  Finally, we have advocated that we not create a mechanism that simply \nguarantees big tax increases in order to balance the budget, and to do \nthat we would like--and we have included--a supermajority requirement \nto raise taxes so that a simple majority wouldn't be enough. It would \nrequire a supermajority which would only occur, presumably, in truly \nextraordinary circumstances.\n  I believe very strongly we can have strong economic growth and the \njob creation we need, but to get there we have to create an environment \nin Washington; we have to pass legislation and create an environment \nthat encourages risk taking, encourages business formation, encourages \nnew hiring, and we have not been doing such a good job. One of the ways \nto do that is to put us on a sustainable, viable fiscal path, and the \ncut, cap, and balance approach would do that.\n  We would raise the debt limit by the full amount that the President \nhas asked for provided he agree with us to put this country on a path \nto a balanced budget. I do not think that is asking too much. I think \nthat is a way to achieve long-term fiscal sustainability, and just as \nimportantly it is a way to create an environment for the strong \neconomic growth and job creation we need.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Kirton\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, it is with great sadness that I report the \npassing of a brave soldier, loving son, dedicated husband, and proud \nfather from Centennial, CO. CPL Brandon M. Kirton died on May 18, 2011, \nin Kandahar Province, Afghanistan, of injuries sustained when his \ndismounted patrol received small arms and mortar fire. This is one of \nthe most strategically important areas of Afghanistan. He was 25 years \nold.\n  Family and friends remember Corporal Kirton as a warm, lighthearted \nyoung man. Robert Kirton, his father, said that his son's cheerful \ndisposition at home provided a great contrast to the solemn commitment \nwith which he faced his duties as a soldier. This makes perfect sense, \nRobert said, because Corporal Kirton had dreamed of putting on an Army \nuniform from an early age.\n  Corporal Kirton attended Englewood High School in Englewood, CO, \nwhere he was a member of the baseball and soccer teams. He enlisted in \nthe Army shortly after his graduation in 2004, and he was assigned to C \nCompany, 2nd Battalion, 502nd Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne \nDivision, based at Fort Campbell, KY. Corporal Kirton served a tour of \nduty in Iraq and one in Afghanistan--both with distinction.\n  His record as a soldier demonstrates the Army's proudest traditions \nof valor, commitment to duty, and strength of character. Corporal \nKirton was carrying 70 pounds of gear when CPT Gary Flowers, his \ncommander, first met him in Afghanistan in 115-degree heat. Captain \nFlowers offered to shoulder a bag for him, an offer which Corporal \nKirton declined. He simply replied, ``Are you kidding me?''\n  Corporal Kirton's commanding officers immediately recognized his \nexceptional bravery and talent. He earned, among other decorations, the \nBronze Star Medal, the Purple Heart Medal, the Afghanistan Campaign \nMedal, the Iraq Campaign Medal, and the Global War on Terrorism Service \nMedal.\n  Mark Twain once said, ``The fear of death follows from the fear of \nlife. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time.'' Corporal \nKirton's service was in keeping with this sentiment by selflessly \nputting country first, he lived life to the fullest. He lived with a \nsense of the highest honorable purpose.\n  Mr. President, I stand with Colorado and people nationwide in \nprofound gratitude for Corporal Kirton's tremendous sacrifice. He \nfollowed through on his dream of becoming a soldier in the U.S. Army \nand served honorably in Iraq and Afghanistan when his country needed \nhim most. We are forever humbled by and indebted to the memory of his \ncourageous actions. I ask my colleagues to join in me extending our \ndeepest respects and condolences to Corporal Kirton's family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/13/senate-section/article/S4552-3", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4552-S4553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE GOLDEN EAGLE AWARD\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize two of Wyoming's \nbest ski areas--Grand Targhee and the Jackson Hole Mountain Resort--for \ntheir hard work and commitment to better management practices. Their \nrecords of improving efficiency, reducing energy use, promoting better \nenvironmental management, and focusing on sustainable operations have \nearned them the 2011 National Ski Areas Association Golden Eagle Award \nfor Overall Environmental Excellence. The Golden Eagle Award is \npresented to ski areas and resorts that have shown a true commitment to \nmaking sure our great outdoors will be enjoyed for years to come. I \ncongratulate Grand Targhee and Jackson Hole Mountain Resort for their \naccomplishments. Wyoming is proud to be home to both of these great ski \nopportunities.\n  Jackson Hole Mountain Resort has a history of environmental \nexcellence. They have earned their 2011 Golden Eagle Award for working \nfor 5 years to implement an integrated environmental management system \nto achieve the International Organization for Standardization's, ISO, \n140001 standards. This system is an overall approach to sustainability, \ncontinual improvement, and a future of responsible\n\n[[Page S4553]]\n\nstewardship of some of the most pristine areas in our country. But this \nisn't the first time that Jackson Hole Mountain Resort has been \nrecognized for environmental excellence. They have a history of \ncommitment to sound environmental management going back 15 years. They \nfirst received the Golden Eagle Award in 1995, and were also awarded a \nSilver Eagle Award for Excellence in Energy Conservation and Clean \nEnergy in 2003, as well as a Silver Eagle Award for Excellence in \nVisual Impact in 2005.\n  Grand Targhee has also worked hard to demonstrate their commitment to \nenvironmental quality. This year, they are being recognized with a \nGolden Eagle Award for committing to reduce their energy use by 10 \npercent, and then exceeding their goal and achieving an energy savings \nof 18 percent. Their investments in energy efficiency upgrades, \nweatherization, and better management practices helped them meet and \nexceed their goals for improving their energy use. This year marks the \nthird award for environmental excellence for Grand Targhee. In 2008, \nthey received the Silver Eagle Award for Excellence in Waste Reduction \nand Recycling, and in 2009 they received their first Golden Eagle \nAward.\n  Both Jackson Hole Mountain Resort and Grand Targhee have been \noperating in the Teton Range since the 1960s. They have a history of \nbeing some of the best ways to experience Wyoming's amazing landscapes. \nTheir commitment to sound environmental management, conservation, and \nimproving how they use energy demonstrates their commitment to being \npart of Wyoming's futures for years to come.\n  I congratulate both resorts for this tremendous accomplishment. It is \ntruly an honor to receive the Golden Eagle Award from the National Ski \nAreas Association and is one more example of Wyoming businesses leading \nthe way.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise today to compliment two Wyoming \nski resorts for their dedication to environmental excellence. Grand \nTarghee and Jackson Hole Mountain Resort each received the 2011 \nNational Ski Areas Association Golden Eagle Award for Environmental \nExcellence. The Golden Eagle Award is the most prestigious \nenvironmental honor given by the ski industry.\n  Grand Targhee received the award in the small ski area category for \ntheir efforts to reduce energy consumption. Grand Targhee's stated goal \nwas to reduce energy use by 10 percent below their previous 5-year \naverage. By implementing better management practices, investing in \nenergy-efficient upgrades and retrofits, and weatherizing their \nbuildings, the resort almost doubled their original goal by realizing \nan 18 percent reduction in energy use. Environmental success is not new \nfor Grand Targhee. In 2008 they received the Silver Eagle Award for \nExcellence in Waste Reduction and Recycling, followed by their first \nGolden Eagle Award in 2009.\n  In the medium-sized ski area category, the Golden Eagle Award was \npresented to Jackson Hole Mountain Resort. This recognition is the \nresult of a long-term dedication to environmental management. For the \npast 5 years, Jackson Hole Mountain Resort's environmental management \nsystem has met the 140001 standards for the International Organization \nfor Standardization, ISO. This lofty benchmark has been achieved now by \nonly two resorts in the United States. Jackson Hole Mountain Resort's \nsteadfast approach to sustainable environmental management practices is \nan ongoing commitment. This award is the fourth time Jackson Hole \nMountain Resort has been honored. In 1995 they also received the Golden \nEagle Award, followed by Silver Eagle Awards for Excellence in Energy \nConservation and Clean Energy and Excellence in Visual impact in 2003 \nand 2005, respectively.\n  Mr. President, Grand Targhee and Jackson Hole Mountain Resort's \nongoing commitment to environmental excellence are outstanding examples \nof the private sector working to preserve our natural resources. \nWyoming is a wonderful place to live, work, and recreate. I want to \ncongratulate each resort and their employees for hard work and \ndedication. The National Ski Areas Association Golden Eagle Award is a \ntribute to their achievements. Because of their efforts, the natural \nwonder of Wyoming's landscapes will continue to be enjoyed now and in \nthe future by those who ski our slopes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/13/senate-section/article/S4553-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING KIP TIERNAN\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I rise today in tribute to \nMs. Kip Tiernan of Boston, MA, who died on July 2. Kip was an immense \nforce for good and a towering figure in the fight to better the lives \nof the less fortunate.\n  Kip Tiernan was, herself, accustomed to loss and struggle and \nredemption. A child of the Depression, Kip lost both parents by age 11 \nand was raised by her grandmother who taught her by example the \nimportance of helping those in need. At a time when young women were \ndiscouraged from taking a stand or speaking out she was precocious, \nlearning to fly a plane while still a teenager.\n  She led a remarkable life not just in spite of her own struggles but \nperhaps because of them. Her early years were marked by her own \nstruggle with substance abuse. She spoke openly about the consequences \nof her drinking and how her recovery from alcoholism helped her to \nempathize with the women she would help.\n  Kip is best known for founding Rosie's Place in 1974, the Nation's \nfirst homeless shelter for women. Rosie's Place is a remarkable \ninstitution that has grown from simply providing emergency shelter and \na hot meal to assisting women of all ages to put their lives back \ntogether. Each year they serve nearly 75,000 meals, hand out tons of \ngroceries, provide thousands of hours of counseling and educational \nservices, help dozens of low-income homeowners to avoid eviction or \nfind permanent housing, and deliver numerous other services to \nthousands of women.\n  In addition to Rosie's Place, Kip helped found the Boston Food Bank, \nthe Boston Women's Fund, Community Works, Transition House, Aid to \nIncarcerated Mothers, Food for Free, Finex House, John Leary House, My \nSister's Place, the Greater Boston Union of the Homeless, and numerous \nother organizations dedicated to providing immediate help and longer \nterm assistance to the poor and homeless.\n  It is impossible to measure with any accuracy the impact of Rosie's \nPlace and the many other organizations that Kip helped to found. We \nwill never know just how many women were saved from dangerous streets \nor abusive relationships. Nor can we estimate how many children and \nfamilies were spared the depravation and indignity of a life on the \nstreets. We can never be sure how many people who were touched by Kip \nwere inspired to go on to help others.\n  Kip once said: Compassion is a discipline; it's not just a smiley \nface. She knew that helping on a larger scale required organization. \nShe used her own marketing and PR skills to raise money and awareness \nfor various groups and knew that running increasingly sophisticated \noperations that served thousands required recruiting other \nprofessionals with their own God-given talents.\n  People may disagree about how best to fight poverty or help the \nneediest among us, but there should be no disagreement that Kip Tiernan \ntranscended the disagreements and politics by committing herself to do \nthe hard work, the sometimes uncomfortable work of demonstrating \ncompassion and helping others one on one.\n  While some volunteer a day or two a year, Kip made it her life's \nwork. Kip Tiernan leaves behind an incredible legacy of service and \nlove. Our city, State, and world are far better places because of her.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/13/senate-section/article/S4553-2", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4553-S4554]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             McCALL, IDAHO\n\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate and \nacknowledge the 100th anniversary of the founding of the city of \nMcCall, ID. On July 19, 2011, the citizens of McCall will gather at \nDepot Park to commemorate the 100th year of its founding. This is a \nvery historic and special day for this central Idaho community.\n  From its early days as a settlement in 1818, McCall has embodied the \nfrontier spirit and entrepreneurship that makes the United States a \nland of opportunity. After a discovery of gold in the Salmon River \nMountains, miners\n\n[[Page S4554]]\n\nadvanced along the west side of Payette Lake, accelerating the \nconstruction of Warren Wagon Road. Around 1890, the town's namesake, \nTom McCall, plotted a 4-block town site from his homestead on the south \nend of the lake, taking in the abandoned Lardo U.S. Post Office.\n  In the years following, there was an extraordinary amount of growth. \nTom McCall bought the Warren Gold Dredging Company sawmill, thus \ninitiating his lumber company that provided lumber for the \nmanufacturing of business buildings, hotels, and homes until the 1970s. \nA school and post office were also established, with McCall naming \nhimself postmaster. A few short years later, the town was officially \nincorporated on July 19, 1911.\n  In 1914, the railroad arrived in McCall bringing with it scores of \ntourists. McCall's picturesque location on the shores of Payette Lake \nand abundant snowfall and hot, dry summers make it a natural vacation \ndestination. And yes, this glacially-carved lake, nearly 400 feet deep, \nis rumored to be the home of a sea serpent named ``Sharlie,'' which has \nbeen sighted by tourists and locals alike over the past century.\n  The winter of '24 spawned the annual winter carnival. Its spectacular \nsnow sculptures now draw thousands each year. Even Hollywood took \nnotice of this beauty in 1938, when McCall served as the elaborate \nbackdrop of the Academy Award-nominated movie, ``Northwest Passage.''\n  Today, McCall is known as an alluring all-season vacation destination \nanchored by historic Shore Lodge and the ski slopes at nearby Brundage \nMountain, which forge the frontier spirit of its people and enhance its \nnatural beauty. McCall has much to celebrate and look forward to in its \nnext century.\n  Congratulations to the vibrant town of McCall for 100 years of \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/13/senate-section/article/S4554-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4554]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         PARKSTON, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, today I wish to \nrecognize the community of Parkston, SD, on reaching the 125th \nanniversary of its founding. This vibrant town in Hutchinson County \ntruly is, as its motto states: ``A Great Place to Grow.''\n  Originally founded as Dakota City by Peter Swartz in 1880, Parkston \nas we know it today was moved to its current location in order to be \ncloser to the Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad built running from \nScotland to Mitchell. The town was thus renamed Parkston in honor of \nEdwin R. Parks, the resident engineer of that division of the railroad \nbecause, as the Dakota City Advance put it: ``Mr. Parks is a first \nclass fellow and Parkston is a first class town.''\n  Today, as with many rural communities, Parkston takes particular \npride in their school system, home of the Trojans. Parkston students \nconsistently rank high on achievement exams, a testament to their \ndedication to education. Local small businesses provide a continually \ngrowing economic sector for the town. Parkston is also known for the \nKlauss-James Archive & Art Museum, which houses the Klauss Archive of \nmusic manuscripts, and watercolors and drawings of Bernard Albert \nJames. The citizens of Parkston plan to celebrate this milestone with \nmany community events including a parade, live music, golf tournament, \ntalent show, and an all-school reunion.\n  Over the past 125 years, Parkston has become a shining star in South \nDakota. I commend small towns, such as Parkston, for their residents' \nsense of community pride and friendship that is evident to all. \nCongratulations to Parkston and their citizens for all their \nachievements, and I look forward to seeing what they will achieve in \nthe future and wish them well on all their endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/13/senate-section/article/S4554-2", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4554]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRENT, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, today, I wish to \npay tribute to the 125th anniversary of the founding of Trent, SD. \nLocated along the historic Milwaukee Railroad line, Trent is a humble \ncommunity in Moody County. On July 22 to 24, 2011, the citizens of \nTrent will celebrate their town's proud past and look forward to its \npromising future.\n  At the time of its founding in 1886, Trent was often referred to as \nBrookfield. The railroad requested that the town of Brookfield \nofficially change its name to Trent in order to avoid confusion with a \ntown of the same name on the line. In 1903, Trent was moved to higher \nground east of the railroad tracks due to continual flooding. Today, \nTrent is home to a community pool, known as the ``Swimming Hole,'' and \nnumerous shops, restaurants, and other local businesses.\n  Trent will be commemorating 125 years of rich history with a \ncommunity potluck, dance, and free swimming on Sunday. The community \nwill celebrate with many activities including a fishing derby, parade, \npork loin feed, horseshoes, mud volleyball, and even cardboard and duct \ntape boat races.\n  Trent continues to grow and thrive, even 125 years after its \nfounding. I congratulate the residents of Trent, SD as they celebrate \nthe town's quasquicentennial and wish them continued success and \nprosperity in the years to come. It is truly an honor and a privilege \nto represent the people of the exceptional town of Trent.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/13/senate-section/article/S4554-3", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4554]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 4:20 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1309.

A bill to regulate political robocalls; to the Committee on \nRules and Administration.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Robocall \nPrivacy Act, a simple, straight-forward bill that would allow continued \npolitical outreach through prerecorded phone messages, but protect \nAmerican families from being inundated by calls throughout the day and \nnight. I am pleased to be joined by Senator Durbin.\n  In recent years, we have seen an increase in the development of new \ntechnologies that help political candidates reach out to voters. This \nis a good thing. Political speech is essential and should be protected. \nThe vast majority of these developments strengthen the Democratic \nprocess by promoting an interchange of information and ideas.\n  One of these developments is the robocall--a prerecorded message that \ncan be sent out to tens of thousands of voters at a minor cost through \ncomputer automation. With television and radio ads becoming so \nexpensive, these prerecorded calls can play an important role in \nalerting voters to a candidate's position and urging their support at \nthe polls.\n  But the process can be abused. Throughout recent elections, we have \ncontinued to hear stories about people being inundated with phone calls \nthroughout the day and night. There is simply no good reason why \nAmericans wanting a good night's sleep should be awakened at 4:30 in \nthe morning by a robocall.\n  Commercial calls are already limited by the Federal Trade \nCommission's ``Do Not Call'' list, which millions of individuals have \nregistered for. But political calls are specifically exempted from this \nlist.\n  Let me be clear: I am not seeking to eliminate all robocalls. \nInstead, this legislation is carefully designed to provide some \nsafeguards. Let me tell you exactly what this bill would do.\n  It would ban political robocalls between the hours of 9 p.m. and 8 \na.m.\n  It would ban any campaign or group from making more than two \nrobocalls to the same telephone number in a single day.\n  It would prohibit the organizer of any robocall from blocking the \n``caller identification'' number and require an announcement at the \nbeginning of the call indentifying the individual or organization \nmaking the call, and the fact that it is a prerecorded message. This is \nto prevent robocalls from misleading the recipient of the call.\n  The enforcement provisions of this bill are simple and directed \ntoward stopping the worst of these calls. The bill would create a civil \nfine for violators of the law, with additional fines for callers who \nwillfully violate the law.\n  The bill also allows voters to sue to stop those calls immediately, \nbut not receive monetary damages. A judge can order violators of the \nlaw to stop these abusive calls.\n  Let me briefly describe a few incidents that showcase why the \nprovisions in this bill are so important.\n  On Election Day in 2010, over 110,000 Maryland voters began receiving \nanonymous robocalls instructing them to ``relax'' and stay home because \nGovernor Martin O'Malley had already won re-election. These calls came \na full two hours before the polls would close.\n  Days before the 2010 Midterm elections, voters in Kansas received \nanonymous robocalls telling them to bring a voter registration card and \nproof of home ownership to the polls on Wednesday. Not only are these \nitems not required to vote, but as we know, the election was on a \nTuesday.\n  Similarly, in my home state of California, about two dozen Los \nAngeles residents complained of receiving Spanish language robocalls \nfrom an unidentifiable source instructing them to vote on Wednesday, \nNovember 3--the day after Election Day.\n  Shortly before last year's elections, individuals in St. Louis, \nMissouri, heard their phones ring and checked the caller ID to find a \nnumber belonging to a local hospital. Expecting the worst, they \nanswered the call. The voice on the other end was not a hospital \nemployee, but rather a prerecorded political message from an \norganization that had been able to manipulate caller ID devices to make \nit seem as if the calls were coming from emergency officials.\n  In October 2010, 50,000 Nevadans were awoken at 1 a.m. by a robocall \nregarding a ballot question in the state that would change the judicial \nselection process. The calls came in the middle of the night due to a \nprogramming error--they were supposed to be made at 1 p.m.\n  To be clear, incidences like these involving the malicious or \nuntimely use of robocalls are not unique to the recent election.\n  In a Maryland race in November 2006, in a conservative area residents \nreceived a middle-of-the-night robocall from the nonexistent ``Gay and \nLesbian Push Organization,'' urging them to support one of the \ncandidates. That candidate lost the election, in part because of the \nfalse, late-night call.\n  In the 2006 Congressional elections, many calls wrongly implied that \none candidate was making a robocall. The message began with a recorded \nvoice stating that the call contained information about U.S. \nRepresentative Melissa Bean. Some voters called Bean's office to \ncomplain without listening to the entire message, which eventually \nidentified an opposing party committee as the sponsor--when most voters \nhad hung up. Representative Bean had to spend campaign funds informing \nvoters she had not made that call.\n  I am a strong supporter of the First Amendment protection for \npolitical speech, but the worst of these calls are disturbing people in \ntheir homes and spreading misleading and outright false information. \nSomething must be done to rein in the robocalls which perpetrate these \nactions.\n  This bill presents a solution. It does not ban robocalls. It merely \nprovides a reasonable framework of tailored time, place, and manner \nrestrictions.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting the Robocall Privacy \nAct.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1355\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to exempt National Forest System land in the State of \nAlaska from the Roadless Area Conservation Rule; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I wish to speak about legislation I am \nintroducing today that would repeal an ill-fitting and broad-reaching \nrule that limits not only timber harvest and mining but important \nrenewable energy projects in Southeast Alaska.\n  In March of this year, a Federal District Court ruling set aside the \n2003 Tongass Exemption and reinstated the application of the 2001 \nRoadless Area Conservation Rule in the Tongass National Forest. This \ndecision means that the Tongass National Forest is now managed by a \ncookie-cutter rule imposed upon all national forests rather than by the \n2008 Tongass Land Management Plan developed by Forest Service personnel \nunder a wide reaching multi-year collaboration with Alaskans.\n  This will have a severe impact and reverse efforts to revitalize \nlocal communities and increase economic diversification throughout the \nregion. Over the past few months, I have spoken with Tongass Forest \nSupervisor Forest Cole and Department of Agriculture staff about what \nflexibility they have under the rule.\n  I appreciate that Secretary Vilsack and the plaintiffs in this most \nrecent court case recognize the importance of hydropower development, \nmining and personal use wood policies to the economy of Southeast \nAlaska. However, what I have read of their settlement agreement doesn't \noffer any certainty that there won't be more challenges and delays. Our \nexperience over the past decade suggests there will be.\n  With lots of demands on the Tongass Forest, the Forest Service needs \ngreater flexibility to address these issues while crafting a reasonably \nsized timber sale program that keeps the few existing mills alive and \nallows for modest expansion into second growth markets. Unemployment in \nthe rural portions of Southeast Alaska currently averages more than 15 \npercent. Energy costs in these non-hydropower communities are too high \nas well. Instead of adding options, the roadless rule takes them away. \nIt is time once and for all to do away with the rule in Alaska.\n  I want to thank my colleague, Senator Murkowski, for joining me as a \ncosponsor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY:\n  S. 1361. A bill to reduce human exposure to endocrine-disrupting \nchemicals, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Endocrine-\nDisrupting Chemicals Exposure Elimination Act to create a research \nprogram through the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences \nto further endocrine related research.\n  There are approximately 80,000 known chemicals in our environment \nthat are potentially harmful. Many of those chemicals have never been \ntested to determine if they are damaging to human health. Products that \nAmerican families use every day such as household cleaners, cosmetics, \nand personal care products could actually be causing them harm.\n  This legislation establishes the Endocrine Disruption Expert Panel to \nstudy and evaluate up to 10 chemicals per year that are potentially \nendocrine-disrupting to determine whether they have a high, \nsubstantial, minimal, or no level of concern. Any chemical that is \ndeemed a high level of concern could be banned from use within 2 years. \nThis commonsense approach provides vital protections against harmful \nchemicals while giving industry an opportunity to either find a way to \neliminate human exposure to the toxin or eliminate it from use.\n  The increased rate of disorders affecting the human endocrine system \nis alarming. Children developing in the womb are particularly \nvulnerable. Many scientists believe there are connections between \neffects on the endocrine system and the chemicals around us, and it is \ntime to do more about it.\n  This bill promotes action based on hard, scientific evidence. I urge \nall my colleagues to support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n  S. 1363. A bill to amend titles 10 and 41, United States Code, to \nallow contracting officers to consider information regarding domestic \nemployment before awarding a Federal contract, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I am introducing the American \nJobs Matter Act, legislation that will promote domestic job creation in \nthe field of Federal contracting.\n  We must do all that we can to stop the outward migration of jobs. \nThis bill takes the important step of directing the Federal Government \nto notify contract applicants that it may consider American job impact \nwhen deciding which bids to accept. The government would then be \nallowed to use that information in making award decisions.\n  There should be no greater champion of American-made goods than the \nFederal Government. Members of Congress come from 50 States and 435 \ndistricts and we each know of the special skill sets that our \nconstituents possess and how fortunate the Federal Government would be \nto have these employees working on Federal projects. Yet our flawed \nprocurement policy has no mechanism to assess the impact of government \npurchasing on American jobs.\n  This bill seeks to change that. Under the American Jobs Matter Act, \ncontractors will be allowed to submit information related to the net \neffect of their offer on American employment. This information could \ninclude the number of American jobs expected to be created or retained \nas a result of the work. Bidders would also be allowed to guarantee \nthat the jobs created would not be moved outside the United States \nafter the contract is awarded. The legislation would finally give \nFederal agencies the ability to assess the impact of procurement \ndecisions on American jobs. It does not dictate that a contract go to \nthe applicant that will create the most jobs. It just elevates job \ncreation to its right place in the hierarchy of criteria that should be \nstudied before making a decision.\n  The American Jobs Matter Act would be an important step towards \npromoting a vibrant manufacturing base which is essential to our \nstandard of living, the health of our communities, and ensuring our \nlong-term economic security.\n  I want to thank my counterpart from the House of Representatives, \nRepresentative Chris Murphy, for his leadership in that body on this \nlegislation. I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nimportant legislation and thank the chair for allowing me to speak on \nthis issue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON of Florida:\n  S. 1364. A bill to ensure the timely payment of Social Security \nbenefits in August 2011; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, the Budget Committee chairman, \nthe Senator from North Dakota, has, in fact, laid out a budget. It puts \nus on a serious road toward budget balance by utilizing real numbers, \nnot sleight of\n\n[[Page S4559]]\n\nhand numbers, not budget fakery numbers, not a budget as a political \ndocument but a budget as an economic document. And it nips--indeed, it \nsavages--the annual deficit and the Federal debt of $4 trillion over 10 \nyears.\n  This is real money, and it is real money that is basically in balance \nbetween $2 trillion of spending cuts--which we have had all of those \nkinds of talks going on down at the White House, and they seem to get \nto an agreement of $2 trillion of spending cuts. But when it comes to \nthe revenue side, there seems to be an unwillingness to accept \nrevenues.\n  What I would like to do is elucidate further on the Budget Committee \nchairman's presentation yesterday or the day before of this budget on \nhow we can produce $2 trillion of new revenue and it not be considered \nas just straight tax increases but, instead, of going to two other \nparts of the Tax Code that have been off limits to so much of the tax \nplanning and tax cuts that we have been talking about. Of course, I am \ntalking about the $14 trillion of tax expenditures that the Federal \nGovernment expends by not having that tax revenue coming in to the tune \nof $14 trillion for special tax preferences over the course of the next \ndecade.\n  Now, if that were not enough in itself, there is also an additional \n$1 trillion that is money that is kept abroad that is not brought back \ninto this country and, therefore, is not taxed. Just a little portion \nof that money being kept overseas could be brought in and used in \nproductive activities in the United States. But it would be brought in \nas income instead of housed in one three-story building in the Cayman \nIslands for 18,000 corporations, where all it is is a residence for a \ncorporation to use to avoid U.S. taxes.\n  Now, if we are going to do anything serious about lowering the \ndeficit, we are going to have to try to stop this nonsense that is \ngoing on. In the case of tax preferences, the tax expenditures, the $14 \ntrillion, the Senate, in an overwhelming vote a couple of weeks ago, \nactually attacked one of those tax preferences.\n  Remember when we voted something like 95 to 5 here to get rid of the \nsubsidy on ethanol made from corn? It was a subsidy put in years ago to \nencourage ethanol made from corn as a way of blending it with gasoline \nthat would then lessen our reliance on oil, particularly foreign oil. \nBut now we know we can make ethanol from a whole bunch of other things, \nand it doesn't have to be making ethanol from something that we eat, \nwhich all it was doing was driving the price of corn higher and, of \ncourse, corn is being used as a feed in the feed lots and, therefore, \nthe meat products that the American consumer was getting at the grocery \nstore went much higher in price.\n  So we realized here was a tax subsidy, a tax preference, in other \nwords, a tax expenditure, that had outlived its usefulness. There are \n$14 trillion of these tax preferences that are, in effect, for the next \ndecade, and it would not be an unreasonable question to ask: Could we \nreduce those tax preferences just a little bit? If you reduced them, \njust 17 percent of all those tax preferences, you would produce $2 \ntrillion. If that $1 trillion that is kept overseas--if you could stop \nsome of those laws that keep foreign income held by U.S. companies \nabroad, if you could just tax a little bit of that, then we could even \nlower the percentage that we needed to get into the tax expenditures.\n  Now, there are some tax expenditures that are obviously very popular \nand very necessary. Charitable contributions, which include \ncontributions to churches, they get a charitable deduction that you \ndeduct from your overall income in order to get your adjusted gross \nincome. From that you subtract the various deductions you have to get \nto your taxable income. Clearly, giving charitable contributions is an \nactivity that we want to encourage, and we encourage that in the Tax \nCode.\n  Another example is, you own a home. You go to the bank, you get a \nmortgage, the mortgage payments that include principal and interest. \nYou are able to deduct the interest that you are paying on that \nmortgage, and that is a tax preference. It was originally put in to \nencourage home ownership. Well, should that preference continue for \nthose who don't need the help?\n  I think these are questions. So if we start just doing little things \nwith this $14 trillion of tax preferences, we can make major reductions \nin the annual deficit.\n  Let me give another example: Oil and gas. There are a lot of tax \npreferences for the oil and gas industry. Normally, when a business \ngoes in and provides capital to get a business up and going, that \ncapital equipment is allowed to be deducted over the life of that piece \nof equipment.\n  Well, so much of oil and gas equipment is allowed to be written off \nin the very first year as an expense of doing business in that first \nyear. That is just one other example. So if we look at it, are we \ncapable of taking $14 trillion of tax preferences--some people call \nthem tax expenditures; some people call them tax giveaways--and, \ntherefore, reduce those, especially the ones that are ineffective and \ninefficient, even though it is going to step on somebody's toes? Some \nspecial interest that has that tax preference, they are not going to \nlike it. They want their goodies. But for the purpose of balancing the \nbudget, for the purpose of bringing this deficit down so we can get on \nthe road to fiscal order instead of the fiscal chaos that we have now, \nis that not a legitimate question to ask and a legitimate road to go \ndown?\n  No less than one of the senior economic advisers to President \nReagan--his name is Martin Feldstein. He was a Harvard professor and \nthe Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers to President Reagan. I \nwant you to see what he says about reducing tax expenditures.\n\n       Cutting tax expenditures is really the best way to reduce \n     government spending. Eliminating tax expenditures does not \n     increase marginal tax rates or reduce the reward for saving, \n     investment or risk-taking. It would also increase overall \n     economic efficiency by removing incentives that distort \n     private spending decisions. And eliminating or consolidating \n     the large number of overlapping tax-based subsidies would \n     also greatly simplify tax filing. In short, cutting tax \n     expenditures is not at all like other ways of raising \n     revenue.\n\n  Martin Feldstein, well regarded in conservative circles.\n  With this crisis looming, why can't we get people to recognize that \nif we want balance, they have to give, too, and here is a good way. I \nwant to expand on this--another way we could do it.\n  We could actually, as the Simpson-Bowles commission suggested, lower \nthese tax expenditures Martin Feldstein is talking about. We could even \ntake that additional revenue and pour it into the rest of the Tax Code \nand lower the tax rates for everybody, including corporate tax rates, \nand in the process we could also simplify the Tax Code into three tax \nbrackets. All of the tax brackets would be lowered if we got rid of \nsome of those tax expenditures. There are multiple ways we can use \nthis, and in the process, then, we are starting some serious tax \nreform.\n  The Senator from North Dakota has laid this out. He has explained \nthis to the Senate. He has the unanimous support of the majority of the \nSenate Budget Committee. He has the near-unanimous support of the \nentire majority in the U.S. Senate. He has explained this to the \nPresident and to the Vice President.\n  Of course, one of the easy ways to react to this is, well, there is \nnot enough time. If we want to do major tax reform and tax \nsimplification for the sake of our consumers, there sure is time \nbecause we could solve this debt ceiling crisis with a commitment down \nthe line to doing just exactly what I have talked about.\n  As we are in this maelstrom of all of these different ideas going \naround about what we are going to do before August 2 so the debt \nceiling can be raised and so the country can pay its bills, I have \nheard about some disturbing things out there on the horizon. One is \nthat Social Security is going to get whacked and that Medicare is going \nto get whacked.\n  By the way, what the Budget Committee is proposing does not whack \nSocial Security or Medicare providers. In the first place, Social \nSecurity is not in financial trouble in the foreseeable future. It is \nnot until the late 2030s that it starts to get into difficulty. It is \naround 2035 that it would not, in that year, be able to pay 100 percent \nof its payments. We can correct that before then.\n\n[[Page S4560]]\n\n  Our problem is now. Our problem is this next decade of bringing this \nbudget on a path toward balance and bringing the annual deficit down to \na much lower percentage of gross domestic product.\n  The budget I have just outlined, that is the work product of the \nSenate Budget Committee chairman, brings it down at the end of the \ndecade to 1.8 percent--the deficit--to GDP. Anytime we get below 3 \npercent of the deficit being a percentage of GDP, we are on the path to \nfiscal stability, and we would be moving toward that position of \nbalance--a position, by the way, we enjoyed 11 years ago because we \nwere in surplus. Eleven years ago, we had 4 years of surplus in a row, \nbut we started enacting policies--and, I might say, not with the vote \nof this Senator--that caused the revenues to drop off considerably. \nThen, of course, when we got in the situation where we started \nincreasing expenditures for one reason or another--increasing \nexpenditures for national defense, for two wars--and those were wars we \nwere not paying for with a revenue source; in fact, we were just going \nout and borrowing the money.\n  So this brings me now to Medicare and Social Security. It might make \nsome people in Washington, DC, feel good to whack Medicare. It \ncertainly wouldn't make this Senator feel good. It certainly wouldn't \nmake an awful lot--as a matter of fact, some 45 million senior citizens \nin this country are on Medicare, some of whom are living from hand to \nmouth, from Social Security check to Social Security check, and from \nMedicare reimbursement to Medicare reimbursement for their health care. \nIt certainly wouldn't make them feel good. And it is not going to do \nanything immediately for the deficit we are having to confront. So why \ntrade off, saying we are going to whack these two programs and not \nattack things such as tax expenditures that are inefficient and don't \nproduce what they are supposed to do via the incentives in the Tax \nCode? It simply doesn't make sense.\n  Oh, by the way, isn't it interesting, isn't it almost ironic that the \npeople who are now attacking Medicare and saying we have to whack it \nare the very people who were criticizing us 2 years ago in the health \ncare bill when we eliminated $\\1/2\\ trillion of inefficiencies and \noverpayments out of Medicare to put the program on a more financially \nsolvent path? And they were the very ones who were criticizing us for \ntaking that money out of Medicare. Well, I say to my colleagues, we \nalready took on Medicare, so we ought to get down to the hard choices \nof budget deficit reduction, which means cutting spending and getting \nrid of some of these tax expenditures so we can start bringing our \nbudget into balance.\n  My final subject is Social Security. Now, why in the world would we \nwant to scare the bejabbers out of 45 million senior citizens of this \ncountry, some of whom literally are living hand to mouth and from \nSocial Security check to Social Security check and some of whom cannot \nafford the cost of drugs even partially provided for through Medicare \nPart D, the prescription drug benefit? I don't think we want to do \nthat.\n  As we get closer to August 2, I am hearing--and I hope every other \nSenator is hearing from all of these senior citizens and these disabled \nworkers who are relying on Social Security--that they are concerned \nabout Washington's failure to get its house in order, and if we fail to \nget our house in order, it is going to threaten the very source of \nincome they count on. So to risk a government default and to say the \nonly way we can do it is by taking it out of Social Security is not \ngoing to do anything for us in reducing the deficit over the next \ndecade, which is the problem at hand.\n  Yesterday, the President was asked if he could tell the folks at home \nthat no matter what happens, Social Security checks are going to go out \nthe day after the government is supposedly going to go into default. Do \nmy colleagues remember what the President said? He said: I cannot \nguarantee that those checks go out on August 3 if we haven't resolved \nthis issue because there may simply not be the money in the coffers to \ndo it.\n  So the people who are relying on a fixed income of Social Security to \nsurvive--Social Security payments are more than just a government \nstatistic. For them, Social Security is more than just a Federal outlay \nor an entitlement expenditure. There are almost 4 million Social \nSecurity beneficiaries in my State. I can tell my colleagues that their \nSocial Security pays the rent, it pays for the groceries, and it helps \npay their medical copays. It helps pay for that over and above what is \nprovided in Medicare.\n  It is interesting, these speeches I hear. It is all ``it is your \nfault, and it is your fault, and it is the other guy's fault, and it is \nso partisan, and it is so ideologically rigid.'' The only way we are \ngoing to solve something that is as tangled up as this is for people of \ngood will to be willing to respect the other fellow's point of view and \ncome together and build consensus to find a workable solution.\n  So as we get closer--and we can almost hear the background music; it \nis getting more ominous day by day as the clock ticks down to August \n2--there is something we can do about it. The threat that Social \nSecurity payments could be delayed should not be used as a weapon to \nforce a slash-and-burn cut to these entitlements. I said 45 million \nearlier; it is actually 56 million retirees who rely on these payments.\n  A recent report from the Congressional Research Service states:\n\n       Under normal procedures Treasury pays Social Security \n     benefits from the General Fund and offsets this by redeeming \n     an equivalent amount of the Social Security Trust Funds' \n     holdings of government debt. Treasury now may need to issue \n     new public debt to raise the cash needed to pay benefits. \n     Treasury may be unable to issue new public debt, however, \n     because of the debt limit.\n\n  In other words, if the debt ceiling is not raised, Social Security \nbenefits could be delayed or jeopardized. So perhaps what we ought to \ndo is enact some legislation that takes Social Security out of the \nequation in the event we don't reach a deal on the debt ceiling by \nAugust 2.\n  In the past, the President and the Congress have agreed to exempt \nSocial Security from the debt ceiling in order to ensure that the \npayments go out to Social Security recipients. As a matter of fact, as \nrecently as 1996, Treasury reported it had insufficient cash to pay \nSocial Security benefits in March of that year. In response, Congress \nthen passed--and it was a bipartisan Congress; it was headed by a \nmajority of the Republican Party, and there was a Democratic President, \nPresident Clinton. They passed--and it was signed into law--a measure \nthat provided the Treasury with temporary authority to issue securities \nto the public in the amount equal to the Social Security benefit \npayments due.\n  I will conclude by pointing out that after that was done in 1996, \nCongress later extended the borrowing authority for an additional 2 \nweeks.\n  I believe we should use what we know works and not play games with \nSocial Security benefits. So I am introducing some legislation, and I \nam introducing it today. It is called the Social Security Benefit \nProtection Act. What it suggests is the way we ought to go. Now, I know \nwe are not going to take up and pass this legislation, but I have a \nmeans by which I can get this idea out. What it does is guarantee that \nthe Social Security Administration will be able to continue paying \nSocial Security benefits to retirees, survivors, and disabled workers \nregardless of what happens to this political gridlock here in \nWashington.\n  Similar to the 1996 legislation, this legislation gives the Treasury \nDepartment temporary authority to issue new debt to ensure the payments \ncan be made to Social Security beneficiaries, but only to the extent \nnecessary to cover the needs of the Social Security Program.\n  I urge our colleagues to try to come together and give the assurances \nto millions of retirees that they are not going to be whacked and, \nespecially so, they are not going to be whacked out of political \ngridlock by all the rest of us for these excessive reasons. I urge my \ncolleagues to take a look at the ideas in this legislation that I have \nfiled.\n\n[[Page S4561]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/13/senate-section/article/S4561-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4561]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 232--RECOGNIZING THE CONTINUED PERSECUTION OF FALUN \nGONG PRACTITIONERS IN CHINA ON THE 12TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CAMPAIGN BY \n   THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY TO SUPPRESS THE FALUN GONG MOVEMENT, \n  RECOGNIZING THE TUIDANG MOVEMENT WHEREBY CHINESE CITIZENS RENOUNCE \n   THEIR TIES TO THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY AND ITS AFFILIATES, AND \n CALLING FOR AN IMMEDIATE END TO THE CAMPAIGN TO PERSECUTE FALUN GONG \n                             PRACTITIONERS\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself and Mr. Coburn) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 232\n\n       Whereas Falun Gong (also known as Falun Dafa) is a Chinese \n     spiritual discipline founded by Li Hongzhi in 1992 that \n     consists of spiritual and moral teachings, meditation, and \n     exercise based upon the universal principles of truthfulness, \n     compassion, and forbearance;\n       Whereas, during the mid-1990s, Falun Gong acquired a large \n     and diverse following, with as many as 70,000,000 \n     practitioners at its peak;\n       Whereas, on April 25, 1999, an estimated 10,000 to 30,000 \n     Falun Gong practitioners gathered in Beijing to protest \n     growing restrictions by the Government of the People's \n     Republic of China on the activities of Falun Gong \n     practitioners, and the Government of the People's Republic of \n     China responded with an intensive, comprehensive, and \n     unforgiving campaign against the movement that began on July \n     20, 1999, with the outlawing of Falun Gong;\n       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     has stated that it fully respects and protects citizen's \n     freedom of religion in accordance with the law, but that \n     ``Falun Gong is neither a religion nor a spiritual movement; \n     rather it is an evil cult against humanity, science and \n     society'';\n       Whereas, on October 30, 1999, China's National People's \n     Congress promulgated an ``anti-cult'' law (article 300 of the \n     Criminal Law), effective retroactively, to suppress the Falun \n     Gong movement and thousands of religious sects across the \n     country;\n       Whereas, since 1999, more than 6,000 Falun Gong \n     practitioners have reportedly served time in prison, with \n     estimates of those in reeducation through labor camps \n     reaching as many as 125,000 people, and Falun Gong \n     practitioners are said to constitute approximately two-thirds \n     of all prisoners and detainees of conscience in China \n     (roughly 15,000 people);\n       Whereas the publication of ``Nine Commentaries on the \n     Communist Party'' in November 2004 by the United States-based \n     newspaper, the Epoch Times, led to the creation of the \n     Tuidang movement;\n       Whereas the Tuidang movement, which translates literally as \n     ``withdraw from the communist party'', has encouraged as many \n     as 90,000,000 people to publicly renounce their membership in \n     the Chinese Communist Party and its affiliates since 2004;\n       Whereas, in the lead up to and during the 2010 World Expo \n     in Shanghai, authorities conducted propaganda campaigns \n     portraying ``cults'' like Falun Gong as ``dangers'' to \n     society that ``wreck families'' and ``poison the minds of \n     youth'', carried out strict surveillance of practitioners, \n     and detained and imprisoned large numbers of practitioners;\n       Whereas, according to estimates by the Department of State \n     and human rights organizations, since 1999, from several \n     hundred to a few thousand Falun Gong adherents have died in \n     custody from torture, abuse, and neglect;\n       Whereas a review of the Government of the People's Republic \n     of China by the United Nations Human Rights Council's Working \n     Group on the Universal Periodic Review in February 2009 \n     reiterated concerns regarding human rights violations against \n     Falun Gong practitioners, including arrests, detention, \n     torture, and reeducation through labor camps;\n       Whereas the Department of State's 2010 Human Rights Report \n     on China cited reports of Falun Gong adherents being \n     committed to mental health facilities, medicated against \n     their will, and forcibly subjected to electric shock \n     treatment;\n       Whereas the Department of State's 2010 Human Rights Report \n     on China stated that the Government of the People's Republic \n     of China automatically censored e-mail and web chats based on \n     an ever-changing list of sensitive key words, such as ``Falun \n     Gong'', and periodically blocked the blogs of a number of \n     prominent activists, artists, scholars, and university \n     professors; and\n       Whereas the 2010 Annual Report of the Congressional-\n     Executive Commission on China found that lawyers involved in \n     human rights advocacy work--including in legal cases \n     involving Falun Gong practitioners and others deemed by the \n     Government of the People's Republic of China to threaten \n     ``social stability''--have been harassed by the Government of \n     the People's Republic of China based on who their clients are \n     and the causes those clients represent: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) expresses solidarity with Falun Gong practitioners and \n     their families for the lives, freedoms, and rights they lost \n     for adhering to their beliefs and practices;\n       (2) calls upon the Chinese Communist Party to immediately \n     cease and desist from its campaign to persecute Falun Gong \n     practitioners and promptly release all Falun Gong \n     practitioners who have been confined, detained, or imprisoned \n     in retaliation for pursuing their right to hold and exercise \n     spiritual beliefs;\n       (3) emphasizes to the Government of the People's Republic \n     of China that freedom of religion includes the right of Falun \n     Gong practitioners to freely practice Falun Gong in China;\n       (4) calls upon the President, the Secretary of State, and \n     Members of Congress to--\n       (A) mark the anniversary of the Government of the People's \n     Republic of China's official repression of the Falun Gong \n     spiritual movement;\n       (B) express solidarity with persecuted Falun Gong \n     practitioners in China; and\n       (C) meet with Falun Gong practitioners; and\n       (5) expresses support for volunteers and participants of \n     the Tuidang movement for their peaceful efforts to reclaim \n     Chinese history and culture, and for their pursuit of a fair \n     and open government, a free people, and a society rooted in \n     the practice of virtue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/13/senate-section/article/S4561-2", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4561-S4562]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 233--HONORING THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE NATIONAL \nAERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION SPACE SHUTTLE PROGRAM ON REACHING \n   THE HISTORIC MILESTONE OF THE 135TH AND FINAL FLIGHT OF THE SPACE \n                         TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida (for himself, Mr. Brown of Ohio, Mrs. \nHutchison, Mr. Boozman, Mr. Rockefeller, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Rubio, Mr. \nUdall of Colorado, Mr. Warner, and Mr. Vitter) submitted the following \nresolution;

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON PROTECTING MEDICAID.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) 68,000,000 low-income children, parents, pregnant \n     women, seniors and people with disabilities are served by the \n     Medicaid program.\n       (2) After almost 50 years, Medicaid is still a life-saving \n     part of what we do as a government--by providing health care \n     to more than 20 percent of all Americans, including 40 \n     percent of the births, 50 percent of long-term care, and, \n     along with the Children's Health Insurance Program, 34 \n     percent of the children in our country.\n       (3) Medicaid provides essential health coverage, furnishing \n     a usual source of care, lowering infant mortality rates, \n     improving the health of adults and children with chronic \n     illnesses and special health care needs, and providing \n     critical preventive care.\n       (4) Medicaid provides essential coverage for seniors and \n     people with disabilities. It covers 62 percent of all long-\n     term care services and supports. It also covers premiums and \n     co-payments on behalf of low-income Medicare beneficiaries\n       (5) The 9,000,000 beneficiaries who are dually eligible for \n     Medicaid and Medicare are among the most medically complex \n     beneficiaries and account for nearly 40 percent of Medicaid \n     spending, although they account for only 15 percent of \n     Medicaid enrollment. Significant Medicaid cuts would \n     undermine efforts to improve care and lower costs for this \n     group of beneficiaries.\n       (6) Medicaid is a very efficient program. On average, after \n     adjusting for differences in health, Medicaid costs 27 \n     percent less per child than private insurance and 20 percent \n     less for adults. Between 2000 and 2009, per beneficiary \n     spending grew at 4.6 percent compared to 7.7 percent growth \n     in premiums for employer sponsored insurance.\n       (7) Medicaid is an economic engine supporting millions of \n     home-grown jobs at hospitals, nursing homes, community health \n     centers, and doctor's offices.\n       (8) Medicaid is the health care program that helps States \n     during times of crises - including after the September 11th \n     attacks, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and the recent floods \n     and tornados in the South and Midwest. It automatically \n     expands during an economic downturn to assist families who \n     lose their jobs and health insurance.\n       (9) Medicaid is the largest source of Federal revenues for \n     States. According to the National Governors Association, \n     ``federal spending reductions for Medicaid will result in a \n     direct cost shift to States, which will result in reduced \n     Medicaid expenditures, increased State taxes or reductions in \n     K-12 education, transportation, and public safety funding.''\n       (10) Cuts to federal Medicaid funding will force already \n     cash-strapped States to cut eligibility, benefits, and \n     provider payment rates, inevitably resulting in reduced \n     access to care for children, parents, pregnant women, seniors \n     and people with disabilities who have nowhere else to turn \n     for affordable, comprehensive coverage.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that any agreement to reduce the budget deficit should not \n     include arbitrary cuts to Medicaid that shift health care \n     costs to States and local governments and jeopardize health \n     care coverage for millions of Americans.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 551.

Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the \nsenior Senator from Florida about Social Security. In my State--and it \nis not much different in Rhode Island, the State of the Presiding \nOfficer--the average Social Security benefit is $14,000 a year. A huge \npercent--I think about half--of Social Security beneficiaries in Ohio \nrely on Social Security for more than half of their income.\n  When I hear proposals here, which Senator Nelson also was speaking \nagainst, to make significant cuts to seniors who are getting $1,000 a \nmonth from Social Security and letting off hedge fund managers who are \npaying significantly lower tax rates than most people in the middle \nclass--that the sacrifice is aimed toward the middle class and aimed \ntoward seniors and not spread more evenly among people who are the most \nprivileged of society--it bothers me, as it does, I know, the Presiding \nOfficer.\n  I rise today about a similar issue, about a Social Security issue \nalso, calling on my colleagues in the Senate and in the House of \nRepresentatives to practice what we preach.\n  Presently, the Congress and the White House are working to find \nagreement on ways to balance the budget, as we should. I was part of \nthe effort in the 1990s. During the Clinton years we balanced the \nFederal budget. In fact, during those 8 years, we took a terrible \ndeficit and high unemployment, and even though taxes for upper income \npeople were raised to 39 percent, we saw 21 million private sector jobs \ncreated, we saw incomes going up, and we saw that President Clinton \nleft office with the highest budget surplus in American history.\n  We saw the policies of the next 8 years and what they did to our \ncountry: tax cuts for the wealthy, deregulation of Wall Street, bad \ntrade agreements, a giveaway to the drug and insurance companies, and \ntwo unpaid-for wars and where that got us to this budget situation--\nexacerbated by this recession in the last 3 years. So we clearly need \nto move forward in balancing the budget.\n  Some Washington politicians want to balance the budget by cutting the \nSocial safety net upon which millions of hard-working Americans rely. I \noppose those efforts.\n  In a time of fiscal belt-tightening, Members of Congress should also \nshare the burden of reducing that deficit. That is why I have \nintroduced the Congressional Retirement Age Act of 2011.\n  The bill is simple. As Congress and the White House seek an agreement \non a deficit reduction package, Members of Congress cannot permit \nthemselves to receive benefits denied to ordinary working Americans.\n  While the wealth of Members of Congress varies, there is no doubt we \nreceive a healthy salary and benefits compared to millions of American \nfamilies who do not.\n  Members of Congress also have an added benefit. We can access our \nFederal retirement benefits early, whether we serve as few as 5 or as \nmany as 25 years. Millions of seniors--who have worked their lives in \nfactories or have worked their lives in construction or have worked \ntheir lives walking the floor of retail outlets, department stores or \ndiners--millions of seniors cannot do the same. For too many Americans, \nSocial Security has become their retirement plan, as pensions disappear \nand 401(k)s plummet.\n  All Members of Congress are able to collect their pensions at any \ntime--starting at age 50--if they have served 25 years. Most have not \nby the age of 50, obviously, but once they have served 25 years, they \ncan receive full pensions. If they have served as few as 5 years, they \ncan collect their pensions beginning at age 62.\n  So with 25 years of congressional service, Members of Congress can \nreceive pensions immediately upon retirement. If they have served 5 \nyears, they can receive a pension--not a large one at that point but a \npretty decent pension--at age 62.\n  But what about a Youngstown steelworker, what about a Columbus store \nclerk, what about a Cincinnati nurse, what about a Toledo sheet metal \nworker, what about an Akron worker in a rubber plant? Do they get that \noption? Of course not. They have to wait until age 65, or age 62 at a \ndiscounted amount, to receive retirement benefits.\n  No longer should any Congressman, no longer should any Congresswoman, \nno longer should any Senator be treated differently from other \nAmericans. That is what the Congressional Retirement Age Act of 2011 \nwould ensure.\n  This bill would amend the Federal Employees Retirement System and the \nCivil Service Retirement System to directly tie current and future \nMembers of Congress' access to their Federal retirement benefits to the \nSocial Security retirement age.\n  It is that simple and it is bipartisan. Senator McCaskill of \nMissouri, a Democrat, Senator Johnson of South Dakota, a Democrat, are \ncosponsors. The House companion, introduced by Representative Bobby \nSchilling of Illinois, a Republican, has seven Republican cosponsors.\n  This idea is endorsed by the conservative National Taxpayers Union, \nthat calls it ``one of the few serious attempts to reform Congressional \npensions in recent memory.'' I do not agree with the National Taxpayers \nUnion on that many issues; they are too willing to cut benefits for the \nmiddle class, in my view. But together, on this issue, we share the \nbelief that Members of Congress should be treated as any other citizen. \nThere is no reason that the benefits of being a Member of Congress \nshould be more generous than being a member of the middle class.\n  According to reports, 13 sitting Senators and 31 Members of the House \nof Representatives today have accrued annual pensions worth at last \n$50,000, if they were to retire today. Meanwhile, American workers age \n65 or older receive a median private pension payment of about $8,000 a \nyear.\n  Elected officials do not, frankly--I think you look around this body \nand you know that most House Members and Senators, at least a number of \nthem, simply do not know enough people who work in construction, who \nwork in a retail store, who work at a\n\n[[Page S4565]]\n\ndiner, who work at a manufacturing plant, who work in a hotel cleaning \nrooms, who stand up all day as a cosmetologist or as a barber, working \nin jobs where their bodies simply cannot work until the age of 70.\n  Members of Congress, dressing like this and doing what we do, can \noften work--obviously, if the voters say so--can, obviously, work into \nour 70s. It is not that hard for most of us. But while we go to work in \na suit and tie, tens of millions of American workers work in factories \nand mines and fields and diners and hotels and their bodies simply \ncannot work until the age of 70.\n  So when I hear my colleagues say we should raise the Social Security \nretirement age, I think of people working in the service industry, I \nthink of people doing demanding work in agriculture and on shop floors \nand in construction and hairdressers, and all that.\n  Why should they wait longer for their retirement security--albeit it \nis too small to begin with in many cases; it is minimal, often, at \nbest--but why should they wait longer for their retirement security \nthan Members of Congress?\n  So for those who think about raising the retirement age for Social \nSecurity, think about raising the retirement age for ourselves. There \nis simply no reason we, as Members of Congress--no matter how many \nyears of service--should be able to retire at full pension before \nSocial Security beneficiaries in this country.\n  Why should Members of Congress be treated better than a steelworker \nor a store clerk or a nurse or a hotel worker?\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/13/senate-section/article/S4565-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, JULY 14, 2011\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio.
