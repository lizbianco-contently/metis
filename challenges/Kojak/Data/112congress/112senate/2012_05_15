Mr. President, we are now on the motion to proceed to the \nExport-Import Bank reauthorization bill. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe hour following my remarks and those of the Republican leader be \nequally divided and controlled between the two leaders or their \ndesignees, with the majority controlling the first half and the \nRepublicans the final half.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

At 12:30 \nthe Senate will recess until 2:15 for our weekly caucus meetings. As \nearly as 2:15 there will be up to six rollcall votes in order to \ncomplete action on the Export-Import Bank. There could possibly be five \nvotes as part of the order--I have been told they may not all be \noffered--and then we will have final passage on the bill.\n\n\n                       Measure Placed on Calendar\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, H.R. 5652 is at the desk and due for a \nsecond reading.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will read the bill by \ntitle for the second time.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 5652) to provide for reconciliation pursuant \n     to section 201 of the concurrent resolution on the budget for \n     fiscal year 2013.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would object to any further proceedings on \nthis issue at this time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection having been heard, the \nitem shall be placed on the calendar.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am happy to announce that Democrats and \nRepublicans have reached an agreement to move forward with \nreauthorization of the Ex-Im Bank legislation.\n  This bank helps American companies sell their products overseas and \nhire workers here at home. It helped private companies add almost \n300,000 jobs last year in more than 2,000 American communities. That is \nwhy the labor groups, manufacturers, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and many \nother organizations have urged the Senate to move quickly to \nreauthorize this bank, whose lending limit is just about to expire.\n  The second ranking officer at the chamber of commerce wrote to all \nSenators yesterday.\n\n       Failure to enact this legislation would put at risk . . . \n     American jobs at 3,600 companies that depend on Ex-Im to \n     compete in global markets. . . . Because other countries are \n     providing their own exporters with an estimated $1 trillion \n     in export finance--often on terms more generous than Ex-Im \n     can provide--failure to reauthorize Ex-Im would amount to \n     unilateral disarmament and cost\n\n[[Page S3138]]\n\n     tens of thousands of American jobs. China, for instance, has \n     three export credit agencies that last year provided $300 \n     billion in export finance to its exporters--ten times more \n     than Ex-Im provided. This bill would help level the financial \n     playing field in export markets and ensure transparency in \n     Ex-Im's operations.\n\n  This is directly from the chamber of commerce.\n  This legislation helps American businesses export their products \ninstead of exporting jobs. Reauthorizing this important legislation is \nthe kind of consensus proposal that should not result in any kind of a \npartisan fight. I spoke to Senator McConnell yesterday, and we made the \ndecision that this is the best way to move forward. I am hopeful that \nthe Senate will pass it overwhelmingly, signaling to American \nbusinesses that Congress will do what it takes to help them compete in \nthe global market. But while Republicans say publicly that they support \nthis important measure, they have instead insisted on votes on a number \nof amendments that would gut or even kill the bill.\n\n  The chamber of commerce will consider votes on this measure--and any \namendments that would weaken the bank--to be keys to determine whether \nSenators are business-friendly. The extreme amendments offered by my \nRepublican colleagues would certainly weaken the bank. One amendment \njust eliminates the bank. These kinds of amendments are unacceptable to \nthe business community.\n  The National Association of Manufacturers issued a similar warning \nyesterday, which I read here on the floor. We agree, we can't afford to \ngive an inch to our global competitors. Canada, France, and India \nalready provide seven times the assistance to their exporters that \nAmerica does. China and Brazil provide 10 times the support.\n  So Senate Republicans are faced with a choice: They can continue to \nsupport these extreme amendments that would effectively kill the \nExport-Import Bank and risk the wrath of the American business \ncommunity or they can work with the Democrats to reauthorize this bank \nwithout adding amendments that would undermine its ability to help \nbusinesses grow. We have been told that the House is going to accept no \namendments. It was very hard for them to get done what they did. I \nadmire and appreciate what they did do. I am optimistic that my \nRepublican colleagues will make the right choice and help us defeat \nthese vexatious amendments.\n\n\n                  Recognition of the Republican Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, there is a lot of talk on the left \nthese days about the Senate being a dysfunctional institution. And they \nare right. For the past few years, the Senate hasn't functioned as it \nshould. The question is, Why? In my view, the answer is quite clear: a \nmajority party that believes it should be able to dictate from above \nthe shape of every single piece of legislation we take up.\n  The common complaint from the other side, as I understand it, is that \nbecause Republicans insist on playing a role in the legislative process \naround here, we are somehow violating some unspoken rule that says \nDemocrats should always get their way, that we are somehow disturbing \nthe legislative harmony by suggesting we do the kinds of things our \nconstituents want. We have been dealing with this strange view of the \nSenate in some form or fashion for 5 years but particularly over the \npast 3.\n  Here is how it works. Following the lead of our very liberal \nPresident, Democratic leaders in the Senate propose some piece of \nlegislation without any Republican input at all. Then Republican \namendments are blocked from even being considered. The point in most \ncases is to draw Republican opposition and ensure that the legislation \nfails. Democrats then cry obstruction as a way of distracting people \nfrom the fact that they basically have given up on governing and done \nnothing to ensure that our most pressing national problems actually get \naddressed. Rather than working with us on bipartisan solutions that \nreflect the concerns and input of our constituents and that therefore \nhave a good chance of actually passing, Democrats blame the other side \nfor obstruction--not only avoiding their own responsibilities as the \nmajority party but handing the President a useful election-year theme \non which to run.\n  What my colleagues and I have been saying for 3 years is that it \ndoesn't have to be this way. Give us an opportunity to play a role in \nthe process and we will work together on bipartisan solutions. Just \nlook at the record. When Democrats blocked all debate and amendments on \nthe Export-Import Bank legislation, it went nowhere. When they agreed \nto our reasonable requests for input on the bill, that changed. They \ncould have accepted this offer, actually, much earlier, but they didn't \nbecause it didn't fit the story line. The same thing on the postal \nbill--when Democrats blocked all amendments and debate, the bill \nstalled. When they agreed to a reasonable list of amendments, it \npassed. The same could be said about trade adjustment assistance, \npatent reform, FAA reauthorization, the highway bill, unemployment \ninsurance, the doc fix, the payroll tax holiday, and others. It is the \nsame story every time: Poisoned pills are removed, Republican input is \nallowed, and then things happen.\n  Republicans have been crystal clear that the Export-Import Bank \nreauthorization needed some work. Remember, Democrats tried to add it \nas an amendment to the JOBS Act before the House reached the agreement \nthat enabled it to pass on a bipartisan basis over in the House. But, \nagain, they wanted to do it without giving Senate Republicans a chance \nto debate or amend on the floor, so it didn't go anywhere. Now that we \nare being allowed to offer further improvements to the bill, there is a \npath forward. Republicans fought for the right to make this bill more \nresponsive to the concerns of the American people, who, understandably, \nwant proof that we take our fiscal problems seriously. This is how the \nSenate is supposed to work, and it has been all too rare over the past \nseveral years.\n  The Founders established the Senate as a place where issues would be \nresolved through consensus and considered bipartisan debate, so that \nonce that consensus is actually reached, our laws would be stable and \nwe could move on, confident that we had done the right thing.\n  The Social Security Act of 1935 was approved by all but six Members \nof the Senate. The Medicare and Medicaid acts of 1965 were approved by \nall but 21. All but eight Senators voted for the Americans With \nDisabilities Act of 1990. The idea in all these cases--and many \nothers--was that on issues of broad national importance, on issues that \naffect all of us, one party shouldn't be allowed to force its will on \nthe other half of the Nation. Yet, over the past few years, Democrats \nhave felt quite differently.\n  So I am pleased today to see a departure from the Democratic standard \noperating procedure on this particular piece of legislation before us. \nBecause they have agreed to allow a reasonable amendment process on \nthis bill--something they objected to last month and then objected \nagain even as recently as last week--this bill will be considered today \nafter debate and votes on amendments aimed at improving it.\n  There is a lesson here: When both sides have a chance to debate and \namend, legislation tends to move. But when the majority refuses any \nideas that they didn't come up with, things slow down. Let's hope this \nnew process will stick.\n\n\n                          National Police Week\n\n  Mr. President, this week we commemorate National Police Week 2012 and \npay tribute to the men and women in the law enforcement community for \ntheir service and their sacrifice.\n  In 1962 President Kennedy signed a proclamation which designated May \n15 as Peace Officers Memorial Day and the week in which it falls as \nPolice Week.\n  During National Police Week, the Nation's Capital welcomes tens of \nthousands of law enforcement officers to honor those who have fallen in \nthe line of duty. Among those visiting Washington are hundreds of \npolice officers from my home State of Kentucky, and I want to \npersonally welcome them and extend a special-thank you for their \nservice and sacrifice that they make to keep Kentucky's communities and \nfamilies safe. Your hard work and dedication is unmatched and does not \ngo unnoticed.\n\n[[Page S3139]]\n\n  Today we honor the approximately 900,000 peace officers across the \ncountry as well as the more than 19,000 officers who have lost their \nlives dating back to the first known line-of-duty death in 1791, \nincluding 163 officers who died in 2011 and 36 officers who have been \nkilled thus far in 2012. In addition, this year we are paying tribute \nto 199 officers who died in previous years but whose acts of courage \nand sacrifice were not discovered until recently.\n  It is with great sadness that one of those officers we lost last year \nwas from the Commonwealth--Officer James Philip ``Stumpy'' Stricklen of \nthe Alexandria, KY Police Department.\n  Officer Stricklen was well respected amongst his peers and a leader \nwithin the community. He will be sorely missed.\n  This week the Nation honors Officer Stricklen, as well as all those \npolice officers that have fallen. I would also like to take a moment to \nremember the families of the fallen. It is only through supportive \nfamilies that these men and women were able to dedicate their lives to \nprotecting others. May God continue to look after them and may God \ncontinue to protect all those, whose daily work is to protect us.\n  I hope paying tribute to those who serve and especially those who \nhave paid the ultimate sacrifice reminds all of us of the heroes we \nhave all around us, keeping us safe, each day. I encourage everyone to \ntake a moment this week and going forward to extend a thank you to law \nenforcement officers who have sworn to protect us and keep our \ncommunities safe.\n  On behalf of myself and my Senate colleagues, thank you to all \nmembers of the law enforcement community for your service. You have our \ndeepest admiration and respect.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Reservation Of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nleadership time is reserved.\n  Under the previous order, there will now be 1 hour of debate equally \ndivided and controlled between the two leaders or their designees, with \nthe majority controlling the first 30 minutes and the Republicans \ncontrolling the second 30 minutes.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, before I say a word about the Export-\nImport Bank, I wish to speak as in morning business. I ask unanimous \nconsent to speak as in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                            Senate Procedure\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the comments made by the Republican Senate \nleader about the procedures in the Senate are comments I wish to speak \nto directly.\n  First, perhaps to his surprise, let me say I agree with him. The \nSenate is not what it should be. It is an important part of this \ngovernment, it is an important part of this Nation, and it should be an \nimportant forum for the deliberation of critical issues that face us. \nHistorically that is the role it has played.\n  But what we have found over the last several years is that we have \nlapsed into a new Senate--and not a very good one, from my point of \nview. It is a Senate that is overrun with filibusters. Filibusters used \nto be so rare, one or two a year in the early days and then maybe a few \nmore in the last 50 years, but now virtually every single week. The \nfilibuster is basically shutting down the Senate, saying that we will \nnot go forward to vote on a measure. It has been abused, overused and, \nfrankly, has denigrated the reputation of this important institution.\n  What are the points of view? The point of view of the minority was \nwell stated by the Republican leader. The minority wants an opportunity \nto offer amendments. I know the feeling. I have been in the minority in \nthe Senate. It is your only opportunity to have a voice on the floor of \nthe Senate and to express a point of view that may not be reflected by \nthe President or the Senate majority. That is an understandable \nimpulse. The majority in the Senate is usually trying to move an \nagenda--many times, in this case, the President's agenda--and, frankly, \ndoes not want to see this slowed down by an onslaught of amendments. \nThere has to be a happy medium, and that is what we need to see.\n  The suggestion of the Senate Republican leader that the problem we \nhave with filibusters has to do with the fact, as he said it, that the \nRepublicans insist on playing a role in offering amendments is correct \nto a point. But I might remind the minority leader, what happened last \nweek? We brought up the college student loan bill. The object was to \nmake sure the interest rate on college student loans did not double \nJuly 1, from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent--widely accepted, widely \nendorsed by President Obama and by Governor Romney. How about that? \nBoth leading contenders for the Presidency said don't let this interest \nrate double. You would think that would be an easy thing to accomplish.\n  What we offered on the floor to the Republicans was an opportunity to \nbring up the measure and they could bring up their amendments to the \nmeasure. That, I think, is what the Senate Republican leader just asked \nfor. How many Republican Senators voted with us to bring up the student \nloan measure, subject to amendment? None. Not one. So this suggestion \nthat we are in filibuster because we do not offer an opportunity for \namendment overlooks what happened last week. The college student loan \nbill offered ample opportunity to the Republicans to offer an \namendment, but they still refused to allow us to proceed to that \nmeasure.\n  Here is what I suggest--perhaps a cooling-off period; perhaps that \nboth sides do sit down and try to work out something that is \nreasonable.\n  Some can argue--and perhaps at times I have argued--that the Senate \nshould be an open forum, open debate of many different issues. But in \nthe interest of achieving things here in a reasonable period of time, I \nsuggest what Senator Reid, the Democratic leader, did on postal reform \nwas a good-faith effort to come to some kind of compromise with the \nminority. If you will remember, Senator Reid came to the floor and said \nwe will accept relevant amendments to postal reform. We had quite a few \nof them, if you remember. I think it was a healthy time. It was a rare \noccasion, unfortunately, on the Senate floor, but it was a good-faith \noffer by the Democratic leader. It gave the Republicans opportunity to \ndebate amendments. We debated them, we voted on them, and we passed \npostal reform.\n  I think we need to find some commonality here, where we can offer to \nthe minority, whichever party is in the minority, the opportunity to \noffer relevant amendments to a bill. That means, of course, it is an \namendment that relates to the subject matter of the bill. Two recent \nexamples show how far afield you can reach. Senator Blunt of Missouri \noffered an amendment to the transportation bill on the subject of birth \ncontrol. Maybe there is some way you can link up transportation and \nbirth control but I will not go there. I will just say that was a \nstretch to bring that issue to that bill, but he was given the chance. \nThe junior Senator from Kentucky tried on bill after bill, totally \nunrelated to foreign policy, to offer an amendment on foreign aid to \nEgypt. That shows how far you can stretch the opportunity to offer a \nfloor amendment.\n  As I said, there can be moments where we want to do that but as a \nmatter of course around here I hope we will try to find some common \nground. Wouldn't it be refreshing if the Senate floor was actually a \nfloor where amendments were offered, debate ensued, and a matter moved \nto final passage instead of watching us lurch from one mind-numbing \nfilibuster to another? I have said it on the floor before, but a lot of \npeople with cable TV are complaining to the cable TV providers that \nthere must by something wrong with C SPAN, nothing is happening on C \nSPAN. It is the Senate. And many times nothing happens because we are \nlurching through filibusters.\n  Today we are going to move to the Export-Import bill.\n  President Obama challenged us back in 2010 to create jobs by doubling \nexports of American-made products by 2015. It is a challenge to create \nand develop new technology, to tap into new markets and create new \nrelationships, to more efficiently ship overseas our agricultural \nproducts and manufactured goods. In 2010, exports supported more than \n9.2 million American jobs. Every $1 billion in new exports sales \nsupports 6,000 additional jobs. By doubling exports, we have the \nopportunity\n\n[[Page S3140]]\n\nto create millions of new jobs right here at home, jobs that could put \nthe millions of Americans still unemployed or underemployed back to \nwork.\n  Last year, Congress passed free trade agreements that will increase \nexports and provide access to markets in South Korea and Panama for US \nexporters. The South Korea Free Trade Agreement alone is estimated to \nsupport 70,000 additional jobs by opening up Korea's $560 billion \nmarket to U.S. companies.\n  Earlier this year, I introduced a bill with Senators Boozman and \nCoons in the Senate and Congressmen Chris Smith and Bobby Rush in the \nHouse that would boost U.S. jobs by increasing American exports to \nAfrica by 200 percent in real dollars over the next ten years. This \nbroadly bipartisan legislation takes common sense steps. The bill would \ncoordinate the various U.S. Government export efforts aimed at Africa, \nmake sure our Foreign Service Officers have appropriate training on \nhelping U.S. companies understand new markets, and ensure that our \nDepartment of Commerce keeps a focus on Africa. And the bill makes a \nchange at the Export Import Bank--a bank which actually makes hundreds \nof millions of dollars in profits for the American taxpayer.\n  Our bill empowers the Export Import Bank to be more aggressive in \ncountering concessional--or below market--loans being offered by China \nand others to help their businesses crack into African markets.\n  You see this is a global economy and the competition from other \nnations and industry is fierce. Our government should be helping our \nbusinesses--and our workers--crack through to new markets where \nAmerican quality and standards are in high demand. This isn't corporate \nwelfare, it is smart business. It doesn't cost the American taxpayer \nanything--in fact it generates jobs and funding. These are all steps \nthat will get us closer to meeting President Obama's challenge.\n  We have another opportunity to help U.S. businesses export more by \nreauthorizing the Export-Import Bank that is set to expire at the end \nof this month. The Export-Import Bank makes loans to firms exporting \nAmerican-made products. These loans allow businesses--including a large \nnumber of small businesses--across the U.S. sell their goods to \nbusinesses all over the world. The Bank makes money off of these loans, \nmoney that is returned to the U.S. Treasury year after year. The bank \nhas a loan loss rate of less than 2 percent--a figure most banks would \nenvy.\n  It is estimated that the Export-Import Bank will return $359 million \nto the United States Treasury in fiscal year 2013 alone, and according \nto CBO the bank will return almost $1 billion over the next 5 years. \nThis money is used directly to reduce the deficit. The Export-Import \nBank is responsible for supporting 288,000 jobs at more than 2,700 U.S. \ncompanies. Mr. President, 113 of these companies are located in my home \nState of Illinois, and 80 of those are small businesses.\n  One of these companies is NOW Health Group in Bloomingdale, IL. This \ncompany is a natural food and supplement manufacturer with more than \n640 employees, 35 of which are supported by assistance from the Export-\nImport Bank. According to NOW's Chief Operating Officer Jim Emme, ``The \nflexibility in the payment terms we can offer through our Export Import \nBank policy has allowed us to grow our business in existing markets as \nwell as open new ones.'' NOW has grown its exports from 2 percent of \ntheir overall business to more than 10 percent. They could not have \ndone this without the Export Import bank. There are thousands of \nstories just like this all over the U.S.\n  The reauthorization increases the Bank's lending cap from $100 \nbillion to $140 billion and authorizes the Bank through 2014. \nLegislation reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank has received \noverwhelming bipartisan support in the past. Similar legislation \nreauthorizing the Bank received bipartisan support in the Banking \nCommittee and was reported out of Committee by a voice vote, and a \nsimilar Export-Import Bank reauthorization was introduced by a \nRepublican back in 2006 and passed the Senate by unanimous consent.\n  I hope we can come to an agreement soon to quickly pass a bill to \nreauthorize the Export Import Bank, a bill the House has already passed \nwith broad bipartisan support. This bill has support from labor \norganizations such as the AFL CIO and the Machinists as well as the \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers.\n  Mr. President, this is a bill that gives American corporations, large \nand small, a fighting chance to build the products here in America and \nsell them overseas, creating jobs right here at home. We live in a \nworld where China--most important China, but many other nations, have \ngovernment support for their businesses' exporting. This is our \ngovernment's support for our businesses to export. Boeing has its \nnational headquarters in Chicago and most of their manufacturing \noperations in the State of Washington. Boeing is competing with Airbus. \nAirbus is a product, a plane that is created by a conglomerate of \nEuropean nations which do their best to make sure that Airbus wins a \ncontract. I think it is not unfair that Boeing have the same \nopportunity, nor Caterpillar in my State, nor many businesses much \nsmaller.\n  So the Export-Import Bank reauthorization is a good idea. It will \ncreate jobs. The amendments being offered on the Republican side, by \nand large, limit the opportunities to help American businesses. I will \nbe resisting those amendments. I hope we can move to passage of this \nmeasure in a timely fashion.\n  I yield for Senator Lautenberg.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                      Confirming Judicial Nominees\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to join with my colleagues on \nthis side to urge our colleagues on the other side of the aisle to move \nquickly to confirm highly qualified judicial nominees. They passed \nreview by the Judiciary Committee. They passed all kinds of scrutiny.\n  We are on the verge of serious economic improvements. As that takes \nplace, we have a lot of parts to keep moving. We must do everything we \ncan to fill the positions that can help, directly and indirectly, to \nresolve disputes or problems, to help Americans across the country to \nfind work, stay in their homes, provide their children with health care \nand education. We have to cooperate on all fronts to accelerate the \npace of the recovery we see ahead of us.\n  One of the places both sides benefit is to keep our justice system \nmoving efficiently. People need to know they can get disputes resolved, \nhopefully quickly, but heard and decided. One of the things that looms \nlarge is the trial of those who are charged with felonious deeds, \ncriminal acts. Let's get those who are convicted finally punished if it \nis called for. But let's make sure that part of our judiciary \nfunctioning is moving as rapidly as it can be.\n  Property rights are at risk. Businesses need certainty about rights \nand responsibilities. Unfortunately, delays in confirming qualified \njudicial nominees who have passed the scrutiny of the Judiciary \nCommittee are threatening to grind the wheels of justice to a halt when \nthere are vacancies around. Nearly 1 in 11 judgeships across the \ncountry is awaiting the position to be filled. If these positions were \nphysicians, firemen, cops, and 1 out of 11, almost 10 percent of these \njobs, were not filled, we would do something as rapidly as we could to \nget them resolved. At this point in President George Bush's Presidency, \nthe Senate had confirmed 25 more judges than have been confirmed since \nPresident Obama took office. These are seriously needed nominees who \nhave been forced to wait nearly four times as long as the Bush nominees \nto be confirmed after being favorably reported, as I mentioned, by the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  As a result, the vacancy rate is nearly twice what it was at this \npoint in President Bush's first term. These vacancies are not some \nremote problems that only lawyers and academics care about. Judicial \nvacancies affect the ability of everyday Americans and businesses to \nsee justice served, and countless of them have had their cases delayed.\n  I am encouraged that we have been able to confirm a number of \nnominees lately, including two last evening. It is my hope that for the \ngood of the country we will pick up the pace in confirming nominees--\nparticularly as I see\n\n[[Page S3141]]\n\nit from our State's point of view. In our State of New Jersey we have \nthree distinguished nominees who have been approved by the Judiciary \nCommittee and are awaiting votes by the full Senate so they can get to \nwork fulfilling their obligation to dispense justice.\n  One of these people is magistrate judge Patty Shwartz, who has been \nnominated to serve on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. She passed \nwith flying colors with an examination of her background. She would be \nthe only woman from New Jersey serving as an active Third Circuit judge \nand only the second woman ever to represent New Jersey on that court. \nHer presence would tell women something important about our \nunderstanding of where women are in our society. Since 2003 Patty \nShwartz has served as a U.S. magistrate judge in the District of New \nJersey, where she has handled 4,000 criminal and civil cases. She spent \nalmost 14 years as an assistant U.S. attorney, supervising hundreds of \ncriminal cases, including civil rights, violent crime, drug \ntrafficking, and fraud cases.\n\n  I review her qualifications only to make the case that this is a \nperson eminently qualified to sit on the bench. We need her presence \nthere to move the volume of cases that are awaiting review, and she is \nbottled up here by reluctance on the other side. She passed the test. \nLet's let her go to work.\n  John Lacey, past president of the Association of the New Jersey \nFederal Bar, said that Judge Shwartz is ``thoughtful, intelligent, and \nhas an extraordinarily high level of common sense.''\n  Thomas Curtin, chairman of the Lawyers Advisory Committee for the \nU.S. District Court of New Jersey, said:\n\n       Every lawyer in the world will tell you that she's \n     extraordinarily qualified, a decent person, and an excellent \n     judge.\n\n  The American Bar Association clearly agrees. They gave her the \nhighest rating of unanimously ``well qualified.''\n  Judge Shwartz graduated from Rutgers University with the highest \nhonors. She received her law degree from the University of Pennsylvania \nLaw School, where she was editor of the Law Review and was named her \nclass's Outstanding Woman Law Graduate.\n  The two nominees for New Jersey's district court are similarly well \nqualified.\n  Kevin McNulty currently leads an appellate practice group in New \nJersey. He spent more than a decade in the U.S. Attorney's Office in \nNew Jersey, rising to the Deputy Chief of the Criminal Division and \nChief of the Appeals Division.\n  Mr. McNulty clerked for U.S. district judge Frederick B. Lacey after \nreceiving his law degree from New York University, where he was a \nmember of the Law Review, and his undergraduate degree came from Yale \nUniversity. He was named Lawyer of the Year in 2008 by the New Jersey \nLaw Journal, and the ABA rated him unanimously ``well qualified.'' I am \nconfident that his work as a judge will earn him similar praise.\n  Judge Michael Shipp, yet another appointee, has equally impressive \ncredentials. As a U.S. magistrate judge in the District of New Jersey \nsince 2007, he has conducted proceedings in both civil and criminal \ncases, including ruling on motions, issuing recommendations to district \ncourt judges, and performing district court judge duties in cases with \nmagistrate jurisdiction.\n  Judge Shipp previously worked in the New Jersey Attorney General's \nOffice as assistant attorney general in charge of consumer protection \nand then as counsel to the attorney general, where he ran a department \nof 10,000 employees.\n  He has also worked as a litigator at a distinguished law firm, \nSkadden Arps, and as a law clerk to New Jersey Supreme Court Justice \nJames Coleman, Jr.\n  Judge Shipp is a graduate of Rutgers University and Seton Hall \nUniversity Law School, where he continues to teach as an adjunct law \nprofessor--a position he has held for more than a decade.\n  I review the qualifications of these judges to remove any doubt about \nwhether they could do a good job. They can do a great job. Their \nbackgrounds say they are ready to go to work, and here we are, frankly, \nseeing them held up, in my view, unnecessarily. Let's get this behind \nus. There are things on which we can cross the aisle without invading \nthe province of the other Members, and I think we just ought to \ncooperate on judges. I think I can speak for the Democrats here that we \nwill cooperate. We will consider the judges who are presented from \ntheir side, but we want to just get going with judges altogether.\n  I thank Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley for moving these \nnominees through the Judiciary Committee, but now it is time to bring \nthem to the floor and confirm them. Judge Shwartz, Mr. McNulty, and \nJudge Shipp have brought honor to New Jersey and to our country, and \nthey deserve to be confirmed. More importantly, the American people \ndeserve to see these vacancies filled so the promise of justice for all \ncan truly be fulfilled.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I wish to continue to emphasize the \nremarks Senator Lautenberg made. I have not been here that long, but \nwhat I have seen happen in the last 2 or 3 years where judges appointed \nby the President of the United States are slow-walked or just ignored \nor blocked in this body is just outrageous.\n  In 2007, during my first month in office, I was presented with a \nRepublican judge, coming from a Republican President, approved by my \npredecessor, Senator DeWine, and my colleague, Senator Voinovich. I met \nwith her, talked with her, and I sent my approval to the Judiciary \nCommittee. She was confirmed in the second or third month I was here, \nbecause I believe the President of the United States should have the \nright to choose judges as long as they are qualified. That is why I ask \nthat we move forward on these judicial nominations.\n  In June 2010 U.S. district judge James Carr took senior status, \ncreating a vacancy in the Northern District Court in Toledo, OH. That \nmeans that Ohioans seeking criminal or civil justice have to wait, \nwhich creates a backlog of too many cases. That is what we have seen \nhappen.\n  In 2007 Senator Voinovich, a Republican, and I assembled a commission \nof distinguished Ohio lawyers to find the best candidate for the job. \nIt wasn't in 2007; it was later than that. In 2009 there was a \nPresident from a different party, so we updated the commission. This \ncommission, appointed by Senator Voinovich and myself, consisted of \nlegal professionals from the Southern District of the State to suggest \nnominations for the vacant judgeships for the Northern District of the \nState. We did the reverse, with lawyers from the north choosing for the \nSouthern District, to make sure there was not a conflict of interest. \nThis commission was very bipartisan. One of them had a Republican \nmajority, one of them had a Democratic majority.\n\n  Following Judge Carr's retirement, the commission made a selection. I \ninterviewed three nominees, sent those names to the President, and then \nthe President nominated Jeffery Helmick. Jeffery Helmick is a Toledo \nnative, a brilliant and distinguished lawyer who has earned the respect \nof his colleagues for doing his job well. Yet for nearly 2 years his \nnomination has languished. For nearly 2 years he has had to place his \ndefense practice and life on hold, awaiting Senate confirmation. This \nis no way to treat a public servant.\n  According to the U.S. Constitution, it is our job to confirm \nqualified nominees to serve on our Nation's highest court. But as of \nApril of 2012--Senator Lautenberg mentioned this, and Senator Nelson \nfrom Florida will in a moment--there are 81 judicial vacancies \nthroughout the United States. In my State of Ohio, the court is saying \nthere is a judicial emergency. The nonpartisan Administrative Office of \nthe Courts, the nonpartisan agency charged with running our Federal \ncourts, recently declared a judicial emergency for the Northern \nDistrict of Ohio.\n  Mr. Helmick has the enthusiastic support of all of the Federal judges \nin Toledo, including those appointed by Republican Presidents, was \nrecommended by a bipartisan process created by Senator Voinovich and \nme, and yet his nomination is still stuck even though there is a \njudicial emergency and even though he was approved in a bipartisan \nmanner by the Judiciary\n\n[[Page S3142]]\n\nCommittee. The result is that litigants in the Northern District are \nexperiencing delays in having their cases resolved. In too many cases, \njustice conferred--as the saying goes--can be just denied.\n  Our Nation's courts have been a beacon of hope--sometimes, not \nalways--for the vulnerable and the powerless, but this confirmation \ndelay clogs our courts, obstructs justice, and damages our democracy. \nMaybe some people are playing political games by slow-walking these \njudges. In the end, they might think it is cute, funny, and they might \nthink they gain politically from it, but it does obstruct justice, it \ndoes clog our courts, and it does damage our democracy. So it is not \ncute, it is not funny, and it is not worthy of any political gains in \nthis Chamber.\n  Jeffrey Helmick will make an outstanding judge on the U.S. District \nCourt for the Northern District of Ohio. We need to confirm him, and we \nneed to confirm him this month before Congress breaks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe time on the Democratic side be equally controlled by myself and \nSenator Levin.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. That would mean how many minutes?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 6\\1/2\\ minutes remaining \nfor the majority.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. For the total?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is correct.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Then I will speed up my remarks until I see \nSenator Levin come in.\n  Mr. President, I, too, wish to talk about the vacancies. There is no \nsense for all of this slow-walking. Fortunately in Florida we have a \nprocess that takes the politics out of the selection of judges. The two \nSenators appoint a judicial nominating commission of prominent people \nall over the State, and they do the interviews and they do the \nselections of at least three for each vacancy. Because they do this in \na nonpartisan way--notice what I said. I didn't say ``bipartisan,'' I \nsaid ``nonpartisan way,'' which is the way the selection of the \njudiciary ought to be done. Because they do that in a nonpartisan way, \nall three of the nominees who come to the two Senators--any one of them \ncan be a Federal judge because they are all so qualified.\n  Fortunately, with the agreement we have with the White House, the \nPresident can name whomever he wants. He agrees to accept the nominee \nand make his pick from among the three we send him if we approve all \nthree after the two Senators have, in fact, gone through and \ninterviewed them. So we have a process. Why should there be a delay on \njudges like that? There absolutely shouldn't.\n  For example, take one of our Federal judges. Judge Jordan was \nelevated by the President to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals \nunanimously out of the Judiciary Committee. At the end of the day, he \nwon on this Senate floor 94 to 5, but he was held up for 4 months. Why? \nThere is too much gamesmanship and partisanship in the process, and \nparticularly coming out of a State such as Florida where it is \nnonpartisan in the selection of judges.\n  We have two vacancies in the Southern District and two vacancies in \nthe Middle District of Florida right now. One of the judges is up on \nthe docket. Two others have just come through and had their hearing in \ncommittee. The fourth is being vetted by the White House. Let's go on \nand get approved these judges where there is no controversy.\n  I see my colleague from Michigan is here. I will turn the remainder \nof my time to him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Members of the Senate have a duty and \nobligation to carefully consider the votes we take on nominations to \nthe Federal courts. Our Constitution has established a judicial branch \nwith vitally important responsibilities and with considerable \nindependence from the other branches of government. The Founders were \nright to do so. They were also right to give this body a say on \nnominations to that independent branch. It is the one chance that the \npeople, through their elected representatives, have to influence the \nmakeup of the Federal courts.\n  I do not begrudge any Senator the right to carefully question \njudicial nominees, to carefully weigh their qualifications, and to \nexercise their best judgment as they exercise their responsibilities \nthat the Founders assigned to the Senate.\n  The question we must all answer is this: When do careful \nconsideration and the exercise of good judgment become damaging delay? \nFor just as we can fail to serve our constituents by failing to \nproperly scrutinize judicial nominees, we can fail to serve them by \nfailing to act on these nominations after there has been sufficient \ntime for the Judiciary Committee and the Senate to scrutinize them.\n  Today nearly 1 in 10 Federal judgeships is vacant. Roughly half of \nall Americans live in judicial districts or circuits in which the \nFederal courts have declared a judicial emergency, meaning according to \nthe standards established by the Supreme Court, residents face the \nprospect of unacceptable delays in having cases heard because vacancies \nhave led to a troubling backlog of cases.\n  It is a precept of Western judicial thought that justice delayed is \njustice denied; that even a correct verdict can be without justice if \nit comes too late to matter to the parties involved, especially if that \ndelay is not justified by the circumstances or the complexity of the \ncase.\n  The dangers for our Nation in these judicial emergencies are great: \nFirst, that Americans may be robbed of justice by unjustified delay; \nsecond, that Americans may come to doubt that the courts are capable of \ndispensing justice because they cannot function effectively; and, \nthird, that in seeking to clear the growing backlog of cases the courts \nmay rush to judgment and may fail to apply the rigor that Americans \nexpect and deserve.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to proceed for an \nadditional minute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Judiciary Committee has favorably reported 17 judicial \nnominations that are now awaiting votes on the floor of the Senate. \nThere is no question that the wait for many of the judicial nominees of \nPresident Obama has been unacceptable. Under the previous President, at \nthis point in his term the average district court nominee waited 22 \ndays from favorable report by the Judiciary Committee to Senate \nconfirmation. The average circuit court nominee waited 28 days.\n  By contrast, the average district court nominee under President Obama \nhas faced a wait of 97 days, and the average for circuit court nominees \nis 138 days. Yet the vast majority of these nominees are not \ncontroversial. They enjoy bipartisan support. We should move quickly to \nconfirm these nominees who have been receiving bipartisan backing, \nparticularly, and to review, debate, and act as expeditiously as we can \non the small number of nominations about which there is some debate.\n  There is a great deal of discussion about which party is to blame \nabout the ever-slower pace of judicial nominations. I have my own \nstrong beliefs on that question. Our constituents are best served not \nby arguing over blame, but by our exercise of the responsibility the \nConstitution bestows upon us. I simply ask all of my colleagues to \nconsider on each of these nominations the damage done by delay and \ninaction, and to carefully consider the threat to justice from the \ngrowing crisis of delay in our courts. We can and should act promptly \non the 17 nominees on the calendar.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to enter into a \ncolloquy with my Republican colleagues: Senators Kyl, Coburn, Isakson, \nand Heller for up to 30 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S3143]]\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues to talk \nabout something I think is an issue that without a solution will affect \nevery single aspect of life in our country. I am speaking about our \ndebt crisis, the impending fiscal cliff, and the lack of a budget to \naddress those issues. As I said, I am very pleased to be joined by my \ncolleagues to talk about this issue.\n  Unfortunately, for whatever reason, the Senate has lacked the will \nand the leadership to fulfill what I consider its most basic \nlegislative function: writing and adopting a budget resolution. That \nhas gone on for more than 3 years.\n  While I understand we are rapidly approaching the time where \nPresidential politics will consume the entire agenda, the U.S. national \ndebt is also rapidly approaching a significant milestone: $16 trillion \nworth of debt. We should look no further than Greece or Spain to see \nwhat this level of debt would do to an economy if it goes unchecked.\n  There are so many frightening statistics, but here is one: America's \nper capita national debt already significantly outpaces that of Greece \nor Spain. So as we watch them spiral further into crisis, we should be \njolted into action by the very suggestion that our debt is equally as \nalarming. Yet we are unable to pass a basic budget resolution to get \nour spending in check. That constitutes a lack of leadership.\n  As I said, I have many colleagues here today who can talk about a \nbetter approach. I would like to start today with Senator Johnny \nIsakson.\n  Senator Isakson has spent his career working on budget issues.\n  I say to Senator Isakson, what is the impact of no budget resolution \nfor 3 years? Is there a better way? Is there a better way to approach \nthe budgeting process than what we are dealing with now?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I thank the Senator from Nebraska for the question and \nfor his service. As a former Governor of the State of Nebraska, he \nknows full well the responsibility we have in terms of budgets. But I \nwill tell you what the impact of no budget for 3 years is, no \ndiscipline for 3 years. The result of no discipline for 3 years is we \nspend $10.4 trillion without a budget.\n  I do not know how good you are with your memory, I do not know how \ngood I am with mine, but if I do not have a budget or a guidepost to go \nby, and I am spending $10.4 trillion, I am making big mistakes. I am \nmaking big mistakes not with my money but with the money of the people \nof the United States of America.\n  Last night I did a telephone townhall back to Georgia. At one time we \nhad a little over 3,200 callers on the line. Question after question, \nwith a very simple question: How can you guys operate without a budget? \nWhy can't you get a budget? Why can't you bring a budget to the floor.\n  The fact is it is because our budget requirements cast out 10 years \nof planning for taxes, 10 years of planning for expenditures, 10 years \nof planning for the government. A lot of people just do not want us to \nknow what their plans are for the next 10 years.\n  But every American family in this county has had to sit around their \nkitchen table, reprioritize their expenditures, and budget what income \nthey have because of difficult economic times. The government should \nask of itself only what it forces upon all of its people.\n  I have a suggestion to consider, a suggestion that 20 of our 50 \nStates practice. Forty percent of our State governments now have a \nbiennial budget. It is a proposal that has been before this body for \nyears. I am proud to be the cosponsor with Senator Jeanne Shaheen from \nNew Hampshire. It is a budget process and a discipline that ends this \nno budget and also memorializes the most important thing we need to do \nand the least thing we do in this body; that is, oversight.\n  The biennial budget proposes we would do our budgeting in odd-\nnumbered years and our appropriating in odd-numbered years and do it \nfor a 2-year period rather than a 1-year period. Then, in the even-\nnumbered year--an election year--we would do oversight of spending. We \ndo not ever do any oversight.\n  The best oversight person in the Senate sits to my right. His name is \nTom Coburn. He is going to be the closing act in this colloquy. He is \ngoing to show some pictures that cast a lot more than 1,000 words about \nthe duplication of expenditures in this government, primarily because \nwe have no oversight and we have no discipline. We go back at \nappropriations year after year after year but never look at justifying \nwhat we spent in the year before.\n  So to the Senator from Nebraska, I say to the people of Georgia and \nthe people of the United States, I want to expect of myself and our \ngovernment at least what is mandated upon you. I want us to begin to be \naccountable for our spending and hold accountable those who spend that \nmoney. I want us to do our appropriations in a balanced way, in a \ndisciplined way, and never again go 1,000 days without a budget, never \nagain have $10.4 trillion of spending without a budget, never again \nlook the American people in the eye and say: I, as your government, am \nnot willing to do what you must do.\n  It is absolutely time we stop the redundancy, start prioritizing, and \nstart conducting oversight. When we do that, America will be better \noff, our fiscal policy will be better off, our debt and deficit will \ncome down, and we will return to those days all of us yearn for, with \nbetter prosperity and absolute accountability.\n  I thank the Senator from Nebraska for giving me the opportunity to \nexpound on the biennial budget.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Isakson.\n  Senator Isakson referenced my time as Governor of Nebraska. But I \nspeak on behalf of all Governors. The Governor has to deliver a budget. \nIn Nebraska, we used a 2-year budget, and that is what makes me proud \nto cosponsor the Senator's idea. It is the right approach. It simply \nsays we are going to do our very best to get a budget passed and do the \noversight necessary to make sure that budget is working.\n  So I compliment the Senator on his idea. It is definitely a better \nway forward.\n  Let me, if I might, now turn to Senator Kyl.\n  I say to Senator Kyl, when I was Governor I always had the first shot \nat delivering a budget. I would deliver it. I would do the State of the \nState Address. It was not that much different from the way it is done \nin Washington, with the President's February budget proposal. The State \nof the Union Address coincides with that.\n  With my budget--and I think most Governors would say this--even when \nthere was real arm wrestling with the legislative process, I always \nbelieved I would get about 90 to 95 percent of my budget proposals \nacross the finish line. It was a serious proposal. There were no \ngimmicks. It was a balanced budget. It did not borrow money to balance \nthe budget.\n  I say to the Senator, how do you regard the President's budget \nsubmission these last years, and why isn't it getting more support in a \nbipartisan sort of way?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I say to my colleague, first of all, I will \nrepeat what Senator Isakson said. As a Governor, you had to balance the \nbudget. You know how to do it. You understand the importance of it. I \nappreciate the Senator's work on this colloquy today in that regard.\n  I would note that my own State of Arizona just concluded its work on \na budget. It was hard. The Governor had her proposals. The State \nlegislature did its work. It was hard slogging because they had to make \ntough decisions, but they did. Just last week, they finished the budget \nin the legislative session.\n  Families have to do it, States have to do it, but here in the \nCongress now, under the Democratic control of the Senate, for 3 \nstraight years there has not been a budget.\n  As the Senator knows, however, the President submits a budget each \nyear. Last year, his budget was, frankly, met with derision from \npundits, from experts, and from economists who said it was not a \nserious proposal. I looked up the number. Last year his budget was \nrejected 97 to 0 in the Senate.\n  So what about this year? Well, the same thing. It was not a serious \neffort. It was a political document. Everybody could see it. So they \nput it to a vote in the House of Representatives. It was defeated 414 \nto 0. Not a single Democrat voted for the President's budget. They \nunderstood it was not serious.\n  Well, we will have an opportunity to vote on the President's budget \nagain\n\n[[Page S3144]]\n\nthis afternoon, and I expect the same fate. Why? Well, three quick \npoints.\n  First of all, it accelerates our path to national bankruptcy. It \nfails to address entitlement spending. It has a slew of job-killing tax \nhikes. And it does nothing to effectuate even the President's own \ndeficit reduction committee plan for reducing the deficit.\n  Just a couple of numbers: It contains a whopping $1.8 trillion tax \nhike on individuals, small businesses, investment, and family-owned \nfarms. Think about the job-killing nature, the wet blanket that puts \nover our economy--a $1.8 trillion tax hike. This comes on top of the \ntax hikes that are already embedded in ObamaCare, which will extract an \nadditional $4 trillion from the private sector by 2035 according to the \nJoint Economic Committee. Even with this tax hike, the President's \nbudget would increase deficits by nearly $6.4 trillion over the next \ndecade.\n  Now, you stop and think: Wait. Aren't the tax hikes supposed to be \nthere in order to balance the budget? Well, you would think so. But \nunder the President's budget, notwithstanding all of the new revenue \nfrom taxes, it increases the deficit by nearly $6.4 trillion, and it \nwould spend a staggering $45.4 trillion during the period of the \nbudget, which is $1.2 trillion higher than the Congressional Budget \nOffice baseline from last March.\n  I know these statistics are mind boggling, and I hate to cite them. \nBut you do need to back up what you are saying with the actual data. \nThat is the point. The President's budget is a job killer, it increases \ntaxes, and it still never balances.\n  I would point out that under his budget, while spending would reach \n23.5 percent of the economy this year, and never get below 22 percent \nof GDP over the next decade, the historical average is much lower: 20.8 \npercent of GDP.\n  So bottom line, the President's budget would lock in the fourth \nstraight year of deficits above $1 trillion, and even though the \nPresident--and here is what the President said--he promised to ``cut \nthe deficit in half by the end of my first term. . . . ''\n  Well, the President's budget would never balance notwithstanding the \nhuge tax increases. That is what is wrong with the President's budget. \nIt is why it is not going to pass today. It is why it did not pass last \nyear.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Very clearly this body is saying, the Senate and the \nHouse of Representatives, when they vote on the President's budget, \nthey are saying very clearly: The President's budget spends too much, \nit taxes too much, and it borrows too much. It does not solve any \nproblems.\n  I think actually that is the very clear unanimous message at this \npoint from these bodies. This is not a serious budget proposal.\n  Mr. KYL. If I could add one other item to what my colleague said, we \nall know the big problem is spending on entitlements, the so-called \nmandatory spending. Well, the only thing mandatory about it is that it \nhas to be spent unless we say something different. But we do not have \nthe courage around here to reform our entitlement programs to the point \nthat they are going to be available for at least our kids by the time \nthey retire, and in some cases they may not even be available for some \nof us.\n  The other thing I would want to say about the President's budget is \nit continues this glidepath to insolvency for Medicare, which the \nrecent Trustees Report says has an unfunded liability of $26.4 \ntrillion. So in addition to spending too much, taxing too much, and \nborrowing too much, it does not do anything about the biggest problem \nwe have, which is the broken entitlement programs that are not going to \nwork for the people who are currently anticipating they will be there \nfor them when they retire.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Senator Kyl makes an excellent point. If I could call on \nmy colleague, Senator Coburn, who, as much as any Member of the Senate, \nhas been the watchdog when it comes to spending and programs that \nduplicate each other, he has been the person who oftentimes has stood \non the Senate floor alone and pointed out to everybody how much waste \nthere is in the Federal Government.\n  Senator Coburn has been a great leader. He was on the fiscal \ncommission, a member of the original Gang of 6. I would like to hear \nhis views on the budgetary mess we find ourselves in now.\n  Mr. COBURN. Well, let me, first of all, I thank my colleague. I have \na couple of charts that are oversized. The reason they are oversized is \nbecause we cannot get it all on one chart. I would ask unanimous \nconsent to display those charts.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. What most people do not realize is the Federal Government \nis now twice the size it was in 2001. Think about that. We are spending \ntwice as much money as we did in 2001. As a matter of fact, if we go \nback 15 years, our deficit this year is bigger than what our entire \nbudget was. That is how out of control the Federal Government is.\n  There is a political reason we are not having a budget. Everybody \nunderstands that. Nobody is going to say that. The political reason no \nbudget was proposed and run through the Senate to create a conference \ncommittee with the House is because we do not want to make the hard \nchoices in an election year.\n  Budgets for families are about making hard choices, and yet here we \nare supposed to represent leadership in our country. We refuse to make \nhard choices about the direction.\n  I had the great opportunity to speak with some members in the War \nCollege class not long ago. We got into talking about budgets. They \nsaid: Do you realize how difficult it is for us to try to spend money \nwhen you send us a continuing resolution, and we do not know about it \nuntil 10 days before it is going to take effect, how difficult it is \nfor us to try to manage in a prudent way the money that the Federal \nGovernment spends when we have no budgetary guidelines? There is waste \nout the kazoo when you ask us to do that.\n  So regardless of the fact that there is a law that says we will pass \na budget, which has been totally ignored by the majority leader, the \nconsequences of that are tremendous. What most people talk about is how \ndo we get out of the problem. What I would put forward in terms of our \nbudget, there is not a problem in front of our country we cannot solve.\n  What we lack is leadership to pull us together as Americans to say: \nHere is the problem. Here are the solutions. Let's find a compromise in \nthe middle for the solution, and let's solve our problem. We have \nrefused to do that. But, most importantly, we refuse to look at \nourselves.\n  I have a couple of examples. The GAO put out its second annual \nreport--- the first one was last year, the second annual report this \nyear--in terms of duplicative programs. We have had amendments on this \nfloor fail routinely that said we ought to know what we are doing \nbefore we pass another bill. We ought to know what is already out \nthere. That has been rejected by my colleagues.\n  But I am going to show charts that show how ridiculous we are in \nterms of how we are well meaning but absolutely stupid in terms of how \nwe address problems that we perceive is the Federal Government's role.\n  The GAO put out a list of duplications. I am just going to read a few \nof them. I have given speeches on the floor on others, but there are \n209 different programs--209 different programs in the Federal \nGovernment for science, technology, engineering, and math initiatives \nfor our educational system. We spend $3 billion a year on that.\n  The overlap is unbelievable. Here is the chart that shows all of the \ndifferent programs with all of the different agencies involved, all of \nthem overlapping, most of the money wasted in terms of how we spend it \nbecause there is no concentration, there is no coordination, and what \nwe have is a ridiculous array--not that it is wrong to want to have \nmore science, more technology, more engineering, and more math \nstudents. But we are spending all the money on the bureaucracy when we \ncould have five programs: one for upper level, one for lower level, one \nfor minorities, one for disadvantaged, and one for others. Here is the \ncomplex. It is mind boggling how many programs we have, and there is \nnot a metric to measure whether any one of these is effective. That is \n$3 billion a year.\n  We could have one-tenth as many programs and spend one-half as much\n\n[[Page S3145]]\n\nmoney and have more students come out with science, technology, \nengineering, and math backgrounds. But we have decided to do it \npiecemeal and never do the oversight and never consolidate. If we \nwanted to get out of a $1 trillion deficit, we do it $1 billion at a \ntime, not do it with $1 trillion at a time.\n\n  The other program, which is even more difficult to ascertain, is in \nthe Department of Justice grants. Let me go through those just for a \nsecond. There are 253 duplicative programs in the Department of \nJustice. We spend a total of $3.9 billion a year, and here is what the \nGAO tells us. People who apply for one grant in DOJ--for one thing--\nturn around and apply for it somewhere else for exactly the same thing. \nThe Department of Justice does not know they just gave them two grants \nfor exactly the same thing because there are so many different grant \nprograms and nobody is watching the store.\n  So the point is nobody would run their household this way. No \nbusiness would operate this way. States that are successful do not \noperate this way. The reason we do this is because we do not have a \nbudget and we do not have any oversight and we are not minding the \nstore. The way to change what is coming for our country is to start \ndoing everything that is necessary to address the problem.\n  And the problem is this: We are spending money we do not have on \nthings we do not need, and nobody in Congress wants to do the hard work \nof ferreting out what works and what does not and making the hard \nchoices because every one of these programs has a constituency.\n  So the parochialism and the constituency and short-term thinking we \nare now bound up in keeps us from saving ourselves. Last quote, and I \nwill finish with this: John Adams said, ``There has yet to be a \ndemocracy that did not murder itself.'' We are on that way if we do not \nchange direction. It is not a Democrat-Republican problem. It is all \nour problem. It will not matter what our political persuasion is when \nwe face the very difficult coming times if we do not respond with a \ncogent budget for this country.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. I thank the Senator. We look at those charts and reach \nthe conclusion, inescapably, if we do not start doing oversight and \nstart figuring this out, we are not going to solve this problem. My \ncolleague's reputation as a watchdog of the Federal Government is well \nearned.\n  Let me now turn to my colleague, Senator Heller. Senator Heller \nbrings great experience. He might be the newest Member of the Senate--I \nthink he is--but he has great experience on the House side. He has seen \nhow the budget process works there. He now has some experience on the \nSenate side. The Senator sees the lack of a budget process.\n  I would like him to offer some thoughts on what is broken and what we \nmight do to fix this.\n  Mr. HELLER. I thank the Senator from Nebraska for yielding time and \nalso those from Oklahoma and Arizona for this colloquy that we are \nhaving today and the ability to talk about issues that, frankly, the \nother side will not talk about--in fact, their conspicuous absence \ntoday on the other side is clear of the depth of their budget.\n  As we have heard, we have not had a budget for the last 3 years. So I \nrise today in support of a serious debate concerning the direction of \nour Nation. Three years have passed since Congress adopted a binding \nbudget resolution. In this light, I respectfully submit that the \nAmerican people do not believe that today's debate is serious. They \nknow the Senate is not going to adopt a budget; once again it will \nignore one of the most basic and important jobs of Congress.\n  What the Senate is doing this week could be considered political \ncomedy if the stakes were not so high. In fact, the fact is this is not \na serious discussion.\n  In May of last year, the majority leader stated: There is no need to \nhave a Democratic budget, in my opinion. It would be foolish for us to \ndo a budget at this stage. As early as February of this year, it was \nstated by the majority leader that there is no need to bring a budget \nto the Senate floor this year.\n  If that is the case, this week's debate is nothing more than a \npolitical sideshow, and the American people are tired of it. Ever \nwonder why the approval rating of Congress is so low? They hate \nWashington because it spends its time on stunts like this instead of \nworking together for the good of the country; pushing votes for \ncampaign press releases instead of solving problems.\n  The bottom line is if Congress does not do its job, then its Members \nshould not get paid. That is exactly what I have proposed with the No \nBudget, No Pay Act. The American people know in an election year too \nmany of their representatives in Washington are afraid of the tough \nchoices that would help get our Nation on a path of fiscal sanity.\n  Most of the people watching the so-called budget debate will witness \nexactly what they have come to expect from Washington: the Republicans \nblaming Democrats, Democrats blaming Republicans. At the end of the \nday, all we will have accomplished is filling another page in the \nCongressional Record.\n  Unfortunately, Americans will face the same fiscal disasters they did \nbefore this debate. Unless we change course, Federal spending per \nhousehold is projected to rise to $34,602 by the year 2022, a 15-\npercent increase in one decade.\n  The government's own actuaries tell us Medicare is going bankrupt in \n10 years, Social Security one decade later. Both sides should be \nwilling to come together to strengthen and preserve these programs for \nfuture generations instead of simply ignoring the problems because it \nis inconvenient in an election year.\n  Our national debt will reach $16 trillion before the end of the year. \nThe Federal Government's unfunded obligations will total some $100 \ntrillion. Yet there will be no budget this year, just like there has \nbeen no budget for the past 3 years. We cannot look beyond the beltway \nand say this failure of leadership has not had tremendous impact on the \npeople we represent.\n  National unemployment has registered above 8 percent for the last 38 \nmonths. Nevada has led the Nation in unemployment for more than 2 \nyears. Almost everyone I speak to in Nevada--businesses, job creators, \nelected officials, and families--speaks of the uncertainty that has \ncharacterized their lives in this economy.\n  We are not moving forward as a Nation, and it is no surprise to these \nno-nonsense folks. They know from everyday life in their businesses and \nin their households that you cannot move forward without a plan. When \nAmericans look to Washington, they see no meaningful proposal, no \nviable plan, and no progress.\n  There are those who claim the Budget Control Act is a budget, and I \nstrongly disagree. This bill does not establish priorities or a path \nforward for our Nation as a real budget should. It does not provide \ncertainty, nor does it address many of the pressing fiscal problems we \nhave today. If the Budget Control Act were truly a budget, there would \nbe no need for this discussion today. It is past time for Congress to \nhold itself accountable.\n  That is why I have advocated my No Budget, No Pay Act for nearly a \nyear. My legislation calls on the House and Senate to pass a concurrent \nbudget resolution and the regular appropriations bills before the \nbeginning of each fiscal year. Failure to do so would result in the \nloss of pay until we take our jobs seriously and make these bills our \nlegislative priority.\n  The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 already requires Congress to \npass a budget by April 15. My bill creates an enforcement mechanism to \nfurther encourage Members of Congress to do their constitutional duty.\n  I have spoken on this floor previously about No Budget, No Pay, but I \nbelieve now is the time to consider whether we are willing to make this \npromise to our constituents. I believe it is more important now than \never because the American people are increasingly losing confidence in \nCongress and its ability to deliver solutions.\n  No Budget, No Pay is not a silver-bullet solution to our Nation's \nfiscal challenges, but it would indicate that we are hearing the \nconcerns of the American people and are willing to participate in the \ndialog necessary to get our country moving again.\n\n[[Page S3146]]\n\n  I am pleased that 10 of my Senate colleagues have cosponsored this \nimportant effort, and others have expressed support for No Budget, No \nPay on the Senate floor. I am especially grateful to Senators Lieberman \nand Collins for holding a hearing to discuss No Budget, No Pay as a \nmeaningful proposal that would help hold Congress accountable to the \nAmerican people. This bipartisan bicameral proposal is worthy of the \nSenate's time if we are serious about regaining the trust of the \nAmerican people whom we are supposed to be representing.\n  My colleagues, our Nation can literally no longer afford to survive \non sound bites and press releases about the importance of budgeting. We \nneed to engage in the serious business of budgeting for our Nation's \nfuture. That work should start today. Sadly, I simply don't believe we \nwill make the tough choices necessary until Members of Congress have \nmore skin in the game. I will continue calling for the adoption of the \nNo Budget, No Pay Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The Republican time has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate agrees to \nthe motion to proceed to H.R. 2072, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2072) to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank of \n     the United States, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nhours of debate equally divided between the two leaders or their \ndesignees.\n  The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2100\n\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we move to \namendment No. 2100 to H.R. 2072.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Lee] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2100.\n\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To phase out the authority of the Export-Import Bank of the \n  United States and to require the President to initiate negotiations \nwith other major exporting countries to end subsidized export financing \n                               programs)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. TERMINATION OF EXPORT-IMPORT BANK OF THE UNITED \n                   STATES.\n\n       (a) One-year Extension of Authority.--Notwithstanding any \n     other provision of this Act or any other provision of law, \n     the authority of the Export-Import Bank of the United States \n     under section 7 of the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 (12 \n     U.S.C. 635f) terminates on May 31, 2013.\n       (b) Termination of Authority.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this Act or any other provision of law, on and \n     after June 1, 2013--\n       (1) the Export-Import Bank of the United States may not \n     enter into any new agreement for the provision of a loan, a \n     loan guarantee, or insurance, the extension of credit, or any \n     other form of financing;\n       (2) the Bank shall continue to operate only to the extent \n     necessary to fulfill the obligations of the Bank pursuant to \n     agreements described in paragraph (1) entered into before \n     June 1, 2013; and\n       (3) the President of the Bank shall take such measures as \n     are necessary to wind up the affairs of the Bank, including \n     by reducing the operations of the Bank and the number of \n     employees of the Bank as the number of remaining agreements \n     described in paragraph (1) decreases.\n       (c) Repeal of Export-Import Bank Act of 1945.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act or any other \n     provision of law, effective on the date on which the Export-\n     Import Bank of the United States has fulfilled all \n     outstanding obligations of the Bank pursuant to agreements \n     described in subsection (b)(1) entered into before June 1, \n     2013, the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 (12 U.S.C. 635 et \n     seq.) is repealed.\n\n     SEC. __. NEGOTIATIONS TO END EXPORT CREDIT FINANCING.\n\n       (a) In General.--The President shall initiate and pursue \n     negotiations with other major exporting countries, including \n     members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and \n     Development and countries that are not members of that \n     Organisation, to end subsidized export financing programs and \n     other forms of export subsidies.\n       (b) Report Required.--Not later than 180 days after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, \n     the President shall submit to the Committee on Banking, \n     Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on \n     Financial Services of the House of Representatives a report \n     on the progress of the negotiations described in subsection \n     (a) until the President certifies in writing to those \n     committees that all countries that support subsidized export \n     financing programs have agreed to end the support.\n\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, it is time that we wind down the Export-\nImport Bank. My amendment, No. 2100, would do precisely that. The \nAmerican people cannot be the world's financial backstop. The \ngovernment should not be picking winners and losers. Businesses in Utah \nand across the country are not receiving government help and are \nshutting their doors after decades of serving their communities. We \nshould not, through this government, be adding insult to injury by \nusing the tax money they contributed to prop up companies overseas.\n  We need to end the corporate welfare that distorts the market and \nfeeds crony capitalism. The corporations that largely benefit from the \nEx-Im Bank should have no trouble marshaling their resources to compete \nin today's economy. If they are struggling, then they are most likely \nnot deserving of taxpayer help; and if they are turning billions in \nprofit, then they clearly do not need taxpayer-subsidized loans.\n  Further, government subsidies breed undue favoritism from government \nbureaucrats who control where the money goes. Unless we want more \nSolyndras, we should end the practice immediately.\n  Some have suggested that the Ex-Im Bank is good for businesses. What \nis best for American businesses is getting the Federal Government out \nof their way, letting them operate without burdensome government \nregulations and without a complex tax system.\n  Having the government pick winners and losers does not make \nindustries stronger, it makes them more dependent on subsidies. When \ngovernment is picking who wins, the loser is always the taxpayer.\n  We have an opportunity today to reverse the status quo and defend the \nAmerican taxpayer. My amendment winds down the Ex-Im Bank. I urge my \ncolleagues to support amendment No. 2100.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues in \nthe Senate to pass the Export-Import Bank legislation now before us. \nThis debate this morning is about jobs, it is about manufacturing jobs, \nand it is about U.S. manufacturing jobs. That is because this bank is \none of the most powerful tools we have for manufacturing jobs in \nAmerica.\n  This is a debate about whether the Members in this Chamber believe \naccess to financing is a key tool for U.S. companies to compete on an \ninternational basis when they are trying to get U.S. manufactured \nproducts sold overseas. In fiscal year 2011 alone, the bank supported \nnearly 290,000 export-created jobs in America. Those are the jobs that \nare going to be threatened if the Senate does not act.\n  This authority expires on May 31. That is right, 16 days from now. \nAnd between now and then, the House is in session for only 5 days, so \nwe can't afford to take this to the brink one more time with amendments \npassed by the Senate that are gutting amendments. These five amendments \nthat will be considered would basically lapse the bank's authority and \nthis would put into the debate more uncertainty about our economy.\n  We need to act now to renew the bank's charter, and businesses can't \nwait. They need the planning and certainty to hire more people. Failing \nto act will stifle U.S. economic opportunity. That is why nearly two \ndozen Governors, Democrats and Republicans alike, have urged the bank's \nextension, and so has the Chamber of Commerce, the National Association \nof Manufacturers, and the Small Business Association.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na\n\n[[Page S3147]]\n\nchart reflecting the jobs supported in each State by Ex-Im financing so \nthat Members, if they wish to, can come and look at both the revenue \nthat was generated and the jobs that were supported.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         JOBS SUPPORTED THROUGH EX-IM FINANCING BY STATE, FY2011\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n

Mr. President, the default rate on the bank is \nconsistently less than 2 percent lower than most commercial lending. I \nam sure we will hear a lot about that during the debate today. But \nsince 2005, the Export-Import Bank has returned $3.7 billion to the \nU.S. Treasury, above and beyond the cost of operation. So, yes, my \ncolleagues, this is actually something that is making money for the \nFederal Government. Not only is it helping U.S. manufacturers sell \ntheir products overseas--financing in a way I think is equivalent to \nwhat the Small Business Administration does; helping to provide a \ncertain level of financing that makes deals come through--I think it is \nwhy we find banks are supportive.\n  The money comes back into U.S. taxpayers' pockets and it supports our \nwinning in a global situation by getting our products sold. It has been \nincredibly helpful to our economy, with zero cost to the taxpayers, \nand, in fact, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office concluded a \n4-year reauthorization of the bank would reduce the deficit by up to \n$900 million over 5 years. So the bank works for businesses and it \nworks for U.S. taxpayers.\n  There is a compromise that is before us. I know it may not be the \ncompromise that I or the Senator from South Carolina--who I see is on \nthe floor--would have written into the legislation, but nonetheless it \nis a compromise and it is time to act. The reason I say that is because \nso many States also are counting on the Export-Import Bank, just as \nWashington State is.\n  Pennsylvania, for example, has over $1.4 billion in exports and 9,800 \njobs related to the Export-Import Bank; Massachusetts, with $566 \nmillion. This is from the annual report of the Ex-Im Bank in 2011. So \nthey had $566 million of economic revenue generated in Massachusetts \nand over 4,000 jobs. Why? Because we helped Massachusetts exporters get \naccess to capital so they could sell their products overseas and win in \nthe international marketplace. Texas, another example, with $4.9 \nbillion in exports, and 35,274 jobs.\n  These are jobs America needs. This is a global economy in which \nAmerica needs to be able to compete, and getting access to capital so \nthat products can be sold is a critically important issue.\n  Florida, another great example of the support of the Ex-Im Bank, had \n$1.1 billion in exports and over 7,643 jobs. So that State has been \nanother big winner; the State of North Carolina, $456 million in \nexports and 3,309 jobs; and Ohio, another example of manufacturers and \nbusinesses, with $398 million in exports and 2,888 jobs.\n  While there are many people who would like to say this program should \nbe discontinued--and I am sure some of my colleagues are not in favor \nof it because there are many programs they wish to get rid of--I would \nsay this is a program that is good for the U.S. taxpayers. The Ex-Im \nBank has generated $3.7 billion for U.S. taxpayers since 2005.\n  Again, what is this debate about? The underlying amendments my \ncolleagues are offering are trying to gut the Ex-Im Bank. They simply \ndon't like it, and they want to get rid of it or say it is not a viable \ntool. I guess because one in four jobs in Washington State is based on \ntrade, I know how critically important it is. Whether we are talking \nabout agricultural products or selling airplanes or selling music \nstands, as one company we saw, or selling grain silos, companies need \nto be able to compete in the international marketplace and they need to \nbe able to get sales for their products. This has been a very viable \nand important tool for them.\n  Some of my colleagues have previously raised concerns about the \nbank's transparency and oversight, and these concerns have been heard \nand addressed in this legislation. I wish to talk about the five ways \nthis new compromise bill addresses those concerns.\n  There is more oversight. Under the amended bill, we would have a \nquarterly report on its default rate, and the first of these reports \nwould be due September of this year. The bank has historically \nmaintained a low default rate of less than 2 percent, but under this \nprovision, if the default rate reaches 2 percent or higher, the bank \nwill have to develop a plan to fix the problem and report to Congress \nwithin 1 month. If the default rate stays above 2 percent for more than \n6 months, they will be subject to a review of an independent auditor.\n  These are very viable and important additions to the legislation. Not \nonly would the auditor be there to help fix what was going on, he would \nhave the oversight for anything that was involved with the bank they \nneeded to report on. So there is less risk.\n  The second change to the underlying bill is the Government \nAccountability Office must study and report back to the bank safeguards \nthat prevent it from taking loans that are too risky. Again, since the \nbank has had a historically low default rate, we are happy to add this \nlanguage, but it is another layer of protection on something that is \nperforming and performing well. But as I say, we are happy to add that \nto the legislation.\n  More public input. The bank will have to open a public comment period \nfor transactions greater than $100 million and it will have to notify \nCongress about these transactions so there is more transparency on what \nsome consider the bigger financial loans in which the bank is involved.\n  Fourth, we have added more accountability. There is an annual report \nwhere the bank has to justify the need of every transaction--every \ntransaction. That way the public will know if the bank has acted \nbecause a private lender would not have or if it acted in response to \nforeign export credit agencies.\n  And then fifth, the Treasury must engage nations in discussions about \nthe need for export financing worldwide. I know some of my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle would hope the President would end all \nexport financing and leave that discussion at the World Trade \nOrganization. But I would ask my colleagues, what is the difference \nbetween this and the Small Business Administration that provides an \nopportunity, a bridging of capital between small businesses and the \nopportunities to join with private financing to make deals happen.\n  As I said earlier, I live in a State where we know how beneficial \nexport markets are to our products--whether we are speaking of cherries \nor apples or\n\n[[Page S3148]]\n\nairplanes or a variety of new technologies--and these products are \nwinning the day in the international marketplace. They are also \ncreating jobs. So for my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who \nwish to end this program or say it ought to be ended on an \ninternational basis, we are happy to hear what the world community \nwants to debate and discuss on this basis, but I would ask why, in the \nmoment of crisis in our financial institutions, when one of the \nsupposedly most risk-averse institutions can't figure out why it lost \n$2 billion, would we want small businesses across America to pay the \nprice for the fact they can't get financing of their products sold in \nan international marketplace? We have to wake up and understand this is \nabout helping small businesses and helping them win the day for \nproducts that are created in the United States--created in the United \nStates and sold abroad.\n  This compromise legislation that is offered today is the best path \nforward. These amendments are an attempt to gut the underlying bill and \nto stop the authorization of the bank and have it curtailed. As I said, \nwe only have about 5 legislative days, given the House's schedule, to \nget this done. Some of my colleagues want to tell all those businesses \nI mentioned in all those States--Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida, and \nothers--that we don't know anymore whether this program exists and so \nlet's actually stop the funding and lose jobs.\n  I know there are people in my State--such as Lawrence Stone from \nSCAFCO or Bill Perdue from Sonico--who gave me the message the American \npeople want us to focus on creating jobs and supporting businesses. \nThey want a program like this to continue and they want the jobs it \ncreates for their communities.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I will gladly yield and let Senator Corker \ngo ahead of me--I understand the Senator has an amendment to offer--\nwith the understanding I be allowed to speak for 5 minutes after he is \ndone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2102\n\n  Mr. CORKER. I thank the Senator from South Carolina and certainly the \nSenator from Washington State. I want to say I put my credentials for \nsupporting exports up against anybody here, and I think the purpose of \nour being in this body is to try to create good policies.\n  I have an amendment I wish to call up. It is amendment No. 2102, \nwhich is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Corker] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2102.\n\n  Mr. CORKER. I ask unanimous consent to dispense with the reading of \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To require the Export-Import Bank of the United States to \n  provide financing only for transactions subsidized by export credit \n agencies of other countries or for which private sector financing is \n   unavailable or prohibitively expensive and to require the Bank to \n  maintain a ratio of capital to the outstanding principal balance of \n         loans and loan guarantees of not less than 10 percent)\n\n       Strike section 25 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 25. LIMITATION ON FINANCING BY THE EXPORT-IMPORT BANK OF \n                   THE UNITED STATES TO TRANSACTIONS SUBSIDIZED BY \n                   OTHER COUNTRIES OR FOR WHICH PRIVATE SECTOR \n                   FINANCING IS UNAVAILABLE OR PROHIBITIVELY \n                   EXPENSIVE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any provision of the \n     Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 (12 U.S.C. 635 et seq.) or any \n     other provision of law, the Export-Import Bank of the United \n     States may not provide any financing (including any \n     guarantee, insurance, or extension of credit, or \n     participation in any extension of credit) for the exportation \n     of any article unless the Bank certifies to Congress in \n     writing that--\n       (1) an export credit agency of a foreign country is \n     providing financing for the exportation of a substantially \n     similar article from that country; or\n       (2) private sector financing for the exportation of the \n     article is not available or is prohibitively expensive.\n       (b) Additional Information Required.--If the Export-Import \n     Bank of the United States certifies under subsection (a)(2) \n     that private sector financing for the exportation of an \n     article is not available or is prohibitively expensive, the \n     Bank shall also include in the certification the following:\n       (1) An explanation of why private sector financing is not \n     available or is prohibitively expensive.\n       (2) An explanation of how financing by the Bank for the \n     exportation of the article does not put the United States at \n     a substantial risk of loss.\n       (3) If private sector financing is available but \n     prohibitively expensive, an assessment of the difference \n     between the cost of private sector financing and the cost of \n     financing provided by the Bank.\n       (c) Report on Regulatory Barriers.--For any transaction \n     relating to the exportation of an article financed by the \n     Export-Import Bank of the United States after certifying \n     under subsection (a)(2) that private sector financing is \n     unavailable, the Secretary of the Treasury shall submit to \n     Congress a report that--\n       (1) assesses the extent to which private sector financing \n     is unavailable as a result of excessive regulation of \n     domestic financial institutions by the Federal Government or \n     the obligations of the United States under international \n     agreements relating to risk management by financial \n     institutions; and\n       (2) makes recommendations for eliminating the barriers to \n     private sector financing identified under paragraph (1).\n\n     SEC. 26. CAPITAL RATIO REQUIREMENT FOR THE EXPORT-IMPORT BANK \n                   OF THE UNITED STATES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, the Export-Import Bank of the United States shall \n     maintain a capital ratio of not less than 10 percent.\n       (b) Capital Ratio Defined.--In this section, the term \n     ``capital ratio'' means the ratio of the capital of the \n     Export-Import Bank of the United States to the total \n     outstanding principal balance of all loans made or guaranteed \n     by the Bank.\n\n     SEC. 27. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       Except as provided in section 9(b), this Act and the \n     amendments made by this Act shall take effect on the earlier \n     of June 1, 2012, or the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I will be very brief. Again, this \namendment is very simple and it does two things I would think the \nSenator from Washington especially would support, after all we have \ngone through, and especially after her alluding to some of the most \nrecent developments in the financial system. I hope this amendment will \nreceive broad support in this body.\n  The Ex-Im Bank is set up to finance transactions that cannot be \nfinanced in the private sector. That is the purpose for its existence. \nSo, No. 1, what this amendment will do is to cause the Ex-Im Bank to \ncertify there is no private sector financing--or at least no private \nsector financing at a reasonable cost--before any loan goes through the \nEx-Im Bank.\n  The second piece I think is very important. The way the Ex-Im Bank is \nset up right now, there are no capital requirements. The Senator from \nWashington was just talking about something that happened at JPMorgan. \nFortunately, we have put in place since the financial crisis very \nstrong capital requirements at our financial institutions, and what \nthat has done is to make them healthy and to cause them to be able to \nwithstand things that may happen as relates to default rates or other \nfailures.\n  The Ex-Im Bank, believe it or not, is set up to finance things that \nno other bank will finance, and yet it has no capital requirements \nother than having to maintain $1 billion. So they are able to loan, per \nthis new legislation, $140 billion but they only have to have $1 \nbillion in capital reserves, which means you are creating with this \nmechanism 140-to-1 leverage ratios.\n  What we have gone through with our entire financial system is a \nprocess to make sure we have adequate capital. What our amendment does \nis to require that the Ex-Im Bank adhere to the normal sound financial \npractices we want our financial institutions across our country to \nadhere to by establishing a 10-percent capital base.\n  Again, I think this is a very goodgovernment amendment. We don't want \nto see the same happen with Ex-Im Bank that we have seen happen with \nFannie, with Freddie, with so many of our institutions in this country \nthat did not have proper capital reserves.\n  I urge strong support for this amendment which will make the Ex-Im \nBank something that ensures--or hopefully helps ensure--that our U.S. \ntaxpayers are never in a situation where we have to come to the aid of \nthis institution because it hasn't reserved properly, it doesn't have \nthe proper capital standards in place, that I think people in\n\n[[Page S3149]]\n\nthis body on both sides of the aisle have overwhelmingly supported for \nthe private sector.\n  I would hate to see us be in a situation where we want to create \nsomething in government that risks taxpayers' money, when we have just \ngone through a process of understanding that it is very important for \nthe financial institutions of our country to have appropriate capital \nstandards. Here we are getting ready to pass legislation on this floor \nwhich, I am sorry, has almost no capital standards in place because you \nonly have to have $1 billion--that is all--at the Ex-Im Bank, $1 \nbillion against a $140 billion loan base. I think anybody here thinking \nabout this understands those standards are not nearly appropriate, and \nI hope this amendment will receive overwhelming support.\n  It is my sense that if we pass this, the House would easily pass \nthis. Contrary to what the Senator from Washington was saying, I think \nthis would make the legislation better and, my sense is, receive \noverwhelming support in the House if added to it.\n  I yield the floor, and I thank the Senator from South Carolina for \nhis tremendous courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise in support of the compromise that \nwas outlined by Senator Cantwell.\n  Basically, 6 years ago the Congress of the United States by voice \nvote reauthorized the Export-Import Bank. If you are in business, like \nBoeing and GE, and thousands of other companies out there that are \nmaking products in the United States and selling them overseas, the \nidea that the Congress would, by voice vote, reauthorize the bank had \nto make you believe that this model of doing business would be made \navailable to you. Here we are, later down the road, a lot of concern \nabout the bank, and some people actually want to do away with it.\n  I understand free markets pretty well, and I would love to live in a \nworld where no country interfered in the marketplace at all and the \nbest products would win based on a level playing field. But why do we \nhave the Export-Import Bank? It is about 70 years old. There is a long \nrecord here. Products made in America and sold overseas--sometimes \nbecause of the volatile nature of the region in question traditional \nbanks won't lend money. What happened is about 70 years ago we created \na bank to help us export products, and that bank, the Export-Import \nBank, as Senator Cantwell said, makes money, doesn't lose money, and it \nhas been a sound way to get American-made products into the \ninternational marketplace.\n  Here is the reality: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain, \nBrazil, China, and India all have export banks of their own. The G 7 \ncountries we competed against between 2006 and 2010 doubled the amount \nof ex-im financing available in their countries. This is what American \nbusinesses are competing against.\n  Our good friend up North, Canada, is one-tenth our size. The Canadian \nEx-Im Bank did $100 billion worth of financing for Canadian-made \nproducts last year, compared to $32 billion in support of American \nmanufacturers.\n  The only area of our economy that has been strong lately is exports. \nSo imagine this: America does away with the Export-Import Bank. All of \nthe countries I just described have their banks available to their \nmanufacturers. Boeing makes planes in Washington and in South Carolina. \nEight out of ten planes being manufactured in Charleston, SC, by \nBoeing, the 787s, are sold based on export-import financing, 8 out of \n10. That is why they needed a second line of production. They are \ncompeting against Airbus. France has three Export-Import Banks. China's \nExport-Import Bank is larger than those of the United States, Germany, \nCanada, and Britain combined.\n  It is one thing to do reform; it is another to unilaterally \nsurrender. It is one thing to lead the world; it is another to put the \npeople who make products in America at risk unnecessarily. The \nlegislation in the House did compel the President, the Department of \nCommerce, and Treasury to try to get these Export-Import Banks wound \ndown over time. If we could do that, great, because I think the \nAmerican workers and the American companies can compete anywhere in the \nworld on a level playing field. At the end of the day, this is about \nwhether we are going to unilaterally surrender. We are weeks away.\n  Senator Corker has a good amendment, a decent amendment, but it \ndoesn't quite get us to where we need to be at this late hour. One part \nof this amendment is that you can't make a loan under the Export-Import \nBank until the company proves that the other countries in question are \nnot offering loans in that area. That is pretty hard to do when \ncountries such as China are not very transparent.\n  This amendment is billed as good government, and I know his \nmotivations are sound. He is not ideologically against the bank. But at \nthis late hour, it will bring the legislation down. And, quite frankly, \nthe second prong of what he is proposing I think is a real burden to \nput on American businesses at a time when it is hard enough already to \ncreate jobs in America.\n  To those who want to end the bank without other countries doing so, I \nthink you would be doing a great disservice to people in this country \nwho are selling products overseas. In my State alone, you would be \ndestroying the ability of Boeing Company to grow in South Carolina. GE \nmakes gas turbines in Greenville, SC. One-third of those turbines made \nin Greenville are sold through ex-im financing. If you can get the \nother parts of the world to do this, count me in. Until we do it \ntogether, I am going to allow this bank to stay in business because it \nmakes money, it doesn't lose money. There is a difference between \nleading the world and putting your companies at risk in a world based \non reality, and the reality is that export-import financing by our \ncompetitive nations is growing, it is not being reduced.\n  This bill that passed the House was 330 votes. We live in a time in \nCongress where you can hardly declare Sunday as a holiday, but 330 \nMembers of the House voted to extend this bank for 3 years with \nreforms. Count me in the reform camp.\n\n  Some people say this bank has kind of gotten out of its lane and is \nmaking loans that are not traditionally export-import loans. I agree \nwith that. Some say the bank is not transparent enough. I agree with \nthat. The bottom line is it has been reformed; not as much as some \nwould wish, but it definitely has been reformed.\n  Sixty-two percent of the Republican Conference in the House voted to \nreauthorize this, so I want to acknowledge Representative Cantor, \nRepresentative Hoyer, Tim Scott, and my delegation, who have tried to \nbring about reform. At the end of the day, the Senate now is receiving \na product that went through the House, a lot of giving and taking. They \nproduced a compromise, as Senator Cantwell said, that would be \ndifferent than I would have written, but it truly is reform. It allows \na 3-year extension of the bank at $140 billion with reforms that are, \nquite frankly, I think common sense, and 62 percent of the House \nRepublicans supported this. The tea party was split.\n  At the end of the day we have a decision to make as a Senate: Are we \ngoing to allow this bank to fail, or are we going to allow the bank to \nstay in business under a new way of doing business? I think it would be \na travesty and a detrimental event to the economy of this country if \nthis bank were to go out of business and the banks of everybody we \ncompete with are doubling in size. If you want to grow the footprint in \nAmerica of selling products made in America overseas, this bank has a \nniche. Where you cannot find traditional financing, this bank allows \nAmerican products to be sold, and I think it is a very sound business \npractice. The bank is making money.\n  The bank has been around for 70 years and there are no subprime \nmortgages here. This is about selling American products to a willing \nbuyer overseas where you can't find traditional financing. Our friends \nin China--sometimes they are not our friends; they manipulate their \ncurrency, they steal intellectual property--their bank is going like \ngangbusters. The last thing I am going to do with my vote is take \nAmerican companies that are struggling to make it, creating jobs in \nAmerica through selling products overseas, and put them at a \ndisadvantage against the Chinese or any other country that is doing \nbusiness. We will wind\n\n[[Page S3150]]\n\ndown these things together or we will stay in business to allow those \nin America to make products and sell them overseas.\n  From a South Carolina perspective, this is a very big deal. It was a \nbig deal to get Boeing to come to South Carolina. This is a request by \nBoeing, and many other small businesses such as Mount Vernon Mills, to \nkeep the program around.\n  I will end where I started. Six years ago, those people in the \nmanufacturing community had the bank reauthorized by voice vote. They \nset up a business model assuming the bank was going to be around, \nbecause nobody even objected to it enough to get a rollcall. Six years \nlater, we can't make wild, radical changes. We have made reforms. But \nthe worst thing we can do is to have told the community 6 years ago by \nvoice vote this bank will be in place and 6 years later do away with it \nwhen no one else is doing away with their banks. That makes no sense to \nme. That is not good government. That, to me, is unilateral surrender. \nI didn't want to unilaterally disarm when we were competing against the \nSoviets in the Cold War, and I sure as heck don't want to unilaterally \ndisarm in a world economy very much interconnected.\n  These amendments, most of them, are designed to wind down the bank. \nThey are ideologically driven. Senator Corker is trying to make it \nbetter, but there is a component of his amendment that I think would \nmake it very difficult for our companies to get a loan. At the end of \nthe day, we need to vote these amendments down and pass the House \nproduct.\n  To the Members of the House, Republicans and Democrats, you worked \nthis out among yourselves in a way that I think the Senate should \nembrace and endorse.\n  And to Senator Reid and Senator McConnell, we are allowing votes on \nan important piece of legislation. The Senate is operating in the best \ntraditions of the Senate; people have their say, people get to vote.\n  Here is my say: Bring your amendments to the floor. I respect your \nideological position. I respect the idea of the free markets and where \nwe want to go. But I am asking my colleagues not to put American \nbusinesses at risk at a time when our economy is on its knees. Do not \ndestroy this bank at a time when competitor nations are doubling the \nsize of theirs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague from South \nCarolina coming down to talk about his important tool for U.S. \nmanufacturers and why it is important in his State and why we need to \nget on to the business of passing this House legislation that was a \ncompromise that involved many people and, as my colleague from South \nCarolina stated, a very robust vote out of the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  I also wish to say a few words about my colleague's amendment, \nSenator Corker. I will trust what my colleague from South Carolina \nsays, that the amendment may be seen as a reform of the system, well \nintended, but I can tell you, it will have very adverse effects.\n  The Corker amendment basically is calling for a 10-percent capital \nratio requirement. It is not based on any fact or reason. The bank has \nhad a default rate of less than 2 percent--1.5 percent. So raising the \nreserve ratio would have a very adverse effect on the bank itself, and \nit would quadruple the reserves and basically cause problems with the \nbank and how it is leveraged.\n  If this is an issue about reform, there are many reforms in the \nunderlying bill. To the provision that would say you would have to \nverify, if you are an individual business, that you can't get \nfinancing, I have read the Senator's amendment. I am not sure how you \nwould prove that. It is not clear from the legislation. Does that mean \nyou would have to survey every time the ex-im program was implemented \nfor a business?\n  Let's say SCAFCO in Spokane, WA, which is a grain silo producer that \nis selling silos in many different parts of the world--every time they \nwanted to get financing for one of those silos, what would they do? \nWould they petition five banks in a region? Would they petition 100 \nbanks in a region? I want people to understand what that competition is \nlike.\n  Let's pretend that SCAFCO, as I said, which makes large grain \nelevators and is selling products all over the world and is one of the \nworld leaders, and we have an Ex-Im Bank requirement that says they \nhave to prove there is no financing available, and they are selling a \nlot of product in South America, in Africa, in Asia. Now somebody else \nsays, You know what. I can get financing for the product out of Russia \nor I can get financing for the product out of China and I don't have \nthat same requirement, so I am not going to buy from you, I am going to \nbuy from them.\n  That is what you are doing. You are basically hamstringing American \ncompetitors in an international marketplace by not allowing them the \nfinancing tools. Of course the bank has to show they can't get \nfinancing, but this new provision puts an undue burden on these \nindividuals--because of the language and how vague it is, how are they \never going to prove that there isn't someone there?\n  Instead of hamstringing American businesses, why not allow those \nAmerican businesses to continue under this legislation that, as my \ncolleague from South Carolina said, has been around for decades and \nbeen very effective? And we are including more transparency.\n  I urge my colleagues to defeat the Corker amendment because of its \nrequirements on capital ratio that they do not need and, second, on an \nability to prohibit the financing based on a clause that I don't even \nknow how it can be met. My colleagues from States that are using this \nprogram will understand that it will be very hard for our businesses to \ncontinue to compete with such a requirement.\n  I know my colleague Senator Lee was here earlier. The Lee amendment \nbasically would out-and-out defund the Export-Import financing program. \nI get that some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle believe \nwe should not have this program. I think it has been a very important \ntool for U.S. companies to win in their sales of U.S. products overseas \nand, as I said, creates thousands of jobs. I do not think the amendment \nof Senator Lee, which would basically abolish the bank as of September \n30, 2013, is a good way to go.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2103\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I now call up Vitter amendment No. 2103, \nwhich is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this amendment is borne of real \nfrustration that a lot of folks have faced over the last few years, \nparticularly in my State of Louisiana. As you know, we have had a rough \ntime, particularly following the BP disaster.\n  First there was that real environmental disaster, which was a shock \nto our system and our ecology. But second, and of perhaps even more \nlasting impact, there was the economic hit that was magnified \nenormously when the Obama administration, in my opinion, overreacted \nand instituted a full-blown moratorium on production drilling--drilling \nin the Gulf of Mexico. That formal moratorium was ended in late 2010, \nbut a de facto moratorium continued for many months. Even now there is \na permanent logjam that has permitting at a much lower pace than before \nthe BP disaster.\n  This is a broader problem because, at least off the coast of \nLouisiana, we are producing some energy. In many other places of the \ncountry where we have an abundance of energy, we are not allowed to get \nit because this Federal Government, particularly under this Obama \nadministration, puts well over 90 percent of our domestic resources off \nlimits.\n  In the midst of everything that was going on in the gulf, in the \nmidst of that moratorium shutting down jobs in the Gulf of Mexico, \nPresident Obama traveled to Brazil and he said that the United States \nwanted to be a tremendous partner and cheerleader of the development of \nBrazil's offshore industry. I have to tell you, that was like rubbing \nsalt in the wounds of tens of thousands of oilfield workers and others \nwho were suffering because of the Obama administration policy here in \nthis country really discouraging energy development. The way President \nObama proposed to be a strong supporter and partner and cheerleader of \nBrazilian offshore development was through an Export-Import Bank loan.\n  There are many of these sorts of loans. In August 2009--talking about \nBrazil, the case I mentioned--the Wall Street Journal reported in an \neditorial that ``the U.S. is going to lend billions of dollars to \nBrazil's State owned oil company, Petrobras, to finance exploration of \nthe huge offshore discovery in Brazil's Tupi oil field in the Santos \nBasin near Rio de Janeiro.'' Again, the Export-Import Bank approved a \n$2 billion loan to aid Brazilian oil production. That is what President \nObama was cheering and encouraging and making happen. It has happened \nother places as well. Again, the Ex-Im Bank specifically approved a \n$2.84 billion loan and loan guarantee to a subsidiary of Colombia's \nnational oil company. This money was intended to expand and upgrade an \noil refinery in Cartagena, Colombia. In 2011 the Ex-Im Bank again \nauthorized $1 billion for Pemex, Mexico's national oil and gas company.\n  Here we have this Federal Government, through the Ex-Im Bank, \nfinancing energy production overseas at the same time as this Federal \nGovernment tries to shut down and make difficult a lot of that activity \nhere at home. That is the frustration that produced this amendment, No. \n2103. This amendment is simple. It simply says that Ex-Im Bank is not \ngoing to provide those loans or loan guarantees related to fossil fuel \ndevelopment in foreign countries if there are similar projects in this \ncountry that are not getting comparable help. It is not suggesting that \nthe Ex-Im Bank is going to participate directly in projects in this \ncountry. It simply says first things first--American jobs, American \nenergy, American production. So we are not going to finance the world \nto produce energy when we create obstacles right here at home to do the \nsame.\n  The last several years have proved the need for this sort of \ncommonsense provision, in my opinion. President Obama traveling to \nBrazil, ballyhooing the development of their industry while his \nmoratorium and other policies substantially shut down our own here in \nthe United States, proves the need for this commonsense amendment.\n  I urge all my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats, to support this \nVitter amendment No. 2103. Again, it is very simple, very logical, and \npure common sense. Before the Ex-Im Bank uses U.S. taxpayer money to \nfund, to finance the guarantee of oil and gas and other energy \ndevelopment overseas in foreign countries, we are going to look here at \nhome to see if similar projects exist and are they getting any similar \nhelp or inducement from the Federal Government.\n  I urge support of this amendment as a way to move forward in a \ncommonsense way on this reauthorization.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise to address the Vitter amendment, \nNo. 2103. In speaking in opposition to that amendment, as I said, like \nall these amendments that are up for us to vote on today, I believe \nthey are detrimental not only to the Export-Import financing program \nbut to the compromise that has been worked out by Republicans and \nDemocrats in the House of Representatives in the legislation that is \nbeing supported by the chamber of commerce, U.S. manufacturers, a \nbipartisan list of Governors, and many businesses across America.\n  The reason the Vitter amendment is a horrible idea, actually, is that \nthe amendment would basically cut off or curtail American companies in \ntheir ability to compete on energy projects on a worldwide basis; that \nis, it would eliminate the bank's current 10 percent goal for renewable \nenergy projects. This is a longstanding requirement that has been \nincorporated into the Senate Foreign Operations bill. Why someone would \noppose it here I am not sure.\n  As somebody who knows a lot about energy and works on energy all the \ntime, I can tell you that one of the goals we have as a country should \nbe for the United States to win in the energy debate. Look at what a \ntremendous market opportunity new energy solutions are for our economy, \nfor the worldwide economy. It is somewhere from $4 trillion to $6 \ntrillion. A lot of people like to talk about the Internet and the great \nthings on the Internet. By comparison, it was somewhere between $2 and \n$4 trillion. This is an economic opportunity way beyond that.\n  When you look at what China is doing, they need to invest $3.7 \ntrillion by 2030 in order to build 1,300 gigawatts of new electricity-\ngenerating capacity. The Chinese Government alone needs to spend $3.7 \ntrillion on energy. My colleague from Louisiana wants to say: Let's \nhamstring U.S. companies--those that might have a solution to some of \nChina's energy needs--from getting the appropriate financing so they \ncan be successful in this program. To me, it is wrongheaded in the fact \nthat we want to be selling to China, as I said, just because in the \nNorthwest we already know what China is as a market. We sell them \nsoftware, we sell them airplanes, we sell them coffee--we sell\n\n[[Page S3152]]\n\nthem lots of things. We understand they are a market. To curtail the \nsolutions U.S. companies are working on, whether it is battery \ntechnology or smart grid technology or solutions for a whole range of \nproducts--you could even say nuclear power solutions or other clean \nenergy source solutions--all of these things would be curtailed under \nthe Vitter amendment.\n  We do not want to go backward. Not only does the United States want \nto be a leader in energy solutions in the United States, the United \nStates should have the goal of being an energy winner in the \ninternational marketplace, growing jobs through selling solutions that \nwe think can be quite successful in and around the developing world and \nin China.\n  I ask my colleagues to defeat this amendment and to make sure we get \nthis bank. As I said regarding the Export-Import financing program, we \nhave about 5 legislative days to give the predictability and certainty \nAmerican businesses would like to see in making sure U.S. manufacturers \nwin in a global marketplace.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. I rise today in support of H.R. 2072, \nthe Export-Import Bank Reauthorization Act of 2012. After too much \ndelay, it is time for the Senate to pass this bill.\n  The Export-Import Bank supports nearly 290,000 jobs a year, assists \nthousands of American businesses, and helps reduce the Federal budget \ndeficit. It shouldn't be surprising, then, to hear that the bank has \nthe approval of labor unions, the chamber of commerce, the Business \nRoundtable, and the National Association of Manufacturers.\n  Indeed, the bank is supported by a wide majority in both Houses of \nCongress. The bill before us today passed with an overwhelming vote of \n330 to 93 in the House of Representatives last week as Republicans and \nDemocrats came together in support of truly bipartisan legislation. \nWhen we passed a similar bill out of the Senate Banking Committee last \nyear, it had unanimous bipartisan support.\n  Despite the urgent need for passage of the bill, there are several \nRepublican amendments. I urge all of my colleagues to vote against \nthose amendments and pass this bill without delay. We are at the finish \nline today with a bill that has already been approved in the House and \nhas bipartisan support in the Senate. Unless we pass this bill, the Ex-\nIm Bank's authorization will lapse on May 31 and nearly 300,000 \nAmerican jobs will be at risk. Unless we pass this bill, American \nexporters will be put at a disadvantage with their foreign competitors, \nwho, in many cases, receive far greater assistance from their own \nnations' export credit agencies.\n  Let's come together and pass this bipartisan bill and score a victory \nfor the hundreds of thousands of American workers whose jobs are \nsupported by the Ex-Im Bank.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendments and support \nreauthorization of the Export-Import Bank today so we can send this \nbill to the President and have it signed into law without delay.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2104\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 2104, which is \nat the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Toomey, for himself, Mr. \n     DeMint and Mr. Lee, proposes an amendment numbered 2104.\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I ask that the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To prohibit an increase in the lending authority of the \n Export-Import Bank of the United States to more than $100,000,000,000 \n until the Secretary of the Treasury certifies that the Secretary has \n  initiated international negotiations to eliminate export financing \nprograms and to prohibit an increase in that lending authority to more \n   than $120,000,000,000 until a multilateral agreement to eliminate \n             export financing programs has been completed)\n\n       Strike section 3 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, this is an amendment that deals with the \nreauthorization of the Ex-Im Bank. I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment. I think it is a very important measure to begin the process \nof phasing out a very unfortunate practice that we participate in, as \ndo many of our trading partners, which is the active taxpayer \nsubsidization of exports.\n  I want to be very clear. There is a very real risk that is carried by \nAmerican taxpayers, and that risk is systematically underpriced. The \nfact is the Ex-Im Bank extends loans and provides guarantees to \ncountries and companies buying American exports. It provides those \nloans and those loan guarantees under terms that are not available in \nthe private sector.\n  There is a reason those terms are not available in the private \nsector. It is because the private sector necessarily requires full \ncompensation for whatever risks they take, and there is a risk in any \nloan. The Ex-Im Bank underprices these loans systematically, and that \nis why it is important, that is why it exists, and that is why it does \nbusiness that the private sector cannot win away from the Ex-Im Bank. \nThe Ex-Im Bank necessarily and systematically underprices the risks \nthat taxpayers are on the hook for. This is what many of us object to, \nthe risk that the taxpayers are forced to bear.\n  In addition to enforcing taxpayers to incur this risk, it is quite \nunfair to American companies that have to compete with the foreign \ncompanies that get the subsidized financing. This isn't just \ntheoretical. This happens all the time. Some years ago I was involved \nin a dispute because the Ex-Im Bank was going to finance the \nacquisition of equipment by a foreign--I think it was a Chinese \nsteelmaker--which would enable them to make steel at lower prices than \nAmerican steelmakers could make because the American companies wouldn't \nbe able to obtain this equipment with the subsidy that the Chinese\n\n[[Page S3153]]\n\ncompanies could obtain through the Ex-Im Bank.\n  More recently is the case of Delta Airlines, which has observed that \nthe price they have to pay for jets is higher than the price paid by \nother countries that are operating competing routes but buying their \naircraft through the subsidies of the Ex-Im Bank.\n  In 2008 President Obama, referring to Ex-Im Bank, said this is \n``little more than a fund for corporate welfare.'' I think that is a \nlittle bit harsh. I understand how this has come to be, I understand \nwhy it has been extended, and I understand why people believe we have \nto subsidize our exports. It is because other countries around the \nworld subsidize theirs. In other words, if our German and French and \nChinese and Russian taxpayers are made to take a risk in subsidizing \nthe sales of their manufacturers, then our taxpayers ought to take a \nsimilar risk.\n  I think there is a logical solution. Let's require the administration \nto sit down with our trading competitors and negotiate a mutual \nphaseout of all of these export subsidies. Frankly, it is in \neverybody's interest. We could have a level playing field on which no \ntaxpayers are subject to this risk, no taxpayers are asked to subsidize \nthe sales of private companies, and I think that is what we ought to \ndo. This is what my amendment would accomplish.\n  My amendment says we will go ahead with the reauthorization of the \nEx-Im Bank, but the first increase in the lending limit we are \ncurrently at--the bump-up of $20 billion that is contemplated in this \nbill that has passed the House--would be contingent upon the \nadministration informing Congress that they have begun the process of \nnegotiating a phaseout of all export subsidies.\n  I recognize this phaseout would not occur immediately but would be a \ngradual process that would happen over time. So under my amendment the \nsecond increase would only occur when the administration came back and \ninformed Congress that they had, in fact, reached an agreement with our \nleading trading partners on a framework that would phase out \nsubsidization of exports.\n  I think this is a very sensible way to deal with the only compelling \nargument I have heard in favor of forcing taxpayers to continue to take \nthis risk; that is, well, everyone does it, so we must. Since that is \nthe only reason, then let's start the process of persuading everyone \nelse not to do it. We have tremendous leverage in both bilateral and \nmultinational trade negotiations of all sorts. There are ways that the \nadministration--if it makes this issue a priority--can persuade our \ntrading partners that this is the right direction to go.\n  Each of our trading partners has their own constituency of taxpayers \nwho would probably rather not be forced to subsidize this process just \nas we do. I think this amendment does it in a careful fashion that \nallows businesses to continue for now provided we start in a different \ndirection, a direction that will avoid continuing to put taxpayers at \nrisk.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment numbered 2104.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I would like to speak in support of \nSenator Toomey's amendment and to point out some of the things about \nthe Ex-Im Bank that are important for the taxpayers to know.\n  As a businessman I know if I can get a guaranteed loan, I would take \nit in a second. I don't blame companies that are interested in lower \nrate financing. But as Congressmen and Senators and as the President of \nthe United States, our job is to protect taxpayers. We are forgetting \nin this debate that when we guarantee a loan, we are signing the \ntaxpayers' names to a loan guarantee. In the real world if an \nindividual or a business guarantees a loan, that is a very real \nliability to them, and we are not just talking about the Ex-Im Bank.\n  The taxpayers of this country are now liable for about $1 trillion \nfor student loans, trillions of dollars for mortgages and other loan \nguarantees and insurance.\n\n  We cannot continue to pass these bills without realizing someday \nthese bills are going to come due and the folks across the country are \ngoing to have to pay them.\n  We were promised, when Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were making all \nthese loans, that it was good for the taxpayer, that we were making \nmoney, we could not lose. But the taxpayers have lost billions of \ndollars. And now as we continue to guarantee loans around the world, \nsome of the countries these loans are going to are on the watch list by \nMoody's and other ratings services because of the financial situation \nin Europe and all across the world, which is more and more strained. We \ncannot assume this money is coming back to the taxpayer.\n  We probably heard already from some of the speakers that the Export-\nImport Bank was started many decades ago during Franklin Roosevelt's \nadministration, and there was a limit on how much could be lent. It was \n$3.5 billion. But we know how government works and how government \ngrows. The bill we are considering this week is not in the millions; it \nis in the billions; and it is not $3 billion or $4 billion, it is $140 \nbillion of loan guarantees to American companies that are selling \noverseas.\n  Unfortunately, that does not help American companies that want to \nsell here in America, which means much of the domestic market for our \nproducts is financed at a higher rate. It is only the rest of the \nworld. And we are the biggest consuming market in the world. This is \nnot an idea we should continue in America. We are in a bidding war with \nChina and Europe to see who can subsidize the most loans at a time when \nall of us are broke.\n  We need to bring this to a close. Senator Toomey's amendment is a \nlogical way to proceed. The World Trade Organization is set up to make \nsure there is a level playing field and that we are not subsidizing \nimports and exports. But this is a very real subsidy and a very real \nrisk to the American people.\n  Let's begin the process of taking away this excuse of why we need to \nsubsidize them. The excuse is always: We have to do it because they are \ndoing it. But as a world trading organization, we need to take down \nthese subsidies and phase them out. We can do that and decrease the \namount of money the American taxpayer is liable for. It is common \nsense. Hopefully, my colleagues will support it today.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate is voting on H.R. \n2072, the Export-Import Bank Reauthorization Act of 2012. This bill \nwill reauthorize the Export-Import Bank, which has been operating under \ntemporary extensions. We are overdue to reauthorize and expand this \nimportant agency.\n  The Export-Import Bank is an important tool U.S. companies can use to \npromote the export of American-made manufactured goods, particularly \nexports of small- and medium-sized manufacturers which make up the \nlargest portion of the Export-Import Bank's transactions. The Export-\nImport Bank provides financing to foreign purchasers of U.S. goods when \nprivate financing is not available. That financing allows U.S. \nbusinesses to sell more U.S. goods abroad, which means we create more \njobs here at home. And the reality is that many of our trading partners \nthat compete against us in the global marketplace use aggressive export \nfinancing to advantage their companies. We need to offer the same type \nof support to American manufacturers so that they can compete in \noverseas markets on a level playing field.\n  Over the last 5 years the Export-Import Bank helped 148 Michigan \ncompanies export $2.7 billion worth of goods overseas, supporting and \ncreating jobs in Michigan. Over 100 of these Michigan, companies were \nsmall businesses selling a broad range of products manufactured in \nMichigan, including fabricated metal products, machinery, auto parts, \nchemicals, wood products, paper, and food. The three top export \ndestinations for these Michigan exports were Mexico, Turkey, and \nCanada.\n  The Export-Import Bank is self-financing and in fact contributes \nmoney to the U.S. Treasury every year. This is a win-win situation to \nreauthorize the Export-Import Bank and increase its authorization level \nat no cost to the government so that we can export more American-made \ngoods and create and support U.S. jobs here at home.\n  Mr. President, I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n[[Page S3154]]\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for the \nnext 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I have enjoyed listening to my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle talk about Senator Toomey's amendment and all about \nsubsidies. Well, it is hard to argue about subsidies when we are \ntalking about the Ex-Im Bank generating $3.7 billion for U.S. taxpayers \nsince 2005.\n  So if this is a subsidy, we need a lot more of it because you are \nwinning in producing jobs and you are actually producing money for the \nTreasury. This is a very important tool for us to win in a global \neconomy. I think my colleague from South Carolina who spoke earlier \nsaid it best when he talked about the manufacturing jobs that are now \nin that State and what an important tool it is.\n  I am not one of those who basically says: Oh, we should do it because \nother countries do it. I am saying, you should recognize that is going \non, but that the United States needs to understand there is a global \nmarketplace for its products. If you believe in U.S. manufacturers, as \nI do--and I have seen them in my State--they are winning the day in \nproducing products and services that can beat the competition in \ninternational marketplaces. They can.\n  I have seen grain silos, I have seen music stands, and, yes, I have \nseen airplanes. So the question is, are we going to let U.S. products \nthat can beat the competition in an international marketplace lose \nbecause the purchaser of those products is looking for financing \nmechanisms that will help them secure financing and purchase of those \nproducts? That is the question.\n  Does the United States want to do those kinds of activities? I say we \nshould be even more aggressive. Why? Because the global development of \nmany countries that are now buying U.S. products is going to continue \nto grow. In my State, in southwest Washington, in Vancouver, I saw the \nsecond largest grain elevator in the entire world--the second largest \ngrain elevator. I said: Why do we have the second largest grain \nelevator in the entire world right here at the Port of Vancouver? They \nsaid to me: Because as the Asian middle class rises, they want to eat \nbeef. And if they want to eat beef, they have to have grain.\n  What is wrong with the United States selling grain to Asian markets \nbecause they want our product--or all these other products we have been \ntalking about today? These are examples of products in the United \nStates where we are actually building a product that many countries and \nmany end customers want. We should celebrate that, and we should \nrealize, as the growing middle class around the globe increases, there \nis even more opportunity for the United States to sell products and win \nthe day in the marketplace. So I do not know what they are talking \nabout when they say ``subsidies,'' because this has been good for the \nU.S. taxpayers, and it has been good for our economy.\n  Specifically to the Toomey amendment, this amendment would require \nunnecessary conditions for helping the bank in the future. Basically, \nit would put a hold on the financing of the Export-Import Bank until we \nnegotiated on an international basis to terminate this kind of \nfinancing.\n  As I said, for many States, they have had great benefits. In \nPennsylvania, they have had the economic benefit--this is in just \n2011--of $1.4 billion in exports and over 9,000 jobs. So here is \nsomething that has actually created jobs, created money for the U.S. \neconomy--basically money back to U.S. taxpayers that we have used to \nhelp pay down the deficit. So how is it that is bad for us? In the \nmeantime, that manufacturer in Pennsylvania is winning and getting his \nproduct out on an international basis and, hopefully, expanding his \nbusiness to many different countries.\n  We had numbers on some of the other examples of companies that have \nbeen helped in various States. These are products and services like \nmany in my State. We have visited a grain silo producer in Spokane, WA, \nthat is winning in selling its product. We visited a music stands \ncompany, Manhasset Music Stands. You would think somebody might be able \nto compete with them and beat them in the international marketplace, \nbut, in fact, they are winning the day in the international \nmarketplace, and the Export-Import Bank helps them in doing so.\n  There are many examples of how this particular program is a win for \ntaxpayers, is a win for manufacturers, and is a win for the U.S. \neconomy. These amendments that are all trying to gut the Export-Import \nBank would send this back to the House, when we need to be sending it \nto the President's desk, giving certainty and predictability to our \neconomy, giving certainty and predictability to a program that has \nexisted for decades, for which often there has been a voice vote--\ninstead of holding it up, actually making sure manufacturers have the \nopportunity and know where the financing is.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/15/senate-section/article/S3154-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nleader remarks on Wednesday, May 16, the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of motions to proceed to the following budget resolutions \nlisted, en bloc: Calendar No. 357, S. Con. Res. 41; Calendar No. 354, \nH. Con. Res. 112; Calendar No. 356, S. Con. Res. 37; Calendar No. 384, \nS. Con. Res. 42; and Calendar No. 395, S. Con. Res. 44; that there be 6 \nhours of debate on the motions to proceed equally divided between the \ntwo leaders or their designees; that upon the use or yielding back of \ntime, the Senate proceed to vote on the five motions to proceed in the \norder listed above; that there be 2 minutes equally divided between the \nvotes and that all after the first vote be 10-minute votes; that the \nmotions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; that \nnotwithstanding the adoption of any motion to proceed, the Senate \nproceed to the remaining votes on motions to proceed; further, that at \nthe conclusion of those votes, the Senate resume consideration of the \nbudget resolution if a motion to proceed is adopted; and that if no \nmotion to proceed has been adopted, the majority leader be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, there has \nnot been a budget passed in the Senate and the House in over 3 years. I \nwould argue that the exercise we have ending tomorrow will have no \nsubstantial difference. I do not think there is anyone in America who \nbelieves we will have a budget at the end of tomorrow. The \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974 requires Congress to pass a budget by \nApril 15. So with that, I ask unanimous consent that the request of the \nleader be modified so that S. 1981, the No Budget, No Pay Act, be \nautomatically discharged from the Homeland Security and Government \nAffairs Committee, the bill be immediately placed on the calendar, and \nthat when the Senate proceeds to the budget votes mentioned in the \nSenator's request, the Senate also vote on the motion to proceed to S. \n1981 under the same terms and conditions of the other budget votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator so modify his request?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Objection has been heard on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is objection to the modification. Is \nthere objection to the original request? Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, just on the note that the Senator raised, \nI want to make clear that I have heard over and over: No budget \nresolution has passed in 1,000 days. What is not being said is that \ninstead of a budget\n\n[[Page S3155]]\n\nresolution last year, the Senate and the House passed the Budget \nControl Act. The Budget Control Act is not a resolution, it is a law. A \nresolution, as all Members know, is purely a congressional document. It \nnever goes to the President for his signature.\n  Last year, instead of a budget resolution, this body and the other \nbody passed legislation called the Budget Control Act that set a \nbudget, budget limits, and spending limits for this year and next. \nActually, it went even further: It set 10 years of spending caps. A \nbudget resolution usually only sets 1 year of spending caps.\n  So I wanted to make clear that instead of a budget resolution being \npassed last year, the House and the Senate passed the Budget Control \nAct to set spending limits for this year and next and for the 8 years \nbeyond.\n  In addition, the Budget Control Act established a supercommittee and \ngave it special authority to reform the tax system and the entitlement \nsystem and said that if they could come to an agreement, they would not \nface a filibuster. With a simple majority, we could reform the tax \nsystem and the entitlement system here in the Senate. The Budget \nControl Act further said that if the special committee does not agree \nto reform the tax system, to reform the entitlement system, there will \nbe an additional $1.2 trillion of spending cuts put in place over and \nabove the $900 billion of cuts put in place by the Budget Control Act \nthrough spending caps for 10 years. That is a total--because the \nspecial committee did not agree--of over $2 trillion of spending cuts \nthat are now in law as a result of the Budget Control Act. That is the \nlargest spending cut package in the history of the United States, and \nit is law. It is law because of the Budget Control Act passed last \nyear.\n  Now, my colleagues can go and shout it through the rooftops, as they \nhave done, that the Congress has not passed a budget resolution in \n1,000 days, but they are not telling the whole story. They are not \ntelling people that instead of a resolution, the House and the Senate \npassed a law. A law is stronger than any resolution. A resolution is \npurely a congressional document. A law has to be signed by the \nPresident of the United States.\n  The Budget Control Act was passed by the Senate on an overwhelming \nbipartisan vote, passed by the House, and signed by the President of \nthe United States. It sets the budget limits for this year and next, \nand it goes beyond that. It sets 10 years of spending caps, saving $900 \nbillion. And because the special committee could not agree to reforming \nthe tax system and the entitlement system, it put in place another $1.2 \ntrillion of spending cuts that are now in law. That is a total of over \n$2 trillion of spending cuts.\n  What we do not have is the longer term plan the Budget Control Act \nhoped would come about as a result of the work of the special \ncommittee. So that is work we still need to do, but nobody should be \nunder any misimpression or misunderstanding that we do not have \nspending limits in place for this year and next and, in fact, for all \ndiscretionary spending, spending limits in place for the whole of the \nnext 10 years. That is a fact.\n  Tomorrow we are going to have a chance to debate fundamental issues \nof where the resources of the United States go. But we are in a \ndifferent situation than we normally would be because the Budget \nControl Act is in law. We know what the appropriators can spend for \nthis year and next. That is locked in. And tomorrow we will have a \nchance to debate longer term plans.\n  I will be interested to see what some of our colleagues say about \nsome of the truly extraordinary and extreme budget plans that are being \noffered by my colleagues on the other side--plans to eliminate Medicare \nin 2 years, plans to cut Social Security benefits by 39 percent, plans \nto have trillions of dollars of additional tax cuts for the wealthiest \namong us, and at the same time cut education 25 percent, cut funding to \nreduce our dependence on foreign energy by 60 percent, plans to cut \nspending beyond the Budget Control Act limitations by another $2 \ntrillion.\n\n  We are going to see, from some of my colleagues on the other side, \ntruly extreme plans. I hope they will be voted down tomorrow. I hope we \nwill be able to make clear to the American people with the Budget \nControl Act law that passed last year, instead of a budget resolution, \nthere are spending caps in place this year and next and the 8 years \nbeyond.\n  Tomorrow will be an interesting day to discuss different Members' \nviews of the fiscal future of this country. Make no mistake, we need to \ncome together on a long-term plan to get us back on track.\n  I was part of the Bowles-Simpson Commission. In fact, it was the idea \nof Senator Gregg and myself to have such a commission. I voted for the \nfindings of that commission to save more than $4 trillion. I was part \nof the Group of 6 who spent an entire year trying to find a way to \nimplement Bowles-Simpson. So I am fully prepared to have this debate \nand this discussion.\n  I am eager for us to come together around a plan to get us back on \ntrack, but it is going to require all sides to get out of their fixed \npositions. That is probably unlikely right before an election, but it \nneeds to happen before the end of this year. I am very hopeful that \nBowles-Simpson--that fiscal commission plan--serves as a good example \nof where we might find common ground. Both sides, all sides, need to \nget out of their fixed positions to reach an agreement to get our \ncountry back on track.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/15/senate-section/article/S3155-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3155-S3158]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       EXPORT-IMPORT BANK REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2012--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the Export-Import Bank of the United States from \n   providing financing to a person or for a project in a country the \n   government or central bank of which holds debt instruments of the \n                             United States)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. PROHIBITION ON FINANCING BY THE EXPORT-IMPORT BANK \n                   OF THE UNITED STATES FOR PERSONS OR PROJECTS IN \n                   COUNTRIES THAT HOLD DEBT INSTRUMENTS OF THE \n                   UNITED STATES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any provision of the \n     Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 (12 U.S.C. 635 et seq.), the \n     Export-Import Bank of the United States may not provide any \n     guarantee, insurance, or extension of credit (or participate \n     in the extension of credit) to a person or with respect to a \n     project in a country the government or central bank of which \n     holds debt instruments of the United States.\n       (b) Debt Instruments of the United States Defined.--In this \n     section, the term ``debt instruments of the United States'' \n     means bills, notes, and bonds issued or guaranteed by the \n     United States or by an entity of the United States \n     Government.\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, first, we borrow billions of dollars from \nChina, India, and Saudi Arabia. Then we loan it back to them again.\n  Republicans rightly complain that we are sending taxpayer money to \nthe President's major donors at Solyndra and BrightSource. Now \nRepublicans need to be consistent and say we are not going to send Ex-\nIm loans to even bigger companies that are even more profitable. If it \nis wrong for the government to choose winners and send our money to \ncorporations, we should say it is wrong and we should vote against \nthis.\n  Does anybody remember the President threatening to increase taxes on \ncorporate jets? Ex-Im Banks are now going to increase the loans for \ncorporate jets tenfold.\n  My amendment will stop this charade. My amendment will stop sending \ntaxpayer dollars overseas to countries from whom we already are \nborrowing money. It makes no sense, and the time is now to stop it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, this amendment is simply another attempt \nto gut the Export-Import Bank financing that U.S. manufacturers use to \nincrease the sales of their products around the globe.\n  The amendment would prohibit U.S. exporters from using the financing \nfor any country that owns U.S. debt. So basically we are saying we are \ngoing to prohibit U.S. manufacturers, who make good products, from \nhoping to sell those to places such as China and others just because of \nthe amount of U.S. debt.\n  This is about job creation in America for a program that actually \ngenerates money to our Treasury and helps us pay down the deficit. We \nshould be helping all U.S. manufacturers sell all around the globe and \ncreate jobs at home.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the Paul amendment.\n  Mr. PAUL.

Mr. President, the most important thing this amendment \ndoes is establish capital in the Ex-Im Bank. Right now the way the Ex-\nIm Bank is set up, there is over $1 billion worth of capital against \n$140 billion in loans. That is a leverage ratio of 140 to 1.\n  This body spent a tremendous amount of time in a bipartisan way to \nmake sure the financial institutions of our country had proper capital \nratios. This amendment establishes a 10-percent capital reserve for the \nEx-Im Bank. By their definition these loans are more risky than the \nprivate sector would make, and that is why the sponsors are trying to \nextend the Ex-Im Bank.\n  As a responsible body, the very least we can do is to cause them to \nhave the appropriate capital reserved against the loans they are making \nwhich are more risky by definition than the private sector loans.\n  I hope this will receive a strong bipartisan vote. My guess is the \nHouse will take this almost in unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, this amendment would force the Ex-Im \nBank financing to increase its reserves by nearly 400 percent to \nmaintain that 10-percent ratio. Basically we already have a board that \naudits third-party accountants, OMB, and a bank inspector general \nreviewing this. This amendment basically would take away from money \nthat actually goes to the Treasury.\n  This Ex-Im Bank has generated $3.7 billion for taxpayers since 2005. \nMy colleague would rather have that put aside as opposed to helping us \npay down the deficit. It has a reserve ratio that has worked for \ndecades, worked successfully, and I like the fact that it helps us pay \ndown the deficit.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on the Corker amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this amendment is very simple. It simply \nsays that if we are going to have the U.S. taxpayer, through the Ex-Im \nBank, finance and guarantee and loan money to traditional energy \nprojects around the world, maybe we should have the same policy and the \nsame help for U.S. projects producing U.S. energy here at home. That \nis, pure and simple, what it is all about. This is not a theoretical \nconcern. A year ago President Obama traveled to Brazil to praise the \ndevelopment of their offshore industry, to give them U.S. taxpayer help \nthrough the Ex-Im Bank. But policies in this country were doing exactly \nthe opposite--hurting U.S. activity to produce U.S. energy, to produce \nU.S. jobs.\n  If you want to create that reasonable, fair playing field to promote \nU.S. jobs here at home too, please support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, the Senator from Louisiana has \nthe right intentions, but this amendment would truly be a vote against \nU.S. jobs and manufacturing. It would wrongly target renewable energy \nmanufacturing, and it would threaten millions of dollars in the export \nof U.S.-made products at a time when we should be seeking to expand \nthese markets overseas.\n  If you look particularly at the wind industry, it is already \nsuffering because we have not had the courage, frankly, to extend the \nproduction tax credit for wind, and it has bipartisan support; that is, \nthe extension of the wind production tax credit. So we have to pass \nthat production tax credit immediately. But in the meantime, let's not \ncreate a double whammy and pass the Vitter amendment because that would \ndamage our opportunity to export renewable energy projects and \nservices. Without question, that sector is expanding dramatically. It \nis the source of a lot of jobs in my State and I think in every State \nin the Nation.\n  Let's expand our markets. Let's export. Let's not limit that \npossibility. The Vitter amendment would do just that, so I urge all of \nyou to vote against the Vitter amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, there are two things we know about \nreauthorizing the Ex-Im Bank. We know our taxpayers are subject to a \nrisk for which they are not fairly compensated in the sense that Ex-Im \nnecessarily systematically underprices the risk. That is precisely why \na borrower goes to them.\n  We also know it is unfair to a domestic competitor that cannot obtain \nthe financing at the same rate that a foreign company can. We are told \nwe should do this anyway because everyone else does it, because all of \nour competitors around the world subsidize their exports.\n  So I would suggest the logical conclusion is we should work to phase \nout export subsidies all around the world. That is what this amendment \ndoes. It reauthorizes Ex-Im. It lifts the limit of the borrowing cap. \nBut it makes it contingent on the administration beginning a process of \nnegotiating a phaseout of export subsidies. It makes the second \nincrease in the lending cap contingent on an actual agreement that \nwill, over time, get us all out of the business of risking taxpayer \ndollars in export subsidies.\n  I think this is a sensible way. It will allow an adjustment to take \nplace for those who are dependent on this bank, but it will get \ntaxpayers off the hook in time.\n  So I urge support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I think this is a nonsensical \nprovision. It says the bank can only make loans--can make more loans if \nthere is an international agreement to terminate the bank.\n  I know in Pennsylvania, Wallquest finished 2010 with export sales \nover $17 million, a 61-percent increase because it obtained Ex-Im \nfinancing. During the first 2 years, its workforce grew from 80 to 150. \nNow I know that may not be a big story, but it is the story of the Ex-\nIm Bank.\n  So capping it and saying we are not going to give any more money for \nmore loans until we negotiate an end to the bank, I think, is the wrong \nway to go.

Mr. President, the national flood insurance program is to \nexpire the end of May, this month. The insurance program provides \ncoverage for almost 6 million people who work in flood zones. It is \nself-sustaining. For more than 40 years it has guarded American \nhomeowners against flood-related disasters. If the program expires, new \nhousing construction will stall, new housing construction will come to \na halt, and taxpayers will be on the hook for future disasters.\n  We have not been able to bring flood insurance to the floor because \nwe have had a lot of problems with Senate procedure that some believe \nis abusive. It has left us with so little time. As you see, I have \nfiled cloture on two nominations to the Federal Reserve. I will file \nlater on a judge who has been waiting for almost a year.\n  No one believes there is enough time to pass, conference, and enact a \nlong-term flood insurance bill before the end of this month, so under \nthe situation we will have to do another short-term extension simply to \nkeep the bill from expiring. Thus I will seek to pass an extension of \nthis important program now.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to \nconsideration of Calendar No. 366, S. 2344, which is an extension of \nthe National Flood Insurance Program, that that bill be read a third \ntime, passed, the motion to reconsider be laid on the table, and there \nbe no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I object. I will hold my comments until \nafter the majority leader finishes his talk, so I can explain my \nposition.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator can go ahead if he wishes.\n  Mr. COBURN. The majority leader wants me to go ahead?\n  Mr. REID. Seriously, I am anxious to hear it.\n  Mr. COBURN. We have had 14 short-term extensions to the National \nFlood Insurance Program. That is over the past 4\\1/2\\, 5 years. There \nis a bill set to be brought to the floor. Yet we are going to have a \nshort-term extension again.\n  This program is not financially sound and it is not self-sustaining. \nIt runs a $900 million deficit every year. What is the National Flood \nInsurance Program? Do we need it? Yes. Am I objecting that we do need \nit? No. But the vast majority of the moneys that are expended by hard-\nworking Americans go to subsidize the insurance for homeowners of \nsecond and vacation homes. Multiple times in the Senate and in the \nHouse, both sides have concurred that this should be taken away, this \nsubsidy for those in terms of second homes and vacation properties.\n  What I would expect, if we are going to do an extension, is that then \nwe ought to do an extension with something that both bodies have \nalready passed, which includes making those people who have properties \neight times the average value of the rest of the homes in the flood \ninsurance program carry their fair share of their insurance. So I am \nnot inclined, no matter what happens to the flood insurance program, to \nallow us to continue to extend.\n  I would make one other point. We will not have time in December to \nfix this, with everything else that is coming up. So the time to fix \nthis is now. I will not object to the 5-year reauthorization coming to \nthe floor. I don't think anybody on our side will as well. We should \naddress this and be done with it. But another short-term extension is \nnot what this country needs. We cannot afford losing another $900 \nmillion, plus the American taxpayer is on the hook for $1.34 trillion \nwith this program right now. The average subsidy to the average home--\nnot the vacation home--is over $1,000 a year.\n\n  I have no objection to supporting those who actually need our help, \nwho are in flood-prone areas. But for those who have the tremendous \nbenefit and the opportunity to have second and third homes, I think it \nis objectionable we continue to subsidize their purchase of flood \ninsurance.\n  With that, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before my friend leaves the floor, I hope we \ncan do a short-term bill. As my colleague knows, the impediment to the \nregular function of the Senate this year has been the offering of \nirrelevant amendments. I am wondering if I could say through the Chair \nto my friend, the junior Senator from Oklahoma, what kind of agreement \ndoes he think we can get on the number of amendments on something like \nthis?\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I would respond to the majority leader \nthrough the Chair and say I will help him in any way I could with my \nside of the aisle to make sure we have cogent amendments to this bill \nand also agree to a limited number of them, since it is important that \nwe reauthorize this program.\n  Mr. REID. I say again through the Chair to my friend, how many \namendments does he think he would need?\n  Mr. COBURN. One or two.\n  Mr. REID. I thank my friend from Oklahoma. It is something I wish to \nbe able to do. We have so much to do--we have the farm bill, we have \ncyber security, we have the FDA bill, I am filing cloture on \nnominations--people who have been waiting to change their lives. So I \nam sorry we cannot legislate more.\n  I have sympathy with my friend from Oklahoma. I don't agree with \neverything he said, but this is a program that needs to be changed and \nI recognize that. I will continue working with my friend. Maybe there \nis some way we can work together and figure out a way to move this \nforward. It is hard.\n  What I would suggest is I would be happy to work on my side, because \nSenator Johnson has talked to me twice today on this legislation, to \nfigure out what amendments my folks want to offer, because they want to \noffer amendments. If my friend from Oklahoma would also make a decision \non his side of, as he indicated, cogent\n\n[[Page S3160]]\n\namendments, relevant amendments, we could put this in a little package \nand move to it without having to file cloture and do these amendments. \nI wish to do that.\n  I will work on my side to find out what amendments there are. If my \nfriend will do that, on Monday or Tuesday we will talk about this and \nsee if we can get a very concise agreement to do it. This is important \nlegislation. My friend is not denying that. But I think we do have to \nmake some changes in it. I am happy to move forward on it. I think the \nHouse is going to take something up real soon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. If the Senator from New Jersey will give me a courtesy of \n5 minutes to speak as in morning business and I will be through.\n  I appreciate what the majority leader has said. I will work my side \nof the aisle, to see if the possibility of moving this is there and I \nwill give it my 100-percent effort between now and next Monday when I \nsee the majority leader to see if we cannot do it.\n  I will make a couple of points. Our Nation is in big trouble and we \nare not acting as if it is in big trouble. It seems that the way we are \noperating is from crisis to crisis. That is not good for the country, \nit is not good for the agencies, it is certainly not good for the \nindividuals, and it makes it where we actually cannot do effective \nlegislating.\n  The idea behind the flood insurance program is almost 50 years old. \nThere is nothing wrong with its intent. But we cannot afford $900 \nmillion a year in subsidies to the very wealthy in this country for \ntheir second or vacation homes. If we are talking about fairness, as \nthe President talks, then it is time to reform this program--whether it \nis with an extension or not--this component of it where there is a fair \npremium, where we are not subsidizing those who can in fact take care \nof themselves in this country.\n  Whether it is this bill or the farm bill where we are subsidizing 4 \npercent of the farmers with 60 percent of the crop insurance premium, \nit is the same issue.\n  I look forward to working with the majority leader and I will do my \npart to try to gather up the amendments that might be there and work \nwith our leadership to try to bring this bill to the floor.\n  I thank the Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Violence \nAgainst Women Act that the Senate passed, but we seem to have a \nchallenge with our colleagues in the House of Representatives. In my \nview, violence against any woman is still violence. Apparently, my \nRepublican colleagues in the House do not share that view. Republicans \nin the House have introduced a bill that would not protect all women. \nTheir bill would roll back protections for certain vulnerable \npopulations. It would strip provisions in the Senate bill that protect \nwomen from discrimination and abuse, specifically Native American \nwomen, the LGBT community, and for undocumented immigrants it actually \nrolls back protections they have under current law.\n  We have seen that violence against women is an epidemic and it \nplagues all of us, not just some of us. We have fought against it, we \nhave tried to end it, we have established programs and policies at the \nnational and State levels to mitigate it. We have stood with the \nvictims of domestic violence. Now we must stand and reaffirm our \noutrage.\n  It is in my mind a no-brainer. I am, frankly, hard-pressed to \nunderstand why anyone would stand in the way of denouncing violence \nagainst any woman, no matter who they are, no matter what their sexual \norientation or citizenship. I am hard-pressed to understand why anyone \nwould choose to exclude violence against certain women, turn back the \nclock to a time when such violence was not recognized, was not a \nnational disgrace, and make a distinction when and against whom such \nviolence meets our threshold of outrage. There can be no such threshold \nand no such distinction. Violence against any woman is an outrage, \nplain and simple.\n  Is the message to be that we are willing for some reason that in my \nmind defies logic to accept violence against certain women? Because \nthat seems to be the message the other body is sending us. I cannot \nbelieve anyone would take such a position, but that is exactly what we \nwould do if we listened to our Republican House colleagues, and that is \ncompletely unacceptable to this Senator and should be unacceptable to \nevery Member of Congress and every American. If our friends on the \nother side deny they are waging a political and cultural war against \nwomen, then why are they willing to accept an actual war against \ncertain women by excluding them from protection under the Violence \nAgainst Women Act?\n\n  The reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act doesn't just \naffect those who are or might become victims of sexual violence or \ndomestic violence; it affects all of us. Nearly one in five women \nreports being the victim of rape or attempted rape. One in six reports \nbeing stalked. One in four reports having been beaten by their partner. \nOf those who report being raped, 80 percent report being raped before \nthe age of 25. The short-term physical and emotional trauma of such an \nevent cannot be overstated. Domestic and sexual violence is an issue \nthat affects us all, and we must all be part of a solution.\n  Since 1994, the Violence Against Women Act has been the centerpiece \nin our comprehensive approach to protect and empower women, and it must \nremain so. Since the passage of VAWA in 1994, there has been enormous \npositive change.\n  From 1993 to 2010, the rate of intimate partner violence declined 67 \npercent. More victims are reporting violence to police, and those \nreports are resulting in more arrests and prosecutions. VAWA is \nworking, but there are still women who need protection.\n  For example, in 1 day in New Jersey, a survey found that domestic \nviolence programs assisted 1,292 victims. On that same day, New Jersey \ndomestic violence hotlines answered 444 phone calls. So our work on \nthis issue is not yet done.\n  Looking to the merits of the reauthorization, let me highlight, for \nthe record, several critical changes in the legislation--changes that \ndid not simply extend successful programs but built upon them. Every \nreauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act has incorporated new \nunderstanding and updated knowledge, and this reauthorization was and \nshould be no different.\n  First and foremost, the Senate reauthorization includes additional \ntraining for law enforcement, victim services, and courts that increase \nthe focus on high-risk offenders and victims, including connecting \nhigh-risk victims with crisis intervention services. I am sure no one \ncan argue against that.\n  Second, the Senate bill strengthens our response to sexual assault \nwhile increasing the connection to nonprofit groups. Sexual assault \ncoalitions in every State have been indispensable allies. I met with a \nlarge roundtable before our debate and discussions in the Senate, and \nthis bill supports their efforts. It included a 20-percent setaside for \nassistance to States for sexual assault programs and also included \nreforms to reduce the unprecedented backlog of rape kits.\n  I have been proud to support funding to reduce this backlog. Just \nrecently I supported Senator Leahy's effort to fund the Debbie Smith \nDNA Backlog Grant Program at the current level of $125 million with at \nleast $90 million directly spent on reducing the DNA backlogs. I am \nhappy to say the Violence Against Women Act will make important strides \nto reduce the backlog.\n  Most importantly, given the debate on this legislation, this \nreauthorization recognizes that domestic and sexual violence affects \nall groups regardless of their sexual orientation. We included \ncommonsense protections against discrimination on race, religion, \nnational origin, sex, and disability because it is, quite simply, the \nright thing to do because all violence against women is an outrage to \nall of us.\n  For the first time the Senate bill established the fundamental notion \nthat victims cannot be denied services based on gender identity or \nsexual orientation. We included provisions to protect\n\n[[Page S3161]]\n\nimmigrant victims of violence and Native American victims.\n  In the Senate the bill passed 68 to 31 with a dozen Republicans \nvoting in support of the final legislation despite Republican attempts \nto weaken the bill during the Senate's consideration of the \nlegislation. Unfortunately, Republicans in the House are attempting to \nweaken the bill and do what a minority in the Senate could not. For the \nfirst time in the nearly 20-year history of the Violence Against Women \nAct, the House reauthorization doesn't expand protections but instead \neliminates a series of them.\n  In its version, the House sent an undeniable message: If you are \nNative American, LGBT, or undocumented, you do not deserve protection. \nThat is the House message.\n  To start, LGBT victims do not receive the protection they need in the \nHouse bill. Professionals in the field specifically requested \nnondiscrimination provisions based upon their direct experiences. \nStudies on the issue only confirm this need: 45 percent of LGBT victims \nwere turned away from domestic violence shelters, and 55 percent were \ndenied protective orders. The Senate version ensures all victims, gay \nor straight, share in the protections of VAWA. But the House version \ndenies these critical protections to LGBT victims.\n  Under the House legislation, immigrant victims of violence would fare \nfar worse than under current law--far worse than under current law. \nDomestic violence advocates tell us that often abusers threaten their \nsignificant others that they will take them to the authorities with the \npossibility of deportation unless they continue to submit themselves to \ndangerous and inhumane treatment.\n  The Violence Against Women Act provides a way out, but the House \nversion of that law does away with confidentiality protections for \nimmigrant victims. Studies have shown that victims are most vulnerable \nimmediately before or after they leave the abuser. VAWA protects these \nvictims with confidentiality when they come forward to seek help. The \nHouse version instead creates a cruel possibility that in seeking help, \nthe victim will be exposed and face more abuse. How perverse is that?\n  House Republicans would put burdensome new requirements on immigrant \nvictims and give them less help than they receive under the current \nlaw. The abuser often possesses the relevant evidence while the abused \nfaces language barriers, isolation, and limited access to legal \nrepresentation.\n  In past Violence Against Women Act debates, we have had wide \nbipartisan consensus around protections for these victims because a \nvictim is a victim is a victim. But the House reauthorization ignores \nthis consensus and places an unimaginable burden on self-petitioners.\n\n  Under the House proposal, the program to protect immigrant victims, \ncalled the U Visa Program, would be a hollow shell of its former self. \nThe permanent visa would now be temporary, reducing the incentive for \nimmigrants to take the risk and assist law enforcement in identifying \nthe person who may have committed a sexual rape.\n  Of course proponents claim these reforms are needed to combat \n``fraud'' in the system. But I have to ask: What fraud? To obtain a U \nvisa in the first place, law enforcement personnel must personally sign \noff. Is there a suggestion that somehow the law enforcement personnel \nare engaged in a fraud? There is no evidence of fraud in this program. \nThe simple enforcement technique has proven profoundly effective. Yet \nthe House insists on adding additional burdens on a vulnerable \npopulation only to fight a nonexistent problem.\n  Moreover, allowing these abusers to go free puts more criminals in \nour community who can then victimize more women in the future. Our \nwhole goal is to end the abuse and to get the abuser to ultimately face \nup to their punishment. Instead we would say: Oh, no. Let the abuser go \nahead and continue their abuse, and we will subject the victim \nultimately to a set of circumstances in which not only will they not \ncome forth and talk about the abuse, we will subject the victim \nultimately to facing even greater challenges in their lives.\n  Knowing what is at stake and what it would mean to the many victims \nof domestic violence and sexual violence, there is no question we must \npass final legislation as soon as possible. The debate should be about \none thing and one thing only: protecting victims, all victims. Each and \nevery one of these women in these categories is, in fact, a victim. \nThere should be no differentiation and there should be protection for \nall.\n  I yield the floor\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, earlier today I attended a memorial service \nto honor our Nation's law enforcement officers who laid down their \nlives to protect their fellow citizens. Since 1962, May 15 has stood as \na day of remembrance for the many fallen police officers who faithfully \nserved our communities and our Nation. They must never be forgotten.\n  This year 362 names were added to the National Law Enforcement \nOfficers Memorial, and among those names were three brave officers from \nKansas. Two of these men died in the line of duty many years ago, but \nwe paused today to remember their sacrifice.\n  In 1892 Andrew Balfour of Kiowa County was filling his duties as a \nlocal sheriff and pursuing a man who was wanted for theft when he was \nmortally wounded. Andrew passed away at the young age of 41, leaving \nbehind a wife and six children.\n  In 1992, William Bloomfield, a deputy sheriff, was serving in Bourbon \nCounty and arresting a well-known killer when he was killed during a \nfierce gun battle.\n  These two men were killed while carrying out their duties. Rather \nthan shirk from danger, police officers face danger with courage, and \nthat is exactly what these two men did.\n  Just 5 months ago, Kansans were grieved by the loss of another \nofficer, SGT David Enzbrenner of Atchison, KS. On December 9, 2001, \nDavid joined a fellow officer on a routine call to see a local \nresident. As they were turning to leave the front steps of the home, a \nperson suddenly appeared and opened fire on David without warning. This \nact of violence was unprovoked and forever robbed the Enzbrenner family \nof their father, husband, and the Atchison community of a loyal public \nservant.\n  When we lose someone in a community in Kansas, it is not just a name \nto us. It is somebody we go to church with, it is somebody we see at \nour kids' activities at school, it is somebody we know and care for. \nThat is how Atchison felt about David.\n  In remembering David, Atchison Mayor Allen Reavis said:\n\n       He was No. 1 father, No. 1 husband, No. 1 partner to his \n     fellow officers, No. 1 son.\n\n  Inscribed on the National Law Enforcement Memorial in Washington are \nthese words:\n\n       It is not how these officers died that made them heroes, it \n     is how they lived.\n\n  Police Chief Mike Wilson served alongside David for 24 years and \nreferred to the words inscribed on the National Law Enforcement \nMemorial when he said this about his former colleague and friend:\n\n       Those words speak directly to David. How true about our \n     brother.\n\n  David was dedicated to his family, his fellow law enforcement \nofficers, and his community. He was well known in Atchison and well \nloved. David attended high school there and served in the Atchison \nPolice Department for 24 years. David was also on the board of trustees \nat his local church and found great joy in teaching and coaching his \ndaughters on their softball teams.\n  Last December I witnessed the impact that David had on the local \ncommunity when I attended his memorial service and more than 2,000 \npeople gathered to pay their respects to him. During the service, many \nmoving tributes were read about David and how he lived his life. One \nthat stood out from among the others was a statement from David's wife \nKerri. She said this about her husband:\n\n       David was a man of few words. He always tried to keep a \n     simple life. And when I questioned things, he would remind me \n     that it's okay sometimes not to understand.\n\n\n[[Page S3162]]\n\n\n  We don't fully understand. We don't understand at all why David's \nlife was taken or why the lives of more than 19,000 officers we \nremembered today ended so soon. But we express our gratitude for their \nservice and dedication to their communities and to our country.\n  During National Police Week, we also remember their families and the \nloved ones they left behind. May God comfort them in their time of \ngrief and be a source of strength for them. May he also protect all \nthose who continue to serve today.\n  I want to especially mention David Enzbrenner's wife Kerri and his \nthree teenage daughters Avery, Abbi, and Celia. I want them to know we \nhonor the way David lived his life and tell them we love and care for \nthem today and always.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to join my \ncolleague, Senator Menendez, and I think some of our other colleagues \nwho will be here soon, to reaffirm our commitment to the \nreauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. That act recently \npassed out of the Senate with a strong bipartisan vote that recognizes \nour bipartisan commitment to end domestic and sexual abuse, stalking, \nand dating violence. The House of Representatives will soon be taking a \nvote on their proposed counterpart to the Violence Against Women Act, \nand I want to address some of the concerns I have with the bill that is \non the floor in the House.\n  What we have seen in this country is that domestic violence has a \nsignificant impact on families, on victims. It comprises the very \nstability of our towns and communities. The Violence Against Women Act \nprovides essential resources for victims and for law enforcement. I was \npleased to see so many of us in the Senate put politics aside and \nsupport this important reauthorization.\n  Unfortunately, the House version of the reauthorization of the \nViolence Against Women Act does not provide the same level of \nprotection for victims, and it does not include some resources that \nhave specifically been requested by law enforcement.\n  In the House bill protections are diminished for college students, \nfor lesbian, gay, and transgender victims, for immigrants, and for \nNative Americans.\n  The Senate bill strengthens the Violence Against Women Act to provide \nmore protections to more women and their families. The House bill \nweakens the law by failing to state that same-sex couples will have \nequal access to services, by decreasing protections for immigrant \nvictims, and by declining to expand the jurisdiction of tribal courts.\n  One example of some of the changes in the House bill, where I think \nit fails, is around protections the Senate bill provides to women \nstudents on college campuses.\n  The Senate bill provides strong protections that have been omitted in \nthe House bill. The Senate bill includes a provision requiring a \nuniversity to implement prevention programs, teaching all students, \nmale and female, how to help prevent sexual violence and dating \nviolence, including bystander education.\n  The Senate bill also requires a university to make reasonable \naccommodations for students who need to change their living, working, \nor academic situation as a result of being victimized. For example, if \na young woman is the victim of an assault and her attacker lives in her \ndorm, what the Senate bill would do is require the university to help \nthat young woman find another place to live. Unfortunately, these kinds \nof protections are not included in the House bill.\n  The Department of Justice recently estimated that 25 percent of \ncollege women will be victims of rape or attempted rape before they \ngraduate within a 4-year college period, and women between the ages of \n16 to 24 will experience rape at a rate that is four times higher than \nthe assault rate for all women.\n  There is no doubt this is a serious problem. The safeguards we \nimplemented in the Senate bill must be preserved if we are to provide \nthe protections that young women and men in college deserve.\n  When we were working on our reauthorization in the Senate, I had a \nchance to meet with case workers at crisis centers and with some of the \nvictims of domestic violence in New Hampshire.\n  I heard from one woman who said if it had not been for that 24-hour \nhotline and her caseworker at the Bridges Crisis Center in Nashua, she \nwould never have been able to leave her abuser. She was finally able to \nstand up for herself and end the terrible cycle of abuse because of the \nViolence Against Women Act.\n  All victims should have equal access to these important resources, \nand it is imperative this bill provide that.\n  So I urge my colleagues in the House to insist on these essential \ncomponents so we can move forward on this reauthorization and we can \nprotect all of the victims of domestic violence.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/15/senate-section/article/S3162-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3162-S3164]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING CHUCK COLSON\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I rise this evening to honor a longtime \nfriend, confidant, and mentor, Chuck Colson, whose life we will \ncelebrate tomorrow at a memorial service at the National Cathedral.\n  It has been said that a man's character can be tested by the way he \nresponds to adversity. If that is the case, Chuck Colson's character \nwas one of remarkable strength, tenacity, faith, and humility.\n  Chuck was a brilliant man with a resume of impressive accomplishments \nat a very young age: A scholarship to an Ivy League school and a law \ndegree from George Washington University; a veteran and, at one time, \nthe youngest captain in the Marine Corps; a former chief of staff to a \nU.S. Senator from Massachusetts; and then top assistant and legal \ncounsel to the President of the United States.\n  Now, this does not sound like the type of man who would find himself \nsitting alone in a Federal prison cell, but that is exactly what \nhappened to Chuck Colson, and what happened there changed his life \nforever.\n  Known as President Nixon's ``hatchet man,'' Colson pleaded guilty to \nobstruction of justice in the Daniel Ellsberg case during the Watergate \nscandal and went from White House Special Counsel to incarcerated \nfelon.\n  In 1974, Chuck Colson entered Maxwell Federal Prison Camp in Alabama. \nThis fall from perhaps the closest confidant of the President of the \nUnited States to a Federal prison cell is about as far and as deep as \nanyone can fall. That is what we call hitting rock bottom. But rock \nbottom for Chuck Colson became a time of repentance, a time of grace, \nand a time of transformation.\n\n  Far from the Rose Garden, it was behind those prison bars where Chuck \nColson made one of the most important decisions of his life--one that \nwould impact the lives of thousands. He decided to dedicate the rest of \nhis life serving the God he loved.\n  Scripture in Proverbs reads:\n\n       Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your \n     own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he \n     will make your paths straight.\n\n  With a redemption that can only come through the grace of God, and \nwith a renewed sense of vision, Chuck did just that. He put his trust \nin the Lord and submitted to Him. He decided to let God write the story \nof his life rather than trying to control his own destiny.\n  That transformation is the story we will celebrate tomorrow at the \nNational Cathedral--a story of redemption and a testament to the power \nof God's forgiveness and love.\n  Chuck Colson's experience in prison and his renewed sense of vision \nopened his eyes to a sector of our society that is often forgotten. \nOnce a prisoner himself--and having experienced the depth of his own \nneed for repentance and transformation; even those at the very bottom \nof society--Chuck believed that God could change them and any willing \nheart.\n\n[[Page S3163]]\n\n  As described in the first two of his many published books--the first \none, ``Born Again,'' and the second one, ``Life Sentence''--Chuck \ndedicated his now transformed life to serving prison inmates and the \nfamilies of prisoners.\n  In 1976, he practiced what he preached and founded Prison Fellowship, \na Christian ministry to give prisoners the opportunity to experience \nthe radically transforming power of Christ that he had experienced \nhimself.\n  Chuck Colson's ministry took him to visit 600 prisons in the United \nStates and in 40 other countries. He worked relentlessly to improve \nprison conditions, increase access to religious programs, and provide \nresources and support to the families of prisoners.\n  Prison ministry was not his only passion. In his later years, Chuck \nfocused his efforts on developing other Christian leaders who could \ninfluence their communities through their faith. This became the \ncornerstone of the Chuck Colson Center for Christian Worldview, a \nresearch and training center established to promote Christian worldview \nteaching.\n  Chuck has touched the lives of many people through his ministry, \nbooks, lectures, and charity work. I am one of those who is personally \ngrateful for the positive influence he has had on my life.\n  It was in April 1976 that I attended an annual Fort Wayne, IN, \nmayor's prayer breakfast. I was intrigued with the speaker who was \nannounced as Chuck Colson--recently released from prison, formerly a \nWatergate figure and legal counsel to the President.\n  As I sat through his presentation, I was touched in a way and reached \nin a way that transformed my life, and I am ever grateful to Chuck \nColson for using himself as, I think, a conduit for a message I also \nneeded to receive.\n  It resulted in a radical change of course for me: from a predictable, \nsettled, purposeful, I thought, life as an attorney in a midsized firm \nin Fort Wayne, IN, to becoming engaged in politics, something I never \nthought I would engage in. It was Chuck Colson who made me ask that \nsame question and make that same decision he made; that is, to no \nlonger try to control the direction of my life, but subject myself to \nthe control of someone who had a plan for me. And that plan was not a \nspecific one of serving in the Senate or Congress. It was simply to be \nopen to the possibility of a path that perhaps I had not ever thought \nwould be taken.\n  As a consequence of that, and as a consequence of a string of events \nthat is impossible for me to claim any credit for, I find myself \nstanding here in the Senate delivering this tribute to Chuck Colson.\n  Marsha and I will miss him greatly. We will continue to be motivated \nand inspired by the example of how life should be lived.\n  When I first came to the Senate, I was here just 2 days when I \nreceived a call from Chuck Colson. He said: I have a gift for you. It \nis a precious gift, and one I do not want to give, but I think this \ngift can be more useful to someone who can speak as a U.S. Senator than \nto someone like me who can speak as head of Prison Fellowship.\n  That gift was a young man by the name of Michael Gerson, who had, \nafter leaving college, worked for Prison Fellowship and, both through \npolicy decisions and through the written word, helped Chuck with his \nministry.\n  This young man worked for me for a number of years, and I was the \nvoice of his thinking and the voice of his written messages. He went on \nto become a speech writer for a Presidential candidate and then the \nchief speech writer for President George W. Bush.\n  Michael Gerson wrote a piece that was published in the Washington \nPost on April 22 titled ``Charles Colson found freedom in prison.'' I \nthink that piece certainly is worth reading. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the article be printed in the Record immediately following my \nremarks.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. COATS. Mike Gerson said in his column:\n\n       Chuck led a movement of volunteers attempting to love some \n     of their least lovable neighbors. This inversion of social \n     priorities--putting the last first--is the best evidence of a \n     faith that is more than a crutch, opiate, or self-help \n     program. It is the hallmark of authentic religion--and it is \n     the vast, humane contribution of Chuck Colson. Chuck Colson's \n     remarkable life story can serve as a guiding light and \n     provide all of us the courage and the strength to overcome \n     whatever adversity we may face in our own lives.\n\n  May we remember the example of Chuck Colson and the words prayed so \noften by my very good friend:\n\n       Please show me how You want me to live and give me the \n     power to live that way.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 22, 2012]\n\n                 Charles Colson Found Freedom in Prison\n\n                          (By Michael Gerson)\n\n       Charles W. Colson--who spent seven months in prison for \n     Watergate-era offenses and became one of the most influential \n     social reformers of the 20th century--was the most thoroughly \n     converted person I've ever known.\n       Following Chuck's recent death, the news media--with short \n     attention spans but long memories--have focused on the \n     Watergate portion of his career. They preserve the image of a \n     public figure at the moment when the public glare was \n     harshest--a picture taken when the flash bulbs popped in \n     1974.\n       But I first met Chuck more than a decade after he left the \n     gates of Alabama's Maxwell prison. I was a job-seeking \n     college senior, in whom Chuck detected some well-hidden \n     potential as a research assistant. In him, I found my \n     greatest example of the transforming power of grace. I had \n     read many of the Watergate books, in which Chuck appears as a \n     character with few virtues apart from loyalty. I knew a \n     different man. The surface was recognizable--the Marine's \n     intensity, the lawyer's restless intellect. The essence, \n     however, had changed. He was a patient and generous mentor. \n     And he was consumed--utterly consumed--by his calling to \n     serve prisoners, ex-prisoners and their families.\n       Many wondered at Chuck's sudden conversion to Christianity. \n     He seemed to wonder at it himself. He spent each day that \n     followed, for nearly 40 years, dazzled by his own implausible \n     redemption. It is the reason he never hedged or hesitated in \n     describing his relationship with Jesus Christ. Chuck was \n     possessed, not by some cause, but by someone.\n       He stood in a long line of celebrated converts, beginning \n     with the Apostle Paul on the Damascus road, and including \n     figures such as John Newton, G.K. Chesterton and Malcolm \n     Muggeridge. They were often received with skepticism, even \n     contempt. Conversion is a form of confession--a public \n     admission of sin, failure and weakness. It brings out the \n     scoffers. This means little to the converted, who have \n     experienced something more powerful than derision. In his \n     poem, ``The Convert,'' Chesterton concludes: ``And all these \n     things are less than dust to me/ Because my name is Lazarus \n     and I live.''\n       Prison often figures large in conversion stories. Pride is \n     the enemy of grace, and prison is the enemy of pride. ``How \n     else but through a broken heart,'' wrote Oscar Wilde after \n     leaving Reading Gaol, ``may Lord Christ enter in?'' It is the \n     central paradox of Christianity that fulfillment starts in \n     emptiness, that streams emerge in the desert, that freedom \n     can be found in a prison cell. Chuck's swift journey from the \n     White House to a penitentiary ended a life of \n     accomplishment--only to begin a life of significance. The two \n     are not always the same. The destruction of Chuck's career \n     freed up his skills for a calling he would not have chosen, \n     providing fulfillment beyond his ambitions. I often heard him \n     quote Alexander Solzhenitsyn, and mean it: ``Bless you, \n     prison, for having been in my life.''\n       Chuck was a powerful preacher, an influential cultural \n     critic and a pioneer of the dialogue between evangelicals and \n     Catholics. But he was always drawn back to the scene of his \n     disgrace and his deliverance. The ministry he founded, Prison \n     Fellowship, is the largest compassionate outreach to \n     prisoners and their families in the world, with activities in \n     more than 100 countries. It also plays a morally clarifying \n     role. It is easier to serve the sympathetic. Prisoners call \n     the bluff of our belief in human dignity. If everyone matters \n     and counts, then criminals do as well. Chuck led a movement \n     of volunteers attempting to love some of their least lovable \n     neighbors. This inversion of social priorities--putting the \n     last first--is the best evidence of a faith that is more than \n     crutch, opiate or self-help program. It is the hallmark of \n     authentic religion--and it is the vast, humane contribution \n     of Chuck Colson.\n       It is a strange feeling to lose a mentor--a sensation of \n     being old and small and exposed outside his shade. Chuck's \n     irrational confidence in my 21-year-old self felt a little \n     like grace itself. The scale of his life--a broad arc from \n     politics to prison to humanitarian achievement--is also the \n     scale of his absence. But no one was better prepared for \n     death. No one more confident in the resurrection--having \n     experienced it once already. So my grief at Chuck's passing \n     comes tempered--because he was Lazarus, and he lives.\n\n  Mr. COATS.

Mr. President, it is very hard to believe that today \nmarks exactly 2 months since I first came to the floor to advocate \npassage of the Senate's version of the Violence Against Women Act. I \nwas very encouraged to see our body finally come together and \neventually support this important legislation. The Violence Against \nWomen Act has helped provide lifesaving assistance to hundreds of \nthousands of women and their families, and it certainly was a no-\nbrainer to make sure all women had access to that assistance.\n  However, I was very disappointed to learn that, a day after we passed \nit, House Republicans pulled an immediate U-turn and introduced their \nversion of the bill that would undo the commonsense progress we made. \nThe House Republican version of VAWA is a giant step backward for \nvictims of domestic violence. It is dangerous and irresponsible and \nleaves women across the country more vulnerable to domestic abuse. Not \nonly do they remove important protections that would be created by the \nSenate version of the bill, they actually strip existing protections \nalready provided by this important law. In fact, it removes critical \nprotections for LGBT victims, does little to address the epidemic of \ndomestic and sexual violence in tribal communities, removes critical \nprotections already in place for students on college campuses, and it \nrolls back protections for immigrant victims.\n  We have made a lot of progress since VAWA was first passed back in \n1994. I hope no one will insist on putting partisan politics ahead of \nprotecting victims of domestic violence. Where a person lives, whom \nthey love or what their citizenship status may be should not determine \nwhether their perpetrators are brought to justice.\n  The Senate bill that we passed last month builds on what works in the \ncurrent law, it improves what doesn't, and it continues on the path of \nreducing violence toward women. It certainly should not be \ncontroversial.\n  Mr. President, it is time for the House Republicans to come to their \nsenses and support our bipartisan bill so that women and families in \nthis country can get the resources and support they need.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today, I would like to recognize what \nAbraham Lincoln referred to as ``the people's department''--the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture.\n  On this day 150 years ago, President Lincoln signed legislation to \ncreate the U.S. Department of Agriculture. At the beginning, USDA's \nfocus was on agriculture research, farming techniques, and keeping \nstatistics. Today, more than ever, the USDA is ``the people's \ndepartment.'' The USDA covers a broad range of issues that touch \npeople's lives, from soil and water conservation to the school lunch \nprogram and from agriculture trade to expanding rural broadband \nservices.\n  Through the efforts of USDA over the past 150 years, agriculture has \nbecome one of the most successful sectors in the U.S. economy. \nAgriculture accounts for 1 in 12 American jobs and provides our country \nwith 86 percent of the food we consume. In 2011, agriculture trade set \nrecords by exporting nearly $140 billion in U.S. farm exports.\n  The USDA has worked to develop rural communities, conserve the \nenvironment, and ensure that people across the country have access to \nsafe and healthy food choices. In rural communities, USDA has given \nmoney to improve health care facilities, grants to assist families \npurchase or refinance homes, and investments to secure broadband \nservices. USDA has worked to protect critical wetlands habitats, \nNational Forests, and water and soil. And USDA ensures the health and \nsafety of Americans by providing nutrition assistance through SNAP \npayments, reforming the school lunch program, and adopting tougher \nstandards for E. coli and Salmonella in animal production.\n  Illinois has played a large part in the evolution of agriculture \npolicy. President Lincoln gained his respect for agriculture from his \ntime spent on farms and in rural communities around the state of \nIllinois as well as in Kentucky and Indiana. The same year President \nLincoln began USDA, he also signed into law the Homestead Act and the \nMorrill Land Grant College Act. Illinois has also had two Secretaries \nof USDA--John Block, who served from 1981 until 1986, and Edward \nMadigan, who served from 1991 through 1993.\n  Over the past 150 years, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has lived \nup to Lincoln's vision as a department for the people. I hope USDA \ncontinues its commitment to improve agriculture, nutrition, and rural \ncommunities around the country and across the globe in the Department's \nnext 150 years.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture on 150 years of service to the people of \nAmerica.\n  On this day in 1862, President Abraham Lincoln created the Bureau of \nAgriculture and with it, America's commitment to an abundant supply of \nfood and fiber. Lincoln grew up on a farm, and he understood the long \nhours of hard work that men and women like his parents spent working \nthe land. Farming in those days was a very different proposition--much \nof the work was done by hand or animal labor. He rightly called it the \nPeople's Department because 90 percent of Americans at the time worked, \nlike his folks, on farms.\n  Lincoln created the USDA at a time of great change in agriculture. \nMachinery was being introduced that lessened the workload and made \nfarming more efficient. Families were heading westward and expanding \nthe frontier. It was only 5 days later that Lincoln signed another \nimportant law that would have a dramatic effect on the future of \nagriculture in this country: the Homestead Act. That same year, Lincoln \nwould also sign the law creating the Transcontinental Railroad, as well \nas the Land Grant Colleges Act, which has special meaning for me as a \nMichigan State University graduate.\n  But here is the most amazing thing: he did all of this during some of \nthe worst fighting of the Civil War.\n  When he put pen to paper to create the Bureau of Agriculture, there \nhad already been more than 100,000 casualties in the Civil War. He \ncreated all of these institutions that would have a lasting impact on \nthis great Nation at a time when many people wondered how long this \nNation could survive.\n  Mr. President, 150 years ago, in his address to Congress, Lincoln \nsaid, ``Fellow citizens, we cannot escape history. The fiery trial \nthrough which we pass will light us in honor or dishonor to the last \ngeneration.''\n  President Lincoln rose to the challenge. He saved the Union, and he \ncreated lasting institutions that are still with us and making a \ndifference today.\n  If he could do all that in the middle of the Civil War, with enemy \ntroops camped just across the river, what challenge can't we face \ntoday?\n  In the Agriculture Committee, we came together last month to pass, \nwith an overwhelming bipartisan vote, the Agriculture Reform, Food and \nJobs Act, or the farm bill. This is a bill we pass every 5 years to \nrenew America's agriculture policy and to continue the important work \nof the Department of Agriculture.\n  It is critical that we pass the farm bill before the current bill \nexpires in September. We passed a very strong\n\n[[Page S3165]]\n\nbill out of committee, with real reforms that cut the deficit by $23 \nbillion, and we did it in a bipartisan way.\n  We evaluated every program, eliminated duplication, and streamlined \nprograms to save taxpayers money while getting better results on the \nground, and we did it in a bipartisan way.\n  Change is never easy, but we came together because the farm bill is \nso important to the 16 million men and women whose jobs rely on \nAmerican agriculture. They work hard every day producing the most \naffordable, healthy, and abundant supply of food, fiber, and energy in \nthe world.\n  President Lincoln understood how important our food supply is--it \nfeeds the Nation and can be the difference in times of war. The \nleadership and innovation of those 16 million Americans have made our \nNation the world's leader in agriculture. With an ever-growing global \npopulation, our farmers are truly feeding the world. It is critical for \nour national security that we pass this farm bill to continue our \nleadership.\n  It has been 150 years since President Lincoln created America's \ncommitment to agriculture, and we have come a long way since then. We \nhave been through floods and famines, dust bowls and depressions. But \nwe have also seen great advances as we have learned to overcome these \nchallenges with better risk management, conservation practices, and a \ncommitment to fighting hunger.\n  Passing the farm bill will continue this great American success \nstory.\n  The 150th anniversary of USDA's creation is a great time to celebrate \nfarmers and rural communities. It is also a strong reminder that we \nhere in Congress need to do our jobs too and pass the farm bill soon. \nOur country's future depends on it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Today marks the 150th anniversary of the United States \nDepartment of Agriculture, and I would like to take a moment to pay \ntribute to USDA's mission and day-to-day work and to all those involved \nin the agriculture industry--from farmers and ranchers and foresters, \nto producers and manufacturers and researchers.\n  The Department of Agriculture is pillar and post in American \nagriculture, fostering durability while enabling innovation; bridging \nold and new, rural and urban. Agriculture has long been a centerpiece \nof Vermont's economy and way of life. The impact of agricultural \nindustry is felt in every State, and in every household. In fact, one \nin every 12 Americans is employed in an agriculture-related industry, \nand in Vermont, the importance of our agricultural working landscape to \ntourism, to recreation and to the identity of our State is beyond \nmeasure.\n  One hundred and fifty years ago today, on May 15, 1862, with the \nstroke of President Abraham Lincoln's pen, the Department of \nAgriculture was established, with the purpose of acquiring information \nthrough ``scientific experiments'' and finding, collecting, and \ndisseminating ``new and valuable seeds and plants.'' It is worth noting \nthat the establishment of the USDA was the first in a series of the \nfoundational acts of Congress that helped to develop our modern \nagricultural system.\n  Among these other landmark laws is the Morrill Act, named for \nVermont's own Senator Justin Morrill, which established our land grant \ncolleges, and which also is celebrating its 150th anniversary this \nyear. Senator Morrill rightly believed that college education should \nexpand beyond arts and classical studies to include agriculture and \nlife sciences. In the last 150 years, our land grant colleges have \nprovided the foundation for agricultural research and have helped give \nthe United States a competitive advantage in the global market, in \naddition to becoming inarguably the best public institutions of higher \nlearning in the world.\n  Thanks to the hard work of our Nation's agricultural producers, to \nthe research done at our land grant colleges, to the dedication of U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture employees across the country, and to the \npolicies and programs overseen by the Department of Agriculture, \nAmerican consumers enjoy a safe and plentiful food supply. We Americans \nspend, on average, less than 10 percent of our disposable income on \nfood, the lowest in the world. This would not be possible without the \nscience, policies, and vital programs advanced by the USDA in fostering \nour modernized agricultural and food systems.\n  The Department of Agriculture also manages some of the Nation's most \nsignificant ongoing conservation and environmental quality efforts.\n  Farming is hard work. Farming also is an inherently risky venture, \nsubject to the whims of nature, as well as the volatility of the \ncommodity marketplace. The programs USDA manages at the local level \nhave helped make risk manageable for farmers--especially when it comes \nto small family farms. These programs have been a steadying element--a \nbalance wheel, smoothing out major risks, allowing America's farmers to \nharness the earth's bounty and giving American consumers access to \nunrivaled food security and variety.\n  Despite--and, in some cases, as an unintended result of--the great \nadvances in agriculture in the last 150 years, there is more work to be \ndone. Too many Americans still endure hunger, with almost 50 million \nAmericans living in food insecure households, while at the same time \ntwo-thirds of Americans are overweight, and obesity-related disease is \nfast becoming an epidemic in this country. Globally, 1 billion people--\nout of a population of 7 billion--are hungry and food insecure. As the \nworld population increases, we must continue our scientific effort in \nagriculture research and innovation, and we must not simply produce \nmore food; we must also improve access to and consumption of healthier \nfoods. These goals need to be achieved while we work to restore natural \necosystems that are fundamental to sustaining life on earth.\n  My home State of Vermont has placed itself at the forefront of \ndeveloping and implementing the agricultural and food systems that the \nplanet will depend on in the 21st century, and the USDA is a critical \npartner in this essential venture. The USDA is providing needed \ntechnical support to enhance the efficiency of our dairy and \ndiversified farms; the USDA provides the financial and risk management \ntools that farmers need to diversify and survive in a changing climate \nand volatile markets; the USDA supports cutting-edge research at the \nland grant University of Vermont; the USDA is vitally important to \nrural communities and businesses; USDA conservation programs are the \nlynchpin of our work to improve water quality; and the USDA Organic \nprogram has kept Vermont at the forefront of this fast-growing and \npromising sector. In fact, in Vermont, and across the Nation, the \nDepartment of Agriculture manages some of the Nation's most significant \nongoing conservation and environmental quality efforts.\n  The USDA has deep and longstanding roots throughout rural America and \nin our communities. Being in and being of the communities that the USDA \nserves makes a crucial difference, as we saw last year in Vermont \nthrough the many ways that USDA's diligent workforce became an integral \npart of the response to the disastrous damage wrought by Hurricane/\nTropical Storm Irene.\n  We face many challenges today, but with smart, effective and \nsustainable agricultural policies, the United States is in a prime \nposition to lead the war against global hunger and toward public health \nwhile also protecting our water, air and open spaces for generations to \ncome.\n  As a lifelong Vermonter, I value my State's farming traditions and I \nam proud of the hard work of Vermont's farmers who have persisted in a \ndifficult economy, embracing innovation and change. Some are \ntransitioning to organic operations, and others focusing on direct \nmarketing opportunities or value-added products. Farming is not an easy \nway of life, but it has remained a cornerstone of Vermont's economy, \nand the Nation's, because of the dedication our farmers and producers, \nthe research of our land grant colleges, and the policies and support \nof the Department of Agriculture. I am proud to see so many young \npeople returning to the farms of Vermont. Some are continuing their \nfamily's farming legacy, while others are the first in several \ngenerations to turn back to the land. All of them have a deep \ndedication to the stewardship of Vermont's natural resources and to the \nworking landscape that is helping to strengthen our economy.\n\n[[Page S3166]]\n\n  I am proud to be a member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry and to have had the opportunity to serve as its \nchairman. I also consider it a great privilege to be able to offer \nVermonters a seat at the table when policy matters affecting our \nState's farmers and our State's economy, such as our current work on \nthe 2012 Farm Bill, are written and considered.\n  Agriculture is part of the lifeblood of the American economy then, \nnow, and in the future.\n  I wish the Department of Agriculture a ``Happy 150th Birthday'' and \ncontinued success in the USDA's vital missions that are so important to \neach and every American family, and to the world.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the marking of \nan historic event. 150 years ago--on May 15, 1862--President Abraham \nLincoln signed into law an Act establishing what our Department of \nAgriculture is today.\n  Agriculture has come a long way in 150 years. Through science, \ninnovation, ingenuity and plain old hard work, America's farmers have \ngone from producing enough food for their individual families to \nproducing enough to meet the needs of 150 people per farmer--that's \nwhat I call the miracle of modern agriculture.\n  Some may have a romanticized view of agriculture production 150 years \nago and pine for a return to the days of the past. But let me assure \nyou, those were hard days. And if today's farmers and ranchers only \nproduced the same yield and quality of food as the farmers and ranchers \nof yesteryear, we'd be in a world of hurt.\n  Today's farmers and ranchers produce the safest, most abundant and \naffordable food and fiber supply in the world--all while facing \nincreased input costs and tightening regulations.\n  As if these challenges weren't enough, our producers face a challenge \nof worldwide significance. As the global population tops 9 billion in \nthe next several decades, agriculture production must more than double \nto meet the expected demand for food and nutrition.\n  In addition to the sheer population expansion, global food demand \nwill shift toward higher value proteins and commodities as economies \ndevelop and prosper. For example, in 1985 the average person in China \nconsumed roughly 44 pounds of meat. This increased to 90 pounds per \nperson in a short 15 years. That number is expected to double again by \n2030.\n  That's no small task. It will take advancements in technology, \nefficiency and in some cases simply getting government and regulatory \nroadblocks out of the way. Doubling agriculture production will only \noccur through production techniques that combine the use of important \nconservation practices with the use of improved seed varieties that \nincrease drought and disease resistance while increasing yields.\n  The importance of agriculture's mission cannot be overstated. It is \nalso a matter of national security. A well fed world is a much safer \nand stable place than a hungry world. Full bellies lead to stability, \neconomic growth and peace. Hungry bellies lead to discontent, \ninstability, and extremism.\n  The more nations we can help to feed and bring economic prosperity, \nthe more stable the world as a whole will become.\n  Now I don't know if 150 years ago President Lincoln knew how \nimportant the role of agriculture would become to global stability or \nwhat USDA's role would be in answering these challenges. But this \nanniversary provides us a unique opportunity to thank our producers for \ntheir efforts in bringing agriculture this far, and to let them know \nthat we stand beside them in meeting the challenges ahead.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, on this day, May 15, in 1862, President \nLincoln signed into law an act establishing our nation's Department of \nAgriculture. This 150th anniversary is an important opportunity to \nrecognize and celebrate the success and achievement of the many \nAmericans who are involved directly or indirectly in producing, \nprocessing, and distributing food, fuel, and fiber for our nation and \nfor export to foreign consumers.\n  The specific purposes of the new department mentioned in the 1862 act \nare ``to acquire and diffuse among the people of the United States \nuseful information'' concerning agriculture, broadly and \ncomprehensively defined, and ``to procure, propagate, and distribute \namong the people new and valuable seeds and plants.'' The \nresponsibilities and authority entrusted to the Department of \nAgriculture have of course been enlarged over the course of the past \n150 years, but this initial legislation contains the core elements of \nthe Department's mission and role that have continued to this day.\n  You will notice in the act the emphasis on disseminating among the \npeople of the United States information, knowledge, and technology that \nwould be helpful and useful to them as in their pursuits in \nagriculture. In doing so, the new Department would help to create, \nfoster, and develop new, broadly-available opportunities among the \npeople of the United States. Individuals and families could then \ncapitalize on these opportunities through applying their own efforts \nand talents to create and grow farms and ranches, and in the process \nalso to build and strengthen our nation. Some 2\\1/2\\ years later after \nsigning the act, President Lincoln noted in his fourth and last message \nto Congress the success of the new Department of Agriculture in \nresponding to and serving the needs of the people of our Nation: ``It \nis peculiarly the people's department, in which they feel more directly \nconcerned than in any other.''\n  Two other landmark pieces of legislation in 1862 also reflect this \napproach of the Federal government offering a helping hand to the \npeople of our nation in developing American agriculture. On May 20, \n1862, President Lincoln signed what is commonly known as the Homestead \nAct in order to provide people who would otherwise not have the chance \nan opportunity to own land. And on July 2, 1862, President Lincoln \nsigned into law the first Morrill Act to donate public lands to the \nstates and territories to support education ``related to agriculture \nand mechanic arts''. This act was the first Federal assistance to \nhigher education, and its purpose was to make this education widely \navailable to multitudes of people who otherwise never would have \nobtained it.\n  Over the ensuing years, our Nation has benefited tremendously from \nthese policies. The productivity of America's farmers and ranchers, \nalong with those working in associated businesses and industries, is a \nfoundation for our national economy and our way of life. We have been \nblessed in this country with a richness of natural resources to which \nAmericans have applied their hard work, knowledge, and talents. The \nabundance of America's agricultural output has been instrumental in \nsupporting our people and enabling them to pursue and to excel in many \nother fields. To be sure, our Nation's history has proven the wisdom of \nDaniel Webster's observation in 1840, ``When tillage begins, other arts \nfollow.''\n  The responsibilities of the Department of Agriculture have of course \ngrown over the years as the circumstances and needs of our Nation and \nits people have changed. The Department continues to play a critical \nrole in supporting research, education, and extension involving food, \nagriculture, and related topics. It helps agricultural producers \nsurvive unpredictable economic losses from market fluctuations and \ndamaging weather. The Department provides critical assistance to \nfarmers and ranchers in conserving and protecting soil, water, \nwildlife, and other natural resources for future generations. And USDA \nnutrition assistance enables American children to eat healthy lunches, \nbreakfasts, and snacks and low-income families to put food on the \ntable. The Department of Agriculture also provides important assistance \ntoward developing new sources of rural renewable energy and biobased \nproducts. Rural communities benefit from USDA programs that support \nvital facilities and foster the creation and growth of businesses and \njobs. Of course, consumers rely on USDA to protect and ensure the \nsafety of their meat and poultry. And its trade promoting efforts boost \nour agricultural exports.\n  On this anniversary of the Department of Agriculture, it is also \nimportant to recognize and commend the dedication, talent, and hard \nwork of all of the people working in the Department of Agriculture \nwherever they may be--in local, county, State, or regional offices, \nhere in Washington, or\n\n[[Page S3167]]\n\nin a foreign country. I am also of course proud that several Iowans \nhave very capably led the Department of Agriculture, including our \npresent secretary, Tom Vilsack.\n  So, today is a time to reflect upon and recognize the achievements of \nAmerican agriculture and the contributions to that success from the \nDepartment of Agriculture. It is also a time to appraise and consider \nthe huge challenges we face in the years ahead in producing the \nquantities of food needed to eradicate hunger in a growing global \npopulation and to do so in ways that conserve and sustain natural \nresources. Undoubtedly, our Nation and our Department of Agriculture \nwill be called upon to continue our leadership in responding to and \nsolving these crucial challenges.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to commemorate \nthe 150 year anniversary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n  I am pleased that my colleagues in the Senate have agreed the \noccasion is worthy of a resolution honoring this milestone in our \nnation's history. On May 15, 1862, President Abraham Lincoln signed \nlegislation to establish the USDA. It gave the agency general authority \nto acquire and spread useful information on agricultural subjects and \nto assist in the development and use of new and valuable seeds and \nplants.\n  For the past 150 years, USDA has lent a helping hand to our farmers \nand ranchers as they provide the food, feed, fiber, and fuel to \nAmericans, as well as a growing customer base around the world. In the \n1850s, there was 1 farmer for every 2 people in the United States. \nThanks to ongoing improvements in technology and management practices, \ntoday's farmers and ranchers are able to produce even more with \nefficient use of resources. Currently, the average farmer in the United \nStates feeds more than 150 people.\n  The history of Nebraska has been closely intertwined with this story. \nIn fact, thousands of homesteaders settled in the Nebraska territory \nafter President Lincoln signed another piece of legislation--the \nHomestead Act--on May 20, 1862. This influx of population led to \nNebraska becoming the Nation's 37th State. Since that time, USDA has \nserved as a resource to the many farmers and ranchers who continue to \nmake agriculture the leading industry in Nebraska's economy--just as \nthe department has done for producers nationwide.\n  As the 28th Secretary of Agriculture, I was proud to work with men \nand women who are still committed to USDA's original mission of \nspreading information and developing new technologies to increase \nagricultural production.\n  Today's Department of Agriculture conducts valuable research through \nthe land-grant university system and institutions like the University \nof Nebraska. USDA also helps to minimize the risks of weather and \ncommodity price volatility for producers. And, the department helps to \nprotect the health of our plants and animals. But, USDA's mission goes \nbeyond helping producers. For example, those who enjoy a good steak, as \nwell as other meat and poultry products in the U.S., have come to trust \nUSDA's food safety inspection process.\n  Of growing importance is USDA's role in promoting exports of \nagriculture products. It is fitting that this anniversary falls in \nMay--which is also world trade month. I think we can all agree that the \nbenefits of trade are great especially to the agriculture sector.\n  Nebraska is a big agricultural State. And, in Nebraska alone, more \nthan 30,000 jobs and more than $7.6 billion dollars in revenue were \ndirectly tied to exports last year. And, these numbers will only grow \nas we continue to expand access to customers around the world.\n  In fact, the Colombia Free Trade Agreement goes into effect today. It \noffers great opportunity to both the manufacturing and agriculture \nsectors. The Colombia Agreement eliminates barriers for many Nebraska \nagricultural products, including beef, corn, soybeans, pork, and wheat. \nFor some time now, goods from Colombia have been entering the U.S. \ntariff-free, while American producers still paid tariffs on exports to \nColombia as high as 40 percent.\n  It is good news for our agriculture producers and manufacturers that \ntrade agreements are finally being implemented. The South Korea \nAgreement has already gone into effect, and I hope Panama Agreement \nwon't be far behind. These types of free trade agreements are sorely \nneeded so we can level the playing field for our exporters.\n  We cannot ignore the fact that the fastest-growing opportunities for \nAmerican businesses, farms, and ranches are outside our borders. They \nare overseas in rapidly developing countries. I am confident that \nNebraska farmers, businesses and workers, and those across the country, \ncan compete with anyone in the world. And, in doing so, we can create \nnew jobs here at home.\n  USDA has played a key role in making sure our farmers and ranchers \nhave the tools to take advantage of these export opportunities. \nAdditionally, the department recognizes that American agriculture is \nintertwined with the health of our rural communities. USDA works to \nensure small-town-America is not overlooked by a Federal Government \nthat is often focused on big urban areas.\n  Over the past 150 years, President Lincoln's vision of ``the People's \nDepartment'' has expanded beyond America's farms and ranches and rural \ncommunities. His vision is alive and well in the health of our \nschoolchildren, in our ability to supply energy from homegrown sources, \nand in our leadership role in helping feed some of the hungriest and \nneediest people around the world.\n  A key part of USDA's mission--one that consumes the largest portion \nof USDA's budget--is addressing hunger and meeting the nutritional \nneeds of Americans. Whether through school lunches or assistance for \nhungry families, USDA plays an important role in supporting those in \nneed.\n  USDA's mission is one of the most diverse of any department and in \nevery area there are hard-working staff striving to meet the \ndepartment's goals. On this day, I am happy to recognize the men and \nwomen of the ``People's Department.'' Their professionalism, \ndedication, and work ethic provide a shining example of why President \nLincoln called the Department of Agriculture the ``People's \nDepartment.''\n  Together, we celebrate the growth and success of American agriculture \nand the health and well-being of the people of the United States. We \nhonor the farmers, ranchers, and others whose ingenuity, adaptability, \nand skill have created the safest and most abundant food supply in the \nhistory of mankind.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to help recognize the 150th \nbirthday of the United States Department of Agriculture--USDA. As a \nmember of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry \nas well as the Committee on Foreign Relations, I understand the \nimportance of agriculture to feeding our Nation and feeding the world.\n  One hundred and fifty years ago today President Abraham Lincoln \nsigned the legislation creating the Department of Agriculture. This was \nfollowed in short order by the Homestead Act and then the Morrill Act \nestablishing our great land grant college system, including The \nPennsylvania State University. I suspect that few Americans at the time \nwould have imagined that President Lincoln's leadership and vision in \nthe area of agriculture would have such a profound impact on our \ncountry and the world.\n  Just recently, Dr. Rajiv Shah, the Administrator of the Agency for \nInternational Development said that the single-most effective way to \neliminate world poverty was to increase agriculture yields. That is an \nextraordinary statement. It means that Penn State and the other \nagriculture research universities have a critical role to play in \neliminating hunger, assisting in global food security and political \nstability.\n  The world's population just passed seven billion people and is on the \nway to nine billion people by 2050. This means we must double world \nfood production by 2050 in order to meet the challenge of feeding this \nincreased population.\n  As noted recently by Bob Stallman, President of the American Farm \nBureau Federation:\n\n       The importance of science and innovation . . . to \n     agriculture will be significant as we\n\n[[Page S3168]]\n\n     face several challenges in the years ahead. . . . Further, we \n     must accomplish this hefty goal while realizing that our \n     Earth is fragile. To take care of our environment, we must \n     embrace agriculture research, science, innovation and \n     biotechnology. When it comes to medical care, communication \n     and transportation we accept the importance of innovation. We \n     need to do the same when it comes to the production of food.\n\n  Last year, net farm income and farm exports set a record and played a \nkey role in helping to grow the U.S. economy. In order to ensure the \nfood security of our Nation, I believe strongly that Pennsylvania \nfarmers will continue to be productive, competitive and successful and \nsupply food to communities in Pennsylvania, throughout the country and \nthe world. Pennsylvania's proud agriculture tradition helped to build \nthe Nation and agriculture continues to drive our economy.\n  We live in a nation that is as diverse in agricultural production as \nit is in the people who consume the products that farmers grow. As we \nreflect upon agriculture's past, and look toward agriculture's future, \nI hope we can continue to ensure that we have a safe, stable, secure \nsupply of food. Agriculture is not just a nostalgic reflection of the \npast; it is critical to the U.S. economy and all Americans as we move \nforward. Therefore, I am pleased to extend birthday wishes to USDA, the \nland grant colleges and universities, and all those in the food value \nchain.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I am here today to commemorate the \nUnited States Department of Agriculture on its 150th anniversary.\n  Our country has changed dramatically since 1862, when President \nAbraham Lincoln signed a bill into law creating the Department of \nAgriculture.\n  Despite all the changes we have seen in the last century and a half, \nthe USDA remains true to its original mission as ``The People's \nDepartment,'' administering critical programs that touch the lives of \nall Americans.\n  So as we celebrate this important milestone for the USDA, I think we \nshould also take a moment to recognize the men and women who are \nputting its programs to use--the farmers and agriculture leaders who \ngrow our crops, produce our food and power our homegrown energy supply.\n  Sometimes, people forget that food doesn't just magically appear on \ngrocery store shelves. But the truth is that behind every aisle--\nwhether it's dairy or produce--there is farmer or a rancher who has \nmade it their livelihood to produce nutritious, abundant food.\n  In Minnesota, our economic strength is anchored in the soil of our \nland and the sweat of our farmers. Agriculture is our State's leading \nexport, accounting for $75 billion in economic activity every year and \nsupporting more than 300,000 jobs. And while we are 21st in the country \nfor population, we are the sixth largest agricultural producer.\n  Minnesota is number one in turkeys, green peas, and oats, number two \nin spring wheat, number three in hogs and soybeans, and number four in \ncorn.\n  I have spent the last year traveling across our State as part of an \neconomic tour that has taken me to dozens of communities and businesses \nthroughout Minnesota. And no matter where I go, I am always reminded of \nthe critical role that farming plays in our State's economy.\n  For generations, the Department of Agriculture has stood behind our \nfarmers and rural communities and made sure they had the tools and \nresource to move forward.\n  The USDA may be best known for administering the farm programs that \nhelp agricultural producers manage risk and recover from disasters--\neverything from floods to market failures. But programs such as crop \ninsurance, which provides a safety net across 254 million acres, are \njust one component of the USDA's larger portfolio of priorities--\neverything from clean energy development and conservation to export \npromotion.\n  In terms of research, the USDA has helped our farmers and ranchers \nremain the most productive in the world. It has funded research that \nnot only shields our food supply from pests and dangerous diseases, but \nalso increases the productivity of farmers growing everything from \nwheat to watermelons.\n  Anyone who has visited a farm using modern precision agriculture can \ntell you just how far we have come. And in terms of the economic \nbenefits, studies have shown that for every dollar spent on \nagricultural research, it returns over $20 to our economy.\n  The USDA is also making great headway with conservation programs. By \nworking with hundreds of thousands of farmers and ranchers and \nimplementing conservation practices on tens of millions of acres of \nprivate land, the USDA is helping reduce soil erosion and ensure clean \ndrinking water.\n  And in preserving our natural resources, USDA is also strengthening \nkey industries like fishing and hunting, which are so much more than \njust hobbies in my State--in Minnesota, sportsmen put $3.4 billion into \nour economy each year and support 55,000 jobs.\n  On the energy front, USDA is moving us closer to oil independence by \nencouraging the development of homegrown sources--like cellulosic \nbiofuels, methane digesters and other renewable and energy efficient \nsolutions. Altogether, those solutions are expected to save enough \nenergy to power nearly 600,000 homes a year.\n  At a time of spiking gas prices and volatility in foreign oil \nmarkets, I believe we should be investing in the energy innovators of \nthe Midwest--not the oil cartels of the Mideast.\n  With the right tools, America's farmers can develop the next \ngeneration energy sources that will power the world.\n  We are already feeding the world, and the USDA has helped make that \npossible through its work to lift export barriers and open new markets \nfor agricultural goods. In 2011 farm exports reached a record high of \n$137 billion, which support 1.5 million jobs here in the U.S.\n  Finally, so much of the USDA's work boils down to strengthening rural \ncommunities. That is why programs to help finance everything from \nbroadband to infrastructure for clean drinking water are so important. \nThey are critical to ensuring a kid who grows up in rural American can \nstay in rural America and doesn't have to move somewhere else to find a \njob, raise a family or start a business.\n  In this sense, the USDA truly is the ``People's Department.'' This \nonly underscores the importance of the work we're doing in the Senate \nto craft a strong and successful farm bill--one that builds on the \nsuccess of existing programs while also making key improvements and \naccounting for challenges created by the current budget environment.\n  The Agriculture Committee took the first step by passing the farm \nbill out of committee in April, on a strong bipartisan vote of 16 5, \nthat should pave the way for full Senate action.\n  The legislation strengthens and continues many vital programs that \nfarmers rely on in States across the country.\n  It maintains a robust farm safety net which makes several \nimprovements to the crop insurance program, including changes to ensure \nthe program works better for fruit, vegetable and organic producers.\n  I sponsored an amendment that will give beginning farmers better \naccess to the crop insurance program by making it more affordable for \nthem to purchase coverage.\n  And because I believe we should do more to invest in the future of \nAmerican agriculture, I worked to make sure the bill included \nprovisions for the Beginning Farmers and Ranchers Program and for \npromoting public-private research opportunities.\n  Importantly, the bill we passed in the Committee also streamlines and \nstrengthens the conservation programs that farmers rely on to keep our \nsoil healthy and our water clean. It preserves the essential nutrition \nprograms that millions of families and children rely on every day. And \nit includes a strong energy title for encouraging homegrown energy \nproduction.\n  Every single American has a direct stake in the success of our farms \nand food businesses. Through the food we eat, the water we drink, the \nfuel we put in our cars and the air we breathe, each and every one of \nus is personally invested in the success of American agriculture, and \nthat is why the USDA is such a critical resources.\n  I congratulate all my friends with the USDA on a remarkable 150 \nyears, and I want to thank my colleagues on the floor today for their \ngreat work\n\n[[Page S3169]]\n\nand dedication to supporting our farmers and rural communities. I look \nforward to working with all of my colleagues in the Senate to pass a \nstrong Farm Bill that supports vital services at the USDA and gets the \njob done for our Nation's farmers.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize \nAmerican agricultural producers on the 150th anniversary of President \nLincoln signing legislation establishing the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture on May 15, 1862.\n  As President Lincoln said in his last annual address to Congress, \n``[The Department of Agriculture] is precisely the people's Department, \nin which they feel more directly concerned than in any other.'' Many \ndon't realize it, but USDA plays a unique role in the daily lives of \nevery single American, ranging from the programs available that assist \nrural small businesses to providing the support system that makes it \npossible for our farmers and ranchers to produce the most affordable \nand abundant food supply of any country in the world.\n  As the main economic pillar and No. 1 industry in my State of South \nDakota, it is important that we acknowledge and celebrate the economic \nimportance of agriculture and the role that the USDA has played in \nimplementing and supporting policies that have assisted our farmers and \nranchers in becoming a leader in feeding, fueling, and clothing the \nworld.\n  USDA's work on food, agriculture, economic development, science, risk \nmanagement, natural resources conservation, and a whole host of other \nissues has enabled the agriculture industry to establish itself as a \ncritical component in our economic success while having an influence on \nthe lives of every single American. The Department, in coordination \nwith our Nation's farmers and ranchers, has helped allow families to \nput nutritious, healthy food on their tables at a lower cost than \nalmost anywhere else in the world. On average, less than 10 percent of \nAmerican consumers' disposable income is spent on food.\n  Moreover, agriculture is the economic engine that drives our rural \ncommunities. Without viable family farms and ranches our small towns \nand Main Street businesses throughout South Dakota and our Nation would \nface significant hardships. According to the South Dakota Department of \nAgriculture, the agriculture industry has a $20 billion economic impact \neach year, accounting for one-third of the State's economic activity. \nThe 46,000 agricultural producers on 31,500 farms combine with \nassociated industries to employ more than 143,000 South Dakotans.\n  But the value of America's farmers and ranchers goes far beyond \neconomic activity. Our producers are also the most productive in the \nworld, providing the food, fuel, and fiber necessary to sustain us and \nmillions of others throughout the world. Each year, just one South \nDakota producer raises enough food to feed 155 people both here at home \nand abroad. As the world's population continues to grow to a projected \n9 billion people by 2050, the demand for our agricultural products will \nonly increase, and we will have to continue improving our productive \ncapacity to double food production on fewer acres.\n  The increased yields needed to overcome the challenges ahead cannot \nbe accomplished without the full use of sound science and innovative \ntechnology. In providing public land for the establishment of colleges \nto further agricultural research and education, the Morrill Land Grant \nCollege Act, which was also signed into law by President Lincoln in \n1862, gave us such institutions as South Dakota State University and \nwill remain a lasting achievement for the ongoing progress of \nproduction agriculture.\n  Therefore, on the 150th anniversary of its establishment, I commend \nUSDA, and the American agricultural producers they assist, for \nproviding the food, fuel, and fiber that we each rely on. I \ncongratulate them and wish a happy birthday to USDA and those \nthroughout the food chain.\n  Senator KOHL. Mr. President, in the fall of 1859, just two years \nprior to his election to the presidency, Abraham Lincoln spoke to the \nWisconsin State Agricultural Society in my hometown of Milwaukee, WI. \nLincoln concluded his speech saying, ``Let us hope . . . that by the \nbest cultivation of the physical world, beneath and around us, and the \nintellectual and moral world within us, we shall secure an individual, \nsocial, and political prosperity and happiness.'' Just 3 years later, \nPresident Lincoln created the Department of Agriculture with these \nwords in mind.\n  May 15, 2012 marks the 150th year of the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture, USDA. Perhaps more than any other department, USDA \nconnects Americans to the land and to each other in ways seen and \nunseen. From its formation in 1862 through today, the Department has \nserved millions of American's in a multitude of innovative ways.\n  From the earliest years of our Nation, agricultural production has \nbeen front and center. Today, roughly 1 out of every 12 Americans is \nemployed in an agriculture related industry. Whether a producer, \nresearcher, conservationist, food safety official, or one of many other \nagricultural professions, each person, including those who work in \nUSDA, plays an important role in producing and delivering a safe and \nhealthy food supply to the United States and the world.\n  Colleges and universities around the country have produced research \nthat has improved crop yields, plant and livestock health, and soil \nquality, among others. Research has also led to the widespread use of \nconservation practices on farmland. While there are many different \ntypes of conservation efforts supported by USDA, they all share the \nsame goal--to maintain the health and vitality of American farmland for \nfuture years and future generations. Once research and conservation \nefforts have been applied it becomes the job of agricultural producers \nto efficiently harvest and deliver their product to markets around the \ncorner, or across the country. I believe American agricultural \nproducers are the best in the world at what they do.\n  To help Americans sort through the incredible variety of their food \nchoices at grocery stores or farmers markets, USDA provides critical \nguidance for nutrition assistance. Through the My Plate program and \nother nutrition education initiatives, USDA works to ensure that \nchildren, low-income individuals, seniors and the disabled not only \nunderstand what makes up a nutritious, healthy meal--but they create \naccess to such meals year round, through programs such as the Special \nNutrition Assistance Program for Women, Infants and Children, or the \nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. These programs and others \nhelp feed those who have trouble accessing healthy foods, but they do \nso in a way that reinvests in agricultural producers and their rural \ncommunities.\n  I believe USDA's most important achievement has been the fulfillment \nof Lincoln's vision--harmoniously using all the tools, resources and \nprograms at its disposal to contribute to social prosperity and \nhappiness through the cultivation of the American land and its people.\n  It is with pride and respect that I honor USDA and our Nation's \nagriculture industry today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/15/senate-section/article/S3169-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3169-S3170]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING LOST DHS PERSONNEL\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, the mission of the Department of \nHomeland Security, DHS, is broad and diverse. The men and women of DHS \nprotect our borders and modes of transportation; they guard our \nwaterways; they protect U.S. and foreign leaders; they prepare for and \nrespond to disasters; they manage our immigration process; and, they \ndefend us against cyber attack. DHS employees provide selfless service \nto their nation and they do so with honor and distinction under an \never-present threat. With National Police Week 2012 commencing, I would \nlike to pay tribute to the Department of Homeland Security's agents, \nofficers, and military personnel who lost their lives in the service of \nour Nation. Fifty-five courageous men and women of DHS have died in the \nline of duty since the Department's inception in 2003. We owe them more \nthan a tribute on this day, but our gratitude begins with that.\n  They are:\n\n       Lorenzo R.

Mr. President, today, people across our country observe \nPeace Officers Memorial Day. As we remember all of the fallen officers \nwho have made the ultimate sacrifice while upholding justice and \nprotecting our communities, I wish to echo the sentiments of Americans \nacross the country in honoring the lives and exemplary service of all \nof the men and women who lost their lives this past year, including two \nNorth Dakota peace officers, Bismarck police Sgt. Steven Kenner and \nBurleigh County sheriff's department Deputy Sheriff Bryan Sleeper.\n  Sgt. Steven Kenner served with the Bismarck police department for \nmore than 32 years when he was killed in the line of duty on July 8, \n2011. Sergeant Kenner was a distinguished and well-respected member of \nthe Bismarck police department. He also served as a decorated member of \nthe North Dakota National Guard military police and founded the \nbusiness C.A.R., Collision Analysis Reconstruction.\n  Colleagues, friends and family knew Sergeant Kenner to be a loving, \nhardworking and dedicated man who served his State with great pride. He \nwas devoted to mentoring and training his fellow officers, and his \nextensive knowledge and professionalism garnered the respect and \nadmiration of his colleagues, who often referred to Sergeant Kenner as \na gentle giant because his stature belied his kind nature and selfless \nservice to others.\n  During Sergeant Kenner's distinguished career, he earned several \nawards, including the North Dakota Peace Officers Association \nLifesaving Award. Sergeant Kenner was also actively involved in his \ncommunity, serving in a variety of capacities, including as a member of \nthe Missouri Valley Fraternal Order of Police, the National Trustee for \nNorth Dakota and the Midwest Association of Traffic Accident \nInvestigators. He is survived by his wife, Debbie, and children James, \nStephen, Kailey, and Tayler.\n  Last year, North Dakota also mourned Deputy Sheriff Bryan Sleeper who \ndied in the line of duty on September 28, 2011. A lifelong North \nDakotan, Deputy Sleeper graduated from the University of Mary in 1997, \nand worked at the North Dakota state penitentiary and the Bismarck \nrural fire department before beginning his distinguished career with \nthe Burleigh County sheriff's department in 2007.\n  Deputy Sleeper was an active member of his community, and his \ninvolvement--like his job--aimed to improve\n\n[[Page S3171]]\n\nthe well-being of his fellow citizens. He earned his EMT certification \nand taught CPR and first aid at St. Alexius Medical Center and the \nBurleigh County sheriff's department. He was also a volunteer \nfirefighter, member of the West Dakota SWAT team and the vice president \nof the Fraternal Order of Police Missouri Valley Lodge #3 for Bismarck. \nAt the sheriff's department, he organized enforcement events including \na blood drive and Christmas shopping event for children. Recognitions \ninclude the North Dakota Peace Officers Association Lifesaving Award.\n  Deputy Sleeper was a hardworking, ambitious and energetic man whose \nkind heart and engaging personality quickly endeared him to the people \nhe met. An athlete and outdoors enthusiast, Deputy Sleeper was a \nnatural leader and committed family man and friend. He is survived by \nhis wife Lana, children Branden, Jeremy and Heather; and grandson \nHunter.\n  This past week, North Dakotans added the names of Steven Kenner and \nBryan Sleeper to the North Dakota Peace Officer Memorial located on the \neast side of the North Dakota State capitol. This memorial now bears \nthe names of 61 brave men. These North Dakota peace officers, like the \nother officers from across our country who have been killed in the line \nof duty, have earned our unyielding gratitude for their service and \nheroism. These brave men and women keep our communities safe and \nsecure, and it is fitting and right that we should pay tribute to these \nheroes who have paid the ultimate sacrifice.\n  Mikey and I extend our deepest sympathy to the families of all our \nfallen officers, especially the families of Sergeant Kenner and Deputy \nSleeper. Our thoughts and prayers go out to them, and we pray that they \nwill take comfort in knowing that their loved ones served their State \nand fellow citizens with great honor and pride.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/15/senate-section/article/S3171-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3171]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TAIWAN'S PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURATION\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Inauguration Day \nin Taiwan on May 20, 2012. On January 14, Mr. Ma Ying-jeou was elected \nto his second term as President of the Republic of China. I offer \ncongratulations to Mr. Ma not only for winning the election but for \nwhat his election symbolizes: the continued growth and maturation of \ndemocracy in the Republic of China. Taiwan is the first place in the \nethnic Chinese world where democracy has taken root, and its democratic \ntransformation has laid the foundation for reduced tensions across the \nTaiwan Strait and strengthened its ties with the United States as well.\n  Taiwan's democracy brightens the future of East Asia. Taipei poses no \nthreat to Beijing, and its democratic government has fostered the \ndevelopment of strong cross-strait economic and cultural ties. I hope \nthat, instead of building up its military forces in fear of a \ndemocratic Taiwan, Beijing will learn from Taiwan's example and reform \nits own political system. Democratization on both sides of the Taiwan \nStrait will lead to further expansion of the economic and cultural ties \nthat have begun to flourish in recent years as well as improve security \nfor the entire region.\n  The United States understands that our interests are well served by a \nfree and democratic Taiwan. We want to see Taiwan grow and thrive as an \nimportant economic and trade partner, and we recognize that the safety \nand security of Taiwan is very important to the security of the entire \nAsia-Pacific region. The partnership between the United States and \nTaiwan, especially under the terms of the Taiwan Relations Act, has \ndeterred aggressive action in the Taiwan Strait and opened the door for \nTaiwan to reach its full potential as a strong democracy and an \nimportant economic hub. I look forward to strengthening the links \nbetween Taiwan and the United States in the future, particularly \nthrough the removal of remaining trade barriers and a renewed \ncommitment to addressing the security challenges facing Taiwan.\n  I hope that the United States and the Republic of China, as two \nfellow democracies, will continue to support each other and commit \nthemselves to even closer ties in the future. And in that spirit, on \nthe occasion of Taiwan's Inauguration Day, I congratulate the people of \nTaiwan and join them in celebrating the power and potential of \ndemocracy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/15/senate-section/article/S3171-2", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3171]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n        350TH ANNIVERSARY OF ST. FRANCIS XAVIER CATHOLIC CHURCH\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I wish to celebrate the 350th \nanniversary of St. Francis Xavier Catholic Church in Leonardtown, MD. I \nhope my colleagues will join me in celebrating the centuries of history \nin marking this anniversary, including the establishment of Catholicism \nin English America. It was 350 years ago that Leonardtown, which was \nthen known as Newtowne, was founded as the first settlement in the \nMaryland province after the establishment of St. Mary's City. Its \ngeographic location places it within view of St. Clement's Island where \nthe English colonists first landed in 1634. Prior to its settlement by \nthe colonists, the Piscataway Indians and their forebears had occupied \nthe site for many centuries.\n  Lord Baltimore founded the Maryland colony with the intention of \nproviding his co-religionists with the civil liberty to exercise their \nreligion freely, but it was not until the restoration of Charles II to \nthe throne in England that the political climate in Maryland allowed \nfor the building of a public chapel at Newtowne in 1662. The chapel was \nbuilt by the local Catholics for the community that continues to the \npresent day as Saint Francis Xavier's Parish, a parish within the \nArchdiocese of Washington.\n  In 1967, when the Society of Jesus withdrew from Newtowne to work in \nother areas, St. Francis Xavier Church, Newtowne Manor, and the 7.5 \nacres surrounding them were conveyed to the Archdiocese of Washington. \nThe Archbishop of Washington at the time, James Cardinal Hickey, \nrealized the religious, historical and archeological significance of \nthese buildings, both of which are on the national Register of Historic \nPlaces, and he determined that they must be restored and preserved to \nmaintain a link with the earliest days of the Roman Catholic Church in \nAmerica.\n  While the site of the current church, a.d. 1731, and the Newtowne \nManor House, a.d. 1789, the graveyard, and the site of the original \nchapel have been excavated by archaeologists, more work remains to be \ndone to tell the full story of what is believed to be the second public \nCatholic chapel built in the colonies. The first is thought to be in \nneighboring Charles County, MD. I join Father Brian P. Sanderfoot and \nthe Saint Francis Xavier Catholic Church congregation in encouraging \nfurther investigation and exploration of their history. Their work will \ninform all of us about the colonial history of the Catholic community \nin Maryland and the early colonial life and freedoms evidenced in the \nrecords and archeological findings of St. Francis Xavier Catholic \nChurch.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/15/senate-section/article/S3171-3", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3171-S3172]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CONGRATULATING ASHLEE SMITH\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to honor a young \nNevadan for being recognized as one of America's top 10 youth \nvolunteers of 2012. Ashlee Smith, a seventh grader from Sparks, NV, was \nawarded the prestigious national Prudential Spirit of Community Award \nfor her efforts to assist child victims of house fires and natural \ndisasters. I am proud to congratulate one of Nevada's own for her \nleadership, compassion, and selflessness as she sets a fine example for \nstudents all across the United States who want to make a difference.\n  Ashlee's home burned down in a devastating fire in 2005, destroying \nall that her family owned--including her childhood toys. Ever since \nthis experience, she has dedicated her free time to helping children \nwho are victims of natural disasters recover their lost belongings. At \n8 years old, she founded Ashlee's Toy Closet, a nonprofit organization \nthat helps low-income children as well as those who have been affected \nby natural disasters. Over the past 5 years, she has collected and \ndistributed more than 175,000 toys to children who have been affected \nby natural disasters. Ashlee's commitment to children in need is \ninspiring and reinforces the importance of serving our communities.\n\n[[Page S3172]]\n\n  Having four children of my own, I understand the importance of \ncreating an environment where our kids can give back to their \ncommunities. Encouraging our Nation's next generation of leaders to \nbecome engaged in community service will help ensure that they are \nactive and positive contributors to their local community. We must \nencourage our Nation's youth to excel beyond the academic arena, \ndemonstrate strong leadership skills, and show active initiative to \nsupport their communities.\n  I am proud to stand with the citizens of Sparks to congratulate \nAshlee on this exceptional accomplishment. As she continues to grow her \norganization, I hope that she will serve as an example for Nevada's \nyouth and will continue building upon this experience in her \nprofessional and personal future. Today, I ask my colleagues to join me \nin recognizing an ambitious Nevadan who has helped make a difference in \nthe lives of thousands all over the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/15/senate-section/article/S3172-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3172]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/15/senate-section/article/S3172-2", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3172]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/15/senate-section/article/S3172-3", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3172]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bill was read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       H.R. 5652.

A bill to amend the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act to \nenhance the protections accorded to servicemembers and their spouses \nwith respect to mortgages, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I introduce the Servicemember Housing \nProtection Act, and I thank Senators Durbin, Sherrod Brown, Whitehouse, \nand Begich for joining me as original cosponsors of this bill.\n  In 1940, as World War II escalated across the globe, Congress enacted \nthe Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act ``to protect those who have \nbeen obliged to drop their own affairs to take up the burdens of the \nnation.'' In 2003, Congress passed a new version of this law to reflect \nthe new challenges of post-9/11 service and renamed it the \nServicemembers Civil Relief Act, SCRA. In 2010, in order to address the \ncountry's high foreclosure rates and their impact on servicemembers, \nCongress further amended this law to enhance foreclosure protections.\n  Also in 2010, when it became evident that military families needed an \nentity\n\n[[Page S3176]]\n\nto serve as a watchdog, provide education, and help monitor and respond \nto concerns, questions, and complaints about consumer financial \nproducts and services, I led the bipartisan effort during the Dodd-\nFrank act debate to create a new Office of Servicemember Affairs within \nthe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, CFPB.\n  Our country has a strong tradition of ensuring that the laws that \nprotect our servicemembers keep pace with the challenges that they \nface. The Servicemember Housing Protection Act seeks to address one \nsuch continuing challenge helping servicemembers with their housing \nneeds so they can maintain a focus on the difficult task of protecting \nour country.\n  First, our bill would make it easier for servicemembers to submit \ntheir military orders to creditors and get their affairs in order prior \nto deployment. Currently, creditors require a copy of military orders \nin order to trigger SCRA protections. However, these orders are often \nnot cut until just before deployment or once the servicemember is \nalready deployed. Redefining military orders as either official orders \nor a letter from the servicemember's commanding officer would further \nensure that a servicemember has more time to prepare for deployment and \npromptly receives SCRA protections, including the interest rate \nlimitation of six percent on qualifying mortgages.\n  Second, this bill would extend foreclosure protections to surviving \nspouses. Currently, servicemembers have a 9-month window of foreclosure \nprotection following service, to provide time to reacclimate to \ncivilian life and get affairs back in order. Our bill extends this \nnine-month window of foreclosure protection to a surviving spouse. \nAfter suffering such an unspeakable loss, a military spouse should not \nhave the additional burden of dealing with immediate foreclosure.\n  Lastly, this bill would help facilitate the transition from off-base \nto on-base housing. Due to the shortage of on-base military housing, \nmany servicemembers temporarily find off-base housing until on-base \nhousing becomes available. When a servicemember on a waiting list is \ngiven the chance to move into on-base housing, he or she is sometimes \nunable to terminate his or her off-base housing lease. Including an \norder to move from off-base to on-base housing as additional grounds \nfor lease termination would allow servicemembers and their families the \nopportunity to move into the military housing community. We should \nextend this opportunity, which already is law in several states, such \nas Florida, Georgia, and Virginia, to servicemembers serving at any of \nour military bases.\n  While the men and women of our Armed Forces are protecting our nation \noverseas, we should do everything possible to protect their families \nand homes. I urge my colleagues to join Senators Durbin, Sherrod Brown, \nWhitehouse, Begich, and me, as well as the Military Officers \nAssociation of America, in supporting this bill and taking these next \nsteps to add protections for our military families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/15/senate-section/article/S3176-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3176]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 460--DESIGNATING THE WEEK OF MAY 20 THROUGH MAY 26, \n                2012, AS ``NATIONAL PUBLIC WORKS WEEK''\n\n  Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mr. Inhofe) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, this is a very important piece of \nlegislation done in the right way. Senators Harkin and Enzi have done \nsomething in the way we always used to do things: They moved a bill out \nof committee to the Senate floor, truly a bipartisan bill, so important \nto our country, the FDA bill--Food and Drug Administration.\n  Senator Enzi has always been very focused on when we bring something \nto the floor, it must have the committee mark on it--and this bill \ndoes.\n  The reason I move to the bill today the way I have is to line this up \nfor filing cloture on Thursday. I hope we don't have to file cloture, \nwe move to proceed to it. Why don't we get on the bill? If we can get \non the bill, we can start on it Monday, we can start offering \namendments, and get this moving along.\n  I have talked to Senator Enzi, I have talked to Senator Harkin. We \nhad good luck on the highway bill. We had good luck also on the postal \nbill with relevant amendments. This is a very important piece of \nlegislation. I hope we can move to this without having to file cloture. \nIf I have to file cloture, I will have to file cloture, but I sure hope \nnot. I admire the cooperation and the working together of Senators \nHarkin and Enzi.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/15/senate-section/article/S3178-2", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3178]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, MAY 16, 2012\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, following any leader remarks tomorrow \nmorning, the Senate will begin debate on several motions to proceed to \nresolutions introduced by Republican Senators. This is an agreed-upon \nmethod of proceeding on these resolutions.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  It is my intention to equally divide the first hour, with the \nmajority controlling the first 30 minutes and the Republicans \ncontrolling the second 30 minutes. I ask unanimous consent that be the \ncase.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. So there is 6 hours of debate time allowed under the \nconsent agreement that was approved earlier today. I certainly hope we \ncan get this done expeditiously. Senator Conrad will be leading efforts \non our side opposed to this; and once we get this out of the way, we \nshould move forward.\n  Tomorrow morning, after we understand the morning hour will be deemed \nexpired and the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use \nlater in the day, I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized at that \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
