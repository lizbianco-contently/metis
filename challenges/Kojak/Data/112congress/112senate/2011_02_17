Mr. President, we are at a point where we can finish the \nFAA bill after all these many years. That was not a mistake. For years, \nwe have been trying to get this bill completed. We are going to have a \nvote in 2\\1/2\\ hours, an important vote dealing with the so-called slot \narrangement; that is, what air companies get to fly into which airports \nand what time and all that stuff. It has been very controversial.\n  We have had two main issues that have held up this legislation. One \nis a labor-management disagreement. That has gone away. Now we have the \nissue dealing with slots that will go away as a result of the cloture \nvote that will occur sometime in the next 2\\1/2\\ hours.\n  We can complete this legislation today. There is no reason we can't \ncomplete the legislation today. We have a number of votes that will \nhave to be cast. That is something we will do. We are going to work to \ncomplete this legislation. Today is Thursday. It would be an \nappropriate time to finish.\n  As I mentioned last night, we have the Presidents Day recess when we \nneed to go home to constituents. As I mentioned last night, I am always \namazed--a lot of times, the press writes that we have gone back for a \nbreak, and ofttimes they write as if we are going to go back and \nleisurely hang around the house. The fact is, when we go home, we have \na lot of work to do. Our constituents throughout the State are there \nduring the week. We have government buildings that are open, and we can \ngo visit there and do all the many things we have to do. For example, I \nhave to address the Nevada State Legislature next week. These are the \nkinds of things we need to do during the time we go home.\n  I, like everyone else, would like to get back to my home in \nSearchlight more quickly, but we have to finish this legislation. There \nis no reason we can't. Everyone has had their opportunity to debate, to \noffer amendments. We could have as many as eight or nine amendments to \nvote on. There is work being done with Senator Coburn now to see if we \ncan somehow condense his five amendments to a couple. The managers will \nwork that out. We are on a path to being able to finish this \nlegislation. I hope we can finish today.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S808]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, two years ago today, at a moment of \ndeep economic uncertainty, the President signed a bill that he said \nwould put us back on track. It was a plan, he said, that would ``save \nor create'' up to 4 million jobs over 2 years--a figure that he called \nhis bottom line for success, a plan that was supposed to drive \nunemployment below 7 percent by now. And it was predicated on the \nnotion that government spending--spending borrowed money on government \nprograms--was the recipe for a rebound; a plan that said if we \n``invest'' in government, we will get out of this mess.\n  We were told the bill included record investments. And then we \nlearned what the administration means by ``investment:'' a plant \ndatabase project; a multimillion dollar facelift for the Sunset Strip; \na study of the mating decisions of female cactus bugs; hundreds of \nmillions of dollars to a solar panel company that was supposed to \ndouble its workforce but ended up cutting jobs instead; massive \nbailouts to the States; turtle tunnels. Senators get the drift.\n  Within a year of its passage, the so-called stimulus bill had become \na national punchline.\n  Nearly a trillion dollars was added to the debt as a result of this \nbill in the name of investing in our future. And in the 2 years since \nit was signed, we have lost millions of jobs.\n  And now they want to do it again. They are back for more.\n  Just as amazing is the fact that the same people who touted this bill \nnow refuse to cut government spending. We learn about another wasteful \nstimulus project just about every day, and they say they can't find a \ndime's worth of government spending to cut?\n  It defies common sense.\n  I mean, if we can't cut a turtle tunnel when the country is $14 \ntrillion in the hole, we have problems. It is time to turn over the \ncredit card.\n  The bottom line here is that 2 years after the President told us he \nwas investing in our future, here is what we have to show for it: \nhigher unemployment than they predicted and trillions more in debt.\n  The fact is, dangerously high debt has actually slowed the recovery, \nmaking it harder to create private sector jobs.\n  So in my view this second debate was over before it started.\n  Massive government investment of borrowed taxpayer money as a tool \nfor economic growth has been a failure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/17/senate-section/article/S808-4", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S808-S809]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           TRIBUTE TO PADUCAH\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the people of \nPaducah, KY, for all of the efforts they have made to make their city \none of our country's best places in which to work, visit or live. Now \nthat hard work has paid off. Paducah has been recognized by the \nNational Trust for Historic Preservation as one of their Dozen \nDistinctive Destinations in America in 2011.\n  The National Trust for Historic Preservation seeks to recognize \ncities and towns that offer an authentic cultural and recreational \nexperience. They take into account a community's commitment to the \nhistoric preservation and revitalization of its downtown, its rich \ncultural history, attractive architecture and a town's core character. \nObviously, I think Paducah ranks highly in all of these criteria, and I \nam glad the National Trust for Historic Preservation, after considering \nthousands of communities across the Nation, agrees.\n  The history of Paducah is a history of life on the river. Paducah was \noriginally settled because of its strategic position on the Ohio River, \nand traffic on the Ohio and the Tennessee River drove its economic \ndevelopment. As rivers were America's original highways, Paducah was \nfounded on vital arteries of trade and commerce.\n  That history is still alive in Paducah because of the hard work of \nmany to preserve their city's heritage. For years I have worked along \nwith local leaders to enhance some of the city's greatest attributes; \nnamely, Paducah's downtown and riverfront. Paducah is now a vibrant \nriver town. I would encourage my colleagues, the next time they are \nplanning a vacation, to keep Paducah in mind.\n\n  The National Quilt Museum of the United States, the River Discovery \nCenter, the Lower Town Arts District, the Upper Town Heritage Walking \nTour, and much more await them there. I will point out that the \nNational Trust for Historic Preservation also recently named Paducah as \nhaving one of the most romantic main streets in America.\n  The Paducah Sun recently published an article about this high honor \nreceived by the city.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From paducahsun.com, Feb. 15, 2011]\n\n                   City Named Distinctive Destination\n\n                           (By Will Pinkston)\n\n       Paducah keeps adding awards to its trophy shelf, as the \n     city was named one of the 2011 Dozen Distinctive Destinations \n     in America by the National Trust for Historic Preservation.\n       Since 2000, the National Trust for Historic Preservation \n     annually selects communities across America that offer \n     cultural and recreational experiences setting them apart from \n     typical vacation destinations. Consideration for this honor \n     comes with communities exhibiting a commitment to historic \n     preservation and revitalization of their downtown centers, \n     displaying their diverse cultural history and architecture, \n     and showing efforts to implement sustainable ``green'' \n     concepts.\n       ``This is an incredible honor to be named by the national \n     trust,'' said Rosemarie Steele, marketing director for the \n     Paducah Convention and Visitors Bureau. ``There's strong \n     criteria for qualifications and we've met all of them.''\n       Steele said several factors helped to put Paducah in the \n     running for the trust's honor.\n       ``Paducah's history is really rich in the diversity and the \n     prosperity of being a river town,'' Steele said. ``The spirit \n     of the people who decided to save and preserve downtown, \n     which started years ago, and kept the moment alive, have made \n     us a vibrant river town.''\n       The trust considered Paducah attractions, such as the \n     National Quilt Museum of the United States, the annual Quilt \n     Show, the River Discovery Center, the Lower Town Arts \n     District and Upper Town Heritage Walking Tour.\n       ``(The National Trust for Historic Preservation) wants to \n     know what the hidden gems are, like all the creative \n     experiences we have,'' Steele said. ``More than 5,000 people \n     learn their craft in Paducah, not just quilting, but the \n     arts, throughout lower town.''\n       The National Trust for Historic Preservation also \n     considered the city's ``walkability,'' according to Steele, \n     with many of Paducah's historic and cultural attractions \n     centered within only a few blocks of one another.\n       ``Paducah celebrates its past in a wide variety of ways, \n     from protecting and restoring landmark buildings to \n     commissioning artists to create life-sized historic murals,'' \n     said Stephanie Meeks, president of the National Trust for \n     Historic Preservation.\n       While being included on the Dozen Distinctive Destinations \n     list is an honor in itself,\n\n[[Page S809]]\n\n     the National Trust for Historic Preservation asks the public \n     to vote for the 2011 fan favorite on its website. Voters may \n     cast ballots once daily through March 15. The winner will be \n     announced March 16. Last year's fan favorite community was \n     Marquette, Mich.\n       ``We're really excited about the voting and we think we can \n     win this one,'' Steele said. ``We're hoping to get a whole \n     lot of help from the community to help us become the \n     distinctive destination and fan favorite.''\n       Paducah's appearance on the trust's Dozen Distinctive \n     Destinations list comes on the heels of it being named as \n     having one of the most romantic main streets in America just \n     this past week, Steele said. Towns from across the country \n     submitted five photographs that best illustrated why their \n     main street and downtown districts should be considered among \n     the most romantic in the country; Paducah was included in the \n     top five, alongside towns in Louisiana, Tennessee, \n     Connecticut and Indiana.\n       ``The beautiful thing about all of this is it really puts \n     us in front of so many people through the national trust,'' \n     Steele said. ``These honors will resonate with so many people \n     who are considering on moving here.''\n       To vote for the Dozen Distinctive Destinations fan \n     favorite, visit www.preservationnation.org/ddd/.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

This is a jobs \nbill. The FAA reauthorization act is going to modernize our air \ntransport system. As many have said far more eloquently than I could \never say, we are looking at a system that has its roots in the 1940s \nand the 1950s, and we need to move beyond this and get a 21st century \nsystem. That is what NextGen is going to do--give us a much better way \nto handle all of those flights, all of that congestion. It is going to \nbe, in addition to a jobs bill--280,000 jobs nationwide--it is also \ngoing to be a bill that focuses on safety. The growth that will be \nspurred on by this bill is crucial, because this industry also accounts \nfor nearly 11 million jobs and more than 5 percent of U.S. GDP.\n  I want to talk about two issues I have a great stake in for the \npeople of California and, frankly, for the people of this country. The \nfirst issue is the passengers' bill of rights. I am so grateful to our \nleader on the committee, Senator Rockefeller, and his ranking member, \nKay Bailey Hutchison, for ensuring that this bipartisan legislation--I \nwrote it with Senator Snowe--is included in the FAA bill.\n  We have all heard the horror stories of travelers trapped for hours \nwithout adequate food or water, some not even able to access their \nmedicines; planes filled with screaming kids; upset passengers and \nunsanitary conditions from overflowing toilets.\n  In fact, it is a situation that, if anyone has ever been in it, makes \nan indelible mark, and, frankly, it makes you less likely to want to \nfly in the American skies because you have a chance at being one of \nthose unfortunate people to get trapped in such a situation.\n  I thank Kate Hanni, a constituent of mine who was trapped in one of \nthese aircraft for hours on the tarmac and got off the plane and said: \nI need to do something about this. She is the one who lobbied very \nhard, a citizen's lobby, to get a passengers' bill of rights.\n  I am grateful the Department of Transportation, under President \nObama, took the first step by adopting key elements of our passengers' \nbill of rights through regulation last year. Secretary LaHood, who \nheads the Department of Transportation, sent a strong message and \nbasically said airlines must give passengers the option of deplaning if \nthey have been stranded on the tarmac for more than 3 hours.\n  According to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, there have only \nbeen 12 tarmac delays of more than 3 hours from May to October of 2010, \nafter the Department of Transportation instituted this rule, compared \nto 500-plus in the same period a year earlier. So by putting in a \nregulation that tells the airlines they cannot keep people on planes \npast 3 hours and, if they do, they have to give them an option to get \noff, we have turned things around. We have seen 12 tarmac delays \ncompared to 500. We want to codify these consumer protections. We want \na law. We don't know what the next President\n\n[[Page S810]]\n\nwill do. We don't know what could happen. We need a law that says they \ncannot keep people on an aircraft for more than 3 hours unless they are \nabout to take off in the next 30 minutes or the pilot says there is a \ndanger in taking passengers back to the gate.\n  We have very commonsense loopholes. But we don't have any loopholes \non this: they have to have adequate water, food, and access to clean \nrestrooms if there is any type of delay.\n  We also set up a consumer complaint hotline within the DOT which \nwould give passengers the means to communicate directly with the agency \nabout delays. Someone will be on the other end when people are \nexhausted and upset and need to have redress.\n  The passengers' bill of rights has broad bipartisan support. It \npassed the Senate 93 to 0 last March. We believe we now have to see it \nthrough.\n  I understand some of my friends on the other side of the Capitol in \nthe House have said no to the 3-hour time period. We are going to have \nto fight hard for it because the bottom line is, if we don't have an \nend time, we could go back to the same delays.\n  The last issue I wish to bring before the Senate that is important \nnot only to my State but to every State is the issue of having more \ndirect flight options into Washington, DC, Reagan National Airport than \nwe have now for many cities across this great Nation. We have now 38 \nmillion people in California. We have an economy that is about the \nseventh largest in the world. We have one direct flight from Los \nAngeles into Washington National Airport. If one lives in San \nFrancisco, Sacramento, San Diego, San Jose, Fresno, or any other city \nin our great State, they do not have an option of flying directly into \nour Nation's Capital. That is not good for business or jobs in \nCalifornia. It is not good for business or jobs in Washington or \nVirginia.\n  We need to encourage more domestic tourism. That creates jobs for our \ncommunities. Tourism in my State generated $90 billion and supported \n881,000 jobs in 2009 alone. It makes a difference flying into the \nairport right here in DC. We can be in the Capitol in 15-20 minutes, \ndepending on traffic, compared to getting off in Dulles, a great \nairport but not easy. Once we get off the plane, we have to get into a \nspecial train, and we walk and we go up escalators. We go on moving \nwalks. It is quite good for exercise, but it is not good if one is \ninterested in getting somewhere in a reasonable amount of time. Then \nthe drive could be anywhere, on a good night, from 50 minutes to an \nhour and a half. That makes a difference to travelers, particularly \nthose who are working or have work in this area.\n  I know there is a compromise on which my chairman and ranking member \nhave been working to open some more slots so we can get more options in \nour State and other States that are likewise deprived. I will be \nsupporting that compromise. It is crucial.\n  We need to have a bill that includes increasing service for citizens \nbeyond this kind of artificial perimeter that was set up. We can't \nafford to wait any longer as opportunity lies in the balance. We are \nnot going to overrun Washington National. Nobody wants to do that. We \nonly want to do what makes sense and allow more freedom for the \nairlines to pick the routes for which they have a demand.\n  We have one direct flight into all of California. Boy, one can never \nget on that either. It just doesn't make any sense. We have multiple \nflights out of Dulles. There is not a balance there at all.\n  Again, this is a jobs bill. This is a consumer bill. This is a bill \nthat is going to help commerce. I strongly support it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, Senator Boxer--and not everybody \nknows this--is the author of the passengers' bill of rights. It has \nbeen an obsession of hers. It is not about helping airlines; it is \nabout helping human beings. That has been a long process on the \ncommittee. It is in the bill. It is a very good part. She is \nresponsible for all of that.\n  When Senator Boxer talks about more flights to the West, she echoes \nmy deepest thinking. It is hard sometimes for people to understand. We \nare the East, and we get the feeling that everything happens in the \nEast. But the fact is, the West is growing and the East is not. All of \nour slots are predicated on the fact that everybody lives in the East. \nYes, there are some people out West--well, there are a lot more people \nout West. Los Angeles is huge beyond belief. That happens to be the \nhome of Senator Boxer. But there are a lot of cities out there which \ndon't get service and should have service. We have tried to address \nthat in this bill.\n  The slots issue has been a very difficult one in the bill. But we \nhave tried to address that by allowing the Department of Transportation \nto say: Are they getting enough? Is DC overcrowded or is it not? If it \nisn't, then they allow more to come on.\n  I enormously appreciate Senator Boxer in general. She chairs an \nimportant committee, but she comes to our hearings and always makes \nenormous contributions. On this bill of rights she is the author, which \nputs her right up there with the Founding Fathers.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague and \nfriend Senator Boxer to hail the inclusion of the passengers' bill of \nrights in the reauthorization of the FAA. We have worked together for 5 \nyears to protect passengers, and moving the passengers' bill of rights \noff the ``to-do'' list and into law will be a victory for the traveling \npublic.\n  Senator Boxer and I have worked diligently as far back as the spring \nof 2007 to move this essential safety measure forward. Last year's \npassage of the FAA reauthorization bill brought us closer to our goal, \nbut the legislation expired as the House and Senate grappled with other \nissues. Undeterred, Senator Boxer and I continued to stand up for this \ncommon sense safety and consumer protection proposal.\n  Make no mistake, providing airline travelers with access to food, \nwater, restrooms, and medication is not just an issue of comfort--\npassengers who are pregnant, elderly, or ill require access to clean \nwater and appropriate facilities--and no passenger should be held \nagainst their will just steps from an airport facility.\n  When passengers are able to safely deplane in the event of a delay, \nthey absolutely should be given the choice to do so. This proposal \nensures that passengers are given the right to get off a plane after 3 \nhours of delay on the tarmac. In 3 hours, a passenger could drive from \nPortland, ME, to Boston, complete an Olympic triathlon, or watch a full \nlength movie. In that time, airlines can certainly ascertain whether or \nnot they will actually be able to get off the ground. In March of last \nyear, American Airlines flight 160 from San Diego to New York sat on \nthe runway in Philadelphia for more than 5 hours, with passengers \nwondering if they ever would make it to New York.\n  Passengers already compete for window and aisle seats, and hope for \nexit rows with a bit more legroom. In fact, a Web site has made a \nbusiness of providing charts of each air carrier's planes to show which \nhave the best seats. The average airline seat is 17.2 inches wide, and \npassengers stuck in middle seats are given so little space to move. We \nhave reached the point where we consult the Web to find which seat is \nleast painful. Consumers want assurances that they will not be confined \nto their seats for any longer than necessary, and this bill helps \nassure passengers that their time in these tight spaces won't be longer \nthan absolutely necessary to get to their destination.\n  We have gone from a record high of 268 flights delayed on the tarmac \nin June of 2009, to zero planes delayed on the tarmac for more than 3 \nhours in 2 consecutive months in October and November of last year. In \nthe 8 months since the DOT rule was put in place, only 15 flights were \ndelayed for more than 3 hours; in the same 8-month period the year \nbefore 586 flights with thousands of passengers aboard were held on the \nrunway for hours on end.\n  After so many years of hearing horror stories of passengers being \nheld hostage aboard aircraft for 9, 12, and even, what I believe is a \nrecord, 16 hours, passengers will be able to point\n\n[[Page S811]]\n\nto Federal law that protects them. I hope the only runway record we set \nin the near future is the number of consecutive months without a single \ntarmac delay.\n  To its credit, the Department of Transportation took our bill, and \nwrote much of it into regulation, and for that, I commend Secretary \nLaHood and his predecessors. Flights will no longer be stranded on U.S. \nrunways for hours on end, with passengers on board just hoping for \nclean water, lights, or appropriate facilities. The Department will \nalso impose a fine of $27,500 per passenger on a stranded flight. \nAirlines that neglect the welfare of passengers aboard their aircraft \nwon't soon forget the hefty fines they face.\n  The rules and regulations drafted by the Department of Transportation \ngo a long way towards addressing our concerns. While it would be easy \nto say the job is done, and passengers are protected, I am pleased the \nFAA reauthorization will codify the passengers' bill of rights \nprovisions.\n  It is critical that the Department of Transportation understands that \nthe passengers' bill of rights will extend these passenger protections \nto international flights using U.S. airports. A passengers' final \ndestination should not dictate his or her rights on the runway. Let us \nbe clear, this passengers' bill of rights applies to every passenger on \nevery commercial plane taking off from or landing in the United States \nor its territories.\n  At the end of a flight, there is simply no excuse for trapping people \naboard an aircraft for hours on end with airport facilities only yards \naway. On December 26, 2010, four international flights were held at \ntheir U.S. destinations for upwards of 10 hours. While the airport and \nairlines continue to bicker over who was responsible for the delay, we \nwant to make sure it never happens again. This legislation will ensure \nthat airlines operating international flights will have a strong \nincentive to find a way to give passengers a way out. It is my hope \nthat in the future all airlines will move heaven and earth to ensure \nthat passengers are not trapped aboard aircraft without access to basic \nneeds.\n  Airports and airlines have worked hard to improve service and reduce \ndelays. In Portland, one of the major airports in Maine, the number of \ncancelled flights has dropped from 702 in 2001, to 213 in 2010, and the \nairport had the greatest percentage of on time departures since 2002. \nThe naysayers who told travelers that these new rules would cause \nhundreds of cancellations have been proven wrong. Now, if we could only \ntame our famous New England winter storms, we could reduce that number \neven more.\n  This bill also provides recourse to consumers who have complaints or \nconcerns about their air travel experience. When you have an issue with \nair travel, a consumer complaint hotline at DOT will be available to \ntake your call. While it is our hope that this bill will improve the \nflying experience for travelers, passengers should have a clear path to \naddressing concerns with airlines. DOT should serve as a clearinghouse \nfor collecting these concerns so a ``big picture'' view of the entire \nindustry is available.\n  I am pleased that this legislation puts into Federal law the clear \nright of passengers to be treated with dignity while traveling. \nReasonable treatment aboard aircraft should not just be a rule, it \nshould be a legal right of passengers.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Boxer on other vital \ntransportation issues that affect our rail lines, ports, and highways, \nand the entire Nation. With the reauthorization of many of our \ntransportation programs this year, I am confident that improving the \nmovement of passengers and freight will remain a congressional \npriority.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a Federal \nprogram that creates jobs, improves communities, and ensures air travel \nthroughout the United States. The Essential Air Service Program was \ncreated in the wake of the airline deregulation of the 1970s to ensure \nthe continuation of commercial airline service for smaller communities.\n  Four airports in Maine participate in the EAS Program: Augusta, \nRockland, Bar Harbor, and Presque Isle. The EAS Program supports these \ncommunities and creates direct and indirect jobs.\n  If the EAS Program were discontinued, travelers would lose choices \nand the economies of these communities would suffer. For residents of \nnorthern Maine, the only way to travel by air would be following a 3- \nto 4-hour car drive.\n  The Maine Department of Transportation calculates that 1,351 direct \nand indirect jobs rely on aviation activities at the four Maine EAS \nairports. In rural areas such as Rockland and Presque Isle, these jobs \nmake a huge difference. Without EAS, these jobs would likely disappear.\n  Additionally, without EAS, our rural communities would be less able \nto attract new businesses and residents. A businessperson may be less \nlikely to locate a new operation in northern Maine if scheduled airline \nservice is more than 3 hours away. It would be simply unfair to pull \nthe rug out from under these rural communities as they try to attract \nnew jobs and businesses.\n  EAS is a small fraction of the total FAA spending, but it has a large \nimpact on our Nation's rural communities and travelers. I strongly \nsupport the Essential Air Service Program and will oppose eliminating \nthis program.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have a briefing by the Secretary of \nState. We have votes scheduled at 10 until noon, about. I ask unanimous \nconsent that vote be extended to 10 after the hour of noon to allow \nMembers to listen to the Secretary of State and still move the bill \nalong.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I have talked to the Republican leader. He knows I have \nasked this consent.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 380\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, in a few minutes, I will ask the Senate to \nproceed to the consideration of S. 380. S. 380 extends the Andean Trade \nPreference Act. But first I would like to make a few comments about the \nimportance of this trade preference act.\n  I am very aware that a lot is going on in the world and there is \nupheaval in the Middle East and there is a lot going on on both sides \nof the aisle on spending, and I am very aware of what has dominated the \nnews and the attention of the Congress and the American people. I want \nto talk for a few minutes about the importance of the Andean Trade \nPreference Act and the need to reauthorize it.\n  I remind my colleagues that the Andean Trade Preference Act was first \nenacted by President George Herbert Walker Bush as a way to boost the \nlicit economies of several Andean nations that were major producers of \nillegal drugs. Over the past two decades, this program has been \nsupported by Democratic and Republican Presidents, it has been \nreauthorized by Democratic and Republican Congresses, and it has been \nwidely recognized as a dramatic success--creating jobs for our workers, \nwho can sell cheaper imports to American consumers as a result of these \ntrade preferences, while also supporting the economic development of \nstrategically important countries in our hemisphere.\n  One of these countries is Colombia. We have been rightly focused on \nother parts of the world over the past decade, but one of the untold \nsuccess stories is Colombia's transformation from a failed state to a \nthriving democracy. It has been one of the world's great stories and \none of the greatest bipartisan triumphs of U.S. foreign policy in \nrecent memory.\n  Through the courage and perseverance of the Colombian people, the \ngovernment and armed forces of Colombia took their country back from \nterrorists and drug traffickers and warlords who murdered the innocent \nindiscriminately and sowed our society with illegal drugs. We were with \nthem every step of the way. It was President Bill Clinton, together \nwith a Republican Congress, who first enacted Plan Colombia, and it was \nPresident George W. Bush, initially with a Democratic Congress, who \nexpanded Plan Colombia.\n\n[[Page S812]]\n\nOver the past decade, the U.S. taxpayer has invested more than $8 \nbillion to help Colombia win its war, and it has been some of the best \nmoney we have ever spent on a national security program. Remember, the \nPlan Colombia and the war, where we helped the Colombians take back \ntheir country from FARC and the terrorists and drug dealers, were to \nprevent drugs from coming to the United States of America, where the \ndemand was created.\n  So I am proud that as an act of generosity and help on the part of \nthe American people, it was in America's national security interest to \nsee Colombia not become a failed state, which it almost was 10 years \nago.\n  The Andean Trade Preference Act has been a critical component of this \neffort. It has provided Colombia, along with other Andean nations, \nessential open access to our markets that has catalyzed their success. \nWhat is more, the vast majority of the products these countries are \nexporting to us Americans barely produce at all, such as cut flowers. \nSo it provides a huge benefit for our partners, with little competition \nor displacement for our workers.\n  Unfortunately, after the long record of bipartisan support for this \nsuccessful and vital program, the last Congress did something deeply \nshortsighted and terrible: Rather than extend the trade preferences, as \nprevious Congresses have done, it made their passage and the passage of \nother vital free-trade measures conditional on the extension of a whole \narray of new government spending--spending our country cannot afford.\n  As a result, the Andean Trade Preference Act expired last weekend and \nwith it the privileged market access that is so vital to key Andean \npartners, such as Colombia. What is even more terrible, we are failing \nColombia at the worst of all possible times, as it is struggling to \nrecover and rebuild from massive flooding. I saw with my own eyes the \nmassive flooding, where hundreds of thousands of people have been \ndisplaced. They have been devastated, and the estimated cost to rebuild \nis several billion dollars.\n  But it is even worse than that. Not only has this Congress denied \nColombians vital trade preferences at a time when their country is \nliterally underwater, it has done so amid the continued failure to \nratify the Colombia Free Trade Agreement. This agreement mainly \nbenefits us, leveling the playing field for U.S. workers seeking access \nto Colombian markets.\n\n  But the signal of strategic commitment that it sends to Colombia \ncan't be understated. By failing for 5 straight years now to pass a \nColombia Free Trade Agreement, we are sending the opposite signal--that \nthe United States is an unreliable and untrustworthy ally and that we \nseem to be incapable of rising above our own domestic political \ndifferences to consolidate our strategic partnership with one of our \nbest friends in the world. It is sad.\n  No trade agreement during a time of great need due to a natural \ndisaster, and how have the Congress and the administration responded? \nBy failing to extend critical trade preferences for Colombia and our \nother Andean friends. We have kicked an ally while they are down and \nright when they need us most. Colombian officials tell me that without \nthese trade preferences, their cut flower industry, which is one of the \npillars of the Colombian economy, could contract by 15 to 20 percent in \nthe coming weeks.\n  Now is the time to right this wrong. Now is the time to come together \nand extend the Trade Preference Act--by itself, on its own, and on its \nmerits, just as Congresses before us have done. This legislation will \ndo that. It will extend the privileged market access for our Andean \nfriends until November 30 of next year. After we have invested so much \nin the success of the Andean region--investments that have earned us \nenormous goodwill and gratitude--why would we do anything to call our \nfriendship into question? Why would we do anything that harms our \nallies? We cannot afford not to extend the Andean Trade Preference Act.\n  Let me also explain something to my colleagues. Before we went out of \nsession last year, we made an agreement--and the Senator from Ohio, \nwhom I see on the floor and who was one of the negotiators--that the \ntrade adjustment assistance would be extended along with the Andean \nTrade Preference Act. The interesting thing about that extension is \nthat it was not only an extension of the trade adjustment assistance as \nit was prior to the stimulus being passed, but also after. In other \nwords, the trade adjustment assistance had gone up to some $2.6 \nbillion, an additional $620 million for the remainder of this year. So \nit is in existence today, with $1 billion being spent on various \nprograms. There is a GAO study that severely questions these multiple \nemployment and training programs that are in existence today. They talk \nabout the $18 billion being spent to administer 47 programs, an \nincrease of 3 programs and roughly $5 billion since their last \nreporting.\n  What I am asking my colleagues who are supportive of the TAA is to \nagree to an extension of the Andean Trade Preference Agreement in \nreturn for our extension, our agreement to extend the trade adjustment \nassistance at the level of pre-stimulus. The stimulus was supposedly \nadvertised as a one-shot deal. So why should we increase trade \nadjustment assistance in keeping with the enactment of the stimulus \npackage? Now that the stimulus is supposedly over, can't we go back to \nprevious levels of adjustment assistance?\n  I wish to make the record perfectly clear: This proposal of killing \noff trade adjustment assistance is in being as we speak today. We are \nsaying we don't want the increase that was put in in 2009 as a result \nof the stimulus package.\n  Things are not great in our Western Hemisphere. We have a return of \nDanny Ortega in Nicaragua, we have Hugo Chavez continuing to \nconsolidate power in Venezuela. We are seeing other nations in the \nregion--and I won't enumerate them--that are becoming more and more \ndictatorial, totalitarian, and anti-American. So when we don't extend \nthe ATPA, the signal to our friends and our adversaries in the region \nis very clear: You can't count on the United States of America to keep \nits solemn agreements negotiated and ratified by Republican and \nDemocratic Presidents and Congresses.\n  I understand and appreciate and respect the Senator from Ohio, the \nSenator from Pennsylvania, and the Senator from Montana and their \ndedication to trade adjustment assistance. I am not seeking to end TAA. \nWe are seeking to leave TAA at its previous level prior to the stimulus \npackage being enacted. I don't understand why that shouldn't be \nsufficient in this era of huge deficits and debts.\n  I ask my friend from Ohio and those on the other side of the aisle \nwho oppose a long-term extension--who oppose the Andean Trade \nPreference Act being extended--that we would agree to the extension of \nthe trade adjustment assistance only at the level where it was before. \nIsn't that reasonable? Isn't that reasonable? It is $1 billion a year. \nIt is $1 billion a year that is going to be allowed under the TAA.\n  Again, I understand there are a lot of things going on in the world. \nThere are a lot of things going on domestically. There are a lot of \nthings happening, but shouldn't we pay attention to our friends, our \nlittle friends who helped us so much in this war on drugs? If they had \nbecome, as they nearly did 10 years ago, a failed state, the \nconsequences to the United States national security would have been \nprofound. We are watching the violence in Mexico and we are alarmed by \nit, including the death of a DEA agent and the wounding of another one \nin the last couple of days in Mexico. My friends, that was a Sunday \nschool picnic compared to what was going on in Colombia before we \nhelped them with the Andean Trade Preference Agreement. I urge my \ncolleagues to please consider at least a short-term extension of this \nATPA, along with the basic TAA, at least to give these people an \nopportunity to recover from the devastation they have experienced.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of S. 380. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read \na third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Is there objection?\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I \nknow the Presiding Officer, the junior Senator from North Carolina, \nwants to\n\n[[Page S813]]\n\nbe part of the TAA extension. I appreciate that, as do Senator Casey \nand Senator McCain and Senator Baucus.\n  My problem is this: I want to work with Senator McCain on this. I \nwant to make this work. I want to extend the Andean trade preferences. \nHe and I worked this agreement out with Senator Kyl and Senator Casey \nand others at the end of last year, in the last 2 hours of the session. \nI think that was the time line. Right at the end, we were able to \nextend all of this, but only for 6 weeks. He wanted longer, I wanted \nlonger, but we couldn't get an agreement.\n  Senator McCain asked, is it not reasonable to extend the old TAA. The \nold TAA started 50 years ago. It was a great program. It was \nbipartisan. It has always been that. But it is not reasonable to do \nonly the old TAA. There have been 150,000 workers who are eligible \nsince the Recovery Act passed for the expanded TAA because they happen \nto have lost their jobs to countries we didn't have a free trade \nagreement with. They were not eligible under the old one, but they are \neligible under the new one. Or they happen to be service workers. They \nare eligible under the new one but not under the old one.\n  It is a situation where because of things we do in this body--we pass \na trade agreement, people lose their jobs. We have an obligation--I \nknow people are focused on government spending, as we should be, and on \nthe deficit, as we should be, but this is an action of the House and \nSenate. We pass tax policy here. We give tax breaks to companies that \nmove overseas. Why don't we pay for this TAA with something like that? \nWe could always do that.\n  The point is there are so many workers in this country who have lost \ntheir jobs because of trade agreements, because of tax law and trade \nlaw. They should be eligible for getting some assistance so they can \nget retrained and go back to work. We all know people in our States--\nArizona, Nevada, Oregon, Texas, West Virginia, and Ohio--where that has \nhappened.\n  The other thing we need to extend is the health care tax credit. We \nknow that literally thousands of workers--I can give you some examples \nquickly: 400 Americans in Arizona, 1,400 Americans in Georgia--mostly \nDelta workers--6,800 Americans in Michigan, 9,200 Americans in Ohio, \n68,000 Americans scattered around every other State in this country--\nbecause of the Recovery Act and the expansion of the health care tax \ncredit, they would be able to continue to get their health care.\n  So with reluctance--I don't want to do this, because I want to see \nthe Andean trade preferences extended--I am going to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, all I can say to my friend from Ohio is \nwe have deep sympathy for the plight of the citizens of Ohio who have \nbeen very hard hit in this economic disaster that this Nation has \nundergone in the last couple of years. There has been enormous loss of \njobs and income on the part of the citizens of Ohio, and particularly \nthat part of the country. I would also argue that my home State of \nArizona has suffered rather dramatically as well.\n  But does it make sense to dramatically increase any program at this \nparticular time? We are already spending $1 billion a year. That seems \nto be a significant amount of money.\n  I would also point out that a lot of these training programs have \ndrawn scrutiny and even criticism from the GAO. This criticism has been \nkind of telling. It says:\n\n       In fiscal year 2009, nine Federal agencies spent $18 \n     billion to administer 47 programs, an increase of three \n     programs and roughly $5 billion since they reported in 2003.\n\n  So I don't think we could see tangible benefits from the trade \nadjustment assistance. But we are willing, I say to my friend from \nOhio, to continue to support a $1 billion program per year for trade \nadjustment assistance when we are slashing vital programs that people \nknow are far--we are all having to make sacrifices. Can't my friend \nfrom Ohio be satisfied with $1 billion for trade adjustment assistance?\n  Again, I wish to say, we do have problems in our hemisphere. We do \nhave Brazilians striking out on a new and independent course. We have \nVenezuela, Nicaragua, Ecuador, Bolivia, we have these countries that \nare looking on us as either an adversary or an enemy, depending on \nwhich country we are talking about. So the message we are sending by \nnot at least extending this agreement I think is a terrible one, and I \nask my friend from Ohio to reconsider.\n  I also wish to say this: The President of the United States and the \nWhite House should be weighing in on this. The President of the United \nStates has said he wants the Korea Free Trade Agreement and we want the \n``Colombian and Panamanian Free Trade Agreement'' as well.\n  Well, if they want that, should they not want to extend the trade \npreferences that were negotiated by President Bush and extended under \nPresident Clinton? Should we not want that--and Republican and \nDemocratic Congresses alike?\n  I have taken too much time of this body. Again, I ask my friend from \nOhio to reconsider, negotiate, do whatever we can before we continue to \nsend this terrible message to our friends in the hemisphere who have \nliterally laid down their lives in the war against drugs, which we have \nfelt is in vital U.S. national security interests.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 \nminutes to make a motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. I have great respect for the senior Senator from \nArizona. I wish to find a way--and I will give some specific names of \npeople who have benefited from the expansion of TAA. I brought in a \nstack of literally 500 letters from Georgia, Michigan, and Ohio--the \nStates hit the hardest--some 300 people in Arizona, and others who have \nbenefited from the expansion of the health care tax revenue and TAA.\n  I offered to Senator McCain--other than the fact that it costs more \nmoney, and I don't dispute that--that if we can work on specific \nproblems they have with individual parts of the expansion and if there \nis a way of working out any kind of language they don't like, I am \nhappy to do that. I am going to offer a unanimous consent request on \nTAA and tax credits and on Andean. The reason I objected is I cannot \nwalk off this floor having helped the workers in Ecuador and Colombia \nbut not the workers in Toledo and Cleveland and Phoenix and Charleston, \nWV. That is why I will make this request--which will help in every \ncase--on the Andean trade preference, TAA, and health care tax credit.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of Calendar No. 11, H.R. 359, that a Brown of Ohio \nsubstitute amendment, also on behalf of Senators Hagan and Casey, which \nprovides an 18-month extension for trade adjustment assistance, and the \nAndean Trade Preferences Act be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be \nread the third time and passed, and the motions to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, I certainly didn't want to \nget too much into this debate because the fact is that GAO concluded:\n\n       Based on our survey of agency officials, we determined that \n     only 5 of the 47 programs have had impact studies that assess \n     whether the program is responsible for improving employment \n     outcomes. The five impact studies generally found that the \n     effects of participation were not consistent across programs, \n     with only some demonstrating positive impacts that tended to \n     be small, inconclusive or restricted to short-term impacts.\n\n  We are talking about an additional $1.6 billion. We can't do that. \nWhy in the world the Senator from Ohio and other Senators from his part \nof the country were satisfied for years with a TAA of roughly $1 \nbillion and now are not satisfied with that in these times of economic \ndifficulties confounds me. It is a sad day for our friends in Colombia \nand the Andes who have sacrificed so much on our behalf. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S814]]\n\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 93, as Further Modified\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ncloture vote with respect to amendment No. 7 be vitiated; further, that \namendment No. 93 be further modified with the changes that are at the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as further modified is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the word ``Sec'' and add the following:\n\n     __.

Madam President, we are ready for the vote on the \namendment. I ask for a vote on amendment No. 93, as further modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n93, as further modified.\n  The amendment (No. 93), as further modified, was agreed to.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 7, as Amended\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to Inhofe \namendment No. 7, as amended.\n  The amendment (No. 7), as amended, was agreed to.\n\n[[Page S815]]\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I wish to ask the Senator from \nArizona to engage in a colloquy with myself and Senator Rockefeller and \nany others who wish to speak within this colloquy regarding an issue \nthat was not able to be resolved because of the time constraints.\n  I want to say that every stakeholder representing constituents all \nover America gave greatly to adopt this amendment that will have, in my \nopinion, a responsible relaxation of the perimeter rule at Washington \nNational Airport.\n  We can talk about the details certainly as we move forward, but there \nwas one major issue left unresolved that I think deserves a colloquy so \nwe know what we have to do to finish this process in conference before \nwe adopt an FAA bill that is a very important bill for our country.\n  I ask the Senator from Arizona to state his concerns about the \nunfinished part of this bill, and then we will open it for discussion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, first, I ask unanimous consent that the \ncloture vote on the underlying bill occur at 2 p.m. today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, very briefly, the Senator from Texas is \ncorrect. No one who was directly involved in these negotiations is \npleased with the outcome. Some will say that must be a pretty good \noutcome then. One of the things we did in order to enable us to come to \nagreement is defer a big issue. That issue will have to be resolved in \nconference. It is the issue of how the additional flights that are \nbeing allowed under this legislation will be allocated among the \nvarious air carriers.\n  Ordinarily, an agency will make a decision based upon criteria the \nCongress lays out in the underlying legislation; otherwise, their \ndecisions can be challenged as arbitrary and capricious. It is up to us \nto devise what those standards are. We were not able to agree on them. \nIt is one of the things we will have to try to come to an agreement \nwith each other about and then articulate a position with our House \ncolleagues in conference. This pertains both to the original or first-\nyear tranche as well to the second-year tranche.\n  I hope my colleagues and I can continue to work together in the \nspirit of cooperation to devise good criteria so the last piece of this \nlegislation can be put into place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I wish to make a couple of \nobservations. First of all, I apologize to all of our colleagues having \nto postpone cloture and precloture votes. What has happened is a number \nof folks have come in at the very last second and asked for changes. \nThat is not usually the way committee business is done. We have been on \nthis for a number of years. But we have to face the reality of that \nfact. We want to get cloture, and we want the bill to pass.\n  I say to my friend from Arizona that I will work with him and with--\nwhether it is GAO, DOT, or whomever we decide to work with or both, \nwhich we can obviously do and which is in the legislation; the GAO is \nautomatic for any Member--that I will work to try and resolve this \nproblem as best as I can.\n  There are many problems wandering around, but the basis of the bill, \nthe structure of the bill, the overall bill is actually not just about \nslots. That is a relatively small part. It has been virtually all of \nthe conversation and the debate.\n  As Senator Hutchison pointed out, a new air traffic control system, \nairline safety, all kinds of other things, are so predominantly \nimportant that we have had to proceed in this way to try to accommodate \nour colleagues, and that we will continue to try to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, let me thank the chair and the ranking \nmember for their leadership on this issue. Along with my colleagues \nfrom Maryland, we have the airports that are most affected by these \nchanges, and we have worked in that spirit of compromise. As the \nSenator from Arizona noted, I don't think anyone is totally satisfied.\n  I wish to particularly single out the ranking member and the chair \nfor their willingness to acknowledge our work on the issue of the \neffects of these additional flights. Going up from where the House \nposition was and the airport authority's original position was to make \nsure--vis-a-vis Dulles--that the economic effects of this and the \nquestion involving the potential shared debt service between the two \nairports be addressed. This was an issue, again, that we were not able \nto resolve, but I appreciate the chair, the ranking member and their \nstaffs' willingness to continue to work as this bill goes to \nconference.\n  It is very important that we get this bill passed and we move forward \non NextGen and all the other important parts of the FAA bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, there have been a lot of \nnegotiations on this amendment, but I do think we now have a \nbreakthrough and a way forward to solve the unresolved issues and pass \na very good FAA bill.\n  In general, the amendment does relax the perimeter rule, with \nexemptions. There will be five new entrant capabilities--``new \nentrant'' meaning air carriers that do not serve National Airport now \nat all--and limited incumbents that have fewer flights from National \nAirport will get five new slots that will be able to go outside of the \n1,250-mile perimeter that has been a standard restriction at National \nAirport. In addition, there will be seven flights that incumbent \ncarriers can exchange from inside the perimeter to outside the \nperimeter.\n  Earlier the Senators from outside the perimeter, which is basically \nwest of St. Louis or Denver, have wanted 75 new flights. They came down \nto 30, then they came down to 21, and now we are at 16. That would be \ntotal because the last four would come later, after a study has shown \nthat there would not be disruptions or congestion at National Airport. \nSo I think we have a very limited number of flights that will be coming \nin to National Airport--a total of 16 but, of those 16, 11 are already \nflights that go in and out of National. Thanks to the good work of the \nSenators from Virginia and Maryland, there will be very little increase \nor disruption in the National Airport area.\n  In addition, although the western Senators negotiated down \nsignificantly from what they originally wanted, the Senators from the \nnorthwest also wanted to have the capability for more competition and \nmore consumer access, and I agree with them. I think they did a great \njob. Senator Wyden, Senator Cantwell, Senator Merkley, and Senator \nMurray also had great concerns, along with the Senators from Alaska, \nSenator Murkowski and Senator Begich. They had concerns we had to \naddress. And the California Senators most certainly have wanted more \naccess from California, and that is a huge population base that will \nnow have better access to National Airport as well as Dulles.\n  I think that is the outline of the amendment we have just adopted, \nand we are going to continue to work in conference. The House bill has \nfive new entrants only, and we have 16. We have conversions; the House \ndoes not. So there will be a lot of talk and a lot of input, but my \ngoal is to have more competition, to have strengthened air carriers for \nour overall U.S. air competition, and to ensure that the people west of \nthe Mississippi River have access to National Airport.\n  I think we have made a good start, and I commend all of those who \nhave been involved in a very delicate negotiation. I especially thank \nmy chairman, Senator Rockefeller of the Commerce Committee, for helping \nus to get to this point where we could pass an FAA bill.\n  As has been mentioned, we are on our 18th short-term extension of \nFAA, and if we are going to have the next-generation air traffic \ncontrol system, a modernization of the air traffic control system and \nthe safety requirements, we have to pass the underlying bill. So we \nhave taken a major first step. It is not the end by any means, but it \nis the beginning of the end.\n  I now recognize Senator Wyden, who was very much a part of \nresurrecting from the dead, I would say is not too strong a term, the \namendment that\n\n[[Page S816]]\n\nwould have gone by the wayside but for his persistence in ensuring that \nwe could come to terms that would make no one happy but also no one \ntruly unhappy.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I yield to the distinguished chairman of \nthe Commerce Committee, and I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak briefly after the chairman of the Commerce Committee has \nspoken.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I wish to echo what Senator \nHutchison has just said. In the process of legislation, if you look at \nit logically, you do it over a period of years--1 or 2--or a number of \nmonths, and people get their amendments in. That has not been the case \nhere. On the other hand, one has to recognize that people feel very \nstrongly, and when Senators feel very strongly, they have that right, \nand they have the right to try, therefore, to affect the legislation \neven though it may be at the very last moment. I think everybody is \nacting in good faith.\n  I appreciate very much the Senator from Washington, Maria Cantwell, \nbecause she has given up a lot and she has also been very cooperative. \nShe is going to be the new chair of the aviation subcommittee, which I \nlook forward to and appreciate. I also appreciate the leadership of \nSenator Hutchison and all other Members--the Senator from Virginia \nwhose time I have taken, Senator Wyden--who have participated in trying \nto work this out. It is not a beautiful process, but it is one that \nthroughout the Senate has been solid and strong, and it needs to be \nvoted for when that time comes. As I said, slots are not the only \nissue. The other issues are huge, and they are resolved without any \ncontentiousness at all. So in that spirit of really thanking all who \nfought for what they have a right to fight for and saying that we have \ntried to respond as best we could--and if nobody is entirely happy, \nthat probably means it is a good bill, a good approach--I wish to thank \neveryone.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I appreciate the chance to speak for just \na few minutes.\n  I particularly wish to thank Senator Hutchison and Senator \nRockefeller and tell colleagues that last night, at 10 o'clock, after \nhours and hours worth of negotiation, I thought the prospect of working \nthis out was absolutely gone. I thought that once again the Senate \nwould walk away from the idea of trying to come up with a way to have a \nmore competitive market-oriented system in the aviation sector.\n  Obviously, this is not all that needs to be done, but this issue of \nslots, I would say to colleagues and the folks who are listening, is \nnot about adding more gambling machines; this is about the right to \nland a plane. In much of our country, we have crowded airports, and \nfolks are very concerned about that because it really relates to the \nbusiness climate and it relates to quality of life. And it is not just \nin my part of the country but lots of other parts.\n  So this morning we still had three or four outstanding issues. A \ngroup of Senators, on a bipartisan basis, got together. We were just a \nlittle ways up here in the building, and in good faith we worked \nthrough a variety of issues--issues to make sure everybody was treated \nfairly in terms of scheduling, issues to ensure fairness with respect \nto the new flights and to something called conversion, which \nessentially involves taking short distance of flights and turning them \ninto long distance flights. We still have some matters, obviously, that \nwe are going to have to review with respect to studying this issue and \nensuring all airlines have equal access to the markets. It is a \nsensitive subject, particularly to folks here in Virginia and Maryland. \nSo these are areas that are going to take some additional work, but I \nthink, with the new provisions that have been added, particularly to \nmake sure we would have the five new round-trip flights from Reagan \nNational, ensuring these new slots would be intended for long-distance, \nfor out-of-perimeter, we have moved a long way to ensure that the \nSenate will go into conference on a bipartisan basis in a unified \nfashion.\n\n  Madam President, I would like to take particular note of the \nextraordinary work done by Senator Cantwell, my colleague from the \nPacific Northwest. When you reach an agreement such as this, which had \nthree or four provisions, in effect, that were still being thrashed \nthrough this morning, it only comes together when colleagues say they \nhave to find a way to get to some common ground and they can't simply \ngo into a negotiation and have everything their way. Nobody, in my \nview, in these discussions moved more from the position they were most \ninterested in than Senator Cantwell.\n  Chairman Rockefeller has been right to note that she will be the \nchair of the subcommittee. I can assure colleagues that no one will do \nmore to protect the consumer, protect competition, and to protect the \nmarketplace that we would like in the aviation sector than Senator \nCantwell. She was instrumental last night and this morning, where we \npractically could have been fed intravenously and she just stayed put \nand kept negotiating to get to the point where we had an agreement on \nthese slots.\n  I referenced, Chairman Rockefeller, when the Senator was off the \nfloor, that we can continue this kind of cooperation as we have this \nbill pass the Senate and we go to conference. There is a reason we \ncouldn't resolve the slots issue in the past; that is, despite efforts \nto come together, we just couldn't get Senators to focus on these three \nor four outstanding issues that were dealt with this morning. I think \nwe have been fair to the big markets under this agreement as well as \nthe smaller markets.\n  So as the chairman goes into the conference, I think the good will \nthat came about as a result particularly of last night's efforts and \nthis morning's efforts and all the cooperation he and Senator Hutchison \nhave shown--he will be able to take an issue that was seen as \nabsolutely impossible to resolve even as of late last night--because I \nfelt when I walked in this morning that we were just going to hang \ndrapes on this question and possibly the whole bill. I think now this \nbipartisan effort in good will shown by a lot of Senators on both sides \nof the aisle, led by the chairman and Senator Hutchison, is going to \npay off. It is a very good start to an issue that isn't going to be \nresolved today, but some of the principles that have been laid out \ntoday are going to make a huge difference.\n  I wish to close by saying that my colleague from the Pacific \nNorthwest, Senator Cantwell, who I believe knows as much about aviation \nas anybody on the planet at this point, did an awful lot to bring \npeople together.\n  I look forward to working with the chairman as we go to conference, \nand I thank him for his cooperation. I also look forward to talking \nabout some additional issues that he knows I care a lot about--the \ndrones that are so important to central Oregon--but I acknowledge that \nhe has made it possible for us to make an enormous amount of headway \ntoday, and I look forward to working with him and Senator Hutchison in \nthe days ahead.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The Senator from Georgia.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Isakson are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     FCC Resolution of Disapproval\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, yesterday, along with Senators Hutchison \nand McConnell, I introduced a Resolution of Disapproval that if \nadopted, will overturn the FCC's attempt to regulate the Internet \nthrough its recent Open Internet Order.\n  In December, the FCC, defying Congress and the Judiciary, announced \nan order that will give it sweeping new authority to regulate content \non, and access to, the Internet. Particularly in today's economy, the \nInternet and associated applications should be able to\n\n[[Page S817]]\n\nevolve without unnecessary government interference that could stifle \ninnovation. The last thing the government needs to do is once again \nburden the private sector with additional burdensome regulatory red \ntape. While the FCC's action is certainly concerning, it should come as \nno surprise considering this administration's history of usurping the \nprivate sector's role in our economy and replacing it with more heavy-\nhanded federal regulation. As we have learned, such regulation only \nserves to micro-manage private businesses and limits the ability of \ncompanies to grow. On the contrary, this order will serve to smother \ncreative new uses for the Internet and to slow the expansion of \nadvanced broadband networks.\n  As you know, the Internet has become an indispensable part of our \neconomy and an integral part of our society. It is a source of \ninnovation, information, entertainment, commerce, and communication. \nLargely unfettered by government laws and regulations, the Internet \nowes much of its success to innovators and entrepreneurs having the \nfreedom to imagine, explore, and create new uses for the Internet. The \ninnovation and ingenuity associated with the creation and development \nof the Internet in this country is a prime example of what the private \nsector is capable of if its hands are not tied by Washington \nbureaucrats. The problem with the FCC's order is that it puts the FCC \nin the position of being the final arbiter of what broadband service \nproviders can and cannot do with their networks. As the Internet \nevolves, new network services and management practices may be necessary \nor desirable. Yet, I fear that companies will now either be barred from \ninnovating or will have to seek the FCC's permission first.\n  Under the order, Internet providers ``shall not block lawful content, \napplications, services, or non-harmful devices, subject to reasonable \nnetwork management''. The order also states that these providers \n``shall not unreasonably discriminate in transmitting lawful network \ntraffic over a consumer's broadband Internet access service.'' Guess \nwho gets to make the determinations as to what constitutes ``lawful'' \nor ``reasonable''? Not the consumer. Not Congress. Rather, it is the \nunelected bureaucrats at the FCC, alone, that will make those \ndeterminations. This gives the Federal Government, for the first time, \nthe power to make decisions that will affect what websites consumers \ncan and cannot access and how they may access them.\n  I continue to believe that the competitive market is the best means \nto preserve and advance the future of the Internet. That is why I have \ncontinued to fight the FCC's attempts at regulating the Internet under \nthe guise of preserving ``openness''. In 2009, I cosponsored an \namendment with Senator Hutchison that would have prohibited the FCC \nfrom using any appropriated funds ``to adopt, implement, or otherwise \nlitigate any network neutrality based rules, protocols, or standards.'' \nAlso, late last year, I authored a letter, signed by 28 of my \ncolleagues, to the FCC urging it not to proceed with this order.\n  With the sweeping new authority the FCC has given itself, one \nquestion that should be asked: Is this order even necessary? How many \npeople in this country have been unable to access the Internet like \nthis order would suggest? Do the American people really want more \ngovernment oversight when it comes to the Internet? The Internet is \nthat last frontier when it comes to innovation without government \ninterference, do we really want to jeopardize this? Isn't this more \nlike a solution looking for a problem?\n  Consumers today have more access to more Internet services than ever \nbefore. Business has invested tens of billions of dollars in new \nbroadband infrastructure. Internet entrepreneurs continue to offer new \nservices, applications, devices, and content to users of broadband \nInternet networks. In this type of environment, there is little \njustification for this type of proposed intrusion into the broadband \nmarketplace It appears, then, that this Order is simply a solution in \nsearch of a problem that does not exist. As we have seen time and again \nin Washington, this is a recipe for producing unintended consequences.\n  I do believe that government does have a significant role to play in \nguiding the future of the Internet. There is a role for the government \nin guiding the future of broadband, but net neutrality misses the mark. \nThe new government restrictions provided for under the FCC's order will \nonly serve to reduce the private sector's investment in our nation's \nbroadband infrastructure. Rather, Congress should work with industry to \nfind ways to encourage broadband investment and to promote competition \namong Internet providers. Investors are eager. During this economic \ndownturn, tens of billions of dollars have been invested in new \nbroadband infrastructure. In turn, this has enabled Internet \nentrepreneurs to offer new services, applications, devices, and content \nto more and more users of broadband Internet networks.\n  President Obama recently announced his initiative to expand broadband \ndeployment so that 98 percent of Americans have access to wireless \nInternet service. I support this goal. However, for this goal to be \nachievable, there needs to substantial private sector investment and \nparticipation, which cannot coexist with the FCC's order. In fact, I am \nconfident that if Congress and the courts do not act to reverse this \norder, it will discourage investment, stifle innovation, and cost this \ncountry more jobs.\n  The FCC's order is anti-free market, anti-competitive, will threaten \nAmerican innovation and cost American jobs. What possible reason would \nthe private sector agree to invest under this type of heavy-handed \nregulatory environment provided under this order? I cannot think of \none. In fact, this order only creates disincentives for private \ninvestment and innovation, which will only put us behind the rest of \nthe world. Consumers today use and have access to more Internet \nservices than ever before. While the FCC order will have little \npositive impact for consumers, it will certainly reduce the potential \nfor innovation and investment in broadband networks. This will \ndramatically slow the pace of that innovation and jeopardize billions \nof dollars of future investment into broadband networks.\n  The good news is that Congress has the tools to correct this. I \nencourage my colleagues to support the Hutchison-McConnell-Ensign \nResolution of Disapproval. This will allow Congress to repeal the FCC's \ndangerous order on net neutrality. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Silver Fleece Award\n\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, we are spending money that we do not have. \nThe administration's budget proposes taxing the American people to the \ntune of $2.6 trillion, spending $3.7 trillion, and borrowing $1.1 \ntrillion. Under the budget, interest payments on the debt are set to \nquadruple from $200 billion this year to $900 billion in 10 years.\n  The great Harvard economic historian, Naill Ferguson, has stated that \nthe decline of a country can be measured when it pays its money lenders \nmore than its Army. We will hit that level in the next few fiscal \nyears.\n  Now, in response today, I am announcing our first Silver Fleece \nAward. It is not a Golden Fleece Award because in this time of \nausterity, we can no longer afford that. We pay homage to Senator \nWilliam Proxmire of Wisconsin that put forward the Golden Fleece Award \nin the late 1970s and 1980s.\n  Working with Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, we feature what is in \nhis ``Wastebook'' on a new site called ``Wastebook on Facebook.'' \nThere, the Silver Fleece Award is being proposed in three parts for a \nvote by people who wish to participate.\n  This month we had three nominees for the Silver Fleece Award. The \nsecond runner up was a pair of National Science Foundation grants worth \n$456,000. These grants went to studies on why political candidates make \nvague statements and how Americans use online dating. The first runner \nup was for $615,000 in a grant to create a library archive about the \nGrateful Dead, a well-known rock-and-roll band.\n  However, neither of these two projects were voted on as the worst of\n\n[[Page S818]]\n\nthe current waste we see. Instead, the inaugural winner of the Silver \nFleece Award is for a nearly $1 million grant going to fund signs to \ndisplay poetry in zoos. The organization administering the program, \nPoets House and Public Libraries, states that the goal of the program \nis to ``deepen public awareness of environmental issues through \npoetry.'' I would add, using borrowed taxpayer funds.\n  Thanks to this nearly $1 million program, a visitor to the Little \nRock Zoo in Arkansas can now read the words of author Hans Christian \nAndersen saying:\n\n       Just as living is not enough, said the butterfly. One must \n     have sunshine, freedom and a little flower.\n\n  I would argue that future generations would be far more interested in \na life without debt, and taxpayers should not pick up the bill for such \nprojects.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the 2008 \nReaders' Digest article, the Poets House and Public Libraries statement \non the Language of Conservation, and the April 15, 2010, article from \nthe Arkansas Democrat Gazette.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Poets House and Public Libraries\n\n\n             Public Libraries: The Language of Conservation\n\n       The Language of Conservation is a Poets House program \n     designed to deepen public awareness of environmental issues \n     through poetry. The program features poetry installations in \n     zoos, which are complemented by poetry, nature and \n     conservation resources and programs at public libraries. \n     Working with five zoos and four public libraries in New \n     Orleans, Milwaukee, Little Rock, Jacksonville, and Chicago, \n     Poets-in-Residence collaborated with wildlife biologists and \n     exhibit designers to curate exhibitions in zoos that feature \n     poems celebrating the natural world and the connection \n     between species. The installations debuted in 2010 on the \n     following dates: Little Rock on April 17; Jacksonville on May \n     14; New Orleans on May 15; Brookfield on May 22; and \n     Milwaukee on June 19.\n       The Poets-in-Residence are Mark Doty in New Orleans, Joseph \n     Bruchac in Little Rock, Alison Hawthorne Deming in \n     Jacksonville, Pattiann Rogers in Milwaukee, and Project \n     Leader Sandra Alcosser in Brookfield, IL (just outside of \n     Chicago). The Chicago-based American Library Association is \n     collaborating with Poets House to share the outcomes of the \n     project--which is designed to be replicated--with libraries \n     throughout the United States and beyond. The Language of \n     Conservation is made possible with funding from the Institute \n     for Museum and Library Services.\n       This partnership between poetry and science began as a \n     successful program developed by Poets House and the Wildlife \n     Conservation Society that incorporated poetry into wildlife \n     exhibits at the Central Park Zoo in New York City. Through \n     the Central Park Zoo project, Wildlife Conservation Society \n     researchers discovered that the use of poetry installations \n     made zoo visitors dramatically more aware of the impact \n     humans have on ecosystems.\n       A story about the Language of Conservation, with a focus on \n     Project Leader Sandra Alcosser, appears in 360, San Diego \n     State University's blog.\n                                  ____\n\n\n   [From the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette (Little Rock), Apr. 15, 2010]\n\nPoetry Drives Home Message at Zoo: 50 Pieces Going Up To Get Patrons To \n                  Think About Nature, Their Role in It\n\n                         (By L. Lamor Williams)\n\n       Conservation was a foreign concept when notable 19th-\n     century author Hans Christian Andersen wrote: ``Just living \n     is not enough, said the butterfly. One must have sunshine, \n     freedom and a little flower.'' The Little Rock Zoo is hoping \n     such poetry posted around the park will inspire patrons to \n     think of their place in the world alongside nature.\n       The Little Rock Zoo is one of five around the country \n     chosen to participate in a $1 million federal grant program \n     aimed at promoting conservation through poetry.\n       ``The goal of the installation is to make you think a \n     little bit more about the place of humanity in nature,'' said \n     Susan Altrui, a spokesman for the zoo. ``The impact that we \n     have on our environment and the natural world is something we \n     should all consider.'' The zoo's share of the grant was \n     $31,000, which covers the cost of the signs and their \n     installation around the park. The other zoos are in Chicago, \n     New Orleans, Milwaukee and Jacksonville, Fla.\n       Little Rock Zoo employees have been working to install \n     excerpts of nature-inspired poems around the park and plan to \n     have all 50 pieces up by Saturday morning.\n       The banner that displays Andersen's quote hangs in a play \n     area near the exhibits that house small North American \n     animals such as geese and prairie dogs. The yellow words seem \n     to float on a blue sky next to a lone monarch butterfly above \n     a field of sunflowers. Many may be familiar with such \n     Andersen works as The Little Mermaid and The Ugly Duckling.\n       The program is funded by the Institute of Museum and \n     Library Science--created by the federal Museum and Library \n     Services Act of 1996--in conjunction with the Central \n     Arkansas Library System, the Poets House nonprofit group, the \n     Little Rock Zoo and the Institute for Learning Innovation, \n     Altrui said.\n       The five zoos were chosen by the Institute for Learning \n     Innovation--a nonprofit group that seeks to support museums, \n     libraries and other learning institutions--and the Poet's \n     House--a national poetry library and literary center--to \n     mimic a program started at New York City's Central Park Zoo \n     last year, she said.\n       ``They saw a lot of success with it. It was done with the \n     same organizations. They saw quite a shift in attitude before \n     and after in how people viewed conservation,'' Altrui said. \n     ``The installation was making them think more. It was making \n     them understand the connection between animals, wildlife and \n     humanity's place in the world and in nature.'' The Institute \n     for Learning Innovation has already randomly surveyed zoo \n     visitors and will conduct another survey sometime after the \n     program is in full swing to measure attitudes toward \n     conservation and whether the project had any impact on Little \n     Rock Zoo visitors, Altrui said.\n       ``The [follow-up] survey will gauge whether or not this has \n     had any effect on attitudes and whether or not someone has \n     learned,'' Altrui said. ``If we're not doing something that \n     encourages learning, then why are we spending the money on \n     it. Having that measurement tool is important when you have a \n     federal grant. We want that measurement tool also to make \n     sure that what we're doing is effective. `` A grand-opening \n     ceremony will serve as a highlight of the zoo's Earth Day \n     celebration, which begins Friday at 9 a.m. and runs through \n     closing time Saturday. The grand opening of the Language of \n     Conservation poetry installation begins at 10 a.m. Saturday \n     at the Civitan Pavilion.\n       Among the speakers will be Little Rock Mayor Mark Stodola \n     and poet Joseph Bruchac, who wrote some of the poetry \n     featured around the park, Altrui said. A full list of the \n     zoo's Earth Day Party for the Planet events, is available at \n     littlerockzoo.com.\n       J.J. Muehlhausen, project director, said she has been on \n     pins and needles waiting for the final pieces to be \n     installed. Among them, a large print poem that will greet \n     visitors at the arch over the zoo's entryway.\n       Her favorite poem has already been installed above the \n     entrance to the park's Cafe Africa. It's a simple piece by \n     W.S. Merwin that reads: ``On the last day of the world I \n     would want to plant a tree.'' ``I think that even when we \n     leave this world there will still be trees on this world,'' \n     she said. ``The first job that God gave us as humans after he \n     created us was to take care of the flora and fauna--the \n     plants and animals--of this world. That was our No. 1 job \n     assignment.''\n\n  Mr. KIRK. I would also like to now announce the new nominees for the \nnext March Silver Fleece Award. First, we will have the opportunity to \nvote to give the Silver Fleece Award for a $150,000 transportation \ngrant to create a ``wildlife crossing'' at Monkton, VT. This is a \ntechnical term for a tunnel that will allow salamanders and other \nanimals to cross below a road.\n  Our second nominee is a $46,000 grant from the National Science \nFoundation to study why people lie in text messages.\n  Third, we will nominate funding for a videogame called WolfQuest \nwhich was funded by a $508,253 grant from the National Science \nFoundation to a Minnesota zoo. We invite your votes and your feedback \non ``Wastebook on Facebook'' to decide what next month's silver fleece \naward winner will be.\n\n  The sad thing is, the only loser currently is the American people.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, in about 5 minutes, we are going to \nbe, hopefully, voting for cloture on the underlying bill, the basic FAA \nbill, which has been the product of an awful lot of work. I think, \ngenerally speaking, we have tried to bring everybody in. Senators do \nhave rights, and as a bill comes closer to a cloture vote or passage \nvote, some of those rights are exercised, which then complicates \nthings. On the other hand, it is what the system is, and people ought \nto have those rights. You cannot ask everybody to sort of sit back and \nthink through a whole bill. Something occurs to them at the last \nmoment, and they need to come down and address that. We have tried to \ndo that.\n  I think we are pretty close to a slots amendment agreement. Not \neverybody is happy about it, but everybody has\n\n[[Page S819]]\n\ngiven up and everybody has gotten from it.\n  So we will have this vote, and then we will continue work on various \naspects of the bill. I hope we can get it done tonight from the Senate \nside. Then we have to go negotiate with the House, and their bill is \nquite different.\n  But what is interesting about the aviation bill, it truly does affect \nAmerica vastly. I do not know how many times I have said it employs 11 \nmillion people. Actually, it employs, directly and indirectly, probably \ncloser to 13 million people, and it affects people's lives in every \nsingle way. They are trying to build a high-speed rail system. You \ncannot build a high-speed interstate system. You can take a chance at \nit, but it does not work very well.\n  So travel by aviation is how people get to where they want to go. It \nis a complicated industry. Costs go up. Sometimes it is because of \nfuel. Passengers are held on tarmacs. Sometimes it is because there is \njust congestion or there is a crisis at the airport of some sort. \nPassengers, when they are on their way from one place to another, do \nnot sort of think about the problems the airline industry or airports \nare going through. They just think about the fact that they are being \ninconvenienced, if, in fact, they are being inconvenienced.\n  But I think it is a very good bill, and it has been worked on a very \nlong time by myself and an extraordinarily wonderful Senator, Kay \nBailey Hutchison, whom I call cochair of the Commerce Committee, \nbecause she is.\n  People have operated in good faith. We have had a lot of scrums and \nhuddles about on the Senate floor. But that is the way legislation \nprobably needs to work. It is a very complicated bill, but it is a bill \nthat I think we will get cloture on, and people should actually be very \nanxious to vote for it when it comes to final passage.\n  I will give a talk about that. But I just remind people again, we \nhave an air traffic control system which is so antiquated that there \nare actually very many near misses in the sky because we are using a \nradar system and planes often come very close to running into each \nother on the tarmac. It is a very old system. It is a 50-year-old \nsystem. This bill will fix that and make it safer for people to travel. \nMore planes can take off and fly.\n  So I hope we invoke cloture at 2 o'clock, and then we will continue \nto work on the bill. It is important for America, and it is important \nto satisfy as many people as we possibly can.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER.

I outlined \nwhy it was so important earlier in the morning.\n  Given all the attention that discussion received, I want to make sure \nthe Senate did not lose sight of another important aviation issue. \nChairman Rockefeller has been very supportive of our efforts to try to \nexpand and improve the unmanned aerial systems--what are known as UAS \nprograms--that are so essential for the future of the aviation sector.\n  In this part of the aviation sector, we have seen enormous growth in \nthe last few years. A lot of folks know these systems are critical to \nmilitary operations. They have been of enormous importance in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. But people may not be as aware that these unmanned aerial \nsystems also have enormous potential in the civilian sector. I am \ntalking now about firefighting, law enforcement, border patrol, search \nand rescue, environmental monitoring. Law enforcement in rural areas, \nthat is much of my State, but I know other parts of the country are \nalso very concerned about this issue.\n  As yet, the Federal Aviation Administration has not come up with a \ngood plan for how to integrate these unmanned aerial system vehicles \ninto the airspace.\n  I am pleased that the bill before us includes requirements for the \nFederal Aviation Administration to work on a plan for these systems and \nestablish test sites for UAS research.\n  It is my hope as we go forward--and Chairman Rockefeller has been \nvery supportive of our efforts; we have discussed this many times--that \nit is going to be possible to expand these sites. Senator Merkley, \nSenator Tester, Senator Baucus, Senator Schumer and a number of other \ncolleagues are interested in this issue. This is a chance for the \nFederal Aviation Administration to finally give these unmanned aerial \nsystems the attention and the priority that is warranted.\n  There is enormous potential in the civilian sector. We talked about \nit in the military sector.\n  I yield now to the chairman of the committee who has been \nexceptionally\n\n[[Page S820]]\n\nhelpful to me, not just on this question of the unmanned aerial systems \nbut for his patience as we worked through the slots issues where we \nfinally got a breakthrough this morning. I am glad to yield to him for \nany comments he may have.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator very much. I \nthank him. I agree with what the Senator from Oregon is saying. I want \nto be helpful, and we will continue to be helpful. There are some in \npositions not to be helpful and are not being helpful. I understand \nthat. Such is life. I will continue to be helpful on this issue, not \njust on the substance because he has been so important in the \nresolution of what he mentioned at the very end, the slots. He has been \na nonstop peacemaker, sort of the Secretary General of the UN. He \nreally has. I respect that, and I appreciate it.\n  This is complicated. It is emotional. He has been great. I will \ncontinue to work with him on this issue to try and get to our mutual \ngoal.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the full committee. \nHe has been exceptionally gracious. I think Senators understand we \nwould not be here other than the fact that the chairman and Senator \nHutchison have prosecuted this case relentlessly in a bipartisan way. \nWe knew if we stayed at it on the slots issue we would get it resolved.\n  I thank him, given all the other things he has on his plate, for his \nhelp on the unmanned aerial systems. As my colleague knows, Senator \nSchumer and I have strong views on this issue, and we are fairly \npassionate characters. The chairman has been very patient. We know we \nhave challenges in terms of working out the exact number of additional \nsites. We thank him for his thoughtfulness.\n  This is going to be a good bill. We are going to conference in a good \nposition. It could not have happened without his tenacity and Senator \nHutchison's.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oregon. I \nlike what he said.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to add my voice of thanks to all \ninvolved in the whole slots issue. I know at the last minute Senator \nWyden was actually shuttling back and forth between one side of the \nChamber and the other. I think it turned out well. It could not have \nhappened without the support of the chairman and ranking member.\n  Coming from the largest State in the Union, we have one flight into \nWashington, DC. It makes no sense. It is not good for the economy. It \nis inconvenient. It adds a lot of congestion on the highways. We are \nvery pleased that we are on our way to passing a good bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. Boxer pertaining to the introduction of S. 388 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the Chair, I yield the floor, and \nunless Senators Rockefeller or Hutchison want to speak, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             budget debate\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this week the Senate began a debate about \nnothing less than the future of this country. Next year we face a $1.65 \ntrillion deficit, the third year in a row where the United States will \nrun a deficit of over a trillion dollars. Even more daunting, we are \nover $14 trillion in total debt.\n  According to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, or CBO, \nthe debt held by the public is projected to reach $18.3 trillion--or 77 \npercent of GDP--by the end of 2021. This is a problem that truly \nthreatens the well-being of this Nation.\n  CBO projects that the cost of simply paying the interest on all of \nthis debt will rise to $792 billion--or 3.3 percent of GDP--in 2021. \nWhen you are pushing $1 trillion a year in interest payments alone, you \nare reaching a day when the national government will not have the \nresources to accomplish even the limited mission delegated to it by the \nConstitution This is what ADM Mike Mullen, the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, meant when he testified today that ``our debt is the \ngreatest threat to national security.''\n  The President could have led on this issue, when he released his \nbudget earlier this week. But he took a pass instead. Apparently he and \nhis Democratic congressional allies have done some polling that tells \nthem two things.\n  First, the American people are demanding that Washington tackle our \nannual deficits and skyrocketing debt.\n  And second, Democrats can benefit politically by standing aside, \nletting Republicans propose solutions to this problem, and then \ndemagoguing the daylights out of any effort to restrain spending.\n  The coming debate is going to be a bruising one. But as we go \nforward, it is critical that we keep one thing in mind. We cannot get \nout of this hole by taking more of taxpayers' hard-earned money. Our \ndebt and deficit problems exist because Washington spends too much, not \nbecause taxes are too low. It is a terrible idea to propose raising \ntaxes by over $1.6 trillion on net over the next 10 years alone. Yet, \nthat is exactly what the Obama administration's budget, released \nearlier this week, proposes.\n  I said it earlier this week, and I will say it again. This budget \nproves once and for all that our deficits and debt are not caused by \nour taxes being too low.\n  The President has proposed a net tax increase of over $1.6 trillion. \nYet for next year--and every year--of his 10-year budget, he runs a \ndeficit. At their best, the annual deficits dip to roughly $600 \nbillion. Even after these astronomical tax increases, the President is \nstill unable to balance the budget. And there are not many more easy \ntargets for Democrats to tax.\n  In 2012, in a foolish attempt at class warfare, Democrats are \nprepared to let the tax rates expire with far reaching consequences for \nthe small business owners who account for half of all small business \nflow-through income. Those small business owners would see their \nmarginal rates hiked by 17 percent to 24 percent under this budget. In \nObamacare they taxed medical devices, insurance plans, prescription \ndrugs, small businesses, and individual Americans. The result--a \nsurprise only to the most hardened ideologues--is the loss of 800,000 \njobs according to the Congressional Budget Office. And yet they still \ncan't balance the budget. So who else do they propose to tax?\n  The bottom line is that there isn't anyone left to tax, unless the \nPresident and his Democratic allies are willing to crush the middle \nclass with additional tax burdens. There is only one way out. We need \nto restrain spending. As the chairman of the House Budget Committee, \nCongressman Paul Ryan, explained, we need to get spending in line with \nrevenue, not the other way around. The analyses of the Congressional \nBudget Office, or CBO, confirm this.\n  The CBO is the nonpartisan official scorekeeper for Congress. \nAccording to its January 2011 Budget and Economic Outlook, from 1971 to \n2010, taxes have averaged 18 percent of gross domestic product, or GDP. \nSo in recent history, we have had an average level of taxation of 18 \npercent of GDP.\n  Take a look at this chart that was made using CBO's January 2011 \ndocument. CBO explains that if no changes in law are made, taxes will \ngo up to 20.8 percent of GDP by 2021, and will average 19.9 percent \nfrom 2012 to 2021. Taxes at 20.8 percent of GDP would represent a tax \nincrease of 16 percent from their recent historical average.\n  CBO also states that if most of the provisions from the December 2010 \ntax act were made permanent, then ``annual revenues would average about \n18 percent of GDP through 2021--which is equal to their 40-year \naverage.'' So, according to CBO, even if all the Bush-era tax rates \nwere permanently extended, taxes would still be high enough when \nmeasured against the level of taxation in recent history.\n\n[[Page S821]]\n\n  So, if taxes are high enough already, should we raise them anyway? I \nwill go ahead and answer my own rhetorical question. Of course we \nshouldn't raise taxes any higher.\n  On August 14, 2008, Jason Furman and Austan Goolsbee wrote a Wall \nStreet Journal editorial. In that editorial, Furman and Goolsbee stated \nthat Candidate Obama's tax plan would reduce ``revenues to less than \n18.2% of GDP--the level of taxes that prevailed under President \nReagan.'' Today, Austan Goolsbee is the Chairman of the Obama \nadministration's Council of Economic Advisers and Jason Furman is the \nDeputy Director of the Obama administration's National Economic \nCouncil. The President must have missed their editorial, because his \nrecently released budget ignores the campaign promises of these top \nofficials, and raises taxes well above their historical levels. As one \nwriter has put it, all of the President's campaign promises seem to \ncome with an expiration date.\n  As this debate over the debt and deficits rages on, pay close \nattention to the words that Republicans and Democrats use. You will \nhear Republicans say that we need spending restraint. By contrast, you \nwill hear Democrats say that we need to deal with the deficit.\n  Let's be clear. Dealing with the deficit is code for raising taxes. \nLiberal pundit after liberal pundit will pronounce confidently that you \ncan't deal with the deficit solely with spending restraint. Yet they \nwon't say why, and they won't explain how you can deal with the deficit \nand debt through tax increases. That is because they can't. If they \ncame clean with the American people, they would have to admit that \ntheir intention is to raise taxes on everyone and everything.\n  As I have already shown, taxes are high enough already, and we should \nnot be raising them even higher.\n  Yet the bottom line is that rather than dealing seriously with out-\nof-control spending, tax-and-spend Democrats want to raise taxes to pay \nfor more out-of-control spending. And guess what: If we raised taxes to \neliminate the deficit, the current levels of spending would just cause \na new deficit to arise.\n  I have a chart here that demonstrates just how futile it is to raise \nthe top tax rate if the goal is to raise more money. When the top tax \nrate has been raised over the years, taxes as a percentage of GDP still \nhovered around their historical average of 18 percent. This held true \neven when the top tax rate was raised to a confiscatory level of over \n90 percent.\n  The conventional wisdom on the other side of the aisle is that we can \nsimply raise more tax revenue by increasing tax rates. However, the \nhistory is pretty clear. This strategy simply does not work. Just take \nanother look at this chart if you don't believe me. Instead of raising \ntax rates, what we need to do is implement a pro-growth tax policy. \nThat starts with not raising taxes.\n  For 2 years, we were able to fight off tax increases on small \nbusinesses proposed by President Obama and congressional Democratic \nleadership. However, I have another chart here that shows the \nrelationship between the annual growth of Federal revenues and GDP. As \nyou can see from this chart, when GDP increases, Federal revenues \nincrease. Similarly, when GDP decreases, Federal revenues decrease. \nThis should not be a shocking revelation.\n  When the economy is growing, the government collects more money in \ntax revenues because there is more taxable income being earned. The key \nis to have commonsense, pro-growth tax and regulatory policies. And as \nI mentioned before, a pro-growth agenda starts with refusing to raise \ntaxes. Part of the difference between Republicans and Democrats on \nwhether to increase taxes comes from different ways of looking at the \nworld. Conservative Republicans look at the money earned by the \nAmerican people and understand that it belongs to the people. As free \nmen and women, America's citizens have a right to the fruit of their \nown labors. Americans work too hard--they sacrifice too much--for \nWashington to blithely raise their taxes to pay for an ever expanding \nFederal Government.\n  Yet liberal Democrats have a different view. Listening to President \nObama and many congressional Democrats, it is clear that they view the \nmoney earned by the American people as the Federal Government's money \nfirst. It is only by the grace of the Federal bureaucracy that citizens \nare given an allowance to live on. This is a huge difference. You hear \nit when liberals talk about the cost of tax cuts. The cost of tax cuts? \nCost to whom? When Democrats talk like this, they are effectively \nsaying that anything you earn is the government's to spend. And it is a \ncost to the government when they decide to let you keep your money. For \nmost Americans, this is an odd way of looking at the world.\n  Government costs money when it spends trillions of dollars on who-\nknows-what. The taxpayer does not cost the government money when he \nkeeps what he earns. Yet this liberal worldview was on clear display in \nthe recent debate about whether to extend the 2001 and 2003 tax bills.\n  President Obama and many congressional Democrats said that we \nshouldn't be giving tax breaks to certain taxpayers. Since when did \nkeeping your own hard-earned money constitute the government giving you \nanything? That is not how the American people view it. And it is not \nhow I view it.\n  President Obama and many congressional Democrats viewed a failure to \nincrease taxes as a giveaway to taxpayers that increased the deficit. \nRepublicans view the job-killing tax increase with nearly 10 percent \nunemployment as a terrible idea. The way to deal with the deficit is \nnot to raise taxes. The way to deal with the deficit is to live within \nour means, as families and individuals do across America. The Federal \nGovernment should only spend what it takes in.\n  The President and his allies like to say they inherited these \ndeficits. That is only a half truth. They inherited some debt and \ndeficits. But they have helped create much more. For example, nearly $1 \ntrillion was added to our debt by President Obama's partisan stimulus \nbill. That bill was loaded with pent-up Democratic agenda items and was \nsold with the promise that it would keep unemployment below 8 percent. \nWe all know that by the President's own standard the stimulus bill has \nfailed miserably. Unemployment has been at or above 9 percent for the \nlast 21 months. That stimulus debt was not inherited by President \nObama, it was created by President Obama, and he is bequeathing it to \nall of our children and grandchildren.\n  The numbers do not lie. When Democrats took over Washington, it was \nlike setting Homer Simpson loose at an all-you-can-eat buffet. For too \nlong, the desire of unions and government workers and special interest \ngroups to create new programs and grow the size of government had gone \nunfulfilled, and when they finally seized the reins of power in 2008, \nliberal Democrats went hog wild. Our Nation's deficit has gone from \n$161 billion in 2007, when Democrats took over control of Congress--\nremember, they had 2 years before President Obama even got elected. The \nDemocrats were in control of Congress. It went from $161 billion in \n2007 to $1.65 trillion in 2011.\n  With respect to the debt, when congressional Democrats took over \ncontrol of Congress in 2007, the debt was $8.68 trillion. It is now \nover $14 trillion. So when Democrats are talking about what a bad \nsituation they inherited, let's remember that these folks have been in \ncharge of Congress for the last 4 years. They acted as though the bills \non their spending would never come due. And like a college student who \nmaxed out his parent's credit card, Democrats are now looking for \nsomeone to bail them out.\n  Unfortunately, they are looking to the American taxpayers to foot the \nbill. This cannot happen. The American taxpayer is already \noverburdened. Citizens are not going to stand for tax hikes when \nspending restraint is called for. The bottom line is simple. We cannot \ntax our way out of this problem. I personally will resist any effort to \ndo so.\n  That is one of the reasons why I am for a balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment. I have found Congress is incapable, fiscally \nincapable, of getting this mess under control. It is hard to believe we \nare that incapable, but we are. So we need to put some restraints on \nCongress, and the best way to do that, in my opinion, is a balanced \nbudget amendment. I think that would be the best way.\n\n[[Page S822]]\n\n  There are some who are looking at putting caps on spending, and that \nsounds good, except for one thing. If you break the caps, you have got \nto increase taxes. I think we would find ourselves increasing taxes all \nthe time around here, and that is a big mistake as far as I am \nconcerned. So I am very strongly for the balanced budget constitutional \namendment. I believe with the mess we are in, good people on both sides \nof the aisle ought to be interested as well.\n  The last time I brought up the balanced budget amendment, we had 66 \nvotes for it in the Senate. It passed the House overwhelmingly. If we \nhad had one more vote back in 1997 we would have had a different \nsituation today, because the balanced budget constitutional amendment \nwould have passed, and I believe 38 States would have ratified it in a \nvery quick fashion, certainly within a year or so.\n  Had that happened, we would not be in the mess we are in today. We \nare in a terrible mess. One of the reasons is Congress cannot get its \nfiscal house in order, and the reason it cannot is because of what I \nhave been talking about. I think it is going to take restraints that \nthe balanced budget amendment would bring to force Congress to have to \nlive within its means or at least vote to break the budget.\n  Most people who spend do not want that provision, because they know \nwhen they vote to break the budget, their constituents are going to see \nthat and they may not be here the next election. So as much as I would \nprefer to not have any artificial approach, I have come to the \nconclusion that Congress plain cannot handle its own problems. It does \nnot have the fiscal restraint to do it.\n  A balanced budget amendment would be a constitutional amendment, \nlocked into our beloved Constitution. It would, like all of the States \nin this country, except Vermont, require us to balance the budget or at \nleast show a reason why not and to vote so that we have to vote on why \nnot.\n  Germany has a balanced budget amendment. They meet those restraints. \nSwitzerland has a balanced budget amendment. They meet those \nrestraints. If they can do it, why can't we? I think we have got to get \nreal around here and start doing some things that will help save the \ncountry, rather than push it right into bankruptcy.\n  We spend too much. Congress and the President pushed Build America \nBonds. Why do you think they did that? The government is going to pay--\nit has been paying 35 percent on those bonds. Guess who pays that 35 \npercent. All of the States that have lived with fiscal restraint will \nbe paying for the profligacy of States that do not live with fiscal \nrestraint. That is not the way to go. It is not fair to the States that \nare careful with their money. We know which States they are. In almost \nevery case, they are States that are dominated by my friends on the \nother side. The fact is, I am totally opposed to this proposal.\n  In this budget, the President wants to make these bonds permanent, \nwhile bringing down the 35 percent government match to 28 percent. But \nthink about that. That is still 28 percent from American taxpayers, \nmost of whom have lived with fiscal restraint in their respective \nStates, to help States that have not and that probably will not behave \nresponsibly. As long as they can get free money from the government, \nwhy not, in their eyes?\n  Some of these states are in such dire straits that even some of these \nGovernors who have been big raging liberals in the past are starting to \nsay, we have got to do something about it. I want to pay particular \npraise to them. I hope they will get spending under control, because \ntheir lack of fiscal restraint and our lack of fiscal restraint here is \nhurting our country.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill.) The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Infrastructure Investment\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, the budget the President released Monday \nincludes more than $1 trillion in deficit reduction and two-thirds of \nit comes from spending cuts. That puts the Nation on the path toward \nfiscal sustainability. But it also reflects the urgency to invest now \nin programs that will pay off for a long time. Investing in \ntransportation and infrastructure is the best way to ensure economic \nrecovery now and economic growth well into the future.\n  It has been 2 years since the President signed into law the American \nRecovery and Restoration Act. The investments made in infrastructure \nover 2 years have either saved or created over a million jobs all \nacross the Nation. In the first year alone, that Recovery Act led to \n350,000 direct on-project jobs. Direct job creation from these projects \nhas resulted in payroll expenditures of over $4 billion.\n  Using this data, the House Transportation Committee calculates that \n$717 million in unemployment checks have been avoided as a result of \nthis direct job creation.\n  In his State of the Union Address, President Obama challenged us to \nstart rebuilding our infrastructure for the 21st century. Our aging \nnetwork of roads and rails was built from a long time past. Our \ninfrastructure used to be the best. But let's be honest, America has \nlost its lead. Mongolia has a more advanced air traffic control system \nthan America. South Korea has faster and easier access to the Internet \nthan America. Europe and China have high-speed rail systems far more \nadvanced than America. Dozens of commissions, academics, groups, the \nsmartest people in America, have all come to the same conclusion: Our \ninfrastructure is old and we need to invest in fixing it.\n  We have to reduce the debt and deficit. I was a member of the Deficit \nCommission. I understand it as well as anyone. But the American people \ndo not want us to do this at the expense of critical infrastructure \nthat will be needed to grow our economy.\n  Unfortunately, the House Republicans currently are in a debate on the \nfloor of the House proposing that we cut off our investments in \ntransportation--right in the middle of the year, right before the \nconstruction season. House Republicans are debating that this week.\n  Their plan cuts billions in funding for roads, rail, and mass \ntransit. It is going to cost us over 300,000 private-sector jobs. Let \nme repeat that: 300,000 private-sector jobs; not government jobs, \n300,000 jobs in the private sector. Can we afford that?\n  Let me give you some examples of what the House Republican budget \ncuts. They cut money from the Clean Water State Revolving Loan Fund--\nover $1 billion of it. That provides low-interest and no-interest loans \nto our local communities to help them build and make safe wastewater \nand drinking water. Most communities cannot afford to do this on their \nown without raising property taxes through the roof, and EPA's funding \nis vital if these projects are going to get done. This cut alone by the \nHouse Republicans would result in 454 fewer sewer projects and 214 \nfewer clean water projects across America. And it would cost us over \n33,000 jobs.\n  There is a program called the TIGER grants. Mayors know all about it \nbecause what President Obama said is, we are going to cut out the \nmiddleman. We are not going through the State capitals and the State \ndepartments of transportation. If a mayor comes to us with a good idea \nof a transportation project right at the local level, we are going to \nsend that money directly in a TIGER grant.\n  So what did the House Republicans decide to do? They took $1.1 \nbillion from that program. That, unfortunately, would eliminate all \nfunding for this program this year, cutting off this construction \nseason, $500 million worth of investment in our Nation's \ninfrastructure. Worse, it rescinds $600 million for projects that have \nalready been awarded.\n  The Department of Transportation announced these projects last year. \nNow the House Republicans want to cut them off. Communities in 40 \nStates across the country have been planning\n\n[[Page S823]]\n\nfor these funds for up to 75 projects, which would be absolutely \nabolished by the House Republican action.\n  The House proposal will literally take away funding promised for \nthese projects, stopping work. Cutting $1.1 billion from TIGER programs \nwill put more than 30,000 private-sector workers out of work in \nAmerica.\n  Then they want to cut $7.1 billion from High Speed and Intercity \nPassenger Rail Grants. I know all about that because, Madam President, \nas you know, that route from Saint Louis to Chicago on Amtrak is one of \nthe prime areas for high-speed rail in America. The Republican proposal \nwould completely eliminate it, stop it cold.\n  Worse, they would rescind more than $6 billion for projects already \nawarded funding. They take away funding from 54 projects in 23 States \nacross the country. The U.S. Department of Transportation tells us that \ncutting $7.1 billion from high-speed rail will put more than 200,000 \nprivate-sector jobs at risk.\n  At a time when we should be creating jobs and building the economy \nand building the infrastructure for even more jobs to follow, the House \nRepublicans have decided to start cutting jobs in America.\n  As the Speaker said when asked about whether he was concerned about \nthe loss of jobs from the House Republican cuts, he said: So be it.\n  I am sorry, but the Speaker has missed the obvious message from the \nAmerican people. They want us to create jobs, preserve jobs, right here \nin America. Killing jobs in the U.S. House of Representatives was not \nthe mission that anyone was sent on in the last election.\n  Compare that cutting with the President's budget. The President \nunderstands we have to invest in infrastructure. The unemployment rate \nin the construction industry--a private-sector industry--is over 20 \npercent. Construction costs at this moment are low, and local \ngovernments are moving forward where they can on projects because they \nare saving money--at the same time the House Republicans want to stop \nconstruction in America on these important projects. We need to make \nthese investments in infrastructure.\n  The President's budget calls for a 6-year, $556 billion \nreauthorization of national transportation programs, He frontloads this \n6-year bill with a $50 billion infusion of investments in fiscal year \n2012. This will help us get the biggest bang for the buck. He creates \nan Infrastructure Bank. Madam President, $5 billion is set aside to \nprovide credit assistance and loans to attract private investment into \npublic infrastructure.\n  The President is investing $8.3 billion in high-speed rail. He wants \nto bring that high-speed rail to 80 percent of the American population \nwithin 25 years. This is the first step in a long-term infrastructure \ninvestment by our country, while the President still freezes spending, \nreduces the deficit, and brings our domestic discretionary spending to \na lower level than it was under President Eisenhower in the 1950s.\n  We can invest in infrastructure in a way that is fiscally responsible \nand will lead to stronger economic growth long into the future.\n  The House is proposing slashing investments in transportation and \ninfrastructure. That will cost us jobs, and it will stop us from the \neconomic recovery we desperately need. We need to enact a balanced \nplan: cut spending, reduce the deficit, but remember that education, \ninnovation, and infrastructure are critical if America is going to \ncontinue to be competitive in the 21st century.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Durbin pertaining to the introduction of S. 386 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Under the previous order, there will now be 4 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 18 offered by the Senator from Kentucky, Mr. Paul.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, this amendment will keep OSHA out of the \ncockpit. This amendment is not about safety. OSHA wants to get into the \ncockpit to add regulatory burden. But already the airlines voluntarily \nadhere to OSHA regulations.\n  Before you vote to bring OSHA into the cockpit, you need to know and \nremember that 20 airlines have gone bankrupt in the last 10 years. Do \nwe want to add more regulatory burden? Do we want to add more \nregulatory cost? The opposite side, the President included, has said \nthey want less regulatory burden. Here is their chance. They have a \nsmall chance here. Keep OSHA out of the cockpit.\n  OSHA has 2,000 pages of rules. OSHA regulations cost the economy $50 \nbillion. Ronald Reagan was talking about OSHA way back in 1976 when he \ncommented on OSHA's 144 regulations with regard to climbing a ladder. I \nrepeat: 144 regulations about how to climb a ladder. No. 1 among those \nregulations: Remember to face the ladder when you are going to climb \nit.\n\n[[Page S824]]\n\n  He also mentioned the hazards of being on a farm. From the OSHA \nmanual on hazards on being on a farm: When you walk around, look around \ncarefully and make sure you look down because there could be a slippery \nsubstance. You could step in it and fall. That is from the 31-page OSHA \nmanual.\n  OSHA isn't all about safety. It is about regulatory burden--undue \nregulatory burden--on businesses, and I hope you will reject this. \nThere is a slippery substance around here that we need to avoid, and \nthat is more government regulations. I recommend that we vote not to \nallow OSHA into the cockpit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this has nothing to do with OSHA and the \ncockpit at all. Frankly, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said the people \nwho work in the airline industry, people who handle the airplanes, \nflight attendants, have one of the highest rates of accidents and \nillnesses in any part of the private sector. What happened is Congress \nurged the FAA to consult with OSHA about workplace safety. They entered \ninto a memorandum of understanding. All this bill says is that FAA \nshould consult with OSHA, work together to increase workplace safety in \nthe airline industry. OSHA will have no regulatory power, they will \nhave no subpoena power, they cannot issue citations, they cannot get in \nthe cockpit. FAA merely consults with them. FAA still retains all of \ntheir authority, and it will not change in any way the way airline \nsafety is regulated. FAA will continue to keep all of that authority. \nIt will be the sole purview of the FAA.\n  In addition, by terms of this memorandum of understanding, the FAA \nwill not adopt any OSHA standard unless there is no impact on airline \nsecurity. So that is a nonissue. Keeping OSHA out of the cockpit--OSHA \nis not about to get into the cockpit. What we do want to do is to have \nthe FAA get the best expertise and advice on what they should do for \nsafety around our airplanes and in our airports.\n  Mr. President, I move to table the Paul amendment No. 18. I ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

ORPHAN EARMARKS ACT.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Orphan \n     Earmarks Act''.\n       (b) Unused Earmarks.--\n       (1) Definition.--In this subsection, the term ``earmark'' \n     means the following:\n       (A) A congressionally directed spending item, as defined in \n     Rule XLIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate.\n       (B) A congressional earmark, as defined for purposes of \n     Rule XXI of the Rules of the House of Representatives.\n       (2) Rescission.--Any earmark of funds provided for any \n     Federal agency with more than 90 percent of the appropriated \n     amount remaining available for obligation at the end of the \n     9th fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the \n     earmark was made available is rescinded effective at the end \n     of that 9th fiscal year, except that the agency head may \n     delay any such rescission if the agency head determines that \n     an additional obligation of the earmark is likely to occur \n     during the following 12-month period.\n       (3) Identification and report.--\n       (A) Agency identification.--Each Federal agency shall \n     identify and report every project that is an earmark with an \n     unobligated balance at the end of each fiscal year to the \n     Director of OMB.\n       (B) Annual report.--The Director of OMB shall submit to \n     Congress and publically post on the website of OMB an annual \n     report that includes--\n       (i) a listing and accounting for earmarks with unobligated \n     balances summarized by agency including the amount of the \n     original earmark, amount of the unobligated balance, and the \n     year when the funding expires, if applicable;\n       (ii) the number of rescissions resulting from this section \n     and the annual savings resulting from this section for the \n     previous fiscal year; and\n       (iii) a listing and accounting for earmarks provided for \n     Federal agencies scheduled to be rescinded at the end of the \n     current fiscal year.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Amendment No. 64 is an amendment by myself and Senator \nBegich from Alaska. It is an orphan earmark amendment where we instruct \nthe agencies to eliminate moneys that have been sitting for 9 years or \nlonger and have not expended it. That is close to $500 million that we \ncould count so far, probably $1 billion. It helps the agencies. It is \nmoney we have already allocated that will never be spent, that is \nunaccounted for. I believe we are going to have a voice vote on it and \nI appreciate everybody's support of that amendment.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the Appropriations Committee will not \noppose this amendment not because we think it is a good idea--it is \nnot--but\n\n[[Page S826]]\n\nbecause this amendment does nothing that is not already covered by \ntitle X of the bill.\n   Sadly, this is the kind of amendment that took up far too much of \nthe Senate's time and effort in the last session, and none of it with \nany discernable value to the American people.\n   Specifically, we asked CBO to score this amendment and they said \nthey could not. They pointed out that the definition provided in the \namendment did not exist 9 years ago; consequently, there are no \nearmarks older than 9 years that meet this definition. So any claims \nthat this amendment saves the American taxpayer money is simply not \nsubstantiated by CBO.\n   Mr. President, we took the further step of asking agencies across \nthe Federal Government if they could tell us what is out there that \ncould possibly meet the Coburn standard. There are indeed a few \nprojects at the Department of Transportation, but they are already \ncovered by title X of the underlying bill.\n   Outside of the Department of Transportation, we discovered that \nthere are a few sewer grants still on the books, but they total less \nthan $5 million.\n  And outside of those two agencies, there may be anecdotal evidence of \nan earmark here or an earmark there, but that is it. Meanwhile, I note \nthat this amendment as well as title X may well end up costing the \nAmerican taxpayer more than the amendment claims to save.\n  The requirement that OMB must create and administer a database and \nmaintain it on its Web site costs money, not to mention the time and \nlabor necessary to establish the criterion for what defines a \nCongressional earmark for the purposes of this amendment.\n  In the spirit of President Obama, I will not take this opportunity to \nrelitigate our past debates over the worthiness of Congressionally \ndirected spending requests.\n  Since my announcement of a moratorium on earmarks this year, it is no \nsurprise to me to see a number of press reports about the communities \nacross the country that are now finding themselves without resources \nthey urgently need.\n  However, I must say, in the spirit of our many past debates over \nearmarks, that I find this amendment to be duplicative, ineffective, \nand a potential waste of the taxpayers' dollars. And if it had come up \nfor a vote, I would most certainly have voted no.\n  We have serious financial issues before us, and we need to get to \nwork.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the amendment is \nconsidered adopted.\n  The amendment (No. 64) was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 80, As Modified\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up \namendment No. 80, as modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 80, as modified.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 141, between lines 9 and 10, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 420. LIMITATION ON ESSENTIAL AIR SERVICE TO LOCATIONS \n                   THAT ARE 90 OR MORE MILES AWAY FROM THE NEAREST \n                   MEDIUM OR LARGE HUB AIRPORT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 41731(a)(1) is amended--\n       (1) in subparagraph (A), by redesignating clauses (i) \n     through (iii) as subclauses (I) through (III), respectively;\n       (2) by redesignating subparagraphs (A) and (B) as clauses \n     (i) and (ii), respectively;\n       (3) in clause (i)(I), as redesignated, by inserting ``(A)'' \n     before ``(i)(I)'';\n       (4) in subparagraph (A)(ii), as redesignated, by striking \n     the period at the end and inserting ``; and''; and\n       (5) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(B) is located not less than 90 miles from the nearest \n     medium or large hub airport.''.\n       (6) The secretary may waive the requirements of this \n     subsection as a result of geographic characteristics \n     resulting in undue difficulty accessing the nearest medium or \n     large hub airport.\n       (b) Exceptions for Locations in Alaska.--Section 41731 is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(c) Exception for Locations in Alaska.--Subsection \n     (a)(1)(B) shall not apply with respect to locations in the \n     State of Alaska.''.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this is an amendment regarding Essential \nAir Service. The amendment of Senator McCain is to eliminate Essential \nAir Service, which is basically a subsidy for people who have to drive \nshort distances--not long distances--to the airport. But we have \nselectively said certain people in this country can be advantaged by \ndriving certain distances.\n  What this amendment as modified says is, provided the Secretary \ndoesn't see extraneous circumstances otherwise, you have to be at 90 \nmiles or greater to qualify for Essential Air Service. We started out \nwith 100 and we saw there were significant difficulties that people \nactually had with that requirement. What we have done is taken this \namendment and moved it to 90 miles. It does not affect a large number \nof airports but there are several within this that have minimal \nenplanements.\n  Remember, the average American drives over an hour to get to the \nairport now. We are saying we are not going to do it if you are driving \nan hour and a half, 90 miles, unless there is a circumstance where the \nSecretary of Transportation says otherwise, such as some particular \nplaces in West Virginia where it is tremendously mountainous and the \ntime and distance does not meet with the average. All it does is lessen \nit.\n  Remember, in this bill we are increasing the amount of funds at a \ntime we are going bankrupt. We are increasing the amount of funds for \nEssential Air Service. What we have done is a compromise to extend it \nto those who actually need it but also not subsidize something we \nshould not. It affects less than 26 airports, and now less than that, \nnow that we have modified it. I appreciate my colleagues' support on \nthat. I think we will have actual votes on that in a minute.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 81\n\n  I call up amendment No. 81.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 81.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To limit essential air service to locations that average 10 \n                     or more enplanements per day)\n\n       On page 141, between lines 9 and 10, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 420. LIMITATION ON ESSENTIAL AIR SERVICE TO LOCATIONS \n                   THAT AVERAGE 10 OR MORE ENPLANEMENTS PER DAY.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 41731(a)(1) is amended--\n       (1) in subparagraph (A), by redesignating clauses (i) \n     through (iii) as subclauses (I) through (III), respectively;\n       (2) by redesignating subparagraphs (A) and (B) as clauses \n     (i) and (ii), respectively;\n       (3) in clause (i)(I), as redesignated, by inserting ``(A)'' \n     before ``(i)(I)'';\n       (4) in subparagraph (A)(ii), as redesignated, by striking \n     the period at the end and inserting ``; and''; and\n       (5) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(B) had an average of 10 enplanements per day or more in \n     the most recent calendar year for which enplanement data is \n     available to the Administrator.''.\n       (b) Exceptions for Locations in Alaska.--Section 41731 is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(c) Exception for Locations in Alaska.--Subsection \n     (a)(1)(B) shall not apply with respect to locations in the \n     State of Alaska.''.\n       (c) Waivers.--Such section is further amended by adding at \n     the end the following:\n       ``(d) Waivers.--The Administrator may waive subsection \n     (a)(1)(B) with respect to a location if the Administrator \n     determines that the reason the location averages fewer than \n     10 enplanements per day is not because of inherent issues \n     with the location.''.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this is another amendment on Essential Air \nService. This amendment eliminates Essential Air Service when the \naverage enplanements are less than 10 a day. There is no way we can \nafford, given our financial situation, to subsidize Essential Air \nService for the airports that have less than 10 a day.\n  I know that is a disagreement amongst us, especially for those who \nare having the benefit, that have subsidy today. By the way, the \nsubsidy is supposed to be limited to $200, but if you take what happens \non many of these, it is over $400; one of them is $482 per person per \nsubsidy on airports that have less than 10 enplanements a day. It is \ncommon sense, given the realities of where we are today, realities of a \n$1.68 trillion deficit projected by the White House for this year. It \nmakes common sense we would do this.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 91\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up amendment No. 91.\n\n[[Page S827]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 91.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To decrease the Federal share of project costs under the \n         airport improvement program for non-primary airports)\n\n       Strike section 207 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 207. FEDERAL SHARE OF AIRPORT IMPROVEMENT PROJECT COSTS \n                   FOR NON-PRIMARY AIRPORTS.\n\n       Notwithstanding section 47109(a) of title 49, United States \n     Code, section 47109(e) of such title (as added by section \n     204(a)(2) of this Act), or any other provision of law, the \n     United States Government's share of allowable project costs \n     for a grant made under chapter 471 of title 49, United States \n     Code, for an airport improvement project for an airport that \n     is not a primary airport is--\n       (1) for fiscal year 2012, 85 percent;\n       (2) for fiscal year 2013, 80 percent; and\n       (3) for fiscal year 2014, 75 percent.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, the Airport Improvement Program is a \nneeded program but what we do regularly in the Airport Improvement \nProgram is we are incentivizing the expenditure of moneys in a way that \ndoes not recognize the priorities of this country. The way we do that \nis we have a cost sharing in which the Federal Government pays for 95 \npercent of all these programs.\n  What has happened, and even in my own State, we have spent money in \nairports that have very few landings every day. There is no commercial \nservice but very few private planes landing. All this amendment does is \nit says if you are going to qualify for the AIP for airport \nimprovement, that over the next 3 years we would take that from 95 \npercent down to 75 percent, which is well above the average of every \nother grant program that we have in the Federal Government.\n  It is not about trying to eliminate, it is trying to say if we are \ngoing to set priorities, what we should do is lower the amount of \nFederal funds so that the State or the community that wants to utilize \nthese funds will recognize, by their having to pony up a little bit \nmore of the money, in fact it is a legitimate thing. At 95 percent we \nare having all sorts of money wasted on things that are not a priority \nfor our country given the financial situation we are in.\n  With that, I think I have responded in less than the time allocated \nto me, and I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There is now 10 minutes of debate, evenly \ndivided, on the Leahy-Inhofe amendment No. 50.\n\n[[Page S829]]\n\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, Senator Leahy is somewhere around here. \nBut since he is not on the floor, I will go ahead and present this \namendment.\n  This is a Leahy-Inhofe amendment. It is on two almost unrelated \nthings, but the Leahy portion of the amendment extends the public \nsafety officer program benefits from 6 to 10 families whose loved ones \ndied in voluntary services. It is fully offset for 10 years.\n  The important part of this amendment is mine, and that is--if I could \nhave your attention over here, and I am speaking to the Republicans \nnow, we have been trying to do this for a number of years, and Senator \nLeahy and I have agreed to this. Those of us who have been pilots--and \nI have been for 55 years--I have been involved in a lot of humanitarian \nmissions. What this does is offer liability protection to those of us \nwho volunteer ourselves, our money, and our aircraft to do missions no \none else will do. They are humanitarian missions. The longest one I did \nwas all the way down to Dominica, North of Caracas, Venezuela, through \ntwo hurricanes, and we saved a lot of lives down there. This would \noffer liability protection to those individuals who make those \nsacrifices.\n  There are 8,000 of us, by the way, around the country, I am sure from \nevery State represented here. So I would encourage my colleagues to \nsupport the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I have no problem at all with my senior \nSenator's modification to the amendment. I am going to ask to have a \nvoice vote on this to accommodate everybody, recognizing the late hour, \nbut I want to make a point. What Senator Leahy wants to do is great to \nhelp people. But the one question we have not asked is--and we are \ngoing to be asked to ask it all the time from here forward given where \nwe are--is it a Federal responsibility to supply these benefits? You \ncan't find it in the Constitution. You can't find it anywhere.\n  When we look at the hard decisions we are going to have to make over \nthe next 2 years in terms of trimming both mandatory programs and \ndiscretionary programs, where we set an example that we are going to \nexpand something that is not in our constitutional role, we are making \na mistake and we are setting ourselves up for failure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased we will finally vote on the \nbipartisan amendment that Senator Inhofe and I have proposed. I thank \nthe Commerce Committee chairman and ranking member.\n  Before we vote I would like to respond to some remarks made on the \nfloor yesterday. The junior Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn, \nexpressed some concern with the portion of our amendment that makes an \nimprovement to the Public Safety Officers Benefits Act. As I understand \none of Senator Coburn's concerns, it is the belief that the PSOB \nimprovement I propose exceeds Congress's proper role under the \nConstitution.\n  Section 8 of article 1 in the Constitution empowers Congress to \nprovide for the ``general welfare'' of the United States. Supporting \nour first responders, and encouraging more Americans to serve their \ncommunities as first responders, who are our first line of national \nsecurity, falls squarely within this clause.\n  Congress can and does legislate in many areas that support the \ngeneral welfare of our Nation, whether providing funds to fight violent \ncrime through joint law enforcement task forces, or providing disaster \naid to the states following natural disasters. Congress has \ntraditionally acted to support our Federal system through beneficial \nlegislation for the states. I find it difficult to understand how \nsupporting all of our Nation's first responders, on an equal basis, \nexceeds Congress's proper and traditional constitutional role.\n  According to my review, there have been 65 Federal cases concerning \nthe PSOB program, and not one of them challenged its constitutionality. \nIn 1986, the Supreme Court took up a case involving the PSOB program, \nwhich did not involve a constitutional challenge, and in fact invoked \nthe Constitution's supremacy clause to hold that the Federal PSOB \nprogram's benefit could not be interfered with by any inconsistent \nstate law.\n  Senators may disagree about the wisdom or necessity of legislating \nfor the general welfare or in support of our first responders, but as a \nconstitutional matter, Congress authority to enact programs like the \nPublic Safety Officers Benefits Act is well established.\n  For over 30 years, since 1976, the Public Safety Officers Benefits \nProgram has assisted the families of first responders lost in the line \nof duty, including local police, firefighters, and EMS technicians. \nThis policy was enacted in part to encourage more Americans to serve \ntheir communities as police officers, firefighters, and paramedics. The \nimportance of the services they provide is undeniable.\n  Senator Coburn also expressed concern that our amendment expanded \nFederal costs. So let me be clear on this point: while the estimated \ncost of this proposal is modest--less than $13 million over 10 years \nour--amendment is fully paid for through an included offset. Let me \nrepeat that because I think there may be some confusion on this point--\nthis amendment is completely paid for. It is deficit neutral and will \nhave no budgetary impact given the included offset.\n  I also heard a concern about the fact that this amendment may not be \ngermane to the underlying bill. If I am not mistaken, one of the very \nfirst amendments the Senate voted on, and for which Senator Coburn \nvoted in favor and had no procedural objection that I am aware of, was \nan amendment to repeal the health care law. I do not think that \namendment would be ruled germane. Nonetheless, in the spirit of moving \nthe legislative process forward, the Senate voted on it.\n  Senator Inhofe and I have worked together to try to advance two \nproposals that are important to us, and which will both support our \nNation's first responders and encourage volunteerism. I thank Senator \nInhofe once again, and I urge all Senators to join us in support of \nthis amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters of support for my amendment from \nthe American Ambulance Association, the National Association of EMTs, \nthe International Association of Fire Fighters, and the International \nAssociation of Fire Chiefs be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                American Ambulance\n\n\n                                                  Association,\n\n                               McLean, Virginia, February 4, 2011.\n     The Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: On behalf of the membership of the \n     American Ambulance Association (AAA), I am proud to convey \n     our strong support for Amendment No. 50 to the FAA Air \n     Transportation Modernization and Safety Improvement Act (S. \n     223). Your amendment would ensure that the survivors of \n     paramedics and emergency medical technicians who die in the \n     line of duty and who are employed by nonprofit ambulance \n     service agencies are eligible for death benefits under the \n     Public Safety Officers' Benefit program. It would also \n     provide much needed liability protection to volunteer pilots.\n       We greatly appreciate that the amendment is named after \n     Dale Long who lost his life in the line of duty in June of \n     2009. Dale was a certified paramedic and provided emergency \n     medical care to patients for nearly twenty five years, most \n     recently with the Bennington Rescue Squad. Just two months \n     prior to his death, Dale was recognized by the American \n     Ambulance Association as a Star of Life for his years of \n     dedicated service to patients. In 2010, Dale was honored by \n     the National EMS Memorial. Dale is deeply missed and we \n     greatly appreciate your efforts on his behalf and those of \n     thousands of paramedics and EMTs around the country.\n       The ambulance service agencies and EMS personnel which they \n     employ, just like the communities they serve, are unique. \n     Communities are served by governmental and non-profit \n     agencies and a large portion by for-profit agencies. There is \n     one characteristic, however, that is constant. When there is \n     an emergency, all EMS personnel, regardless of by whom they \n     are employed, put their lives on the line. We therefore \n     applaud your leadership to make EMS personnel employed by \n     nonprofit agencies eligible for public safety officer \n     benefits and encourage you to ensure that eventually all EMS \n     personnel are covered.\n       The AAA is the primary national trade association for \n     providers of emergency and non-emergency ambulance services. \n     The AAA is comprised of more than 600 ambulance service \n     operations which account for providing services to over 75 \n     percent of the\n\n[[Page S830]]\n\n     U.S. population. AAA members include private, public, fire-\n     based, hospital-based and volunteer ambulance service \n     providers serving urban, suburban and rural areas. The AAA \n     was formed in 1979 in response to the need for improvements \n     in medical transportation and emergency medical services.\n       Again, we strongly support Amendment No. 50 to S. 223 and \n     greatly appreciate all of your efforts on the issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Steve Williamson,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              National Association\n\n\n                             of Emergency Medical Technicians,\n\n                           Clinton, Mississippi, February 4, 2011.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy, The National Association of Emergency \n     Medical Technicians, NAEMT, strongly supports Amendment No. \n     50 to the FAA Air Transportation Modernization and Safety \n     Improvement Act (S. 223). In addition to providing liability \n     protection to volunteer pilots, your amendment would ensure \n     that the survivors of paramedics and emergency medical \n     technicians who die in the line of duty and who are employed \n     by nonprofit ambulance service agencies are eligible for \n     death benefits under the Public Safety Officers' Benefit \n     program. Your amendment would provide piece of mind to \n     thousands of emergency medical service, EMS, personnel and \n     their families including those of Dale Long.\n       The death in June of 2009 of Dale Long was a tragedy. Dale \n     was a certified paramedic and provided emergency medical care \n     to patients for nearly twenty five years and served with the \n     Bennington Rescue Squad for the last four of those years. In \n     1998, he was recognized as the Vermont Advanced Provider of \n     the Year. Dale will be deeply missed and we greatly \n     appreciate you honoring Dale by naming this vital amendment \n     after him.\n       The ambulance service agencies and EMS personnel which they \n     employ, just like the communities they serve, are unique. \n     Communities are served by governmental and non-profit \n     agencies and a large portion by for-profit agencies. There is \n     one characteristic, however, that is constant. When there is \n     an emergency, all EMS personnel, regardless of by whom they \n     are employed, are willing to put their lives on the line. We \n     very much appreciate your leadership to make EMS personnel \n     employed by nonprofit agencies eligible for federal death \n     benefits and encourage you to ensure that eventually all EMS \n     personnel are covered.\n       Again, we strongly support Amendment No. 50 to S. 223 and \n     thank you for all of your efforts on this issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Connie Meyer,\n     President, NAEMT.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         International Association\n\n\n                                             of Fire Fighters,\n\n                                                 February 7, 2011.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy, Chairman,\n     Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: On behalf of the nation's nearly 300,000 \n     professional fire fighters and emergency medical personnel, I \n     wish to express our support for the Dale Long Emergency \n     Medical Service Providers Protection Act, and urge the Senate \n     to adopt it as an amendment to the FAA reauthorization.\n       The legislation corrects an inequity in Public Safety \n     Officers Benefit, PSOB, by extending coverage to those \n     employees and volunteers of non-profit ambulance squads that \n     serve public agencies. Throughout the nation, many non-profit \n     entities serve as the principal 911 emergency responder for \n     their communities, and the emergency care providers who work \n     or volunteer for such agencies should be treated as public \n     safety officers. For example, Dale Long, the individual for \n     whom this legislation is named, served as a paramedic for the \n     Bennington Rescue\n       Squad, which is the designated 911 emergency response \n     agency for the town of Bennington, VT.\n       We believe your amendment fixes this oversight without \n     undermining the original purpose of the PSOB program to \n     provide assistance to the families of fallen public safety \n     officers. The amendment strikes, the appropriate balance, and \n     we urge the Senate's support.\n       Thank you for your consideration of the views of America's \n     professional fire fighters and emergency medical responders.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Barry Kasinitz,\n     Director of Governmental Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         International Association\n\n\n                                               of Fire Chiefs,\n\n                                    Fairfax, VA, February 8, 2011.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy: On behalf of the nearly 13,000 chief \n     fire and emergency officers of the International Association \n     of Fire Chiefs (IAFC), I would like to express our support \n     for your amendment to S. 223, FAA Air Transportation \n     Modernization and Safety Improvement Act, which would add the \n     ``Dale Long Emergency Medical Service Providers Protection \n     Act.'' This amendment strikes a proper balance between \n     providing for the families and loved ones of fallen non-\n     profit EMS personnel, and protecting the original intent of \n     the Public Safety Officers' Benefits (PSOB) program.\n       The amendment would afford previously excluded survivor \n     benefits through the U.S. Department of Justice's PSOB \n     program to the families and loved ones of fallen EMS \n     personnel who work or volunteer for a public or non-profit \n     rescue squad or ambulance crew that is officially authorized \n     or licensed to engage in rescue activity, and is officially \n     designated as a pre-hospital emergency medical response \n     agency.\n       Across the United States, many non-profits serve as the \n     principal 9-1-1 emergency medical responder for their \n     communities. These EMS personnel who work or volunteer for \n     such agencies should be treated as public safety officers \n     under the PSOB program. EMT specialist Dale R. Long, the \n     individual for whom this legislation is named, served as a \n     paramedic for the Bennington Rescue Squad, which is the \n     designated 9-1-1 emergency response agency for the town of \n     Bennington, Vermont.\n       Thank you for your continued support for America's public \n     safety community.\n           Sincerely,\n                                   Chief Jack Parow, MA, EFO, CFO,\n                              President and Chairman of the Board.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to waive the 60-\nvote threshold on this vote and have a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 50) was agreed to.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER.

I want to thank Chairman Rockefeller for the opportunity \nto have this colloquy with him today on the topic of through the fence \nagreements. Now, most folks don't know this, but there are a few \ndifferent developments throughout the country that have houses with \nplane hangars near airports, and they have what is called a through the \nfence agreement to use the airway runway. Is the Senator familiar with \nthese agreements?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I am aware of these agreements.\n  Mr. WYDEN. As the Senator might know, one place that has had a \nresidential airpark for many decades is in my home State, in a town \ncalled Independence, OR. Since 1974, folks at the Independence Airpark \nhave had an agreement with the Independence airport to taxi their \nplanes up to the runway and use it for recreation and travel purposes.\n  But recently, the FAA decided to change the rules on all through the \nfence agreements and the folks at Independence Airpark and elsewhere \nmay not be able to continue an arrangement they have had nearly 40 \nyears with no significant safety issues and no significant noise \ncomplaints.\n  That just doesn't seem fair. So I have introduced an amendment I \nbelieve will safely provide a path forward for places like the \nIndependence Airpark to continue to exist. Is the Senator aware of the \namendment I filed?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I am aware that the Senator has filed an amendment \non this issue, and I understand his concerns about this issue and its \neffect on his constituents.\n  Mr. WYDEN. While I understand we may not have an opportunity to vote \non my amendment, Mr. Chairman, as we moved forward on this FAA \nreauthorization bill, can the Senator commit to working with me to find \na solution so folks who have never gone afoul of the law or regulations \nare treated fairly?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I would be glad to continue working with the Senator \non this issue, and I appreciate his work to ensure that there is \nfairness in this regard.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Senator, both for his important work on this \nlarger FAA bill, and for his willingness to work with me in addressing \nthis issue.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will vote in support of S. 223, of the \nFAA Air Transportation Modernization and Safety Improvement Act and I \nurge its adoption and enactment.\n  The Senate is already on record in support of the contents of this \nbill. This is because the bill we are voting on today is almost \nidentical to the FAA authorization bill that passed the Senate 93-0 in \nMarch of 2010. The last reauthorization bill expired at the end of \nfiscal year 2007 and since then we have passed 17 short-term \nextensions. We are well overdue to enact a long-term reauthorization of \nFAA's programs in order to provide important funding increases and \nprogram improvements that will enhance the safety and efficiency of our \nNation's aviation system. In so doing we will make key investments in \nour nation's aviation infrastructure as well as create good jobs in the \nprocess.\n  Our global economy depends on the smooth and efficient movement of \ngoods, services and people from city to city and across international \nborders. A safe and efficient aviation system goes hand in hand with a \nstrong economy. We are fortunate to have the best aviation system in \nthe world and we must continue to make the necessary investments and \nupgrades to retain that high standard. The FAA reauthorization bill \nhelps us to do this by addressing problems of capacity, congestion and \ndelays. This will ensure our aviation system can handle the projected \ngrowth in airlines passengers.\n  The FAA reauthorization bill being considered by the Senate today \nwill create much needed jobs by providing the funding and directives \nfor safety improvements at our airports and in the aviation industry. \nFor instance, in Michigan the FAA is building two new air traffic \ncontrol towers, at Kalamazoo and Traverse City. The FAA is also \nrepaving numerous runways and taxiways, including at Detroit \nMetropolitan Wayne County Airport, Alpena County Regional Airport, \nBishop International Airport, Sawyer International Airport and at other \nairports around the state. The FAA is also constructing new terminal \nbuildings at Kalamazoo/Battle Creek International Airport and at MBS \nInternational Airport in Freeland, Michigan. Additionally, FAA funds \nare paying for the design of a new building for aircraft rescue and \nfirefighting and snow removal equipment at Pellston Regional Airport in \nEmmet County. These are much needed upgrades to Michigan airports and \nwill make flying into and around Michigan safer and easier. These are \nthe kinds of improvements this bill will continue to make possible in \nthe future.\n  A key component of S. 223 will modernize our air traffic control \nsystem by building the Next Generation Air Transportation System--\nNextGen--of satellite-based navigation. The NextGen system will be more \naccurate and more efficient than the current radar-based air traffic \ncontrol system. It will also result in significant fuel efficiencies \nand time savings by allowing aircraft to fly more direct routes. This \nis good for the environment, good for air carriers and good for the \nflying public. The bill also provides flexibility to airports in using \nAirport Improvement Program funds as well as studying ways to raise \nrevenue for airport projects through a pilot program.\n  This bill also includes important passenger rights protections. It \nrequires airlines to plan for delays and protect passengers while they \nare on an aircraft, including how airlines will provide adequate food, \nwater and access to restrooms. It also requires that passengers be \nallowed to deplane after 3 hours on the tarmac.\n  And this bill makes important improvements to the Essential Air \nService Program, which provides rural communities with access to the \nnational air transportation system. The EAS program is important to \nMichigan because we have eight communities that rely on EAS subsidies \nto help provide them with daily commercial air service. This bill \nincreases EAS program funding by $73 million a year to $200 million \nannually. I joined my colleagues in defeating a McCain amendment that \nwould have eliminated the Essential Air Service Program. I strongly \noppose attempts to deprive Michiganians living in the less populated \nareas of our State of commercial air service. For businesses in the \naffected communities, this service is an economic lifeline that \nconnects them to the web of both national and international commerce. \nAt a time when we're doing everything we can to compete and to increase \nthe number of jobs, cutting off that access makes no sense.\n  Again, I am pleased to vote yes on final passage of the FAA Air \nTransportation Modernization and Safety Improvement Act and I hope the \nHouse of Representatives will also act quickly to adopt a bill.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I believe this bill is fundamental to \nour Nation's long-term economic competitiveness. It will create good-\npaying jobs across the country. It will improve the safety and \nefficiency of our Nation's air transportation system. And it will help \nto make sure the United States remains the global leader in aviation.\n  As we approach a final vote on the FAA reauthorization, I want to \nclose by touching briefly on why this is so important--and why we have \nspent 3 weeks working on this bill.\n  This FAA reauthorization is about more than aviation, it is about \nstimulating the economy and securing jobs and retaining jobs.\n  The aviation sector supports over $1 trillion in economic activity \nand over 11 million jobs in the United States. This bill will support \nhundreds of thousands of aviation jobs annually. Moreover, it is \ncritical to the businesses that rely on aviation and will provide a \nbase for financial success in an increasingly global economy.\n  This bill is about improving commercial airline service to small and \nrural communities, making sure all areas of the country have adequate \naccess to the Nation's air transportation network.\n\n[[Page S834]]\n\n  It also establishes better consumer rights protections for travelers, \ngiving passengers a more consistent and improved air travel experience.\n  Ultimately, it is about improving safety and modernizing our system.\n  In other words, it is about people's lives every day--the safety of \nour skies for passengers and their families is critical and we must get \nthis right.\n  Statistically, the United States has the safest air transportation \nsystem in the world. But statistics do not always tell the whole story.\n  It has been just over 2 years since the crash of Flight 3407 in \nBuffalo, NY, took the lives of 50 people. This tragedy reminds us that \nwe must remain vigilant in making the national airspace system as safe \nas possible.\n  Although we were able to take important steps last August to improve \npilot training and fatigue, this bill still has several critical \nprovisions that will further improve the safety of our skies.\n  Modernizing the air traffic control system will not just make our \nskies more efficient, it represents a quantum leap forward for aviation \nsafety by providing our air traffic controllers and pilots' real-time \ntraffic and weather information.\n  The bill also takes steps to strengthen inspections of airline \noperations, require better oversight of foreign repair stations, and \nimprove helicopter emergency service operations.\n  This bill is also about equality and economic stability. It will \nprovide needed resources to airports large and small, urban and rural.\n  Although the U.S. airline industry has begun to recover from the \nrecent economic downturn, hundreds of rural communities across our \ncountry continue to struggle.\n  The future of small communities' economic standing depends on access \nto air service.\n  I have witnessed firsthand the positive impact that aviation has made \non my home State of West Virginia, and I have seen time and time again \nhow important a lifeline it is for local communities.\n  The Federal Government must continue the commitment it made when the \nindustry deregulated to provide the resources and tools small \ncommunities need to attract adequate air service.\n  Our legislation accomplishes this by building on existing programs \nand strengthening them with appropriate reforms.\n  This bill also strengthens passenger protections by incorporating a \npassenger bill of rights to deal with the most serious flight delays \nand cancellations.\n  Passengers have had it with endless delays--especially when they are \nstuck on the tarmac. They have had it with being overlooked and \ndismissed by the aviation system.\n  The Department of Transportation, DOT, has already begun implementing \nsimilar measures and seen great success--this legislation makes certain \nthe Federal Government continues to focus on passengers' rights.\n  Our air traffic control system is outdated and strained beyond its \ncapacity.\n  America's air traffic control network is still using WWII-era \ntechnology. We are behind Mongolia, and that is unacceptable.\n  The Next Generation Air Transportation System, NextGen, will save our \neconomy billions by creating additional capacity and more direct \nroutes. This will allow aircraft to move more efficiently and \neffectively.\n  Drastic reductions in fuel consumption will reduce carbon and noise \nemissions in the aviation sector.\n  And as I noted before, NextGen will dramatically improve safety.\n  A modern air traffic control system will provide pilots and air \ntraffic controllers with better situational awareness--giving them the \ntools to see other aircraft and detailed weather maps in real time.\n  But achieving a modernized air transportation system requires \nsustained focus and substantial resources.\n  This reauthorization bill takes concrete steps to accelerate \nimplementation of a modern, satellite based air traffic control system \nso we can begin to reap these benefits now.\n  We must move boldly or risk losing our leadership in the world. Over \nthe 3 weeks, I have spoken about the primary goals we set out to \nachieve with this bill: 1, to address critical safety concerns; 2, to \nestablish a clear roadmap for the implementation of NextGen and \naccelerate the FAA's key modernization programs; 3, to invest in \nairport infrastructure; and 4, to continue improving small communities' \naccess to the Nation's aviation system.\n  I am proud of how far we have come. I also want to thank Senator \nHutchison, the ranking member of the Commerce Committee and my able \npartner, for her work on this bill. It is truly a bipartisan bill that \nreflects a shared vision and goal of making sure the United States \ncontinues to have the safest, most efficient, and most modern aviation \nsystem possible.\n  This bill passed 93 to 0 last year. I know a few of my colleagues \nhave had substantial differences over the issue of slots at National \nAirport. But this issue is minor compared to the benefits provided by \nthe larger bill.\n  Flights at National Airport should not bring down a bill that is \ncritical to so many Americans and supports so many jobs.\n  I urge my colleagues to move forward and give the FAA the tools, the \nresources, the direction, and the deadlines to make sure the agency can \nprovide effective oversight of the aviation industry.\n  I urge my colleagues to support reauthorization and advance our \nsystem now. We cannot afford to wait any longer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, before we wrap this up entirely, \nthere is just a couple of people I want to thank. I particularly want \nto thank my ranking member, whom I refer to as my cochair, Senator Kay \nBailey Hutchison, for her incredibly hard, smart, indefatigable \ncommitment and pure determination to see this bill through. I could not \nhave asked for a better partner on this bill or as a partner on the \nCommerce Committee. We work in sync. It doesn't mean we have to agree \non everything, but it happens we usually do.\n  I know, and our colleagues should know, this bill simply would not \nhave happened without her hard work, without her negotiating skills \neverywhere, constantly. She was tenacious in getting a lot of deals \ndone on what was the most contentious issue, slots. She was patient and \nshe was fair. I want my colleagues and the whole world to know how much \nI admire her as a person and as a professional, and I am grateful she \nhas applied her considerable expertise and legislative savvy to this \neffort.\n  I also want to take a moment to tell my colleagues that I am very \ndisappointed that Senator Hutchison has chosen not to seek reelection. \nShe has been a model public servant--she is a model public servant--who \nhas made a real difference in the lives of Americans. She has made \nTexas proud. The Senate will be worse off without her. The Commerce \nCommittee will be worse off without her. The aviation world will be \nworse off without her. Most importantly, the people of Texas will miss \nher talent and her clear ability to represent their interests at the \nFederal level. She is amazing.\n  I will reluctantly not begrudge her the opportunity to bring her \nconsiderable talents to her post-Senate life, which she fully deserves. \nBut I have her as my partner in the Commerce Committee for 2 more \nyears, and for that I am very grateful. We have 2 more years to team up \nand see what we can accomplish together and as a committee. We have a \nfull agenda, and this bill is just the first of what I hope will be \nmany joint successes in this Congress.\n  I want to take a few minutes to thank the staff who have worked so \nincredibly hard on this bill. The issues we deal with are very \ndifficult. Sometimes they are very boring. And sometimes they are just \npersistent. You have to scratch them all the time. They are always \narcane. We would not be able to do our jobs without the assistance of a \nvery dedicated and smart staff on both sides of the aisle.\n  I am going to start with Senator Hutchison's staff first. I would \nlike to thank Jarrod Thompson, Senator Hutchison's lead aviation \nstaffer, who worked seamlessly with my staff. Such is not always the \ncase in this body. The importance of his work on this bill cannot be \noverstated. He managed every issue in this bill with a calm \nprofessionalism that made a challenging process a lot easier.\n  I would also like to thank her staff director, Ann Begeman, who is \ntruly a gem--that is called a jewel. Ann has been nominated to be \nCommissioner on the Surface Transportation Board, and she is going to \nbe a great asset to that commission. The committee will consider her \nnomination soon. Not trying to look ahead too far, I hate the thought \nof losing her, but she is going to make a fantastic Commissioner.\n  Finally, I would like to recognize the work of Brian Hendricks, whose \nfierce tenacity was essential to getting this bill done. He was \ninstrumental in quietly working away, constantly getting things done.\n  For my part, I am fortunate to have a tremendous staff, too--in my \nState, in my personal office, and on the committee. I am genuinely \nlucky I have managed to hold on to a very talented group of people who \neach fundamentally appreciate it is a privilege to be in public \nservice. If you don't have that instinct, you are not going to do a lot \naround here.\n  The staff of the aviation subcommittee is truly exceptional because \nGael Sullivan never seeks recognition. I want to spend a minute on \ngiving him the enormous credit and recognition he deserves. Gael \nSullivan has spent 10 years on the subcommittee and almost 20 years as \na staffer on the Commerce Committee. He knows everything there is to \nknow about aviation. He works enormously hard day in and day out, \nwhether we are on the floor or just trying to solve a problem of a \nrural airport or a small community depending on Essential Air Service. \nGael is here because he is absolutely dedicated to making a difference. \nHe has been critical to every aviation bill that we have tried on this \ncommittee. His hard work has helped produce a safer and more efficient \nair traffic control system and a more secure aviation system.\n  Working with Gael is Rich Swayze. Rich is an aviation expert as well. \nFrom his Ph.D. thesis on air service to his work at GAO, Rich has \ndeveloped his aviation expertise and the committee and my Senate \ncolleagues have benefitted from that. They may not know that, but they \nhave. Rich has put countless hours into this bill over the last 3 \nyears. He has worked tirelessly on helping resolve the thorniest of \nissues, such as, for example, slots.\n  Adam Duffy is the third member of my aviation team. Adam keeps the \nsubcommittee running. Besides helping draft briefing materials for the \nbill and preparing points for the floor, he has done yeomen's work \nmanaging the paper--the amendments--and making sure I had what I \nneeded. His is not a glamorous job at times, but sometimes those are \nthe most important jobs of all.\n  Finally, there is James Reid. James Reid, for many years, has been a \nsenior adviser to me on Commerce Committee issues--both in my office in \nthe Hart Building and at the committee--including aviation. He has been \nthe deputy staff director of the Commerce Committee since I became \nchair, and I don't know what I would do without him--literally don't \nknow.\n  I have known James for many years. I know how smart he is. The \ntragedy of how things get done is that staff is never recognized for \nwho they really are--the group who puts all of it together--and how \nfunny he is. Now, it is an art form to get to the funny part, but he is \none of the funniest people I know, and he has a good heart. I still \nmarvel at the sheer skill he has. Whether it is working through the \ndetails of a vexing legislative dilemma or thinking through the best \nstrategic maneuver to achieve success, James can do it all. I totally \nrely on him. I\n\n[[Page S836]]\n\nam so grateful for his willingness to sacrifice more lucrative \nopportunities, as so many of our staff are willing to do, to make the \nCommerce Committee work. I know the entire staff feels the same way I \ndo.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator \nRockefeller, for the wonderful words about myself, about both of our \nstaffs, and suffice it to say, I think the leadership that comes from \nthe top--Senator Rockefeller, as chairman of the Commerce Committee--\nhas put together a staff and a mandate for all of us such that we are \ngoing to be a productive committee, we are going to work together, and \nwe are going to shoot straight. And that is exactly what our staffs do, \nand it is what we do.\n  The reason we get along so well and have done so much is that we may \nnot agree on every issue, but we try to help each other in a way that \nachieves the overall goal we both want. Then we have the room to differ \non specific ways to get there. So it is a pleasure to be the ranking \nmember of the Commerce Committee, and I do feel that I am a full \npartner. Even though I am not the chairman of the committee, I do feel \nlike the vice chairman. So I thank the chairman.\n  I think we have accomplished so much tonight. We haven't passed, on \nfinal passage, this bill, but the authorization bill that preceded this \none was passed in 2007, and we have had 18 short-term extensions. The \nFAA runs our aviation system in this country. It is responsible for the \nsafety, it is responsible for consumer protection, and it is \nresponsible for managing the air traffic in this country and managing \nthe fund that helps airports with infrastructure. So short-term \nextensions don't work in infrastructure and in the areas where there \nhas to be long-term planning. We have been trying to start the process \nof the long-term planning for the next generation of air traffic \ncontrol systems since 2007. Tonight, we have passed a major hurdle.\n  The House is going along on the same track to pass an FAA \nreauthorization, and I believe we will pass the final bill, I hope, \nbefore the short-term extension runs out at the end of March. That will \nbe our goal. I think because we have come together on this bill, we \nhave a good chance of doing that.\n  I think having the first major bill on the floor in this session of \nCongress was a big test, and I want to commend our leaders, Harry Reid \nand Mitch McConnell, for the way it was handled. Harry Reid let the \nprocess work. We had plenty of time for amendments. Senator McConnell \nwas very helpful in ensuring that amendments were not an overload. \nThere was no attempt to filibuster this bill. I think this is the way \nwe ought to proceed for the next 2 years, and I think we have made a \ngreat start with this bill. People have had their say, they have had \ntheir debate time, and that, I hope, is the way the Senate will resume.\n  I do want to say there were tough issues. The perimeter rule around \nWashington Reagan National Airport was the biggest sticking point, and \nit took a lot of give on all sides to assure that the relaxation of the \nperimeter rule, through exemptions, was done in a way that, I believe, \nwill not hurt any of the stakeholders. I believe there is a balance. I \nbelieve we will have more western Senators and their constituents who \nwill be able to have direct access to National Airport. I think we have \ndone right by the airlines that are incumbent carriers at Washington \nNational, and we have made room for new entrants into Washington \nNational, but it was very difficult.\n  I just want to single out a few people who made huge contributions to \nthis success: Senator Kyl from Arizona and Senator Ensign from Nevada. \nThey represented the western interests so well. They know aviation and \nthey knew what we could do and we have made great progress.\n  I will also commend Senator Wyden, from Oregon, and Senator Cantwell, \nwho is going to be the new chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee in the \nCommerce Committee. They both represented the Northwest and Alaska very \nwell. Senator Begich and Senator Murkowski also did so much to help us \nthread the needle that would be a balanced bill.\n  Then there was Senator Warner, who also had a different interest and \nthat was to protect his constituents from congestion around Washington \nNational. I think we were able to accommodate the needs of the people \nwho live around National Airport as well, through the leadership of \nSenator Warner. It took a lot of negotiation to get there. That is why \nthis bill took several weeks to do.\n  I am very proud and pleased that we have done this. I too want to \nrecognize the staffs, without whom none of us could do the research and \nthe detail work that is necessary. I will start with Senator \nRockefeller's Democratic Commerce staff. Ellen Doneski runs the Senate \nmajority on the Commerce Committee. She is a joy. She and Ann Begeman, \nwho runs the Republican side, are truly colleagues who can shoot \nstraight. There are never surprises. We trust each other. We don't \nalways agree. The answer is not always ``yes.'' But the answer is \nstraight. That is what you need when you are working together to \nachieve results.\n  James Reid, on this bill--I didn't know he was funny because, \nfrankly, there hasn't been much fun for the last 2 weeks. But I am glad \nto know that we have a personality trait that I am going to get to \nlearn. But I did know he is smart. I did know he was very helpful in \nthe capability to work things out with the many amendments and needs of \nall of our colleagues when it is a big bill.\n  Gael Sullivan, Rich Swayze, Bruce Andrews, and Adam Duffy all helped \nin this effort.\n  I thank the floor staffs from both sides. They are the ones who are \nsitting in front of us right now. They have been sitting in front of us \nabout 9 o'clock every night that we have been on this bill. I thank Tim \nMitchell, Gary Myrick, Tricia Engle on the majority staff. On our side, \nI know we couldn't do without Dave Schiappa, Laura Dove, Jody \nHernandez, and all the cloakroom staff. Honestly, I have to say the \nfloor staff makes the trains run on time. They also work things out \nsometimes so we do not even have to do it. I appreciate so much all \nthat you all do. You are the wind beneath our wings.\n  I thank, also, on our side Senator McConnell's staff, Scott Raab, who \nis the aviation Commerce Committee staff person. We appreciate his \nefforts to help us keep things on track for the leader.\n  Then my own Senate Commerce Committee staff. This is why I want to \nsay that we have a great Commerce Committee staff, some of whom will be \nleaving. This may be their final achievement. I am very pleased they \nare going to leave on such a high.\n  Ann Begeman is the chief of our Commerce Committee staff. As the \nchairman pointed out, she has been given a great position, a promotion. \nShe has been appointed to be a Commissioner on the Surface \nTransportation Board. She is going to do a great job. In fact, I think \nshe is accusing us of holding up her hearing because we like her so \nmuch. But she is going to, in fact, have a hearing in the next couple \nof weeks. I know she will be confirmed because everyone who works with \nher knows what a great manager and a great leader she has been on our \nstaff.\n  I want to thank Brian Hendricks. Brian was described by the chairman \nas quietly effective--and we all started laughing on the back bench \nbecause Brian is a tiger. We need his brilliance and his tenacity in \nall of the major things we do on the Commerce Committee. In fact, Brian \nis going to be the new incoming Chief of Staff of the Republican \nCommerce Committee when Ann Begeman takes her new position at the \nSurface Transportation Board. He has earned this by leading us through \nsome of the toughest times, not only this bill, where he was a help, \nbut also taking the lead on the NASA bill that we also passed through \nour committee. The NASA authorization bill, that was passed through the \nCommerce Committee through the leadership of Brian Hendricks of all of \nus on the Commerce Committee, is saving America's position in space \nexploration. We could not have done it without Brian Hendricks. I will \nnever forget the contribution he has made to America. He is going to be \nwith us for a long time to come as well.\n  Jarrod Thompson was the lead on this bill. As the chairman said, we\n\n[[Page S837]]\n\ncould not have done it without Jarrod. He knows aviation backward and \nforward. There is not a question that was ever asked about what the \nrules were, what the law was, who was at every airport--he knew. He has \nbeen the aviation committee clerk through the relaxation of the Wright \namendment restrictions around Love Field and DFW Airport. When we \nstarted on this bill and we got to the perimeter rule at Washington \nNational, it was as though Jarrod Thompson had been through this \nbefore. He knew what restrictions were and how you could ease them in a \nbalanced way. It was in fact Jarrod who came up with the way forward \nwhen we were at a complete impasse at 9 o'clock last night. He is \nessential to our team as well.\n  Nick Rossi, a very important part of our staff, is also getting a \npromotion. Susan Collins has stolen him from our staff to make him \nStaff Director at Homeland Security. We never argue when people are \npromoted. We will miss him very much because he has been an invaluable \nmember of the Commerce Committee staff. He will do a great job running \nthe Homeland Security Committee, the Republican side of that committee \nstaff.\n  Patrick Mullane is going to be moving over to the Budget Committee. \nHe was a great help. He knows transportation backward and forward.\n  Todd Bertoson is a great member of our team who is staying with us \nand will continue to contribute so much with his expertise in marine \nand ocean, which is another part of our Commerce Committee \njurisdiction.\n  I am very pleased we have been able to achieve a great bill that I \nknow is taking us the next step toward the reauthorization bill that is \ngoing to put the FAA, our air traffic control system, our consumer \nprotections, and our safety in the place where they ought to be.\n  I thank the chairman for his leadership and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/17/senate-section/article/S837-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Testimony may be filed electronically. The \n     presiding officer at any hearing is authorized to limit the \n     time of each witness appearing before the committee or a \n     subcommittee.

All information \n     obtained pursuant to such investigative activity shall be \n     made available as promptly as possible to each member of \n     the committee requesting same, or to any assistant to a \n     member of the committee designated by such member in \n     writing, but the use of any such information is subject to \n     restrictions imposed by the rules of the Senate.

In the spirit of \n     section 133A(a) and in order to assure that members of the \n     committee are themselves fully informed and involved in the \n     development of hearings:\n       1. Public notice of the date, place, and subject matter of \n     each committee or subcommittee hearing should be inserted in \n     the Congressional Record seven days prior to the commencement \n     of such hearing.\n       2. At least seven days prior to public notice of each \n     committee or subcommittee hearing, the majority should \n     provide notice to the minority of the time, place and \n     specific subject matter of such hearing.\n       3. At least three days prior to the date of such hearing, \n     the committee or subcommittee should provide to each member a \n     list of witnesses who have been or are proposed to be invited \n     to appear.\n       4. The committee and its subcommittee should, to the \n     maximum feasible extent, enforce the provisions of rule 9 of \n     the committee rules as it relates to the submission of \n     written statements of witnesses twenty-four hours in advance \n     of a hearing. Witnesses will be urged to submit testimony \n     even earlier whenever possible. When statements are received \n     in advance of a hearing, the committee or subcommittee (as \n     appropriate) should distribute copies of such statements to \n     each of its members. Witness testimony may be submitted and \n     distributed electronically.\n\n\n         EXECUTIVE SESSIONS FOR THE PURPOSE OF MARKING UP BILLS\n\n       In order to expedite the process of marking up bills and to \n     assist each member of the committee so that there may be full \n     and fair consideration of each bill which the committee or a \n     subcommittee is marking up the following procedures should be \n     followed:\n       1. Seven days prior to the proposed date for an executive \n     session for the purpose of marking up bills the committee or \n     subcommittee (as appropriate) should provide written notice \n     to each of its members as to the time, place, and specific \n     subject matter of such session, including an agenda listing \n     each bill or other matters to be considered and including:\n       (a) a copy of each bill, joint resolution, or other \n     legislative matter (or committee print thereof) to be \n     considered at such executive session; and\n       (b) a copy of a summary of the provisions of each bill, \n     joint resolution, or other legislative matter to be \n     considered at such executive session including, whenever \n     possible, an\n\n[[Page S842]]\n\n     explanation of changes to existing law proposed to be made.\n       2. Insofar as practical, prior to the scheduled date for an \n     executive session for the purpose of marking up bills, the \n     committee or a subcommittee (as appropriate) should provide \n     each member with a copy of the printed record or a summary of \n     any hearings conducted by the committee or a subcommittee \n     with respect to each bill, joint resolution, or other \n     legislative matter to be considered at such executive \n     session.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/17/senate-section/article/S842-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S842-S843]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           COMMITTEE ON VETERANS' AFFAIRS RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

The Committee vote on the confirmation shall not be \n     sooner than 48 hours after the Committee has received \n     transcripts of the confirmation hearing unless the time limit \n     is waived by unanimous consent of the Committee.\n       5.6. No nomination shall be reported to the Senate unless \n     the nominee has filed a background and financial disclosure \n     statement with the Committee.\n\n                         Rule 6. Investigations\n\n       No investigation shall be initiated by the Committee unless \n     at least five members of the Committee have specifically \n     requested the Chairman or the Vice Chairman to authorize such \n     an investigation. Authorized investigations may be conducted \n     by members of the Committee and/or designated Committee staff \n     members.\n\n                           Rule 7. Subpoenas\n\n       Subpoenas authorized by the Committee for the attendance of \n     witnesses or the production of memoranda, documents, records, \n     or any other material may be issued by the Chairman, the Vice \n     Chairman, or any member of the Committee designated by the \n     Chairman, and may be served by any person designated by the \n     Chairman, Vice Chairman or member issuing the subpoenas. Each \n     subpoena shall have attached thereto a copy of S. Res. 400 of \n     the 94th Congress, and a copy of these rules.\n\n         Rule 8. Procedures Related to the Taking of Testimony\n\n       8.1. Notice.--Witnesses required to appear before the \n     Committee shall be given reasonable notice and all witnesses \n     shall be furnished a copy of these Rules.\n       8.2. Oath or Affirmation.--At the direction of the Chairman \n     or Vice Chairman, testimony of witnesses shall be given under \n     oath or affirmation which may be administered by any member \n     of the Committee.\n       8.3. Interrogation.--Committee interrogation shall be \n     conducted by members of the Committee and such Committee \n     staff as are authorized by the Chairman, Vice Chairman, or \n     the presiding member.\n       8.4. Counsel for the Witness.--(a) Any witness may be \n     accompanied by counsel. A witness who is unable to obtain \n     counsel may inform the Committee of such fact. If the witness \n     informs the Committee of this fact at least 24 hours prior to \n     his or her appearance before the Committee, the Committee \n     shall then endeavor to obtain voluntary counsel for the \n     witness. Failure to obtain such counsel will not excuse the \n     witness from appearing and testifying.\n       (b) Counsel shall conduct themselves in an ethical and \n     professional manner. Failure to do so shall, upon a finding \n     to that effect by a majority of the members present, subject \n     such counsel to disciplinary action which may include \n     warning, censure, removal, or a recommendation of contempt \n     proceedings.\n       (c) There shall be no direct or cross-examination by \n     counsel. However, counsel may submit any question in writing \n     to the Committee and request the Committee to propound such \n     question to the counsel's client or to any other witness. The \n     counsel also may suggest the presentation of other evidence \n     or the calling of other witnesses. The Committee may use or \n     dispose of such questions or suggestions as it deems \n     appropriate.\n       8.5. Statements by Witnesses.--Witnesses may make brief and \n     relevant statements at\n\n[[Page S844]]\n\n     the beginning and conclusion of their testimony. Such \n     statements shall not exceed a reasonable period of time as \n     determined by the Chairman, or other presiding members. \n     Any witness required or desiring to make a prepared or \n     written statement for the record of the proceedings shall \n     file a paper and electronic copy with the Clerk of the \n     Committee, and insofar as practicable and consistent with \n     the notice given, shall do so at least 48 hours in advance \n     of his or her appearance before the Committee.\n       8.6. Objections and Rulings.--Any objection raised by a \n     witness or counsel shall be ruled upon by the Chairman or \n     other presiding member, and such ruling shall be the ruling \n     of the Committee unless a majority of the Committee present \n     overrules the ruling of the chair.\n       8.7. Inspection and Correction.--All witnesses testifying \n     before the Committee shall be given a reasonable opportunity \n     to inspect, in the office of the Committee, the transcript of \n     their testimony to determine whether such testimony was \n     correctly transcribed. The witness may be accompanied by \n     counsel. Any corrections the witness desires to make in the \n     transcript shall be submitted in writing to the Committee \n     within five days from the date when the transcript was made \n     available to the witness. Corrections shall be limited to \n     grammar and minor editing, and may not be made to change the \n     substance of the testimony. Any questions arising with \n     respect to such corrections shall be decided by the Chairman. \n     Upon request, the Committee may provide to a witness those \n     parts of testimony given by that witness in executive session \n     which are subsequently quoted or made part of a public \n     record, at the expense of the witness.\n       8.8. Requests To Testify.--The Committee will consider \n     requests to testify on any matter or measure pending before \n     the Committee. A person who believes that testimony or other \n     evidence presented at a public hearing, or any comment made \n     by a Committee member or a member of the Committee staff, may \n     tend to affect adversely that person's reputation, may \n     request to appear personally before the Committee to testify \n     or may file a sworn statement of facts relevant to the \n     testimony, evidence, or comment, or may submit to the \n     Chairman proposed questions in writing for the cross-\n     examination of other witnesses. The Committee shall take such \n     action as it deems appropriate.\n       8.9. Contempt Procedures.--No recommendation that a person \n     be cited for contempt of Congress or that a subpoena be \n     otherwise enforced shall be forwarded to the Senate unless \n     and until the Committee has, upon notice to all its members, \n     met and considered the recommendation, afforded the person an \n     opportunity to oppose such contempt or subpoena enforcement \n     proceeding either in writing or in person, and agreed by \n     majority vote of the Committee to forward such recommendation \n     to the Senate.\n       8.10. Release of Name of Witness.--Unless authorized by the \n     Chairman, the name of any witness scheduled to be heard by \n     the Committee shall not be released prior to, or after, \n     appearing before the Committee. Upon authorization by the \n     Chairman to release the name of a witness under this \n     paragraph, the Vice Chairman shall be notified of such \n     authorization as soon as practicable thereafter. No name of \n     any witness shall be released if such release would disclose \n     classified information, unless authorized under Section 8 of \n     S. Res. 400 of the 94th Congress or Rule 9.7.\n\n   Rule 9. Procedures for Handling Classified or Committee Sensitive \n                                Material\n\n       9.1. Committee staff offices shall operate under strict \n     precautions. At least one United States Capitol Police \n     Officer shall be on duty at all times at the entrance of the \n     Committee to control entry. Before entering the Committee \n     office space all persons shall identify themselves and \n     provide identification as requested.\n       9.2. Classified documents and material shall be stored in \n     authorized security containers located within the Committee's \n     Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF). Copying, \n     duplicating, or removing from the Committee offices of such \n     documents and other materials is prohibited except as is \n     necessary for the conduct of Committee business, and in \n     conformity with Rule 10.3 hereof. All classified documents or \n     materials removed from the Committee offices for such \n     authorized purposes must be returned to the Committee's SCIF \n     for overnight storage.\n       9.3. ``Committee sensitive'' means information or material \n     that pertains to the confidential business or proceedings of \n     the Select Committee on Intelligence, within the meaning of \n     paragraph 5 of Rule XXIX of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     and is: (1) in the possession or under the control of the \n     Committee; (2) discussed or presented in an executive session \n     of the Committee; (3) the work product of a Committee member \n     or staff member; (4) properly identified or marked by a \n     Committee member or staff member who authored the document; \n     or (5) designated as such by the Chairman and Vice Chairman \n     (or by the Staff Director and Minority Staff Director acting \n     on their behalf). Committee sensitive documents and materials \n     that are classified shall be handled in the same manner as \n     classified documents and material in Rule 9.2. Unclassified \n     committee sensitive documents and materials shall be stored \n     in a manner to protect against unauthorized disclosure.\n       9.4. Each member of the Committee shall at all times have \n     access to all papers and other material received from any \n     source. The Staff Director shall be responsible for the \n     maintenance, under appropriate security procedures, of a \n     document control and accountability registry which will \n     number and identify all classified papers and other \n     classified materials in the possession of the Committee, and \n     such registry shall be available to any member of the \n     Committee.\n       9.5. Whenever the Select Committee on Intelligence makes \n     classified material available to any other committee of the \n     Senate or to any member of the Senate not a member of the \n     Committee, such material shall be accompanied by a verbal or \n     written notice to the recipients advising of their \n     responsibility to protect such materials pursuant to section \n     8 of S. Res. 400 of the 94th Congress. The Security Director \n     of the Committee shall ensure that such notice is provided \n     and shall maintain a written record identifying the \n     particular information transmitted and the committee or \n     members of the Senate receiving such information.\n       9.6. Access to classified information supplied to the \n     Committee shall be limited to those Committee staff members \n     with appropriate security clearance and a need-to-know, as \n     determined by the Committee, and, under the Committee's \n     direction, the Staff Director and Minority Staff Director.\n       9.7. No member of the Committee or of the Committee staff \n     shall disclose, in whole or in part or by way of summary, the \n     contents of any classified or committee sensitive papers, \n     materials, briefings, testimony, or other information in the \n     possession of the Committee to any other person, except as \n     specified in this rule. Committee members and staff do not \n     need prior approval to disclose classified or committee \n     sensitive information to persons in the Executive branch, the \n     members and staff of the House Permanent Select Committee on \n     Intelligence, and the members and staff of the Senate, \n     provided that the following conditions are met: (1) for \n     classified information, the recipients of the information \n     must possess appropriate security clearances (or have access \n     to the information by virtue of their office); (2) for all \n     information, the recipients of the information must have a \n     need-to-know such information for an official governmental \n     purpose; and (3) for all information, the Committee members \n     and staff who provide the information must be engaged in the \n     routine performance of Committee legislative or oversight \n     duties. Otherwise, classified and committee sensitive \n     information may only be disclosed to persons outside the \n     Committee (to include any congressional committee, Member of \n     Congress, congressional staff, or specified non-governmental \n     persons who support intelligence activities) with the prior \n     approval of the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Committee, \n     or the Staff Director and Minority Staff Director acting on \n     their behalf, consistent with the requirements that \n     classified information may only be disclosed to persons with \n     appropriate security clearances and a need-to-know such \n     information for an official governmental purpose. Public \n     disclosure of classified information in the possession of the \n     Committee may only be authorized in accordance with Section 8 \n     of S. Res. 400 of the 94th Congress.\n       9.8. Failure to abide by Rule 9.7 shall constitute grounds \n     for referral to the Select Committee on Ethics pursuant to \n     Section 8 of S. Res. 400 of the 94th Congress. Prior to a \n     referral to the Select Committee on Ethics pursuant to \n     Section 8 of S. Res. 400, the Chairman and Vice Chairman \n     shall notify the Majority Leader and Minority Leader.\n       9.9. Before the Committee makes any decision regarding the \n     disposition of any testimony, papers, or other materials \n     presented to it, the Committee members shall have a \n     reasonable opportunity to examine all pertinent testimony, \n     papers, and other materials that have been obtained by the \n     members of the Committee or the Committee staff.\n       9.10. Attendance of persons outside the Committee at closed \n     meetings of the Committee shall be kept at a minimum and \n     shall be limited to persons with appropriate security \n     clearance and a need-to-know the information under \n     consideration for the execution of their official duties. The \n     Security Director of the Committee may require that notes \n     taken at such meetings by any person in attendance shall be \n     returned to the secure storage area in the Committee's \n     offices at the conclusion of such meetings, and may be made \n     available to the department, agency, office, committee, or \n     entity concerned only in accordance with the security \n     procedures of the Committee.\n\n                             Rule 10. Staff\n\n       10.1. For purposes of these rules, Committee staff includes \n     employees of the Committee, consultants to the Committee, or \n     any other person engaged by contract or otherwise to perform \n     services for or at the request of the Committee. To the \n     maximum extent practicable, the Committee shall rely on its \n     full-time employees to perform all staff functions. No \n     individual may be retained as staff of the Committee or to \n     perform services for the Committee unless that individual \n     holds appropriate security clearances.\n       10.2. The appointment of Committee staff shall be approved \n     by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, or, at the \n     initiative of both or either be confirmed by a majority vote \n     of the Committee. After approval or confirmation, the \n     Chairman shall certify Committee staff appointments to the \n     Financial Clerk of the Senate in writing. No Committee staff \n     shall be given access to any\n\n[[Page S845]]\n\n     classified information or regular access to the Committee \n     offices until such Committee staff has received an \n     appropriate security clearance as described in Section 6 \n     of S. Res. 400 of the 94th Congress.\n       10.3. The Committee staff works for the Committee as a \n     whole, under the supervision of the Chairman and Vice \n     Chairman of the Committee. The duties of the Committee staff \n     shall be performed, and Committee staff personnel affairs and \n     day-to-day operations, including security and control of \n     classified documents and material, shall be administered \n     under the direct supervision and control of the Staff \n     Director. All Committee staff shall work exclusively on \n     intelligence oversight issues for the Committee. The Minority \n     Staff Director and the Minority Counsel shall be kept fully \n     informed regarding all matters and shall have access to all \n     material in the files of the Committee.\n       10.4. The Committee staff shall assist the minority as \n     fully as the majority in the expression of minority views, \n     including assistance in the preparation and filing of \n     additional, separate, and minority views, to the end that all \n     points of view may be fully considered by the Committee and \n     the Senate.\n       10.5. The members of the Committee staff shall not discuss \n     either the substance or procedure of the work of the \n     Committee with any person not a member of the Committee or \n     the Committee staff for any purpose or in connection with any \n     proceeding, judicial or otherwise, either during their tenure \n     as a member of the Committee staff or at any time thereafter, \n     except as directed by the Committee in accordance with \n     Section 8 of S. Res. 400 of the 94th Congress and the \n     provisions of these rules, or in the event of the termination \n     of the Committee, in such a manner as may be determined by \n     the Senate. The Chairman may authorize the Staff Director and \n     the Staff Director's designee, and the Vice Chairman may \n     authorize the Minority Staff Director and the Minority Staff \n     Director's designee, to communicate with the media in a \n     manner that does not divulge classified or committee \n     sensitive information.\n       10.6. No member of the Committee staff shall be employed by \n     the Committee unless and until such a member of the Committee \n     staff agrees in writing, as a condition of employment, to \n     abide by the conditions of the nondisclosure agreement \n     promulgated by the Select Committee on Intelligence, pursuant \n     to Section 6 of S. Res. 400 of the 94th Congress, and to \n     abide by the Committee's code of conduct.\n       10.7. As a precondition for employment on the Committee \n     staff, each member of the Committee staff must agree in \n     writing to notify the Committee of any request for testimony, \n     either during service as a member of the Committee staff or \n     at any time thereafter with respect to information obtained \n     by virtue of employment as a member of the Committee staff. \n     Such information shall not be disclosed in response to such \n     requests except as directed by the Committee in accordance \n     with Section 8 of S. Res. 400 of the 94th Congress and the \n     provisions of these rules or, in the event of the termination \n     of the Committee, in such manner as may be determined by the \n     Senate.\n       10.8. The Committee shall immediately consider action to be \n     taken in the case of any member of the Committee staff who \n     fails to conform to any of these Rules. Such disciplinary \n     action may include, but shall not be limited to, immediate \n     dismissal from the Committee staff.\n       10.9. Within the Committee staff shall be an element with \n     the capability to perform audits of programs and activities \n     undertaken by departments and agencies with intelligence \n     functions. The audit element shall conduct audits and \n     oversight projects that have been specifically authorized by \n     the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Committee, acting \n     jointly through the Staff Director and Minority Staff \n     Director. Staff shall be assigned to such element jointly by \n     the Chairman and Vice Chairman, and staff with the principal \n     responsibility for the conduct of an audit shall be qualified \n     by training or experience in accordance with accepted \n     auditing standards.\n       10.10. The workplace of the Committee shall be free from \n     illegal use, possession, sale, or distribution of controlled \n     substances by its employees. Any violation of such policy by \n     any member of the Committee staff shall be grounds for \n     termination of employment. Further, any illegal use of \n     controlled substances by a member of the Committee staff, \n     within the workplace or otherwise, shall result in \n     reconsideration of the security clearance of any such staff \n     member and may constitute grounds for termination of \n     employment with the Committee.\n       10.11. All personnel actions affecting the staff of the \n     Committee shall be made free from any discrimination based on \n     race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, handicap, \n     or disability.\n\n              Rule 11. Preparation for Committee Meetings\n\n       11.1. Under direction of the Chairman and the Vice Chairman \n     designated Committee staff members shall brief members of the \n     Committee at a time sufficiently prior to any Committee \n     meeting to assist the Committee members in preparation for \n     such meeting and to determine any matter which the Committee \n     member might wish considered during the meeting. Such \n     briefing shall, at the request of a member, include a list of \n     all pertinent papers and other materials that have been \n     obtained by the Committee that bear on matters to be \n     considered at the meeting.\n       11.2. The Staff Director and/or Minority Staff Director \n     shall recommend to the Chairman and the Vice Chairman the \n     testimony, papers, and other materials to be presented to the \n     Committee at any meeting. The determination whether such \n     testimony, papers, and other materials shall be presented in \n     open or executive session shall be made pursuant to the Rules \n     of the Senate and Rules of the Committee.\n       11.3. The Staff Director shall ensure that covert action \n     programs of the U.S. Government receive appropriate \n     consideration by the Committee no less frequently than once a \n     quarter.\n\n                     Rule 12. Legislative Calendar\n\n       12.1. The Clerk of the Committee shall maintain a printed \n     calendar for the information of each Committee member showing \n     the measures introduced and referred to the Committee and the \n     status of such measures; nominations referred to the \n     Committee and their status; and such other matters as the \n     Committee determines shall be included. The Calendar shall be \n     revised from time to time to show pertinent changes. A copy \n     of each such revision shall be furnished to each member of \n     the Committee.\n       12.2.

Changes in Rules\n\n       These Rules may be modified, amended, or repealed by the \n     Committee, provided that a notice in writing of the proposed \n     change has been given to each member at least 48 hours prior \n     to the meeting at which action thereon is to be taken.\n\n                               Appendix A\n\n              S.

An unclassified version of \n     each report may be made available to the public at the \n     discretion of the select committee. Nothing herein shall be \n     construed as requiring the public disclosure in such reports \n     of the names of individuals engaged in intelligence \n     activities for the United States or the divulging of \n     intelligence methods employed or the sources of information \n     on which such reports are based or the amount of funds \n     authorized to be appropriated for intelligence activities.\n       (c) On or before March 15 of each year, the select \n     committee shall submit to the Committee on the Budget of the \n     Senate the views and estimates described in section 301(c) of \n     the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 regarding matters \n     within the jurisdiction of the select committee.\n       Sec. 5.(a) For the purposes of this resolution, the select \n     committee is authorized in its discretion (1) to make \n     investigations into any matter within its jurisdiction, (2) \n     to make expenditures from the contingent fund of the Senate, \n     (3) to employ personnel, (4) to hold hearings, (5) to sit and \n     act at any time or place during the sessions, recesses, and \n     adjourned periods of the Senate, (6) to require, by subpoena \n     or otherwise, the attendance of witnesses and the production \n     of correspondence, books, papers, and documents, (7) to take \n     depositions and other testimony, (8) to procure the service \n     of individual consultants or organizations thereof, in \n     accordance with the provisions of section 202(i) of the \n     Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946, and (9) with the \n     prior consent of the government department or agency \n     concerned and the Committee on Rules and Administration, to \n     use on a reimbursable basis the services of personnel of any \n     such department or agency.\n       (b) The chairman of the select committee or any member \n     thereof may administer oaths to witnesses.\n       (c) Subpoenas authorized by the select committee may be \n     issued over the signature of the chairman, the vice chairman \n     or any member of the select committee designated by the \n     chairman, and may be served by any person designated by the \n     chairman or any member signing the subpoenas.\n       Sec. 6. No employee of the select committee or any person \n     engaged by contract or otherwise to perform services for or \n     at the request of such committee shall be given access to any \n     classified information by such committee unless such employee \n     or person has (1) agreed in writing and under oath to be \n     bound by the rules of the Senate (including the jurisdiction \n     of the Select Committee on Ethics) and of such committee as \n     to the security of such information during and after the \n     period of his employment or contractual agreement with such \n     committee; and (2) received an appropriate security clearance \n     as determined by such committee in consultation with the \n     Director of National Intelligence. The type of security \n     clearance to be required in the case of any such employee or \n     person shall, within the determination of such committee in \n     consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, be \n     commensurate with the sensitivity of the classified \n     information to which such employee or person will be given \n     access by such committee.\n       Sec. 7. The select committee shall formulate and carry out \n     such rules and procedures as it deems necessary to prevent \n     the disclosure, without the consent of the person or persons \n     concerned, of information in the possession of such committee \n     which unduly infringes upon the privacy or which violates the \n     constitutional rights of such person or persons. Nothing \n     herein shall be construed to prevent such committee from \n     publicly disclosing any such information in any case in which \n     such committee determines the national interest in the \n     disclosure of such information clearly outweighs any \n     infringement on the privacy of any person or persons.\n       Sec. 8.(a) The select committee may, subject to the \n     provisions of this section, disclose publicly any information \n     in the possession of such committee after a determination by \n     such committee that the public interest would be served by \n     such disclosure. Whenever committee action is required to \n     disclose any information under this section, the committee \n     shall meet to vote on the matter within five days after any \n     member of the committee requests such a vote. No member\n\n[[Page S847]]\n\n     of the select committee shall disclose any information, the \n     disclosure of which requires a committee vote, prior to a \n     vote by the committee on the question of the disclosure of \n     such information or after such vote except in accordance with \n     this section.\n       (b)(1) In any case in which the select committee votes to \n     disclose publicly any information which has been classified \n     under established security procedures, which has been \n     submitted to it by the Executive branch, and which the \n     Executive branch requests be kept secret, such committee \n     shall--\n       (A) first, notify the Majority Leader and Minority Leader \n     of the Senate of such vote; and\n       (B) second, consult with the Majority Leader and Minority \n     Leader before notifying the President of such vote.\n       (2) The select committee may disclose publicly such \n     information after the expiration of a five-day period \n     following the day on which notice of such vote is transmitted \n     to the Majority Leader and the Minority Leader and the \n     President, unless, prior to the expiration of such five-day \n     period, the President, personally in writing, notifies the \n     committee that he objects to the disclosure of such \n     information, provides his reasons therefore, and certifies \n     that the threat to the national interest of the United States \n     posed by such disclosure is of such gravity that it outweighs \n     any public interest in the disclosure.\n       (3) If the President, personally, in writing, notifies the \n     Majority Leader and Minority Leader of the Senate and the \n     select Committee of his objections to the disclosure of such \n     information as provided in paragraph (2), the Majority Leader \n     and Minority Leader jointly or the select Committee, by \n     majority vote, may refer the question of the disclosure of \n     such information to the Senate for consideration.\n       (4) Whenever the select committee votes to refer the \n     question of disclosure of any information to the Senate under \n     paragraph (3), the Chairman shall not later than the first \n     day on which the Senate is in session following the day on \n     which the vote occurs, report the matter to the Senate for \n     its consideration.\n       (5) One hour after the Senate convenes on the fourth day on \n     which the Senate is in session following the day on which any \n     such matter is reported to the Senate, or at such earlier \n     time as the majority leader and the minority leader of the \n     Senate jointly agree upon in accordance with paragraph 5 of \n     rule XVII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, the Senate \n     shall go into closed session and the matter shall be the \n     pending business. In considering the matter in closed session \n     the Senate may--\n       (A) approve the public disclosure of all or any portion of \n     the information in question, in which case the committee \n     shall publicly disclose the information ordered to be \n     disclosed,\n       (B) disapprove the public disclosure of all or any portion \n     of the information in question, in which case the committee \n     shall not publicly disclose the information ordered not to be \n     disclosed, or\n       (C) refer all or any portion of the matter back to the \n     committee, in which case the committee shall make the final \n     determination with respect to the public disclosure of the \n     information in question.\n\n     Upon conclusion of the consideration of such matter in closed \n     session, which may not extend beyond the close of the ninth \n     day on which the Senate is in session following the day on \n     which such matter was reported to the Senate, or the close of \n     the fifth day following the day agreed upon jointly by the \n     majority and minority leaders in accordance with paragraph 5 \n     of rule XVII of the Standing Rules of the Senate (whichever \n     the case may be), the Senate shall immediately vote on the \n     disposition of such matter in open session, without debate, \n     and without divulging the information with respect to which \n     the vote is being taken. The Senate shall vote to dispose of \n     such matter by one or more of the means specified in clauses \n     (A), (B), and (C) of the second sentence of this paragraph. \n     Any vote of the Senate to disclose any information pursuant \n     to this paragraph shall be subject to the right of a Member \n     of the Senate to move for reconsideration of the vote within \n     the time and pursuant to the procedures specified in rule \n     XIII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, and the disclosure \n     of such information shall be made consistent with that right.\n       (c)(1) No information in the possession of the select \n     committee relating to the lawful intelligence activities of \n     any department or agency of the United States which has been \n     classified under established security procedures and which \n     the select committee, pursuant to subsection (a) or (b) of \n     this section, has determined should not be disclosed shall be \n     made available to any person by a Member, officer, or \n     employee of the Senate except in a closed session of the \n     Senate or as provided in paragraph (2).\n       (2) The select committee may, under such regulations as the \n     committee shall prescribe to protect the confidentiality of \n     such information, make any information described in paragraph \n     (1) available to any other committee or any other Member of \n     the Senate. Whenever the select committee makes such \n     information available, the committee shall keep a written \n     record showing, in the case of any particular information, \n     which committee or which Members of the Senate received such \n     information. No Member of the Senate who, and no committee \n     which, receives any information under this subsection, shall \n     disclose such information except in a closed session of the \n     Senate.\n       (d) It shall be the duty of the Select Committee on Ethics \n     to investigate any unauthorized disclosure of intelligence \n     information by a Member, officer or employee of the Senate in \n     violation of subsection (c) and to report to the Senate \n     concerning any allegation which it finds to be substantiated.\n       (e) Upon the request of any person who is subject to any \n     such investigation, the Select Committee on Ethics shall \n     release to such individual at the conclusion of its \n     investigation a summary of its investigation together with \n     its findings. If, at the conclusion of its investigation, the \n     Select Committee on Ethics determines that there has been a \n     significant breach of confidentiality or unauthorized \n     disclosure by a Member, officer, or employee of the Senate, \n     it shall report its findings to the Senate and recommend \n     appropriate action such as censure, removal from committee \n     membership, or expulsion from the Senate, in the case of a \n     Member, or removal from office or employment or punishment \n     for contempt, in the case of an officer or employee.\n       Sec. 9. The select committee is authorized to permit any \n     personal representative of the President, designated by the \n     President to serve as a liaison to such committee, to attend \n     any closed meeting of such committee.\n       Sec. 10.

This rule may be waived with the \n     concurrence of the Chairman and the ranking minority member \n     of the full Committee.\n\n                   RULE V--SUBPOENAS; COUNSEL; RECORD\n\n       1. Subpoenas.--The Chairman, with the approval of the \n     ranking minority member of the Committee, may subpoena the \n     attendance of witnesses for hearings and the production of \n     memoranda, documents, records, or any other materials. The \n     Chairman may subpoena such attendance of witnesses or \n     production of materials without the approval of the ranking \n     minority member if the Chairman or a member of the Committee \n     staff designated by the Chairman has not received \n     notification from the ranking minority member or a member of \n     the Committee staff designated by the ranking minority member \n     of disapproval of the subpoena within 72 hours, excluding \n     Saturdays and Sundays, of being notified of the subpoena. If \n     a subpoena is disapproved by the ranking minority member as \n     provided in this paragraph, the subpoena may be authorized by \n     vote of the Members of the Committee, the quorum required by \n     paragraph 1 of rule II being present. When the Committee or \n     Chairman authorizes a subpoena, it shall be issued upon the \n     signature of the Chairman or any other Member of the \n     Committee designated by the Chairman. At the direction of the \n     Chairman, with notification to the ranking minority member of \n     not less than 72 hours, the staff is authorized to take \n     depositions from witnesses. The ranking minority member, or a \n     member of the Committee staff designated by the ranking \n     minority member, shall be given the opportunity to attend and \n     participate in the taking of any deposition. Witnesses at \n     depositions shall be examined upon oath administered by an \n     individual authorized by law to administer oaths, or \n     administered by any member of the Committee if one is \n     present.\n       2. Counsel.--Witnesses may be accompanied at a public or \n     executive hearing, or the taking of a deposition, by counsel \n     to advise them of their rights. Counsel retained by any \n     witness and accompanying such witness shall be permitted to \n     be present during the testimony of the witness at any public \n     or executive hearing, or the taking of a deposition, to \n     advise the witness, while the witness is testifying, of the \n     witness's legal rights. In the case of any witness who is an \n     officer or employee of the government, or of a corporation or \n     association, the Chairman may rule that representation by \n     counsel from the government, corporation, or association or \n     by counsel representing other witnesses, creates a conflict \n     of interest, and that the witness may only be represented \n     during testimony before the Committee by personal counsel not \n     from the government, corporation, or association or by \n     personal counsel not representing other witnesses. This \n     subparagraph shall not be construed to excuse a witness from \n     testifying in the event the witness's counsel is ejected for \n     conducting himself or herself in such manner as to prevent, \n     impede, disrupt, obstruct, or interfere with the orderly \n     administration of a hearing or the taking of a deposition. \n     This subparagraph may not be construed as authorizing counsel \n     to coach the witness or to answer for the witness. The \n     failure of any witness to secure counsel shall not excuse the \n     witness from complying with a subpoena.\n       3. Record.--An accurate electronic or stenographic record \n     shall be kept of the testimony of all witnesses in executive \n     and public hearings and depositions. If testimony given by \n     deposition is transcribed, the individual administering the \n     oath shall certify on the transcript that the witness was \n     duly sworn in his or her presence and the transcriber shall \n     certify that the transcript is a true record of the \n     testimony. The transcript with these certifications shall be \n     filed with the chief clerk of the Committee. The record of a \n     witness's testimony, whether in public or executive session \n     or in a deposition, shall be made available for inspection by \n     the witness or the witness's counsel under Committee \n     supervision. A copy of any testimony given in public session, \n     or that part of the testimony given by the witness in \n     executive session or deposition and subsequently quoted or \n     made part of the record in a public session, shall be \n     provided to that witness at the witness's expense if so \n     requested. Upon inspecting the transcript, within a time \n     limit set by the Clerk of the Committee, a witness may \n     request changes in the transcript to correct errors of \n     transcription and grammatical errors. The witness may also \n     bring to the attention of the Committee errors of fact in the \n     witness's testimony by submitting a sworn statement about \n     those facts with a request that it be attached to the \n     transcript.\n\n[[Page S850]]\n\n     The Chairman or a member of the Committee staff designated by \n     the Chairman shall rule on such requests.\n\n                   RULE VI--BROADCASTING OF HEARINGS\n\n       Public hearings of the full Committee, or any subcommittee \n     thereof, shall be televised or broadcast only when authorized \n     by the Chairman and the ranking minority member of the full \n     Committee.\n\n                        RULE VII--SUBCOMMITTEES\n\n       1. Hearings.--Any member of the Committee may sit with any \n     subcommittee during its hearings.\n       2. Change of Chairmanship.--Subcommittees shall be \n     considered de novo whenever there is a change in the \n     chairmanship, and seniority on the particular subcommittee \n     shall not necessarily apply.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/17/senate-section/article/S850-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S850]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        COMMITTEE ON RULES AND ADMINISTRATION RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER.

This does not preclude any Member of the committee \n     from discussing appropriate non-agenda topics.\n       5. After the Chairman and the Ranking Minority Member, \n     speaking order shall be based on order of arrival, \n     alternating between Majority and Minority Members, unless \n     otherwise directed by the Chairman.\n       6.

In general, testimony will be restricted to 5 minutes \n     for each witness. The time may be extended by the Chairman, \n     upon the Chair's own direction or at the request of a Member. \n     Each round of questions by Members will also be limited to 5 \n     minutes.\n\n\n                           TITLE II--QUORUMS\n\n       1.

Voting in the committee on any issue will normally be by \n     voice vote.\n       2. If a third of the Members present so demand a roll call \n     vote instead of a voice vote, a record vote will be taken on \n     any question by roll call.\n       3. The results of roll call votes taken in any meeting upon \n     any measure, or any amendment thereto, shall be stated in the \n     committee report on that measure unless previously announced \n     by the committee, and such report or announcement shall \n     include a tabulation of the votes cast in favor of and the \n     votes cast in opposition to each such measure and amendment \n     by each Member of the committee.

In any \n     hearings on the nomination, the nominee shall be called to \n     testify under oath on all matters relating to his or her \n     nomination for office. To aid in such investigation or \n     review, each nominee may be required to submit a sworn \n     detailed statement including biographical, financial, policy, \n     and other information which the Committee may request. The \n     Committee may specify which items in such statement are to be \n     received on a confidential basis.\n\n\n                                Hearings\n\n       (a)(1) The Chair of the Committee may initiate a hearing of \n     the Committee on his or her authority or upon his or her \n     approval of a request by any Member of the Committee.

Subject \n     to Senate Standing Rule 26(4)(d), such number shall exclude \n     any Administration witness unless such witness would be the \n     sole hearing witness, in which case the Ranking Member shall \n     be entitled to invite one witness. The preceding two \n     sentences shall not apply when a witness appears as the \n     nominee. Interrogation of witnesses at hearings shall be \n     conducted on behalf of the Committee by Members of the \n     Committee or such Committee staff as is authorized by the \n     Chair or Ranking Minority Member.\n       (3) Witnesses appearing before the Committee shall file \n     with the Clerk of the Committee a written statement of the \n     prepared testimony at least two business days in advance of \n     the hearing at which the witness is to appear unless this \n     requirement is waived by the Chair and the Ranking Minority \n     Member.\n       (c) Any witness summoned to a public or closed hearing may \n     be accompanied by counsel of his or her own choosing, who \n     shall be permitted while the witness is testifying to advise \n     the witness of his or her legal rights. Failure to obtain \n     counsel will not excuse the witness from appearing and \n     testifying.\n       (d) Subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses or the \n     production of memoranda, documents, records, and other \n     materials may be authorized by the Chair with the consent of \n     the Ranking Minority Member or by the consent of a majority \n     of the Members of the Committee. Such consent may be given \n     informally, without a meeting, but must be in writing. The \n     Chair may subpoena attendance or production without the \n     consent of the Ranking Minority Member when the Chair has not \n     received notification from the Ranking Minority Member of \n     disapproval of the subpoena within 72 hours of being notified \n     of the intended subpoena, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and \n     holidays. Subpoenas shall be issued by the Chair or by the \n     Member of the Committee designated by him or her. A subpoena \n     for the attendance of a witness shall state briefly the \n     purpose of the hearing and the matter or matters to which the \n     witness is expected to testify. A subpoena for the production \n     of memoranda, documents, records, and other materials shall \n     identify the papers or materials required to be produced with \n     as much particularity as is practicable.\n       (e) The Chair shall rule on any objections or assertions of \n     privilege as to testimony or evidence in response to \n     subpoenas or questions of Committee Members and staff in \n     hearings.\n       (f) Testimony may be submitted to the formal record for a \n     period not less than two weeks following a hearing or \n     roundtable, unless otherwise agreed to by Chair and Ranking \n     Member.\n\n\n                        Confidential Information\n\n       (a) No confidential testimony taken by, or confidential \n     material presented to, the Committee in executive session, or \n     any report of the proceedings of a closed hearing, or \n     confidential testimony or material submitted pursuant to a \n     subpoena, shall be made public, either in whole or in part or \n     by way of summary, unless authorized by a majority of the \n     Members. Other confidential material or testimony submitted \n     to the Committee may be disclosed if authorized by the Chair \n     with the consent of the Ranking Member.\n\n[[Page S852]]\n\n       (b) Persons asserting confidentiality of documents or \n     materials submitted to the Committee offices shall clearly \n     designate them as such on their face. Designation of \n     submissions as confidential does not prevent their use in \n     furtherance of Committee business.\n\n\n                          Media & Broadcasting\n\n       (a) At the discretion of the Chair, public meetings of the \n     Committee may be televised, broadcasted, or recorded in whole \n     or in part by a member of the Senate Press Gallery or an \n     employee of the Senate. Any such person wishing to televise, \n     broadcast, or record a Committee meeting must request \n     approval of the Chair by submitting a written request to the \n     Committee Office by 5 p.m. the day before the meeting.

The brief \n     summary included in the statement must be no more than 3 \n     pages long.

By written notice to the Chairman any \n     time before the record vote on the measure or matter \n     concerned is taken, any member may withdraw a proxy \n     previously given. All proxies shall be kept in the files of \n     the Committee, along with the record of the rollcall vote of \n     the members present and voting, as an official record of the \n     vote on the measure or matter.\n       [b] Vote on matters other than to report a measure or \n     matter.--On Committee matters other than a vote to report a \n     measure or matter, no record vote shall be taken unless a \n     majority of the Committee are actually present.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor Gerda Weissman Klein, \nHolocaust survivor and recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n  We tell ourselves never to forget, and we implore our children to do \nthe same. But we cannot do it alone.\n  We need to listen to those who remember not by choice, but because \nthey can never forget what they saw and what they survived.\n  With each passing year, fewer and fewer of these witnesses remain. \nEven fewer of them speak English, or live in America, where we can hear \ntheir stories first hand. And fewer still are like Gerda Weissman \nKlein.\n  About a year and a half ago, Mrs. Klein and her son visited my \noffice. I invited Senators Levin and Cardin to join me. I will always \nremember one observation she offered.\n  I remember it because she didn't say it as though she were teaching a \nprofound lesson, though it was profound. She didn't say it as though it \nwas the most important message she came to deliver, but it has stayed \nwith me to this day. She said it, incredibly, as an off-hand comment \nwhile we were just chatting.\n  Mrs. Klein said this: ``Surviving is an incredible privilege, but it \nis also a very deep responsibility.''\n  It was beyond humbling--that someone could see what she saw and lose \nwhat she lost and endure what she endured, and still maintain such \nperspective, and feel such responsibility.\n  Mrs. Klein continues to fulfill what she sees as her responsibility, \nsharing her story and teaching us about tolerance. That's why we \nfulfilled our responsibility to her--by recognizing her with highest \nhonor our country can give civilians, the Presidential Medal of \nFreedom.\n  But more than that, we fulfill our responsibility by thanking her, by \nappreciating her and by listening to her--so that we will never forget \nwhat she cannot forget.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/17/senate-section/article/S855-2", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S855]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO BRIA BENJAMIN\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, religious freedom is the first subject \naddressed in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. In \na pair of clauses that too often are divorced from each other, the \nConstitution prohibits Congress from making laws respecting an \nestablishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise of religion. \nReligious freedom has been a passion of mine throughout my service in \nthe Senate and I intend to address this critical subject in a variety \nof ways during the 112th Congress. Today, I want to offer for my \ncolleagues' consideration an important speech on religious freedom \ndelivered two weeks ago at the Chapman University School of Law by \nElder Dallin Oaks.\n  Elder Oaks serves in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the Church \nof Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. He received his law degree from \nthe University of Chicago, where he was Editor-in-Chief of the Chicago \nLaw Review and where he would later teach after clerking for Supreme \nCourt Chief Justice Earl Warren. He also served as President of Brigham \nYoung University, Chairman of the Public Broadcasting Service, and as a \nJustice on the\n\n[[Page S856]]\n\nUtah Supreme Court. Elder Oaks is one of the pre-eminent legal scholars \nof our time, and a man deeply schooled in the Constitution who dearly \nloves our country.\n  As Elder Oaks makes clear at the outset, this speech is not about \nparticular religious doctrine but about religious freedom. In fact, he \nsays that his intent is ``to contend for religious freedom.'' \nContending for something is much more than simply talking about it, \nexplaining it, or even advocating it. To contend for religious freedom \nis to strive earnestly for it, to struggle for it, even in the face of \nopposition. Religious freedom is that important.\n  So I ask unanimous consent to have this speech printed in the Record \nand ask my colleagues to read and consider it. The full printed version \nof this speech contains extensive footnotes which have been deleted \nhere for ease of publication in the Record. But I note for my \ncolleagues that the full text and notes may be found at the following \nInternet address: http://newsroom.lds.org/article/apostle-emphasizes-\nthe-importance-of-religious-freedom-to-society.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Preserving Religious Freedom\n\n (Elder Dallin H. Oaks, of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, Chapman \n      University School of Law, Orange, California, Feb. 4, 2011)\n\n       I am here to speak of the state of religious freedom in the \n     United States, why it seems to be diminishing, and what can \n     be done about it.\n       Although I will refer briefly to some implications of the \n     Proposition 8 controversy and its constitutional arguments, I \n     am not here to participate in the debate on the desirability \n     or effects of same-sex marriage. I am here to contend for \n     religious freedom. I am here to describe fundamental \n     principles that I hope will be meaningful for decades to \n     come.\n       I believe you will find no unique Mormon doctrine in what I \n     say. My sources are law and secular history. I will quote the \n     words of Catholic, Evangelical Christian, and Jewish leaders, \n     among others. I am convinced that on this issue what all \n     believers have in common is far more important than their \n     differences. We must unite to strengthen our freedom to teach \n     and exercise what we have in common, as well as our very real \n     differences in religious doctrine.\n\n\n                                   I.\n\n       I begin with a truth that is increasingly challenged: \n     Religious teachings and religious organizations are valuable \n     and important to our free society and therefore deserving of \n     special legal protection. I will cite a few examples.\n       Our nation's inimitable private sector of charitable works \n     originated and is still furthered most significantly by \n     religious impulses and religious organizations. I refer to \n     such charities as schools and higher education, hospitals, \n     and care for the poor, where religiously motivated persons \n     contribute personal service and financial support of great \n     value to our citizens. Our nation's incredible generosity in \n     many forms of aid to other nations and their peoples are \n     manifestations of our common religious faith that all peoples \n     are children of God. Religious beliefs instill patterns of \n     altruistic behavior.\n       Many of the great moral advances in Western society have \n     been motivated by religious principles and moved through the \n     public square by pulpit-preaching. The abolition of the slave \n     trade in England and the Emancipation Proclamation in the \n     United States are notable illustrations. These revolutionary \n     steps were not motivated and moved by secular ethics or \n     coalitions of persons who believed in moral relativism. They \n     were driven primarily by individuals who had a clear vision \n     of what was morally right and what was morally wrong. In our \n     time, the Civil Rights movement was of course inspired and \n     furthered by religious leaders.\n       Religion also strengthens our nation in the matter of \n     honesty and integrity. Modern science and technology have \n     given us remarkable devices, but we are frequently reminded \n     that their operation in our economic system and the resulting \n     prosperity of our nation rest on the honesty of the men and \n     women who use them. Americans' honesty is also reflected in \n     our public servants' remarkable resistance to official \n     corruption. These standards and practices of honesty and \n     integrity rest, ultimately, on our ideas of right and wrong, \n     which, for most of us, are grounded in principles of religion \n     and the teachings of religious leaders.\n       Our society is not held together just by law and its \n     enforcement, but most importantly by voluntary obedience to \n     the unenforceable and by widespread adherence to unwritten \n     norms of right or righteous behavior. Religious belief in \n     right and wrong is a vital influence to advocate and persuade \n     such voluntary compliance by a large proportion of our \n     citizens. Others, of course, have a moral compass not \n     expressly grounded in religion. John Adams relied on all of \n     these when he wisely observed that ``we have no government \n     armed with power capable of contending with human passions \n     unbridled by morality and religion. Avarice, ambition, \n     revenge, or gallantry, would break the strongest cords of our \n     Constitution as a whale goes through a net. Our Constitution \n     was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly \n     inadequate to the government of any other.''\n       Even the agnostic Oxford-educated British journalist, \n     Melanie Phillips, admitted that ``one does not have to be a \n     religious believer to grasp that the core values of Western \n     Civilization are grounded in religion, and to be concerned \n     that the erosion of religious observance therefore undermines \n     those values and the `secular ideas' they reflect.''\n       My final example of the importance of religion in our \n     country concerns the origin of the Constitution. Its \n     formation over 200 years ago was made possible by religious \n     principles of human worth and dignity, and only those \n     principles in the hearts of a majority of our diverse \n     population can sustain that Constitution today. I submit that \n     religious values and political realities are so inter-linked \n     in the origin and perpetuation of this nation that we cannot \n     lose the influence of religion in our public life without \n     seriously jeopardizing our freedoms.\n       Unfortunately, the extent and nature of religious devotion \n     in this nation is changing. Belief in a personal God who \n     defines right and wrong is challenged by many. ``By some \n     counts,'' an article in The Economist declares, ``there are \n     at least 500 [million] declared non-believers in the world--\n     enough to make atheism the fourth-biggest religion.'' Others \n     who do not consider themselves atheists also reject the idea \n     of a supernatural power, but affirm the existence of some \n     impersonal force and the value of compassion and love and \n     justice.\n       Organized religion is surely on the decline. Last year's \n     Pew Forum Study on Religion and Public Life found that the \n     percentage of young adults affiliated with a particular \n     religious faith is declining significantly. Scholars Robert \n     Putnam and David Campbell have concluded that ``the prospects \n     for religious observance in the coming decades are \n     substantially diminished.''\n       Whatever the extent of formal religious affiliation, I \n     believe that the tide of public opinion in favor of religion \n     is receding. A writer for the Christian Science Monitor \n     predicts that the coming century will be ``very secular and \n     religiously antagonistic,'' with intolerance of Christianity \n     ``ris[ing] to levels many of us have not believed possible in \n     our lifetimes.''\n       A visible measure of the decline of religion in our public \n     life is the diminished mention of religious faith and \n     references to God in our public discourse. One has only to \n     compare the current rhetoric with the major addresses of our \n     political leaders in the 18th, 19th, and the first part of \n     the 20th centuries. Similarly, compare what Lincoln said \n     about God and religious practices like prayer on key \n     occasions with the edited versions of his remarks quoted in \n     current history books. It is easy to believe that there is an \n     informal conspiracy of correctness to scrub out references to \n     God and the influence of religion in the founding and \n     preservation of our nation.\n       The impact of this on the rising generation is detailed in \n     an Oxford University Press book, Souls in Transition. There \n     we read: ``Most of the dynamics of emerging adult culture and \n     life in the United States today seem to have a tendency to \n     reduce the appeal and importance of religious faith and \n     practice. . . . Religion for the most part is just something \n     in the background.''\n       Granted that reduced religious affiliation puts religion \n     ``in the background,'' the effect of that on the religious \n     beliefs of young adults is still in controversy. The negative \n     view appears in the Oxford book, whose author concludes that \n     this age group of 18 to 23 ``had difficulty seeing the \n     possible distinction between, in this case, objective moral \n     truth and relative human invention. . . . [T]hey simply \n     cannot, for whatever reason, believe in--or sometimes even \n     conceive of--a given, objective truth, fact, reality, or \n     nature of the world that is independent of their subjective \n     self-experience.''\n       On the positive side, the Pew Forum study reported that \n     over three-quarters of young adults believe that there are \n     absolute standards of right and wrong. For reasons explained \n     later, I believe this finding is very positive for the future \n     of religious freedom.\n\n\n                                  II.\n\n       Before reviewing the effects of the decline of religion in \n     our public life, I will speak briefly of the free exercise of \n     religion. The first provision in the Bill of Rights of the \n     United States Constitution is what many believe to be its \n     most important guarantee. It reads: ``Congress shall make no \n     law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting \n     the free exercise thereof.''\n       The prohibition against ``an establishment of religion'' \n     was intended to separate churches and government, to forbid a \n     national church of the kind found in Europe. In the interest \n     of time I will say no more about the establishment of \n     religion, but only concentrate on the First Amendment's \n     direction that the United States shall have ``no law \n     [prohibiting] the free exercise [of religion].'' For almost a \n     century this guarantee of religious freedom has been \n     understood as a limitation on state as well as federal power.\n       The guarantee of religious freedom is one of the supremely \n     important founding principles in the United States \n     Constitution, and it is reflected in the constitutions of all \n     50 of\n\n[[Page S857]]\n\n     our states. As noted by many, the guarantee's ``pre-eminent \n     place'' as the first expression in the First Amendment to the \n     United States Constitution identifies freedom of religion as \n     ``a cornerstone of American democracy.'' The American \n     colonies were originally settled by people who, for the most \n     part, came to this continent for the freedom to practice \n     their religious faith without persecution, and their \n     successors deliberately placed religious freedom first in the \n     nation's Bill of Rights.\n       So it is that our federal law formally declares: ``The \n     right to freedom of religion undergirds the very origin and \n     existence of the United States.'' So it is, I maintain, that \n     in our nation's founding and in our constitutional order \n     religious freedom and its associated First Amendment freedoms \n     of speech and press are the motivating and dominating civil \n     liberties and civil rights.\n\n\n                                  III.\n\n       Notwithstanding its special place in our Constitution, a \n     number of trends are eroding both the protections the free \n     exercise clause was intended to provide and the public esteem \n     this fundamental value has had during most of our history. \n     For some time we have been experiencing laws and official \n     actions that impinge on religious freedom. In a few moments I \n     will give illustrations, but first I offer some \n     generalizations.\n       The free ``exercise'' of religion obviously involves both \n     (1) the right to choose religious beliefs and affiliations \n     and (2) the right to ``exercise'' or practice those beliefs \n     without government restraint. However, in a nation with \n     citizens of many different religious beliefs the right of \n     some to act upon their religious beliefs must be qualified by \n     the government's responsibility to further compelling \n     government interests, such as the health and safety of all. \n     Otherwise, for example, the government could not protect its \n     citizens' persons or properties from neighbors whose \n     religious principles compelled practices that threatened \n     others' health or personal security. Government authorities \n     have wrestled with this tension for many years, so we have \n     considerable experience in working out the necessary \n     accommodations.\n       The inherent conflict between the precious religious \n     freedom of the people and the legitimate regulatory \n     responsibilities of the government is the central issue of \n     religious freedom. The problems are not simple, and over the \n     years the United States Supreme Court, which has the ultimate \n     responsibility of interpreting the meaning of the lofty and \n     general provisions of the Constitution, has struggled to \n     identify principles that can guide its decisions when a law \n     or regulation is claimed to violate someone's free exercise \n     of religion. As would be expected, many of these battles have \n     involved government efforts to restrict the religious \n     practices of small groups like Jehovah's Witnesses and \n     Mormons. Recent experience suggests adding the example of \n     Muslims.\n       Much of the controversy in recent years has focused on the \n     extent to which state laws that are neutral and generally \n     applicable can override the strong protections contained in \n     the free exercise clause of the United States Constitution. \n     As noted hereafter, in the 1990s the Supreme Court ruled that \n     such state laws could prevail. Fortunately, in a stunning \n     demonstration of the resilience of the guarantee of free \n     exercise of religion, over half of the states have passed \n     legislation or interpreted their state constitutions to \n     preserve a higher standard for protecting religious freedom. \n     Only a handful have followed the Supreme Court's approach \n     that the federal free exercise protection must bow to state \n     laws that are neutral as to religion.\n       Another important current debate over religious freedom \n     concerns whether the guarantee of free exercise of religion \n     gives one who acts on religious grounds greater protection \n     against government prohibitions than are already guaranteed \n     to everyone by other provisions of the constitution, like \n     freedom of speech. I, of course, maintain that unless \n     religious freedom has a unique position we erase the \n     significance of this separate provision in the First \n     Amendment. Treating actions based on religious belief the \n     same as actions based on other systems of belief is not \n     enough to satisfy the special guarantee of religious freedom \n     in the United States Constitution. Religion must preserve its \n     preferred status in our pluralistic society in order to make \n     its unique contribution--its recognition and commitment to \n     values that transcend the secular world.\n       Over a quarter century ago I reviewed the history and \n     predicted the future of church/state law in a lecture at \n     DePaul University in Chicago. I took sad notice of the fact \n     that the United States Supreme Court had diminished the \n     significance of free exercise by expanding the definition of \n     religion to include what the Court called ``religions'' not \n     based on belief in God. I wrote: ``The problem with a \n     definition of religion that includes almost everything is \n     that the practical effect of inclusion comes to mean almost \n     nothing. Free exercise protections become diluted as their \n     scope becomes more diffuse. When religion has no more right \n     to free exercise than irreligion or any other secular \n     philosophy, the whole newly expanded category of `religion' \n     is likely to diminish in significance.''\n       Unfortunately, the tide of thought and precedent seems \n     contrary to this position. While I have no concern with \n     expanding comparable protections to non-religious belief \n     systems, as is done in international norms that protect \n     freedom of religion or belief, I object to doing so by re-\n     interpreting the First Amendment guarantee of free exercise \n     of religion.\n       It was apparent twenty-five years ago, and it is undeniable \n     today, that the significance of religious freedom is \n     diminishing. Five years after I gave my DePaul lecture, the \n     United States Supreme Court issued its most important free \n     exercise decision in many years. In Employment Division v. \n     Smith, the Court significantly narrowed the traditional \n     protection of religion by holding that the guarantee of \n     free exercise did not prevent government from interfering \n     with religious activities when it did so by neutral, \n     generally applicable laws. This ruling removed religious \n     activities from their sanctuary--the preferred position \n     the First Amendment had given them.\n       Now, over twenty years later, some are contending that a \n     religious message is just another message in a world full of \n     messages, not something to be given unique or special \n     protection. One author takes the extreme position that \n     religious speech should have even less protection. In Freedom \n     from Religion, published by the Oxford University Press, a \n     law professor makes this three-step argument:\n       1. In many nations ``society is at risk from religious \n     extremism.''\n       2. ``A follower is far more likely to act on the words of a \n     religious authority figure than other speakers.''\n       3. Therefore, ``in some cases, society and government \n     should view religious speech as inherently less protected \n     than secular political speech because of its extraordinary \n     ability to influence the listener.''\n       The professor then offers this shocking conclusion:\n\n       ``[W]e must begin to consider the possibility that \n     religious speech can no longer hide behind the shield of \n     freedom of expression. . . .\n       ``Contemporary religious extremism leaves decision-makers \n     and the public alike with no choice but to re-contour \n     constitutionally granted rights as they pertain to religion \n     and speech.''\n\n       I believe most thoughtful people would reject that extreme \n     conclusion. All should realize how easy it would be to \n     gradually manipulate the definition of ``religious \n     extremism'' to suppress any unpopular religion or any \n     unpopular preaching based on religious doctrine. In addition, \n     I hope most would see that it is manifestly unfair and short-\n     sighted to threaten religious freedom by focusing on some \n     undoubted abuses without crediting religion's many benefits. \n     I am grateful that there are responsible voices and evidence \n     affirming the vital importance of religious freedom, \n     worldwide.\n       When Cardinal Francis George, then President of the U.S. \n     Conference of Catholic Bishops, spoke at Brigham Young \n     University last year, he referred to ``threats to religious \n     freedom in America that are new to our history and to our \n     tradition.'' He gave two examples, one concerning threats to \n     current religious-based exemptions from participating in \n     abortions and the other ``the development of gay rights and \n     the call for same-sex `marriage.''' He spoke of possible \n     government punishments for churches or religious leaders \n     whose doctrines lead them to refuse to participate in \n     government sponsored programs.\n       Along with many others, I see a serious threat to the \n     freedom of religion in the current assertion of a ``civil \n     right'' of homosexuals to be free from religious preaching \n     against their relationships. Religious leaders of various \n     denominations affirm and preach that sexual relations should \n     only occur between a man and a woman joined together \n     in marriage. One would think that the preaching of such a \n     doctrinal belief would be protected by the constitutional \n     guarantee of the free exercise of religion, to say nothing \n     of the guarantee of free speech. However, we are beginning \n     to see worldwide indications that this may not be so.\n       Religious preaching of the wrongfulness of homosexual \n     relations is beginning to be threatened with criminal \n     prosecution or actually prosecuted or made the subject of \n     civil penalties. Canada has been especially aggressive, \n     charging numerous religious authorities and persons of faith \n     with violating its human rights law by ``impacting an \n     individual's sense of self-worth and acceptance.'' Other \n     countries where this has occurred include Sweden, the United \n     Kingdom, and Singapore.\n       I do not know enough to comment on whether these \n     suppressions of religious speech violate the laws of other \n     countries, but I do know something of religious freedom in \n     the United States, and I am alarmed at what is reported to be \n     happening here.\n       In New Mexico, the state's Human Rights Commission held \n     that a photographer who had declined on religious grounds to \n     photograph a same-sex commitment ceremony had engaged in \n     impermissible conduct and must pay over $6,000 attorney's \n     fees to the same-sex couple. A state judge upheld the order \n     to pay. In New Jersey, the United Methodist Church was \n     investigated and penalized under state anti-discrimination \n     law for denying same-sex couples access to a church-owned \n     pavilion for their civil-union ceremonies. A federal court \n     refused to give relief from the state penalties. Professors \n     at state universities in Illinois and Wisconsin were fired or \n     disciplined for expressing personal convictions that \n     homosexual behavior is sinful. Candidates for masters' \n     degrees in counseling in Georgia and Michigan universities \n     were penalized or dismissed from programs\n\n[[Page S858]]\n\n     for their religious views about the wrongfulness of \n     homosexual relations. A Los Angeles policeman claimed he was \n     demoted after he spoke against the wrongfulness of homosexual \n     conduct in the church where he is a lay pastor. The Catholic \n     Church's difficulties with adoption services and the Boy \n     Scouts' challenges in various locations are too well known to \n     require further comment.\n       We must also be concerned at recent official expressions \n     that would narrow the field of activities protected by the \n     free exercise of religion. Thus, when President Obama used \n     the words freedom of worship instead of free exercise of \n     religion, a writer for the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty \n     sounded this warning:\n\n       ``To anyone who closely follows prominent discussion of \n     religious freedom in the diplomatic and political arena, this \n     linguistic shift is troubling.\n       ``The reason is simple. Any person of faith knows that \n     religious exercise is about a lot more than freedom of \n     worship. It's about the right to dress according to one's \n     religious dictates, to preach openly, to evangelize, to \n     engage in the public square.''\n\n       Fortunately, more recent expressions by President Obama and \n     his state department have used the traditional references to \n     the right to practice religious faith.\n       Even more alarming are recent evidences of a narrowing \n     definition of religious expression and an expanding \n     definition of the so-called civil rights of ``dignity,'' \n     ``autonomy,'' and'' self-fulfillment'' of persons offended by \n     religious preaching. Thus, President Obama's head of the \n     Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Chai Feldblum, \n     recently framed the issue in terms of a ``sexual-orientation \n     liberty'' that is such a fundamental right that it should \n     prevail over a competing ``religious-belief liberty.'' Such a \n     radical assertion should not escape analysis. It has three \n     elements. First, the freedom of religion--an express \n     provision of the Bill of Rights that has been recognized as a \n     fundamental right for over 200 years--is recast as a simple \n     ``liberty'' that ranks among many other liberties. Second, \n     Feldblum asserts that sexual orientation is now to be defined \n     as a ``sexual liberty'' that has the status of a fundamental \n     right. Finally, it is claimed that ``the best framework for \n     dealing with this conflict is to analyze religious people's \n     claims as `belief liberty interest' not as free exercise \n     claims under the First Amendment.'' The conclusion: Religious \n     expressions are to be overridden by the fundamental right to \n     ``sexual liberty.''\n       It is well to remember James Madison's warning: ``There are \n     more instances of the abridgement of the freedom of the \n     people by gradual and silent encroachments of those in power \n     than by violent and sudden usurpations.''\n       We are beginning to experience the expansion of rhetoric \n     and remedies that seem likely to be used to chill or even to \n     penalize religious expression. Like the professors in \n     Illinois and Wisconsin and the lay clergyman in California, \n     individuals of faith are experiencing real retribution merely \n     because they seek to express their sincerely held religious \n     beliefs.\n       All of this shows an alarming trajectory of events pointing \n     toward constraining the freedom of religious speech by \n     forcing it to give way to the ``rights'' of those offended by \n     such speech. If that happens, we will have criminal \n     prosecution of those whose religious doctrines or speech \n     offend those whose public influence and political power \n     establish them as an officially protected class.\n       Closely related to the danger of criminal prosecutions are \n     the current arguments seeking to brand religious beliefs as \n     an unacceptable basis for citizen action or even for argument \n     in the public square. For an example of this we need go no \n     further than the district court's opinion in the Proposition \n     8 case, Perry v. Schwarzenegger.\n       A few generations ago the idea that religious organizations \n     and religious persons would be unwelcome in the public square \n     would have been unthinkable. Now, such arguments are \n     prominent enough to cause serious concern. It is not \n     difficult to see a conscious strategy to neutralize the \n     influence of religion and churches and religious motivations \n     on any issues that could be characterized as public policy. \n     As noted by John A. Howard of the Howard Center for Family, \n     Religion and Society, the proponents of banishment ``have \n     developed great skills in demonizing those who disagree with \n     them, turning their opponents into objects of fear, hatred \n     and scorn.'' Legal commentator Hugh Hewitt described the \n     current circumstance this way:\n\n       ``There is a growing anti-religious bigotry in the United \n     States. . . .\n       ``For three decades people of faith have watched a \n     systematic and very effective effort waged in the courts and \n     the media to drive them from the public square and to \n     delegitimize their participation in politics as somehow \n     threatening.''\n\n       The forces that would intimidate persons with religious-\n     based points of view from influencing or making the laws of \n     their state or nation should answer this question: How would \n     the great movements toward social justice cited earlier have \n     been advocated and pressed toward adoption if their religious \n     proponents had been banned from the public square by \n     insistence that private religious or moral positions were not \n     a rational basis for public discourse?\n       We have already seen a significant deterioration in the \n     legal position of the family, a key institution defined by \n     religious doctrine. In his essay ``The Judicial Assault on \n     the Family,'' Allan W. Carlson examines the ``formal \n     influence of Christianity'' on American family law, citing \n     many state and United States Supreme Court decisions through \n     the 1950s affirming the fundamental nature of the family. He \n     then reviews a series of decisions beginning in the mid-1960s \n     that gave what he calls ``an alternate vision of family life \n     and family law.'' For example, he quotes a 1972 decision in \n     which the Court characterized marriage as ``an association of \n     two individuals each with a separate intellectual and \n     emotional makeup.'' ``Through these words,'' Carlson \n     concludes, ``the U.S. Supreme Court essentially enlisted in \n     the Sexual Revolution.'' Over these same years, ``the federal \n     courts also radically altered the meaning of parenthood.''\n       I quote Carlson again:\n\n       ``The broad trend has been from a view of marriage as a \n     social institution with binding claims of its own and with \n     prescribed rules for men and women into a free association, \n     easily entered and easily broken, with a focus on the needs \n     of individuals. However, the ironical result of so expanding \n     the `freedom to marry' has been to enhance the authority and \n     sway of government.''\n       ``As the American founders understood, marriage and the \n     autonomous family were the true bulwarks of liberty, for they \n     were the principal rivals to the state. . . . And surely, as \n     the American judiciary has deconstructed marriage and the \n     family over the last 40 years, the result has been the growth \n     of government.''\n\n       All of this has culminated in attempts to redefine marriage \n     or to urge its complete abolition. The debate continues in \n     the press and elsewhere.\n\n\n                                  IV.\n\n       What has caused the current public and legal climate of \n     mounting threats to religious freedom? I believe the cause is \n     not legal but cultural and religious. I believe the \n     diminished value being attached to religious freedom stems \n     from the ascendency of moral relativism.\n       More and more of our citizens support the idea that all \n     authority and all rules of behavior are man-made and can be \n     accepted or rejected as one chooses. Each person is free to \n     decide for himself or herself what is right and wrong. Our \n     children face the challenge of living in an increasingly \n     godless and amoral society.\n       I have neither the time nor the expertise to define the \n     various aspects of moral relativism or the extent to which \n     they have entered the culture or consciousness of our nation \n     and its people. I can only rely on respected observers whose \n     descriptions feel right to me.\n       In his book, Modern Times, the British author, Paul \n     Johnson, writes: ``At the beginning of the 1920s the belief \n     began to circulate, for the first time at a popular level, \n     that there were no longer any absolutes: of time and space, \n     of good and evil, of knowledge, above all of value.''\n       On this side of the Atlantic, Gertrude Himmelfarb describes \n     how the virtues associated with good and evil have been \n     degraded into relative values.\n       A variety of observers have described the consequences of \n     moral relativism. All of them affirm the existence of God as \n     the Ultimate Law-giver and the source of the absolute truth \n     that distinguishes good from evil.\n       Rabbi Harold Kushner speaks of God-given ``absolute \n     standards of good and evil built into the human soul.'' He \n     writes: ``As I see it, there are two possibilities. Either \n     you affirm the existence of a God who stands for morality and \n     makes moral demands of us, who built a law of truthfulness \n     into His world even as He built in a law of gravity. . . . Or \n     else you give everyone the right to decide what is good and \n     what is evil by his or her own lights, balancing the voice of \n     one's conscience against the voice of temptation and need. . \n     . .''\n       Rabbi Kushner also observes that a philosophy that rejects \n     the idea of absolute right and wrong inevitably leads to a \n     deadening of conscience. ``Without God, it would be a world \n     where no one was outraged by crime or cruelty, and no one was \n     inspired to put an end to them. . . . [T]here would be no \n     more inspiring goal for our lives than self-interest. . . . \n     Neither room nor reason for tenderness, generosity, \n     helpfulness.''\n       Dr. Timothy Keller, a much-published pastor in New York, \n     asks:\n\n       ``What happens if you eliminate anything from the Bible \n     that offends your sensibility and crosses your will? If you \n     pick and choose what you want to believe and reject the rest, \n     how will you ever have a God who can contradict you? You \n     won't!. . . .\n       ``Though we have been taught that all moral values are \n     relative to individuals and cultures, we can't live like \n     that. In actual practice we inevitably treat some principles \n     as absolute standards by which we judge the behavior of those \n     who don't share our values. . . . People who laugh at the \n     claim that there is a transcendent moral order do not think \n     that racial genocide is just impractical or self-defeating, \n     but that it is wrong. . . .''\n\n       My esteemed fellow Apostle, Elder Neal A. Maxwell, asked: \n     ``[H]ow can a society set priorities if there are no basic \n     standards? Are we to make our calculations using only the \n     arithmetic of appetite?''\n       He made this practical observation: ``Decrease the belief \n     in God, and you increase the\n\n[[Page S859]]\n\n     numbers of those who wish to play at being God by being \n     `society's supervisors.' Such `supervisors' deny the \n     existence of divine standards, but are very serious about \n     imposing their own standards on society.''\n       Elder Maxwell also observed that we increase the power of \n     governments when people do not believe in absolute truths and \n     in a God who will hold them and their government leaders \n     accountable.\n       Moral relativism leads to a loss of respect for religion \n     and even to anger against religion and the guilt that is seen \n     to flow from it. As it diminishes religion, it encourages the \n     proliferation of rights that claim ascendency over the free \n     exercise of religion.\n       The founders who established this nation believed in God \n     and in the existence of moral absolutes--right and wrong--\n     established by this Ultimate Law-giver. The Constitution they \n     established assumed and relied on morality in the actions of \n     its citizens. Where did that morality come from and how was \n     it to be retained? Belief in God and the consequent reality \n     of right and wrong was taught by religious leaders in \n     churches and synagogues, and the founders gave us the First \n     Amendment to preserve that foundation for the Constitution.\n       The preservation of religious freedom in our nation depends \n     on the value we attach to the teachings of right and wrong in \n     our churches, synagogues and mosques. It is faith in God--\n     however defined--that translates these religious teachings \n     into the moral behavior that benefits the nation. As fewer \n     and fewer citizens believe in God and in the existence of the \n     moral absolutes taught by religious leaders, the importance \n     of religious freedom to the totality of our citizens is \n     diminished. We stand to lose that freedom if many believe \n     that religious leaders, who preach right and wrong, make no \n     unique contribution to society and therefore should have no \n     special legal protection.\n\n\n                             V. Conclusion\n\n       I have made four major points:\n       1. Religious teachings and religious organizations are \n     valuable and important to our free society and therefore \n     deserving of their special legal protection.\n       2. Religious freedom undergirds the origin and existence of \n     this country and is the dominating civil liberty.\n       3. The guarantee of free exercise of religion is weakening \n     in its effects and in public esteem.\n       4. This weakening is attributable to the ascendancy of \n     moral relativism.\n       We must never see the day when the public square is not \n     open to religious ideas and religious persons. The religious \n     community must unite to be sure we are not coerced or \n     deterred into silence by the kinds of intimidation or \n     threatening rhetoric that are being experienced. Whether or \n     not such actions are anti-religious, they are surely anti-\n     democratic and should be condemned by all who are interested \n     in democratic government. There should be room for all good-\n     faith views in the public square, be they secular, religious, \n     or a mixture of the two. When expressed sincerely and without \n     sanctimoniousness, the religious voice adds much to the text \n     and tenor of public debate. As Elder Quentin L. Cook has \n     said: ``In our increasingly unrighteous world, it is \n     essential that values based on religious belief be part of \n     the public discourse. Moral positions informed by a religious \n     conscience must be accorded equal access to the public \n     square.''\n       Religious persons should insist on their constitutional \n     right and duty to exercise their religion, to vote their \n     consciences on public issues, and to participate in elections \n     and in debates in the public square and the halls of justice. \n     These are the rights of all citizens and they are also the \n     rights of religious leaders and religious organizations. In \n     this circumstance, it is imperative that those of us who \n     believe in God and in the reality of right and wrong unite \n     more effectively to protect our religious freedom to preach \n     and practice our faith in God and the principles of right and \n     wrong He has established.\n       This proposal that we unite more effectively does not \n     require any examination of the doctrinal differences among \n     Christians, Jews, and Muslims, or even an identification of \n     the many common elements of our beliefs. All that is \n     necessary for unity and a broad coalition along the lines I \n     am suggesting is a common belief that there is a right and \n     wrong in human behavior that has been established by a \n     Supreme Being. All who believe in that fundamental should \n     unite more effectively to preserve and strengthen the freedom \n     to advocate and practice our religious beliefs, whatever they \n     are. We must walk together for a ways on the same path in \n     order to secure our freedom to pursue our separate ways when \n     that is necessary according to our own beliefs.\n       I am not proposing a resurrection of the so-called ``moral \n     majority,'' which was identified with a particular religious \n     group and a particular political party. Nor am I proposing an \n     alliance or identification with any current political \n     movement, tea party or other. I speak for a broader \n     principle, non-partisan and, in its own focused objective, \n     ecumenical. I speak for what Cardinal Francis George \n     described in his address at Brigham Young University, just a \n     year ago. His title was ``Catholics and Latter-day Saints: \n     Partners in the Defense of Religious Freedom.'' He proposed \n     ``that Catholics and Mormons stand with one another and with \n     other defenders of conscience, and that we can and should \n     stand as one in the defense of religious liberty. In the \n     coming years, interreligious coalitions formed to defend the \n     rights of conscience for individuals and for religious \n     institutions should become a vital bulwark against the tide \n     of forces at work in our government and society to reduce \n     religion to a purely private reality. At stake is whether or \n     not the religious voice will maintain its right to be heard \n     in the public square.''\n       We join in that call for religious coalitions to protect \n     religious freedom. In doing so we recall the wisdom of \n     Benjamin Franklin. At another critical time in our nation's \n     history, he declared: ``We must all hang together, or \n     assuredly we shall all hang separately.''\n       In conclusion, as an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ I \n     affirm His love for all people on this earth, and I affirm \n     the importance His followers must attach to religious freedom \n     for all people--whatever their beliefs. I pray for the \n     blessings of God upon our cooperative efforts to preserve \n     that freedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/17/senate-section/article/S859-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S859-S860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JERRY SLOAN\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, on February 11, 2011, the people of Utah \nreceived of some very bad news. On that day, Jerry Sloan announced that \nhe was resigning his position as head coach of the Utah Jazz. Jerry is \none of the most respected figures in all of sports, a Hall of Famer, \nand, for the people of Utah, an irreplaceable icon. He will most \ncertainly be missed.\n  Coach Sloan was born and raised in rural Illinois. He played college \nball at the University of Evansville. And, although he began his career \nin the NBA with the Baltimore Bullets, he will always be remembered for \nhis years with the Chicago Bulls. Few probably remember that Jerry was, \nin fact, the first member of the Bulls' team, having been selected in \nthe expansion draft prior to the team's first season in the NBA. \nThroughout his playing career, he was known as ``The Original Bull.''\n  As a player, Sloan was known for his tenacity on defense, his \nunmatched toughness, and his no-nonsense nature. Over the course of his \ncareer with the Bulls, he played in two All-Star Games, was named to \nthe NBA All-Defensive First Team four times and the All-Defensive \nSecond Team twice. After his retirement, the Bulls retired Sloan's \njersey, the first jersey retirement in the history of the franchise.\n  After his playing days were over, Jerry joined the Bull's coaching \nstaff, starting out as a scout, eventually working his way up to head \ncoach, a position he held for three seasons. He joined the Jazz \ncoaching staff a few years later as an assistant coach. In 1988, Jerry \nwas named head coach of the Jazz, and he stayed in that position up \nuntil last week.\n  Jerry Sloan was the coach of the Jazz for 23 years. That is simply \nremarkable, not only in the modern NBA era but in the history of \nprofessional basketball. The NBA has seen a number of great coaches in \nits history, but none have coached the same team as long as Jerry Sloan \ncoached the Jazz.\n  Coach Sloan's success is even more remarkable than his longevity. In \nthe 23 seasons Jerry coached, the Jazz finished with a losing record \nonly one time. The team was in the playoffs in all but three of those \nseasons, and they reached the NBA Finals twice, in 1997 and 1998. Jerry \nfinished his career third on alltime wins list. He holds the record for \nmost wins with a single team. No other NBA coach in history has even \napproached 1,000 wins with one team. Jerry won 1,127 as coach of the \nJazz.\n  However, while Jerry has amassed an impressive pile of statistics, \nthat is not what he will be remembered for. For fans of the Jazz and, \nindeed, for basketball fans everywhere, Jerry Sloan was the \npersonification of old-fashioned values. As a longtime fan of the Jazz, \nI have always reveled in the fact that my favorite team has \ncontinuously been praised for its efficiency, discipline, and \nfundamentals. These have been the hallmarks of Utah Jazz basketball, \nand that is a direct reflection of Jerry Sloan. In an industry filled \nwith agents, bright lights, and endless promotion, Jerry Sloan's Jazz \nwere living proof that hard work and professionalism could trump market \nsize and national popularity. In many ways, I think Utahns see the Jazz \nas a reflection of their own values and aspirations, and that is due, \nin large part, to the character of Coach Sloan.\n  Jerry was never one to seek after accolades or personal attention \nduring his career. For him, basketball was a job, and he was a \nconsummate professional. He was brutally honest when\n\n[[Page S860]]\n\nnecessary and took responsibility when things didn't go the team's way. \nNo one ever heard an excuse from Jerry Sloan.\n  Mr. President, I have known Jerry Sloan for a number of years. Quite \nsimply, he is a class act. I think you have to spend some time in Utah \nto know just what Jerry Sloan has meant to our community. I want thank \nJerry for all he has done for the State of Utah, and I wish him and his \nfamily the best of luck in all their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/17/senate-section/article/S860-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING GUISEPPE GARIBALDI\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the American \ndream and honoring those who have not only embodied a pioneering \nspirit, but more specifically, one individual who inspired two nations \nthrough his passionate leadership, and through his dedication to family \nand pride in tradition.\n  Italian-American Guiseppe Garibaldi lived and fought for the dream of \ncreating his own destiny. All too often today we give little thought to \nthe freedom of deciding who we are, to deciding what we want to be even \nhow and where we raise a family and practice our faith. However, 150 \nyears ago, these decisions meant the world to Mr. Garibaldi.\n  Giuseppe Garibaldi was born in Nice, Italy, on July 4, 1807. In his \nearly twenties, Mr. Garibaldi continued his family's coastal trade \nbusiness and answered a call of duty to enlist in the military. At the \nage of 25, Garibaldi's budding leadership was recognized and he was \ncommissioned as a merchant marine captain.\n  Throughout Central and South America, he fought in independence \nstruggles leading the Italian Legion. His success earned him the title \n``Hero of Two Worlds'' from the people of Italy and Uruguay. Garibaldi \ncontinued to foster his passionate beliefs and soon after leaving South \nAmerica began learning English and applied for citizenship in America. \nHis request was granted and Garibaldi settled in New York among other \nnotable Italian minds of the time. Not only did he become a community \nleader for Italian Americans living in Staten Island, he encouraged \nfellow immigrants to work hard for their dreams and to create true \ncommunities with their neighbors, while still embracing family and \ntraditions from Italy.\n  After his time living in the United States, Garibaldi was called upon \nagain to be a military leader. He led the troops at Risorgimento that \nfought to unite a divided Italy and succeeded in their mission in 1861. \nThis man's great works and leadership helped shift Italy from a \ndynastic tyranny to a time of political self-determination.\n  Because of this extraordinary accomplishment, President Abraham \nLincoln offered Garibaldi a position as Major General of the Union \nArmy. Although Garibaldi declined the impressive commission, the 39th \nNew York Infantry was still known afterward as ``The Garibaldi \nGuard''--where Italian-Americans fought alongside fellow soldiers to \nprotect the America they loved.\n  Giuseppe Garibaldi was not just a soldier though. He was a husband, \nfather and an active free mason who believed that people should unite \nas brothers within a nation and as a global community. He encouraged \nfellow immigrants to persevere through hope and hard work and to be \nproud of their Italian roots.\n  As an Italian American, I am proud of my heritage and this is why \nyesterday I introduced a bill today to posthumously award the \nCongressional Gold Medal to Giuseppe Garibaldi for his life's passions \nand accomplishments.

Mr. President, I rise today to urge the Senate to quickly \npass a long-term extension of the Trade Adjustment Assistance, TAA, \nprogram for workers, as well as the Andean Trade Preference program. \nThese programs make our workforce more competitive in the global \nmarketplace and support jobs in North Carolina.\n  Both are critical Federal programs to North Carolina, and both \nexpired this past Saturday.\n  North Carolina's workforce has been particularly hard hit as \nmanufacturing has suffered, factories have closed, and companies have \nmoved operations overseas.\n  The TAA program for workers offers benefits, including job \nretraining, to workers displaced by imports or a shift of production to \nother countries. Once a laid-off worker has exhausted State \nunemployment benefits, he or she can qualify to receive supplemental \nbenefits under TAA.\n  These include weekly cash payments equal to unemployment benefits. To \nqualify, the worker must be involved in job retraining.\n  TAA payments can last for 52 weeks if a worker is in job training and \n26 weeks more if a worker needs remedial education.\n  Many North Carolinians who have lost their jobs through no fault of \ntheir own have turned to our network of affordable community colleges \nto retool their skills.\n  Yesterday, I met with trustees for the North Carolina Community \nCollege System, which is among the best in the Nation.\n  These leaders told me how valuable it is for these laid-off workers \nto get a community college education and gain the necessary skills to \nbe competitive in today's job market.\n  I agree wholeheartedly. Since coming to the Senate I have advocated \nto expand and enhance the TAA program for workers. In the American \nRecovery and Reinvestment Act, we significantly enhanced TAA programs \nby expanding eligibility and increasing the training funds available to \nStates by 160 percent, or $575 million per fiscal year.\n  Earlier this month, I was among a group of Senators who sent a letter \nto leaders in the House of Representatives asking that they quickly \nintroduce and pass a long-term extension of TAA, which is something \nthey did in a bipartisan way last December.\n  Since Congress expanded this crucial program, over 17,000 North \nCarolinians have been certified for assistance under TAA.\n  Last year, displaced workers in North Carolina received over $56 \nmillion through TAA--the second largest amount given to a single State \nto help workers develop new skills and find new jobs.\n  Though we are making progress in turning around our economy, that \ndoesn't mean much if you are one of the 430,000 North Carolinians still \nout of work.\n  One North Carolinian, Wayne Kizewski, is 42 years old and 2 years ago \nlost his job at a Cary company that molded plastic parts for Chrysler. \nWayne used the TAA program to go back to school at Wake Technical \nCommunity College to study information systems.\n  Wayne was also able to receive help from the TAA program to pay for \n80 percent of his health insurance premiums, including coverage for his \n5-year-old son.\n  I hear from business owners all the time who tell me that workers in \nNorth Carolina have a work ethic that is second to none. When these men \nand women lose their jobs through no fault of their own they are \ndetermined to continue providing for their families, and this program \nallows them to go back to school and retool their skills for the 21st-\ncentury economy.\n  With our State's excellent community colleges, we can get our \nworkforce prepared to lead the way in emerging industries.\n  The TAA program for workers is essential to maintaining our Nation's \nglobal competitiveness and supporting workers in North Carolina and \nacross the country.\n  I would also like to address the Andean Trade Preference program.\n  I know my colleagues from Arizona and Ohio were on the floor earlier \ndiscussing both TAA and the Andean Trade Preference program.\n  I know that extending this program is important to my friends on the \nother side of the aisle. It is important to me too as this program has \nan impact on jobs in North Carolina.\n\n[[Page S861]]\n\n  For example, one of the products eligible for preferential treatment \nunder this agreement is apparel made of U.S. combed-cotton yarn, much \nof which is made by workers in North Carolina.\n  In fact, one North Carolina company, Parkdale Mills, exports 1 \nmillion pounds of cotton yarn annually that is valued at $2 million.\n  These exports support more than 100 jobs in North Carolina.\n  Earlier this week I received a letter from the CEO of Parkdale Mills. \nHe wrote, ``a lapse of duty free benefits, even if a short period of \ntime, is catastrophic to our business.''\n  Over the last 4 years, the Andean program has been extended or \nrenewed three different times, often at the last minute.\n  American firms doing business in the Andean region do not know from \nyear to year whether they will pay duties or not. That is no way to run \na business.\n  So I agree with my colleague, the senior Senator for Arizona, that a \nlong-term extension of this program is important.\n  I believe we should be able to extend both of these programs, TAA and \nATPA, together. I know that my colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator \nCasey, made a number of unanimous consent requests last week to do just \nthat. The bill that Senator Brown asked consent to pass earlier would \nprovide an 18 month extension of both programs.\n  Mr. President, these programs have bipartisan support. Workers and \nbusinesses need the certainty and support they provide. We should \nextend them as soon as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/17/senate-section/article/S861-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               150TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DAKOTA TERRITORY\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the formation of \nthe Dakota Territory. It was on February 26, 1861, that the Senate \npassed the legislation creating the territory. In the year of the 150th \nanniversary, I would like to honor the dedication of those who made \nthis status a reality.\n  Dr. J.M. Staples of Dubuque, IA, paved the way to develop the Dakota \nregion, leading the new settlers to desire territorial status.\n  When Minnesota became a State on May 23, 1857, the Dakota area was \nleft without a form of government. Therefore, the settlers \nunprecedentedly created a provisional government in October of 1858, \nincluding electing Henry Masters as Governor and in the autumn of 1859 \nnominating the Honorable J.P. Kidder as delegate to Congress.\n  Congress continued to thwart desired territorial status as U.S. \nSenator Fitch in December 1858, Senator James I. Green on January 29, \n1859, and House Representative Alexander II Stevens on February 4, \n1859, assertively introduced bills, all of which failed.\n  Senator Green would not be deterred and continued to push for the \ncreation of the territory, introducing another bill on February 14, \n1861. His persistence resulted in the passage of the act. This bill \nsuccessfully passed in the Senate on February 26, the House on March 1, \nand President James Buchanan signed it into law less than 48 hours \nbefore his term ended on March 2.\n  After taking office, President Abraham Lincoln had the honor of \nappointing the first Governor to the territory, Dr. William Jayne of \nSpringfield, IL, a personal friend of his. General J.B.S. Todd, a \nrelative of Mrs. Lincoln, became the first officially recognized \nterritorial delegate to Congress.\n  I would like to posthumously recognize the efforts of those who \nworked to secure the designation of the Dakota Territory. For it is \nthrough their labor that eventually on November 2, 1889, the Dakota \nTerritory became, in part, the State of South Dakota of which I am \nproud to be a citizen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/17/senate-section/article/S861-2", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      SPECIAL AGENT JAIME J. ZAPATA AND SPECIAL AGENT VICTOR AVILA\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, as chairman of the Senate Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs, I rise to express my \ndeepest sorrow about a tragic attack on American law enforcement that \nhappened earlier this week in Mexico.\n  On Tuesday afternoon, two agents from U.S. Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement were attacked by unknown individuals while driving between \nMexico City and Monterrey, Mexico. Today, I honor the incredible \nsacrifice of Special Agent Jaime J. Zapata, who lost his life in \nservice of our country, and Special Agent Victor Avila, who is \nrecovering from injuries from the shooting.\n  Special Agent Zapata joined ICE in 2006. He joined one of ICE's \noffices in Laredo, TX, where he served on the Human Smuggling and \nTrafficking Unit, as well as the Border Enforcement Security Task \nForce. He was most recently detailed to ICE's Attache office in Mexico \nCity. He began his Federal law enforcement career with the Department \nof Homeland Security as a member of the U.S. Border Patrol in Yuma, AZ. \nA native of Brownsville, TX, Special Agent Zapata graduated from the \nUniversity of Texas at Brownsville in 2005 with a bachelor of science \nin criminal justice.\n  My thoughts and prayers are with Special Agent Avila as he recovers.\n  These two brave agents gave their all to shield others from harm. \nThey worked tirelessly against dangerous criminal elements. They \nbravely took dangerous assignments, ultimately making a profound \nsacrifice.\n  They were two of the hundreds of ICE personnel around the globe. \nHonorable agents like these two individuals collaborate with their \ncounterparts in joint efforts to dismantle transnational criminal \norganizations. Agents like them give their all day in and day out on \nfighting money laundering, contraband smuggling, weapons proliferation, \nforced child labor, human rights violations, intellectual property \nviolations, child exploitation, and human smuggling and trafficking.\n  An incident like this serves to remind us all as a nation how \ngrateful we are for the sacrifices made by these brave men and women \nevery day. The work they do serves to make the public safe and protect \nthe Nation's security.\n  I have been in contact with law enforcement, and I know that they are \nworking closely with the authorities in Mexico to ensure that the \nperpetrators of this horrible attack on American law enforcement are \nbrought to justice as quickly as possible.\n  In the meantime, I offer my deepest condolences to the family of \nSpecial Agent Zapata. He died for a just cause and will forever be \nremembered as a man of courage and honor.\n  And a message for Special Agent Avila. I think I speak for a nation \nwhen I say that I hope, and pray, for your recovery. Words cannot \nexpress our thanks for your service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/17/senate-section/article/S861-3", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S861-S862]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HONORING THE USS ``MOUNT HOOD'' (AE-11)\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, on August 21, 1944, laden with \nprecious cargo for the Pacific theatre, the USS Mount Hood, the lead \nship of her class for the U.S. Navy, departed Norfolk on her first \nmission. On board were 296 sailors and 22 officers.\n  The USS Mount Hood reached Manus Island, a province of Papua, New \nGuinea, on September 22 and commenced with dispensing ammunition and \nexplosives to ships preparing for the Philippine offensive. On the \nmorning of November 10, 1944, a young Naval Reserve lieutenant and 17 \nenlisted men climbed over the side of the USS Mount Hood and boarded \nboats to go ashore. After reaching the beach, they saw an enormous \nflash followed by two explosions, and the men were knocked to the \nground. They scrambled back to the boats and headed to where the Mount \nHood had been anchored, but found only debris where the ship had once \nbeen. The entire ship, and all aboard, were gone.\n  Over 400,000 Americans lost their lives in World War II. In the \ndeserts of North Africa, the jungles of the Pacific islands, on the \nbeaches in Normandy, and everywhere in between, these brave men and \nwomen sacrificed their lives to preserve the freedom and individual \nliberties we all enjoy. We owe them all an immense debt of gratitude \nfor the sacrifices they made to defend our Nation. They should never be \nforgotten.\n  The only surviving officer of the USS Mount Hood, LT Lester Wallace, \nis now 95 years old and resides in Pensacola, FL. While we mourn those \nwho gave their lives to the cause of freedom, we must also remember to \ncelebrate the service and sacrifice of those who survived. I am \nextremely proud of the\n\n[[Page S862]]\n\nservice Lieutenant Wallace rendered to our country as a Navy officer, \nand later as a civilian. On behalf of the people of Florida and our \nNation, I thank Lieutenant Wallace--and all those who have served and \ncontinue to serve--for their sacrifice and service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/17/senate-section/article/S862-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S862]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO MAJOR GENERAL GREGORY L. WAYT\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, today I recognize the distinguished \nmilitary service of MG General Gregory L. Wayt who recently retired \nfrom military service after nearly four decades of preserving our \nNation's safety and security.\n  A strong leader with an unyielding call to service and duty to State \nand Nation, Major General Wayt embodies the character, discipline, and \nhumility that rank him among Ohio's great adjutant generals.\n  For more than 6 years as the Adjutant General of Ohio, he commanded \nfive brigade-size Army units with more than 11,000 troops and four \nflying wings and seven nonflying units from Ohio's Air Guard with more \nthan 5,000 additional troops.\n  During some of the Guard's most challenging times, Major General \nWayt's leadership ensured the preparedness of the more than 18,000 Ohio \nNational Guardmembers who served in Iraq and Afghanistan during his \ntenure, as well as those preparing for overseas contingency operations.\n  His command also meant Ohio Guardmembers were first on the ground for \nState emergencies and disasters including flood and winter storm relief \nfrom Toledo to Belmont, and in the relief efforts on the gulf coast \nfollowing hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 and Gustav and Ike in \n2008. The Ohio National Guard also had the first C-130 cargo plane on \nthe ground providing critical relief after the Haitian earthquake in \n2010.\n  Under his day-to-day management of the Ohio National Guard--from \nensuring the readiness of Guardmembers and weapon systems to the \nsecuring fiscal and property resources--Major General Wayt ensured Ohio \nremained at the top of readiness ranks for our country's National \nGuards.\n  Maintaining one of the Nation's premier National Guards also required \nMajor General Wayt's professionalism to maintain the relationship \nbetween our military command and civilian leaders. Throughout his \nservice as the Adjutant General of Ohio, he was a trusted national \nsecurity advisor for two Governors from both parties. He was a valuable \nresource for all members of the Ohio congressional delegation--always \njust a phone call away to provide his counsel and recommendations.\n  As a result of his tireless leadership, Major General Wayt helped \nsave two Air National Guard bases in Ohio and the communities that rely \nupon them. The Springfield and Mansfield Air National Guard Bases \nremain critical to our national security and to their local economies \nbecause of Major General Wayt's fierce loyalty to those he represents \nand leads under his command.\n  He also prioritized the retention of talented officers to ensure the \norganization developed qualified servicemembers for senior leadership \npositions. One of the ways Major General Wayt accomplished this was by \nimproving the retirement benefits available to Guardmembers.\n  Because of his input and that of other Guard leaders, the National \nGuard and Reserve Retirement Parity Act was signed into law by \nPresident Obama to restore parity in retirement benefits. This bill is \nlaw because Major General Wayt understood that talented Guardmembers \nshould have the resources and benefits deserving of their sacrifice.\n  He also understood the importance of international collaboration and \ncoordination. He continued the success of the State Partnership Program \nwith Hungary and Serbia, which was created to link National Guard \nStates and territories with partner countries to foster long-term \nrelationships across all levels of society and to establish the \nimportance of the rule of law in nations seeking the highest democratic \nvalues and ideals.\n  As a leader of Ohio's citizen-soldiers and citizen-Airmen--war \nfighters, peacekeepers, and guardians of America's ideals of democracy \nand freedom--Major General Wayt received the admiration of his peers as \nPresident of the Adjutants General Association of the United States.\n  Yet regardless of medals earned and awards received, this great son \nof Ohio remained grounded in a classic Midwestern work ethic. From his \nearly education in Columbus public schools and Columbus Northland High \nSchool to formative years at the Ohio State University as an ROTC \nstudent to the University of Dayton, Army Command and General Staff \nCollege, and Army War College as a graduate student and senior \ncommander--Greg Wayt symbolizes a dedication to service and sacrifice, \nand to State and country that deserves a heartfelt thanks from all \nOhioans.\n  But he would be the first to tell you that any professional \naccomplishment was made possible only by the personal sacrifice of his \nwife Deborah and daughter Lindsey. The sacrifices of military families \ndeserve our Nation's highest praise--my deepest thank you to Deborah \nand Lindsey and the Wayt family for sharing their husband, father, and \npatriarch with a grateful State and Nation.\n  For all the achievements throughout his career, Major General Wayt \nwill always be first and foremost a field commander and remembered by \nhis troops as one of their own. Congratulations, MG Gregory L. Wayt for \n35 years of service to your Nation.\n  On behalf of a grateful State, I thank you and wish you well upon \nyour retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/17/senate-section/article/S862-2", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S862-S863]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO AMBASSADOR RAYMOND L. FLYNN\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, today I rise to honor \nAmbassador Raymond L. Flynn in recognition of the retirement of his \nbasketball jersey at his alma mater, Providence College. On Saturday \nnight, the Friars will pay tribute to Ambassador Flynn, a 1963 graduate \nof the college. Ambassador Flynn is one of the greatest backcourt \nplayers in the storied history of the Providence College basketball \nprogram. Over his 82-game career, the Ambassador scored 1,025 points. \nPrior to the Friars' game against the Cincinnati Bearcats at the \nDunkin' Donuts Center on Saturday, the college will unveil a banner \nbearing Ambassador Flynn's No. 14 jersey hanging from the rafters.\n  A longtime South Boston resident, Ambassador Flynn compiled an \nimpressive list of achievements during his time as a Providence Friar, \nincluding two National Invitation Tournament championships in 1961 and \n1963. He earned the Most Valuable Player award for his performance in \nthe 1963 tournament. During his junior season, Ambassador Flynn \naveraged 12.8 points per game and received All-East honors. A skilled \noutside shooter, the Ambassador increased his average to 18.9 points \nper game during his senior year, meriting his second All-East \ndistinction, an All-New England award, and Academic All-America honors. \nFollowing his graduation, the Ambassador very nearly joined his \nhometown team, the Boston Celtics.\n  Following his noteworthy accomplishments as a collegiate student-\nathlete, Ambassador Flynn embarked upon a distinguished political \ncareer. In 1971, the Ambassador won a seat to represent his South \nBoston community as a member of the Massachusetts House of \nRepresentatives and served at the State house until 1979. Ambassador \nFlynn subsequently served South Boston as a member of the Boston City \nCouncil. After 4 years as a city councilor, Ambassador Flynn ran \nsuccessfully to become mayor of Boston in 1983. He won reelection in \n1987 and 1991. In a 2001 interview, Ambassador Flynn lightheartedly \nremarked, ``As a young kid growing up on the streets of South Boston, \neverybody wanted to be President of the United States or Mayor of \nBoston.''\n  Part way through the Ambassador's third term as mayor of Boston, \nPresident Bill Clinton called on him to serve as Ambassador to the Holy \nSee. Ambassador Flynn embraced the opportunity to represent the United \nStates at the Vatican. By the time he left this post in 1997, \nAmbassador Flynn had cultivated a close working relationship with Pope \nJohn Paul II, whom he had\n\n[[Page S863]]\n\nfirst met in 1969 during his State representative campaign. The \nAmbassador's friendship with Pope John Paul II led him to author two \nbooks: ``The Accidental Pope,'' a novel cowritten with Robin Moore, and \na memoir titled ``Pope John Paul II: A Personal Portrait of the Pope \nand the Man.''\n  Today, I am proud to salute Ambassador Raymond L. Flynn's \naccomplishments as a collegiate student-athlete in addition to his \nachievements as a public servant, diplomat, and devoted husband and \nfather. I am also proud to call him my friend. When Ambassador Flynn \nsees his jersey hanging high above the court for the first time on \nSaturday night, I am sure the crowd will give this accomplished son of \nMassachusetts a standing ovation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/17/senate-section/article/S863-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S863]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO RACHEL BAILEY\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, every day in the Senate we owe an \nenormous amount of gratitude to our staff and to the staff here on the \nfloor which work long hours--often behind the scenes and away from the \nheadlines--to make possible the smooth functioning of this institution.\n  Today I would like to offer particular gratitude for one of the \nSenate pages who was among the youngest members of that extraordinary \nand unheralded team--a page I was privileged to sponsor here, 16-year-\nold Rachel Bailey from Glendale, MD.\n  Rachel found herself serving as a page during last year's lameduck \nsession--one of a pair of the only Senate pages, in fact, on hand \nduring that historically busy period.\n  As we know, typically, the Senate has 30 pages working at any given \ntime. And with 100 Senators, the pace can get pretty hectic.\n  So imagine how hectic it became for Rachel when the rest of her page \nclass went home for the holidays, leaving her and one fellow page to \nhandle all the page duties in what proved to be an extremely productive \nand busy session.\n  Together they handled it all with a smile, carrying the workload of \n30 pages and never missing a beat, even though it meant no days off and \nworking up to 14 hours each day. And Rachel did so in a manner that was \ncalm, professional and bipartisan, working with both the Democratic and \nRepublican cloakrooms.\n  Pages play an important role in the daily operation of the Senate. \nThey deliver correspondence and legislative material throughout the \nCapitol. They take messages for Senators or call them to the phone. \nThey prepare the Chamber for Senate sessions, and they carry bills and \namendments to the desk. All of this is in addition to their regular \nschool work.\n  But as demanding as it is, being a page also gives a student a rare \nopportunity to learn about--and contribute--to the legislative branch \nof our government and to witness firsthand the debates in the U.S. \nSenate, often described as the ``greatest deliberative body in the \nworld.'' And in the lameduck session, Rachel had an up close look at a \nflurry of major legislation, including the Senate's bipartisan \nratification of the New START Treaty, a long-sought arms reduction \nagreement with Russia.\n  Serving as a page has inspired numerous young Americans to pursue \ncareers in public service, even in politics and in the Senate. My \nfriend Chris Dodd, who just retired after more than three decades in \nCongress, once served as a Senate page. So did one of my current \ncolleagues, Mark Pryor of Arkansas. So perhaps someday we will see \nRachel in the Senate again, in some role other than page.\n  But in the meantime, let me thank Rachel's parents, Susan and Karl, \nfor sharing her with the Senate during the Christmas holiday, and \nsustaining her in her first foray in public service--and please also \nallow me to thank Rachel for her extra special efforts and to express \nmy admiration for the way she conducted herself throughout our lameduck \nsession. She has set the bar high for herself--and for all the Senate \npages who will follow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/17/senate-section/article/S863-2", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S863-S864]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DAVID M. PITTENGER\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today, I honor the career and \ncontributions of David M. Pittenger, who is retiring after 30 years \nwith the National Aquarium, 15 years as executive director. Dave joined \nthe National Aquarium as director of education in 1979 and implemented \naward-winning conservation education programs in Baltimore City public \nschools 2 years before the aquarium officially opened its doors in \n1981. Now, each year, 70,000 Maryland schoolchildren, on average, visit \nthe National Aquarium for free as part of their curriculum and Aquarium \neducators give curriculum training to more than 1,000 teachers.\n  Through programs that are onsite, in schools and hands-on in the \nfield, the National Aquarium engages children of all ages in raising \nyoung terrapins and releasing them into the Bay, taking water and soil \nsamples, growing plants, and going on nature hikes. Children paddle \ncanoes and kayaks, wade in creeks, count birds in wetlands, snorkel in \nFlorida coral reefs, and patrol sea turtle nesting areas in Georgia. \nFor some children, these programs offer their first encounter with an \nenvironment outside their neighborhood.\n  During Dave Pittenger's tenure as director, the National Aquarium has \nexpanded its footprint in Baltimore's Inner Harbor to three buildings, \nadding an engaging dolphin amphitheater and the award-winning Australia \nexhibit. The aquarium has also moved beyond its Inner Harbor location, \nacquiring 12.5 acres of once-contaminated waterfront land in South \nBaltimore and remediating this ``brownfield'' to make way for a \npublicly accessible waterfront park.\n  Dave has fostered Baltimore's alliance with the National Aquarium in \nWashington, DC, creating a venue that now showcases 70 exhibits \nfeaturing America's Aquatic Treasures, highlighting the animals and \nhabitats of freshwater ecosystems in the United States and other \nconservation hot spots through the National Marine Sanctuaries Program. \nUnder Dave's leadership, however, the National Aquarium has taken on a \nrole greater than its exhibits. He is committed to using the National \nAquarium as a stage to educate parents and their children about the \nimportance of aquatic conservation. Dave's priorities of conservation \nand education are firmly rooted in the conviction that zoos and \naquariums have both the capacity and the responsibility to increase \npublic awareness of environmental issues and to implement conservation \naction programs.\n  Dave has provided the leadership to make the National Aquarium a true \nconservation organization with programs around the Chesapeake Bay and \nthe world that restore habitats, rebuild tidal wetlands, strengthen \neroding shorelines, reestablish islands, rehabilitate endangered sea \nturtles, and research lionfish and coral reefs. When the BP oilspill \noccurred, for instance, scientists from the National Aquarium were \navailable to provide expertise to government and conservation officials \ntrying to ameliorate the damage to the ecosystem in the Gulf of Mexico, \nwork they continue today.\n  In 2010, building on the aquarium's strong legacy of service to the \nenvironment, the National Aquarium Conservation Center was established \nto research aquatic species and environments and provide advocacy and \nprograms that tackle pressing conservation issues that affect the \naquatic environment.\n  Under Dave's leadership, the National Aquarium has been an economic \nengine for the city of Baltimore and the State of Maryland, welcoming \nsome 1.5 million visitors annually. The National Aquarium is a world-\nclass entertainment attraction and Maryland's No. 1 tourist attraction. \nThe aquarium generates millions in tax dollars and tourism revenue \nwhile employing more than 450 staff and engaging local businesses to \nsupport its operations.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Dave Pittenger for his \nsteadfast contributions to our aquatic environment in Maryland and \nthroughout the Nation and the world. The foundation he has laid will \nproduce benefits for all of us as we continue to work to educate and \nadvocate for clean water and a clean environment for all the \ninhabitants of this Earth.\n\n[[Page S864]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/17/senate-section/article/S864-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S864]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n        LAUNCH OF FIRST RADIOLOGIC-PATHOLOGY CORRELATION COURSE\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \nlaunch of the first Radiologic-Pathology Correlation Course presented \nby the American Institute for Radiologic Pathology, AIRP, at its new \nSilver Spring, MD, venue. The American College of Radiology created the \nAIRP to allow radiology resident training to move forward uninterrupted \nby the Defense Department's closure of the Armed Forces Institute of \nPathology, AFIP, as part of the Base Realignment and Closure Commission \nplan. The launch of the AIRP provides an excellent example of the \nprivate sector stepping up to help ameliorate the impact that BRAC \nchanges can have on a community.\n  I am especially pleased that AIRP chose to locate in the newly \nrevitalized historic American Film Institute Silver Theatre and \nCultural Center, approximately 2 miles from the former AFIP site. The \nAFI Silver Theatre is a state-of-the-art education and cultural center \nanchored by the restoration of noted architect John Eberson's historic \n1938 Silver Theatre. Once slated for the wrecker's ball, AFI was saved \nthrough the efforts of the local community and reopened in 2003. Its \nrevitalization represents a unique public-private partnership between \nMontgomery County, MD, and the American Film Institute.\n  The launch of the AIRP at the AFI Silver Theatre and Cultural Center \ndemonstrates the role the theatre is playing as a major anchor of a \nredevelopment effort in Montgomery County. Approximately 2,000 \nphysicians annually from around the world are expected to convene in \nSilver Spring for 4 weeks at a time to participate in AIRP. With \ncourses developed and presented by world-renowned faculty from the most \nprestigious radiology programs in the country, AIRP will further \ncontribute to Montgomery County's reputation as a leader in medical \nresearch and education. I applaud the launch of the AIRP, and I look \nforward to a long and mutually beneficial relationship between AIRP and \nthe Montgomery County community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/17/senate-section/article/S864-2", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S864]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO ROBERT A. DENNIS\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to \nrecognize the retirement this week of Robert A. Dennis, CBO's Assistant \nDirector for Macroeconomic Analysis. Mr. Dennis is retiring after more \nthan 30 years of service at CBO.\n  He began his career at CBO in 1979, working as a Principal Analyst in \nCBO's Macroeconomic Division. He was promoted to the position of Deputy \nAssistant Director of the Division in 1988 and then to the position of \nAssistant Director of the Division in 1992, where he has served since.\n  As the head of CBO's Macroeconomic Analysis Division, Mr. Dennis has \nbeen one of the leading economists at CBO and has helped drive the \nagency's outstanding work. His skills as an economist have been \nhighlighted in the diverse issues he has worked on while at CBO, \nranging from macroeconomic effects of tax policy, to the impact of flu \nepidemics and terrorist disruptions at U.S. ports.\n  Mr. Dennis has also played a critical role at CBO by developing many \nof the procedures the Macroeconomic Analysis Division has used to \nprepare its economic forecasts. He even wrote the computer software \nthat the division used for many years to analyze current economic \ndevelopments and prepare charts for CBO publications.\n  Mr. Dennis's excellent work has been recognized throughout his \ncareer. In the 1980s, as a principal analyst, he received a CBO \nDirector's Award for outstanding performance. And he has since received \na number of awards recognizing his outstanding management at CBO.\n  Mr. Dennis has exemplified CBO's high standard of professionalism, \nobjectivity, and nonpartisanship. He has worked tirelessly to ensure \nCongress was given accurate and timely information on the key policy \nissues of the day.\n  I thank Robert Dennis and commend him for his many years of \ndedicated, faithful, and outstanding service to CBO, to Congress, and \nto the American people. I wish him all the best in his well-deserved \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/17/senate-section/article/S864-3", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S864]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING CLIFFORD R. PHILLIPS\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to take a few \nminutes to offer a tribute to Clifford R. Phillips. He passed away on \nDecember 3, 2010, at his home in Surprise, AZ. He was an Alaskan \nfishing legend and a true hero who fought bravely in the European \nTheater during World War II.\n  Cliff was born on December 7, 1919, on the west coast of Vancouver \nIsland. His parents, who had originally been involved in the fishing \nindustry in England, had immigrated to British Columbia where they \nmanaged a herring saltery. They later moved to Ketchikan where he \nwould, as a very young man, begin his career in Alaskan fisheries. This \nwas the age of ``mild cure'' salmon, and starting at the age of seven \nCliff began learning the family business and the importance of \nproducing a high quality product. He continued to work with his father \nin the family business through the 1930s.\n  After seeing the devastation and heartache of the beginning of World \nWar II, Cliff joined the Alaska National Guard. He trained at Chilkoot \nBarracks in Haines, AK, and was assigned to duties in the Aleutian \nIslands. He was one of the first to fly into the new military airfield \nbuilt in the Pribilof Islands, which is located nearly 500 miles off \nthe Siberian coast. The rugged winter saw the Islands iced in. The base \ndid not receive supplies by ship for some 9 months, but Cliff and his \ncomrades held their ground.\n  In September 1944, he transferred to the European Theater and joined \nthe Third Army. He participated in the landing at Normandy, and his \nunit later helped to repel the German offensive in ``The Battle of the \nBulge.'' Cliff managed to make it through combat unscathed, and his \ndistinguished service led to his being awarded the Silver Star.\n  Upon discharge after World War II, Cliff felt the urge to return to \nAlaska and to his family heritage in the fishing industry. He naturally \ngravitated back to Ketchikan in southeast Alaska so that he could work \nin the waters he knew best.\n  In 1950, the Phillips father-son duo built the E.C. Phillips cold \nstorage plant on Tongass Narrows in Ketchikan. Cliff and his father \nexcelled at increasing capacity, efficiency, and quality. As time went \nby, the E.C. Phillips product became known for its high quality around \nthe world, and today it is still known as a premier quality product.\n  After the death of his father, Cliff took charge, but he was no desk \nbound executive, and standard working hours did not apply to him. \nDuring the fishing season he could always be found in the processing \narea of his plant inspecting the fish and supervising operations. Cliff \nsold his product by phone and fax from his Alaskan office to the entire \nUnited States and around the world. But nothing left the plant until he \nwas satisfied that the fish met the E.C. Phillips quality standard.\n  Before there was an Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute, Cliff was \nAlaska's ambassador for seafood, and he traveled far and wide promoting \nAlaskan seafood products. Cliff remained active in the business well \ninto his eighties, but even after he retired from daily operations and \nmoved to Arizona he maintained frequent contact with the plant and his \nmany friends and customers.\n  Everyone found Cliff to be a charming man, eloquent and persuasive, \nbut first and foremost he saw it as his mission to insist on high \nquality for all products which carried the E.C. Phillips brand name. I \nextend my sincerest condolences to his wife Dixie and his family \nmembers. We have all lost a friend, and Alaska's seafood industry has \nlost a great champion. May he rest in peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/17/senate-section/article/S864-4", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S864-S865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REMEMBERING NEVA EGAN\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I honor the passing of the \ninitial first lady of Alaska, Neva Egan. Desdia Neva McKittrick Egan \nwas born in Wilson, KS, on October 3, 1914. The articulate, \neffervescent Alaskan served on hospital boards, school boards, worked \ndiligently on community commitments, and continued to attend morning \nmeetings of the Commonwealth\n\n[[Page S865]]\n\nClub in Anchorage for years. Although she was quick to downplay her \nrole in Alaskan history, she had a key position as first lady. Neva \nalso accompanied her husband to Washington, DC, for 19 months during \nthe period when Alaska was being considered for statehood.\n  In DC it was a time of adjustment, traffic, ``hot weather'' and big-\ncity living for the girl from small-town Kansas. After her husband, \nWilliam A. Egan, was elected as Alaska's first Governor, she took great \npride in supporting him, as well as all the Alaskan legislators and \ntheir families. She was known to invite legislator's children to the \nGovernor's Mansion while living in Juneau during session. Although, \nNeva rarely spoke publicly about politics, she was the firm shoulder on \nwhich many legislators leaned. She was a strong woman that worked hard \nto care for others behind the scenes when it mattered most.\n  Neva was the third in a family of four girls and one boy. She \ngraduated from high school in the midst of the Great Depression in 1932 \nand then worked for a year in her father's grocery store. After a year, \nshe decided to continue her education and attended Kansas State \nCollege, but soon transferred to be closer to her sister and aunt at \nthe University of Wyoming. Quickly, she was recruited to teach in \nGlenrock, WY, for the ``fabulous'' salary of $1,000 a year, while her \nfriends were making $25 a month. Her musical background and teaching \ncareer led her to Valdez, where she expected to only stay a year and \nwas told the town was ``a little rough.'' Shortly after she arrived, \none of the few local guys with a car, a quiet man, who read the \nCongressional Record for fun in junior high school, expressed interest \nin Neva. Apparently, the first date was disastrous, but friends recall \n``love at first sight.''\n  William and Neva Egan were married on November 16, 1940, in Valdez. \nIt was the same month that William was elected to the Alaska \nTerritorial House of Representatives from the Third Judicial Division \nthat started his drive into Alaskan political history. As a \nRepresentative, an advocate pushing for statehood in DC, a Governor, \nand as a family man, there was never any question as to whom William \ncould look to for support. Neva was the rock that held up her family. \nWhile overseeing issues, her son, Dennis Egan who was born in 1947, \nonce asked if since Neva is the first lady is he ``the first kid?'' \nWell, that ``first kid'' grew up to be a Juneau radio personality, the \nformer mayor of Juneau, and now a State senator.\n  Neva was known to start the legislative session with buffet \nreceptions for all the Senators and Representatives and their spouses. \nShe was consistently the rock that others leaned upon; ironing shirts, \nmaking beds, and taking the initiative to perform any needed repairs on \nthe Governor's Mansion.\n  Neva Egan worked hard every day and that resulted in a lifetime of \ncontributions to Alaska. Neva is survived by her son Dennis and \ndaughter-in-law Linda; her granddaughters and their husbands, Jill Egan \nand Sandy Vergano and Leslie Egan and Tyler Malstrom; and brother \nRichard McKittrick. Neva was preceded in death by her husband William \nEgan, daughter Elin Carol Egan, and sisters Helen Spiegelberg, Margaret \nMcKittrick and Josephine Trowbridge. I extend my sympathies to the Egan \nfamily and feel blessed to come from the same state where she made such \na difference. May she rest in peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/17/senate-section/article/S865-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/17/senate-section/article/S865-2", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/17/senate-section/article/S865-3", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:00 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 514) extending \nexpiring provisions of the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization \nAct of 2005 and Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of \n2004 relating to access to business records, individual terrorists as \nagents of foreign powers, and roving wiretaps until December 8, 2011.\n  The message also announced that pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 4355(a), and \nthe order of the House of January 5, 2011, the Speaker appoints the \nfollowing Member of the House of Representatives to the Board of \nVisitors to the United States Military Academy: Mr. Shimkus of \nIllinois.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/17/senate-section/article/S865-4", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MEASURE HELD AT THE DESK\n\n  The following measure was ordered held at the desk, by unanimous \nconsent:\n\n       S. 223.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \neliminate\n\n[[Page S873]]\n\nthe 190-day lifetime limit on inpatient psychiatric hospital services \nunder the Medicare program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, our country has recently taken great steps \nforward to support the principles of mental health parity. In 2008, \nCongress has enacted two important pieces of legislation to end \ndiscrimination against people suffering from mental illnesses.\n  Congress passed the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health \nParity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008, MHPAEA, to prohibit the \nestablishment of discriminatory benefit caps or cost-sharing \nrequirements for mental health and substance use disorders. That same \nyear Congress also passed the Medicare Improvements for Patients and \nProtections Act, MIPPA, which included legislation introduced by \nSenator Snowe and myself, the Medicare Mental Health Copayment Equity \nAct. This legislation prevented Medicare beneficiaries from being \ncharged higher copayments for outpatient mental health services than \nfor all other outpatient physician services.\n  Unfortunately, even with the passage of MIPPA, a serious mental \nhealth inequity remains in Medicare. Medicare beneficiaries are \ncurrently limited to only 190 days of inpatient psychiatric hospital \ncare in their lifetime. This lifetime limit directly impacts Medicare \nbeneficiaries' access to psychiatric hospitals, although it does not \napply to psychiatric units in general hospitals. This arbitrary cap on \nbenefits is discriminatory to the mentally ill as there is no such \nlifetime limit for any other Medicare specialty inpatient hospital \nservice. The 190-day lifetime limit is problematic for patients being \ntreated in psychiatric hospitals as they may easily exceed the 190 days \nif they have a chronic mental illness.\n  That is why Senator Snowe and I are working together once again to \naddress the last remaining mental health parity issue in Medicare. \nToday, we are introducing the Medicare Mental Health Inpatient Equity \nAct. Our legislation would eliminate the Medicare 190-day lifetime \nlimit for inpatient psychiatric hospital care. It would equalize \nMedicare mental health coverage with private health insurance coverage, \nexpand beneficiary choice of inpatient psychiatric care providers, \nincrease access for the seriously ill, and improve continuity of care.\n  This legislation is supported by eighty national organizations that \nrepresent hospital associations, seniors' organizations, disability \norganizations, and the mental health community. I would like to thank a \nnumber of organizations who have been integral to the development of \nthe Medicare Mental Health Inpatient Equity Act and who have endorsed \nour legislation today, including the AARP, the American Hospital \nAssociation, the National Association of Psychiatric Health Systems, \nand the American Psychological Association.\n  Congress has now acted to address mental health parity issues for \ngroup health plans and for outpatient Medicare services. It's time to \nend this outmoded law and ensure that beneficiaries with mental \nillnesses have access to a range of appropriate settings for their \ncare. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to \nachieve mental health parity in Medicare.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARDIN (for himself and Ms. Mikulski):\n  S. 377. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to conduct \na special resource study of President Station in Baltimore, Maryland, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce the \nPresident Street Station Study Act. President Street Station, located \nin my hometown of Baltimore, played a crucial role in the Civil War, \nthe Underground Railroad, the growth of Baltimore's railroad industry, \nand is a historically significant landmark to the Lincoln presidency.\n  The station was constructed for the Philadelphia, Wilmington, and \nBaltimore, PW, Railroad in 1849 and remains the oldest surviving big \ncity railroad terminal in the United States. This historical structure \nis a unique architectural gem, arguably the first example and last \nsurvivor of the early barrel-vault train shed arches, also known as the \nHowe Truss. The arch-rib design became the blueprint for railroad \nbridges and roofs well into the 20th century and was replicated for \nevery similarly designed train shed and roof for the next 20 years.\n  The growth of President Street Station and the PW railroad mirror \nthe expansion of the railroad industry throughout the country in the \nlatter half of the 19th century. This station played an essential role \nin making Baltimore the first railroad and sea-rail link in the nation \nand helped the city become the international port hub it remains to \nthis day.\n  In its heyday, President Street Station was the key link connecting \nWashington DC and with the northeast states. Hundreds of passengers \ntraveling north passed through this station and, by the start of the \nCivil War, Baltimore had become our nation's major southern railroad \nhub. Not surprisingly, the station played a critical role in both the \nCivil War and the Underground Railroad.\n  Perhaps its most famous passenger was Abraham Lincoln, who traveled \nthrough the station at least four times, including secretly on his way \nto his first inauguration. In 1861, President-elect Lincoln was warned \nby a PW private detective of a possible assassination plot in \nBaltimore as he transferred trains. While it is unclear if this plot \nexisted and posed a serious threat, Lincoln nevertheless was secretly \nsmuggled aboard a train in the dead of night to complete his trip to \nWashington.\n  Just a few months later, President Street Station served as a \nbackdrop for what many historians claim was the first bloodshed of the \nCivil War. The Baltimore Riot of 1861 occurred when Lincoln called for \nUnion volunteers to quell the rebellion at Fort Sumter in Charleston. \nOn April 19, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania volunteers were met and \nattacked by a mob of secessionist and Confederate sympathizers. The \nbloody confrontation left four dead and thirty-six wounded. As the war \ncontinued, the Station remained a critical link for the Union. Troops \nand supplies from the north were regularly shuttled through the station \nto support Union soldiers.\n  It is well known that Maryland was a common starting point along the \nUnderground Railroad and that many escaped slaves from Maryland's \nEastern Shore plantations were destined for Baltimore and the President \nStreet Station to travel North to freedom. A few weeks ago, I \nintroduced a bill, The Harriet Tubman National Historical Parks Act, S. \n247, to honor Maryland's own Harriet Tubman, the Underground Railroad's \nmost famous ``conductor.'' While she personally led dozens of people to \nfreedom, her courage and fortitude also inspired others to find their \nown strength to seek freedom. President Street Station was indeed a \nstation on this secret network. Prior to emancipation in 1863, several \nrenowned escapees, including Frederick Douglass, William and Ellen \nCraft, and Henry Box Brown, traveled through the station, risking their \nlives for a better and freer life.\n  Others' journeys for a better life also passed through President \nStreet Station. From its beginning and into the 20th century, Baltimore \nwas both a destination and departure point for immigrants. New arrivals \nfrom Ireland, Russia, and Europe arriving on the eastern seaboard \ntraveled by way of the PW railroads to the west.\n  For decades, President Street Station has long been recognized as \nhaving an important place in history: In 1992, it was listed on the \nNational Register of Historic places and the city of Baltimore has \ndedicated it a local historical landmark. For many years it served as \nthe Baltimore Civil War Museum, educating generations of people about \nthe role Maryland and Baltimore played in the Civil War and the early \nhistory of the city. In recent years, the museum, run by dedicated \nvolunteers from the Maryland Historical Society and Friends of \nPresident Street Station, have struggled to keep the station's doors \nopen and keeping the station's character true to its historical roots. \nThe area around President Street Station has changed dramatically over \nthe decades, but the Station has worked to preserve its history. It has \nbeen many years since trains passed through the President Street \nStation and it is clear that the best use for this building\n\n[[Page S874]]\n\ntoday is to preserve the building and use it tell Station's American \nstory.\n  President Street Station is one of America's historical treasures. As \nwe celebrate President's Day this weekend, we honor some of our \ncountry's greatest leaders and remember our own rich and innovative \nhistory. This bill authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to conduct \na special resource study of President Street Station to evaluate the \nsuitability and feasibility of establishing the Station as a unit of \nthe National Park Service. President Street Station, a contributor to \nthe growth of the railroad, and a vital player in the Underground \nRailroad, Lincoln's Presidency and Civil War, is part of this history. \nI urge my colleagues to join me in giving this station the recognition \nit deserves and support this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 377\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na tax incentive to individuals teaching in elementary and secondary \nschools located in rural or high unemployment areas and to individuals \nwho achieve certification from the National Board for Professional \nTeaching standards; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Incentives \nto Educate American Children Act of 2011--I TEACH. This bill provides \nimportant tax incentives to promote the quality of all public school \nteachers by encouraging them to achieve certification from the National \nBoard for Professional Teaching Standards. It provides further \nincentives to teachers in rural and high-poverty schools.\n  We all know that teachers are the front line for the education of our \nnation's children. Still, teachers continue to earn less than other \ncollege graduates. A recent study found that teachers only earn 77 \npercent as much as other college graduates. It is even worse for \nteachers in rural schools. Rural schools struggle with many unique \nchallenges, and one of them is how to pay competitive salaries when \ntransportation costs are necessarily higher than for urban schools. The \nDepartment of Education has reported that rural school districts have \nthe lowest base salaries for starting teachers. This bill helps combat \nthis inequity by providing a tax incentive to public school teachers in \nrural and high-poverty schools.\n  All schools today are struggling with the recruitment and retention \nof qualified teachers. Due to retirements and decreasing retention of \nbeginning teachers, the experience level of our teachers is decreasing. \nIn the 1987-1988 academic year, the most common number of years of \nexperience for our teachers was 15 years. The most recent data from the \n2007-2008 shows the most common years of experience is now just 1 year. \nThe distribution of teaching experience in the data shows the strong \nneed for incentives to encourage teachers to stay in the profession. We \nknow that more experienced teachers help our students learn.\n  States are responsible for certifying teachers in their own states, \nbut teachers have had the additional opportunity since 1987 to earn a \ncertification from the National Board for Professional Teaching \nStandards. This independent, nonprofit, and nonpartisan organization \nprovides teachers with a national board certification similar to those \nin other professions. Since 1987, more than 91,000 teachers have \ncompleted the rigorous process of National Board Certification. The \nNational Research Council of the National Academies recently affirmed \nthat students taught by National Board certified teachers make higher \ngains on achievement tests than students taught by teachers who have \nnot applied or have not achieved this certification. This bill provides \nan incentive to public school teachers to achieve this certification \nand stay in the classroom.\n  The I TEACH Act of 2011 provides important incentives for teachers to \nserve in rural and high-poverty schools as well as for all public \nschool teachers to demonstrate the accomplishment of National Board \nCertification. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WEBB (for himself and Mr. Warner):\n  S. 379. A bill to extend Federal recognition to the Chickahominy \nIndian Tribe, the Chickahominy Indian Tribe-Eastern Division, the Upper \nMattaponi Tribe, the Rappahannock Tribe, Inc., the Monacan Indian \nNation, and the Nansemond Indian Tribe; to the Committee on Indian \nAffairs.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I rise to reintroduce the Indian Tribes of \nVirginia Federal Recognition Act of 2011. This legislation passed the \nSenate Committee on Indian Affairs and the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives in 2009. It would grant Federal recognition to 6 Native \nAmerican tribes from the Commonwealth of Virginia. I am pleased to be \njoined by Senator Mark Warner and in the U.S. House of Representatives \nCongressman Moran, Congressman Scott and Congressman Connolly, all of \nwhom have been strong advocates for Virginia's Native American Tribes \nin past Congresses.\n  The 6 Virginia tribes covered under this bill began seeking Federal \nrecognition more than 15 years ago. They are the Chickahominy, \nChickahominy Indian Tribe Eastern Division, the Upper Mattaponi, the \nRappahannock, the Monacan, and the Nansemond Indian Tribe.\n  The 6 Virginia Tribes covered in this legislation are the direct \ndescendants of the tribes that helped ensure the survival of the first \npermanent English colony in the New World.\n  These 6 tribes have received State recognition as early as 1983, and \nhave received strong bipartisan support from the Virginia General \nAssembly for Federal recognition. It is appropriate for them to finally \nreceive the Federal recognition that has been denied for far too long.\n  I understand the reluctance from some in Congress to grant any Native \nAmerican tribe Federal recognition through legislation rather than \nthrough the Bureau of Indian Affairs administrative process. I have not \nembraced this issue lightly, and agree in principle that Congress \ngenerally should not have to determine whether or not Native American \ntribes deserve Federal recognition.\n  Within the last 2 years the BIA's Office of Federal Acknowledgment \ncame\n\n[[Page S875]]\n\nout with new guidelines on implementing the criteria to determine \nFederal recognition. While I applaud improvements to the process, new \nguidelines still do not change the impact that racially hostile laws \nformerly in effect in Virginia had on these tribes' ability to meet the \nBIA's seven established recognition criteria.\n  Virginia's unique history and its harsh policies of the past have \ncreated a barrier for Virginia's Native American Tribes to meet the BIA \ncriteria, even with the new guidelines. Many Western tribes experienced \ngovernment neglect during the 20th century, but Virginia's story was \ndifferent.\n  First, Virginia passed ``race laws'' in 1705, which regulated the \nactivity of Virginia Indians. In 1924, Virginia passed the Racial \nIntegrity Law, and the Virginia Bureau of Vital Statistics went so far \nas to eliminate an individual's identity as a Native American on many \nbirth, death and marriage certificates. The shameful elimination of \nracial identity records had a devastating impact on Virginia's tribes \nwhen they began seeking Federal recognition.\n  Second, Virginia tribes signed a treaty with England, predating the \npractices of most tribes that signed a treaty with the Federal \nGovernment and therefore were not granted Federal recognition upon \nsigning treaties with the Federal Government like tribes in other \nStates did.\n  For these reasons, recognition of these 6 Virginia tribes is \njustified based on principles of dignity and fairness. As I mentioned, \nI have spent several years examining this issue in great detail, \nincluding the rich history and culture of Virginia's tribes. My staff \nand I asked a number of tough questions before we first introduced this \nbill in 2009, and great care and deliberation were put into arriving at \nthis conclusion. After meeting with leaders of Virginia's Indian tribes \nand months of thorough investigation of the facts, I concluded that \nlegislative action is needed for recognition of Virginia's tribes. \nCongressional hearings and reports over the last several Congresses \ndemonstrate the ancestry and status of these tribes.\n  This bill has advanced in the past several Congresses with the strong \nsupport and tireless efforts of Congressman Jim Moran. Every living \nVirginia Governor, Republican and Democrat including our current \nGovernor, Robert McDonnell supports Federal recognition for these \ntribes. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate, \nespecially those on the Indian Affairs Committee, to push for passage \nof this important bill. Congress has exercised its power to recognize \ntribes in the past and I ask you to use this power to grant Federal \nrecognition to these 6 Virginia tribes.\n  In 2007, we celebrated the 400th Anniversary of Jamestown--America's \nfirst colony. After 400 years since the founding of Jamestown, these 6 \ntribes deserve to join our Nation's other 562 federally-recognized \ntribes.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n                                 S. 379\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) during the period of 1607 through 1646, the \n     Chickahominy Indian Tribes--\n       (A) lived approximately 20 miles from Jamestown; and\n       (B) were significantly involved in English-Indian affairs;\n       (2) Mattaponi Indians, who later joined the Chickahominy \n     Indians, lived a greater distance from Jamestown;\n       (3) in 1646, the Chickahominy Indians moved to Mattaponi \n     River basin, away from the English;\n       (4) in 1661, the Chickahominy Indians sold land at a place \n     known as ``the cliffs'' on the Mattaponi River;\n       (5) in 1669, the Chickahominy Indians--\n       (A) appeared in the Virginia Colony's census of Indian \n     bowmen; and\n       (B) lived in ``New Kent'' County, which included the \n     Mattaponi River basin at that time;\n       (6) in 1677, the Chickahominy and Mattaponi Indians were \n     subjects of the Queen of Pamunkey, who was a signatory to the \n     Treaty of 1677 with the King of England;\n       (7) in 1683, after a Mattaponi town was attacked by Seneca \n     Indians, the Mattaponi Indians took refuge with the \n     Chickahominy Indians, and the history of the 2 groups was \n     intertwined for many years thereafter;\n       (8) in 1695, the Chickahominy and Mattaponi Indians--\n       (A) were assigned a reservation by the Virginia Colony; and\n       (B) traded land of the reservation for land at the place \n     known as ``the cliffs'' (which, as of the date of enactment \n     of this Act, is the Mattaponi Indian Reservation), which had \n     been owned by the Mattaponi Indians before 1661;\n       (9) in 1711, a Chickahominy boy attended the Indian School \n     at the College of William and Mary;\n       (10) in 1726, the Virginia Colony discontinued funding of \n     interpreters for the Chickahominy and Mattaponi Indian \n     Tribes;\n       (11) James Adams, who served as an interpreter to the \n     Indian tribes known as of the date of enactment of this Act \n     as the ``Upper Mattaponi Indian Tribe'' and ``Chickahominy \n     Indian Tribe'', elected to stay with the Upper Mattaponi \n     Indians;\n       (12) today, a majority of the Upper Mattaponi Indians have \n     ``Adams'' as their surname;\n       (13) in 1787, Thomas Jefferson, in Notes on the \n     Commonwealth of Virginia, mentioned the Mattaponi Indians on \n     a reservation in King William County and said that \n     Chickahominy Indians were ``blended'' with the Mattaponi \n     Indians and nearby Pamunkey Indians;\n       (14) in 1850, the census of the United States revealed a \n     nucleus of approximately 10 families, all ancestral to modern \n     Upper Mattaponi Indians, living in central King William \n     County, Virginia, approximately 10 miles from the \n     reservation;\n       (15) during the period of 1853 through 1884, King William \n     County marriage records listed Upper Mattaponis as \n     ``Indians'' in marrying people residing on the reservation;\n       (16) during the period of 1884 through the present, county \n     marriage records usually refer to Upper Mattaponis as \n     ``Indians'';\n       (17) in 1901, Smithsonian anthropologist James Mooney heard \n     about the Upper Mattaponi Indians but did not visit them;\n       (18) in 1928, University of Pennsylvania anthropologist \n     Frank Speck published a book on modern Virginia Indians with \n     a section on the Upper Mattaponis;\n       (19) from 1929 until 1930, the leadership of the Upper \n     Mattaponi Indians opposed the use of a ``colored'' \n     designation in the 1930 United States census and won a \n     compromise in which the Indian ancestry of the Upper \n     Mattaponis was recorded but questioned;\n       (20) during the period of 1942 through 1945--\n       (A) the leadership of the Upper Mattaponi Indians, with the \n     help of Frank Speck and others, fought against the induction \n     of young men of the Tribe into ``colored'' units in the Armed \n     Forces of the United States; and\n       (B) a tribal roll for the Upper Mattaponi Indians was \n     compiled;\n       (21) from 1945 to 1946, negotiations took place to admit \n     some of the young people of the Upper Mattaponi to high \n     schools for Federal Indians (especially at Cherokee) because \n     no high school coursework was available for Indians in \n     Virginia schools; and\n       (22) in 1983, the Upper Mattaponi Indians applied for and \n     won State recognition as an Indian tribe.\n\n     SEC. 302.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1)(A) the first encounter with the English colonists was \n     chronicled by George Percy on May 5, 1607, when the \n     Rappahannock werowance, Pipiscumah or Pipisco, sent a \n     messenger to Captain Christopher Newport bidding the English \n     to come to him.\n       (B) Percy wrote, ``When we came to Rappahanna's town, he \n     entertained us in good humanity.'';\n       (C) the meeting took place approximately 10 miles from \n     Jamestown, at the principal town of the Rappahannocks on the \n     James River, Quioughcohanock (also called ``Tapahanauk'');\n       (D) Quioughcohanock was a part of the Powhatan chiefdom as \n     well as a later town named after the werowance, Pipisco;\n       (E) those towns were located in (Old) James City County, \n     which later became Surry County, Virginia; and\n       (F) there are numerous interactions between those \n     Rappahannock towns and the English recorded in the Jamestown \n     Narratives during the period of 1607 through 1617;\n       (2) during the initial months after Virginia was settled, \n     the Rappahannock Indians had 2 encounters with Captain John \n     Smith;\n       (3)(A) a meeting occurred during the time when Powhatan \n     held Smith captive (December 1607 through January 8, 1608);\n       (B) Smith was taken to the Rappahannock principal town on \n     the Rappahannock River to see if he was the ``great man'' \n     that had previously sailed into the Rappahannock River, \n     killed their king and kidnaped their people; and\n       (C) it was determined that Smith was too short to be that \n     ``great man'';\n       (4) a second meeting took place during Smith's exploration \n     of the Chesapeake Bay (July 1608 to September 1608), when, \n     after the Moraughtacund Indians had stolen 3 women from the \n     Rappahannock King, Smith was prevailed on to facilitate a \n     peaceful truce between the Rappahannock and the Moraughtacund \n     Indians;\n       (5) in the settlement, Smith had the 2 Indian tribes meet \n     on the spot of their first fight;\n       (6) when it was established that both groups wanted peace, \n     Smith told the Rappahannock King to select which of the 3 \n     stolen women he wanted;\n       (7) the Moraughtacund King was given second choice among \n     the 2 remaining women, and Mosco, a Wighcocomoco (on the \n     Potomac River) guide, was given the third woman;\n       (8) in 1645, Captain William Claiborne tried unsuccessfully \n     to establish treaty relations with the Rappahannocks, because \n     the Rappahannock towns on the Rappahannock River had not \n     participated in the Pamunkey-led uprising in 1644, and the \n     English wanted to ``treat with the Rappahannocks or any other \n     Indians not in amity with Opechancanough, concerning serving \n     the County against the Pamunkey's'';\n       (9) in April 1651, the Rappahannocks conveyed a tract of \n     land to an English settler, Colonel Morre Fauntleroy;\n       (10) the deed for the conveyance was signed by Accopatough, \n     weroance of the Rappahannock Indians;\n       (11) in September 1653, Lancaster County signed a treaty \n     with Rappahannock Indians, the terms of which treaty--\n       (A) gave Rappahannocks the rights of Englishmen in the \n     county court; and\n       (B) attempted to make the Rappahannocks more accountable \n     under English law;\n       (12) in September 1653, Lancaster County defined and marked \n     the bounds of its Indian settlements;\n       (13) according to the Lancaster clerk of court, ``the tribe \n     called the great Rappahannocks lived on the Rappahannock \n     Creek just across the river above Tappahannock'';\n       (14) in September 1656, (Old) Rappahannock County (which, \n     as of the date of enactment of this Act, is comprised of \n     Richmond and Essex Counties, Virginia) signed a treaty with \n     Rappahannock Indians that--\n       (A) mirrored the Lancaster County treaty from 1653; and\n       (B) stated that--\n       (i) Rappahannocks were to be rewarded, in Roanoke, for \n     returning English fugitives; and\n       (ii) the English encouraged the Rappahannocks to send their \n     children to live among the English as servants, who the \n     English promised would be well-treated;\n       (15) in 1658, the Virginia Assembly revised a 1652 Act \n     stating that ``there be no grants of land to any Englishman \n     whatsoever de futuro until the Indians be first served with \n     the proportion of 50 acres of land for each bowman'';\n       (16) in 1669, the colony conducted a census of Virginia \n     Indians;\n       (17) as of the date of that census--\n       (A) the majority of the Rappahannocks were residing at \n     their hunting village on the north side of the Mattaponi \n     River; and\n       (B) at the time of the visit, census-takers were counting \n     only the Indian tribes along the rivers, which explains why \n     only 30 Rappahannock bowmen were counted on that river;\n       (18) the Rappahannocks used the hunting village on the \n     north side of the Mattaponi River as their primary residence \n     until the Rappahannocks were removed in 1684;\n       (19) in May 1677, the Treaty of Middle Plantation was \n     signed with England;\n       (20) the Pamunkey Queen Cockacoeske signed on behalf of the \n     Rappahannocks, ``who were supposed to be her tributaries'', \n     but before the treaty could be ratified, the Queen of \n     Pamunkey complained to the Virginia Colonial Council ``that \n     she was having trouble with Rappahannocks and Chickahominies, \n     supposedly tributaries of hers'';\n       (21) in November 1682, the Virginia Colonial Council \n     established a reservation for the Rappahannock Indians of \n     3,474 acres ``about\n\n[[Page S879]]\n\n     the town where they dwelt'', the land being located in (Old) \n     New Kent County, which was later divided to include the \n     modern counties of Caroline and King & Queen in Virginia;\n       (22) the Rappahannock ``town'' was the hunting village on \n     the north side of the Mattaponi River, where the \n     Rappahannocks had lived throughout the 1670s;\n       (23) the acreage allotment of the reservation was based on \n     the 1658 Indian Land Act, which translates into a bowman \n     population of 70, or an approximate total Rappahannock \n     population of 350;\n       (24) in 1683, following raids by Iroquoian warriors on \n     Indian and English settlements, the Virginia Colonial Council \n     ordered the Rappahannocks to leave their reservation and \n     unite with the Nanzatico Indians at Nanzatico Indian Town, \n     which was located across and up the Rappahannock River \n     approximately 30 miles in King George County;\n       (25) between 1687 and 1699, the Rappahannocks migrated out \n     of Nanzatico, returning to the south side of the Rappahannock \n     River at Portobacco Indian Town;\n       (26)(A) in 1706, by order of Essex County, Lieutenant \n     Richard Covington ``escorted'' the Portobaccos, Nanzaticos, \n     and Rappahannocks out of Portabacco Indian Town, out of Essex \n     County, and into King and Queen County, where those Indians \n     settled along the ridgeline between the Rappahannock and \n     Mattaponi Rivers, the site of their ancient hunting village \n     and 1682 reservation; and\n       (B) that land encompassed the Newtown area on the King & \n     Queen County side of the Mattaponi River and extended into \n     Mangohick, on the King William County side of the Mattaponi \n     River;\n       (27) during the 1760s, 3 Rappahannock girls were raised on \n     Thomas Nelson's Bleak Hill Plantation in King William County;\n       (28) of those girls--\n       (A) 1 married a Saunders man;\n       (B) 1 married a Johnson man; and\n       (C) 1 had 2 children, Edmund and Carter Nelson, fathered by \n     Thomas Cary Nelson;\n       (29)(A) land was gifted by the Nelson family to the \n     Saunders and Johnson families as wedding gifts to the \n     Rappahannock girls in King William County; and\n       (B) in the 19th century, those Saunders, Johnson, and \n     Nelson families were among the core Rappahannock families \n     from which the modern Rappahannock Tribe traces its descent;\n       (30) in 1819 and 1820, Edward Bird, John Bird (and his \n     wife), Carter Nelson, Edmund Nelson, and Carter Spurlock (all \n     Rappahannock ancestors) were listed on the tax roles of King \n     and Queen County and taxed at the county poor rate;\n       (31) Edmund Bird was added to the tax roles in 1821;\n       (32) those tax records are significant documentation \n     because the great majority of pre-1864 records for King and \n     Queen County were destroyed by fire;\n       (33) beginning in 1819, and continuing through the 1880s, \n     there was a solid Rappahannock presence in the membership at \n     Upper Essex Baptist Church;\n       (34) that was the first instance of conversion to \n     Christianity by at least some Rappahannock Indians;\n       (35) while 26 identifiable and traceable Rappahannock \n     surnames appear on the pre-1863 membership list, and 28 were \n     listed on the 1863 membership roster, the number of surnames \n     listed had declined to 12 in 1878 and had risen only slightly \n     to 14 by 1888;\n       (36) a reason for the decline is that in 1870, a Methodist \n     circuit rider, Joseph Mastin, secured funds to purchase land \n     and construct St. Stephens Baptist Church for the \n     Rappahannocks living nearby in Caroline County;\n       (37) Mastin referred to the Rappahannocks during the period \n     of 1850 to 1870 as ``Indians, having a great need for moral \n     and Christian guidance'';\n       (38) St. Stephens was the dominant tribal church until the \n     Rappahannock Indian Baptist Church was established in 1964;\n       (39) at both churches, the core Rappahannock family names \n     of Bird, Clarke, Fortune, Johnson, Nelson, Parker, and \n     Richardson predominate;\n       (40) during the early 1900s, James Mooney, noted \n     anthropologist, maintained correspondence with the \n     Rappahannocks, surveying them and instructing them on how to \n     formalize their tribal government;\n       (41) in November 1920, Speck visited the Rappahannocks and \n     assisted them in organizing the fight for their sovereign \n     rights;\n       (42) in 1921, the Rappahannocks were granted a charter from \n     the Commonwealth of Virginia formalizing their tribal \n     government;\n       (43) Speck began a professional relationship with the Tribe \n     that would last more than 30 years and document Rappahannock \n     history and traditions as never before;\n       (44) in April 1921, Rappahannock Chief George Nelson asked \n     the Governor of Virginia, Westmoreland Davis, to forward a \n     proclamation to the President of the United States, along \n     with an appended list of tribal members and a handwritten \n     copy of the proclamation itself;\n       (45) the letter concerned Indian freedom of speech and \n     assembly nationwide;\n       (46) in 1922, the Rappahannocks established a formal school \n     at Lloyds, Essex County, Virginia;\n       (47) prior to establishment of the school, Rappahannock \n     children were taught by a tribal member in Central Point, \n     Caroline County, Virginia;\n       (48) in December 1923, Rappahannock Chief George Nelson \n     testified before Congress appealing for a $50,000 \n     appropriation to establish an Indian school in Virginia;\n       (49) in 1930, the Rappahannocks were engaged in an ongoing \n     dispute with the Commonwealth of Virginia and the United \n     States Census Bureau about their classification in the 1930 \n     Federal census;\n       (50) in January 1930, Rappahannock Chief Otho S. Nelson \n     wrote to Leon Truesdell, Chief Statistician of the United \n     States Census Bureau, asking that the 218 enrolled \n     Rappahannocks be listed as Indians;\n       (51) in February 1930, Truesdell replied to Nelson saying \n     that ``special instructions'' were being given about \n     classifying Indians;\n       (52) in April 1930, Nelson wrote to William M. Steuart at \n     the Census Bureau asking about the enumerators' failure to \n     classify his people as Indians, saying that enumerators had \n     not asked the question about race when they interviewed his \n     people;\n       (53) in a followup letter to Truesdell, Nelson reported \n     that the enumerators were ``flatly denying'' his people's \n     request to be listed as Indians and that the race question \n     was completely avoided during interviews;\n       (54) the Rappahannocks had spoken with Caroline and Essex \n     County enumerators, and with John M.W. Green at that point, \n     without success;\n       (55) Nelson asked Truesdell to list people as Indians if he \n     sent a list of members;\n       (56) the matter was settled by William Steuart, who \n     concluded that the Bureau's rule was that people of Indian \n     descent could be classified as ``Indian'' only if Indian \n     ``blood'' predominated and ``Indian'' identity was accepted \n     in the local community;\n       (57) the Virginia Vital Statistics Bureau classed all \n     nonreservation Indians as ``Negro'', and it failed to see why \n     ``an exception should be made'' for the Rappahannocks;\n       (58) therefore, in 1925, the Indian Rights Association took \n     on the Rappahannock case to assist the Rappahannocks in \n     fighting for their recognition and rights as an Indian tribe;\n       (59) during the Second World War, the Pamunkeys, \n     Mattaponis, Chickahominies, and Rappahannocks had to fight \n     the draft boards with respect to their racial identities;\n       (60) the Virginia Vital Statistics Bureau insisted that \n     certain Indian draftees be inducted into Negro units;\n       (61) finally, 3 Rappahannocks who were convicted of \n     violating the Federal draft laws because they refused to be \n     inducted unless they could be classified as Indian, after \n     spending time in a Federal prison, were granted conscientious \n     objector status and served out the remainder of the war \n     working in military hospitals;\n       (62) in 1943, Frank Speck noted that there were \n     approximately 25 communities of Indians left in the Eastern \n     United States that were entitled to Indian classification, \n     including the Rappahannocks;\n       (63) in the 1940s, Leon Truesdell, Chief Statistician, of \n     the United States Census Bureau, listed 118 members in the \n     Rappahannock Tribe in the Indian population of Virginia;\n       (64) on April 25, 1940, the Office of Indian Affairs of the \n     Department of the Interior included the Rappahannocks on a \n     list of Indian tribes classified by State and by agency;\n       (65) in 1948, the Smithsonian Institution Annual Report \n     included an article by William Harlen Gilbert entitled, \n     ``Surviving Indian Groups of the Eastern United States'', \n     which included and described the Rappahannock Tribe;\n       (66) in the late 1940s and early 1950s, the Rappahannocks \n     operated a school at Indian Neck;\n       (67) the Commonwealth agreed to pay a tribal teacher to \n     teach 10 students bused by King and Queen County to Sharon \n     Indian School in King William County, Virginia;\n       (68) in 1965, Rappahannock students entered Marriott High \n     School (a white public school) by executive order of the \n     Governor of Virginia;\n       (69) in 1972, the Rappahannocks worked with the Coalition \n     of Eastern Native Americans to fight for Federal recognition;\n       (70) in 1979, the Coalition established a pottery and \n     artisans company, operating with other Virginia tribes;\n       (71) in 1980, the Rappahannocks received funding through \n     the Administration for Native Americans of the Department of \n     Health and Human Services to develop an economic program for \n     the Tribe; and\n       (72) in 1983, the Rappahannocks received State recognition \n     as an Indian tribe.\n\n     SEC. 402.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) In 1677, the Monacan Tribe signed the Treaty of Middle \n     Plantation between Charles II of England and 12 Indian \n     ``Kings and Chief Men'';\n       (2) in 1722, in the Treaty of Albany, Governor Spotswood \n     negotiated to save the Virginia Indians from extinction at \n     the hands of the Iroquois;\n       (3) specifically mentioned in the negotiations were the \n     Monacan tribes of the Totero (Tutelo), Saponi, Ocheneeches \n     (Occaneechi), Stengenocks, and Meipontskys;\n       (4) in 1790, the first national census recorded Benjamin \n     Evans and Robert Johns, both ancestors of the present Monacan \n     community, listed as ``white'' with mulatto children;\n       (5) in 1782, tax records also began for those families;\n       (6) in 1850, the United States census recorded 29 families, \n     mostly large, with Monacan surnames, the members of which are \n     genealogically related to the present community;\n       (7) in 1870, a log structure was built at the Bear Mountain \n     Indian Mission;\n       (8) in 1908, the structure became an Episcopal Mission and, \n     as of the date of enactment of this Act, the structure is \n     listed as a landmark on the National Register of Historic \n     Places;\n       (9) in 1920, 304 Amherst Indians were identified in the \n     United States census;\n       (10) from 1930 through 1931, numerous letters from Monacans \n     to the Bureau of the Census resulted from the decision of Dr. \n     Walter Plecker, former head of the Bureau of Vital Statistics \n     of the Commonwealth of Virginia, not to allow Indians to \n     register as Indians for the 1930 census;\n       (11) the Monacans eventually succeeded in being allowed to \n     claim their race, albeit with an asterisk attached to a note \n     from Dr. Plecker stating that there were no Indians in \n     Virginia;\n       (12) in 1947, D'Arcy McNickle, a Salish Indian, saw some of \n     the children at the Amherst Mission and requested that the \n     Cherokee Agency visit them because they appeared to be \n     Indian;\n       (13) that letter was forwarded to the Department of the \n     Interior, Office of Indian Affairs, Chicago, Illinois;\n       (14) Chief Jarrett Blythe of the Eastern Band of Cherokee \n     did visit the Mission and wrote that he ``would be willing to \n     accept these children in the Cherokee school'';\n       (15) in 1979, a Federal Coalition of Eastern Native \n     Americans established the entity known as ``Monacan Co-\n     operative Pottery'' at the Amherst Mission;\n       (16) some important pieces were produced at Monacan Co-\n     operative Pottery, including a piece that was sold to the \n     Smithsonian Institution;\n       (17) the Mattaponi-Pamunkey-Monacan Consortium, established \n     in 1981, has since been organized as a nonprofit corporation \n     that serves as a vehicle to obtain funds for those Indian \n     tribes from the Department of Labor under Native American \n     programs;\n       (18) in 1989, the Monacan Tribe was recognized by the \n     Commonwealth of Virginia, which enabled the Tribe to apply \n     for grants and participate in other programs; and\n       (19) in 1993, the Monacan Tribe received tax-exempt status \n     as a nonprofit corporation from the Internal Revenue Service.\n\n     SEC. 502.

A bill to amend the National Forest Ski Area Permit Act of \n1986 to clarify the authority of the Secretary of Agriculture regarding \nadditional recreational uses of National Forest System land that is \nsubject to ski area permits, and for other permits; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, while our economy is beginning \nto show signs of recovery, there is still a long way to go. This is \nespecially true in our rural communities. That is why I am \nreintroducing a bipartisan bill that would help provide new economic \nopportunities in mountain communities across this country--the Ski Area \nRecreational Opportunity Enhancement Act.\n  The outdoors and recreation industries have been a bright spot in the \neconomic downturn. More Americans are spending time outside, enjoying \nthe natural world and getting exercise. I have long felt it is in the \nnational interest to encourage Americans to engage in outdoor \nactivities that can contribute to their health and well being. Our \npublic lands already play a key role by providing opportunities for \nhiking, skiing, mountain biking and a range of other activities.\n  In Colorado and across the country, for example, many ski areas are \nlocated on National Forest lands. However, under existing law, the \nNational Forest Service bases ski area permits primarily on ``Nordic \nand alpine skiing'', a classification that does not reflect the full \nspectrum of snowsports, nor the use of ski permit areas for non-winter \nactivities. This has resulted in uncertainty for both the Forest \nService and ski areas as to whether and how other activities, such as \nsummer-time activities, can occur on permitted areas.\n  In effect, this means that ski areas on National Forest lands are \nprimarily restricted to use for winter recreation, as opposed to year-\nround recreation.\n  The legislation I am introducing with Senator Barrasso of Wyoming \nwould clarify this ambiguity. It would ensure that ski area permits \ncould be used for additional snowsports, such as snowboarding, as well \nas specifically authorizing the Forest Service to allow additional \nrecreational opportunities--like summer-time activities--in permit \nareas.\n  I should note that this authority is limited. The primary activity in \nthe permit area must remain skiing or other snowsports. And there are \nspecific types of development, such as water parks and amusement parks, \nthat are specifically prohibited.\n  This is a narrowly targeted bill that will lead to additional \nopportunities for seasonal and year-round recreational activities at \nski areas on public lands--and most importantly help create more \nsustainable, year round jobs.\n  I would like to thank Senator Barrasso for his continued support of \nthis legislation and his efforts to work with me in the last Congress \nto pass this bill. I know we were both disappointed that the objections \nof just two Senators prevented this common-sense legislation from \nbecoming law. Hopefully we will have more success this year--because \nour mountain communities should be given every opportunity to thrive, \nas this legislation would help do.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 382\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Ski Area Recreational \n     Opportunity Enhancement Act of 2011''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to amend the National Forest Ski \n     Area Permit Act of 1986 (16 U.S.C. 497b)--\n       (1) to enable snow-sports (other than nordic and alpine \n     skiing) to be permitted on National Forest System land \n     subject to ski area permits issued by the Secretary of \n     Agriculture under section 3 of the National Forest Ski Area \n     Permit Act of 1986 (16 U.S.C. 497b); and\n       (2) to clarify the authority of the Secretary of \n     Agriculture to permit appropriate additional seasonal or \n     year-round recreational activities and facilities on National \n     Forest System land subject to ski area permits issued by the \n     Secretary of Agriculture under section 3 of the National \n     Forest Ski Area Permit Act of 1986 (16 U.S.C. 497b).\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to promote the domestic production of critical \nminerals and materials, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n[[Page S883]]\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise today to address an \nissue that affects both our economic and national security--critical \nminerals and materials. These materials are used in everything from \nwind turbines to cell phones to weapons guidance systems. However, \nthese materials are primarily imported--many from China--and not always \nreadily available. For example, several clean energy technologies--\nincluding wind turbines, batteries and solar panels--require materials \nthat are at risk of supply disruptions. According to the Department of \nEnergy, clean energy technologies currently constitute 20 percent of \nglobal consumption of critical materials. As clean energy technologies \nare deployed more widely in the decades ahead, demand for critical \nmaterials will likely grow.\n  Furthermore, these materials are needed for a number of products \nessential to protecting our Nation's security, including precision-\nguided munitions systems, lasers, communication systems, radar systems, \navionics, night vision equipment, and satellites. Many of these \nmaterials are produced primarily in other countries, and some are not \nproduced in the United States at all.\n  One group of critical minerals with very high importance today is \nrare earth elements. The United States was once the primary producer of \nrare earth materials according to the U.S. Geological Survey, but over \nthe past 15 years we have become 100 percent reliant on imports, with \n97 percent coming from China.\n  When the rare earth industry left the United States, our rare earth \nmaterials workforce dwindled as well, leaving very few experts with \nexperience in processing these materials. Currently, there are no \ncurricula in U.S. universities that are geared toward training a new \nexpert workforce; rather, most of the expertise resides in China and \nJapan. In addition, the U.S.-developed intellectual property for making \nmany of these materials is owned by Japan.\n  Rare earth materials are not the only critical materials in demand \ntoday. Similar supply problems are imminent for other types of minerals \nand materials that will be essential for the increased deployment of \ntechnologies like batteries, solar panels and electric vehicles. Both \nthe Department of Energy and the National Academy of Sciences have \nidentified minerals and materials--such as lithium, manganese and \nrhodium--that are now or could become critical in the near future.\n  Today, I am introducing the Critical Minerals and Materials Act of \n2011, a bill intended to help build up the supply chain of minerals and \nmaterials that are vital for the development of a clean energy economy \nand for our national defense.\n  The National Academy of Sciences recommended improved data-gathering \nby the Federal Government along with research and development to \nencourage domestic innovation in the area of critical minerals and \nmaterials. My bill specifically would direct the Department of Energy \nto begin research and development on critical minerals and materials in \norder to strengthen our domestic supply chain. It would also direct the \nDepartment of the Interior to lead in gathering information on the \ncurrent supply chain and to forecast what materials we might need in \nthe future as our clean energy economy develops.\n  Finally, my bill would build up the workforce necessary for the \nUnited States to regain its leadership in the critical minerals and \nmaterials industry. Fellow Coloradans in this industry have told me \nthat it is difficult to find qualified workers to hire in the minerals \nand materials sector. There are good-paying jobs out there waiting to \nbe filled, and more will become available as these industries grow. But \nwe need to make sure our workforce is properly trained to be able to \ntake advantage of these opportunities and retain U.S. expertise in this \nindustry. My bill will provide for such training in the Nation's \ncolleges and universities, as well as in our technical and community \ncolleges.\n  While there are a great many minerals and materials that are \nimportant for our economic and national security, my bill will focus on \nonly the small portion of minerals and materials that have become \ncritical due to their highly vulnerable supply chain. These critical \nminerals and materials are in danger of becoming simply unavailable or \nextremely expensive and I believe these deserve extra attention.\n  We must also recognize that the raw minerals for these critical \nmaterials are often on Federal land and are a valuable resource owned \nby U.S. citizens. Mining for them must be done in a safe and \nenvironmentally responsible way--and that is why I continue to support \nmining law reform. However, we simply cannot be so dependent upon China \nor any other nation to provide these critical materials. My bill would \nensure that the U.S. is armed with a robust domestic supply chain and a \nskilled workforce needed to produce these materials. I urge my \ncolleagues of both parties to join me in supporting this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 383\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 39, United States Code, to extend the \nauthority of the United States Postal Service to issue a semipostal to \nraise funds for breast cancer research; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Hutchison to \nintroduce legislation to reauthorize the extraordinarily successful \nBreast Cancer Research Stamp for 4 additional years.\n  Without Congressional action, this important stamp will expire on \nDecember 31 of this year.\n  This stamp deserves to be extended as it has proven to be highly \neffective.\n  Since 1998, over 907 million breast cancer research stamps have been \nsold--raising over $72 million for breast cancer research.\n  Furthermore, in October 2007, the Government Accountability Office, \nGAO, released a report showing that the Breast Cancer Research Stamp \nhas been a success and an effective fund-raiser in the effort to \nincrease funds to fight the disease.\n  The National Institutes of Health, NIH, and the Department of Defense \nhave received approximately $50.4 million and $21.6 million, \nrespectively, putting these research dollars to good use by funding \ninnovative advances in breast cancer research.\n  For example, in 2006, NIH began funding the Trial Assigning \nIndividualized Options for Treatment Program, TAILORx, with proceeds \nfrom the Breast Cancer Research Stamp. The trial is designed to \ndetermine which patients with early stage breast cancer would be more \nlikely to benefit from chemotherapy and, therefore, reduce the use of \nchemotherapy in those patients who are unlikely to benefit. The goal of \nTAILORx is to determine the most effective current approach to cancer \ntreatment, with the fewest side effects, for women with early-stage \nbreast cancer by using a validated diagnostic test.\n  Thanks to breakthroughs in cancer research, more and more people are \nbecoming cancer survivors rather than cancer victims. Every dollar we \ncontinue to raise will help save lives.\n  One cannot calculate in dollars and cents how the stamp has focused \npublic awareness on this terrible disease and the need for additional \nresearch funding.\n  There is still so much more to do because this disease has far \nreaching effects on our Nation.\n  Breast cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer among \nwomen after skin cancer.\n  More than 2.5 million women in the U.S. are living with breast cancer \ntoday.\n  Over 200,000 women have been diagnosed with cancer in each of the \npast few years, and will be diagnosed in the coming year.\n  Though male breast cancer is much less common, 1,970 men were \ndiagnosed with breast cancer last year.\n  This legislation would extend the authorization of the Breast Cancer \nResearch stamp for 4 additional years--until December 31, 2015.\n  It also will allow the stamp to continue to have a surcharge above \nthe value of a first-class stamp with the surplus revenues going to \nbreast cancer research.\n  It will not affect any other semi-postal proposals under \nconsideration by the U.S. Postal Service.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me and Senator Hutchison in passing this \nimportant legislation to extend the Breast Cancer Research Stamp for \nanother 4 years.\n  Until a cure is found, the money from the sale of this unique postal \nstamp will continue to focus public awareness on this devastating \ndisease and provide hope to breast cancer survivors.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 384\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. EXTENSION OF POSTAGE STAMP FOR BREAST CANCER \n                   RESEARCH.\n\n       Section 414(h) of title 39, United States Code, is amended \n     by striking ``2011'' and inserting ``2015''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Conrad, \n        and Mr. Franken):\n  S. 385. A bill to include nonprofit and volunteer ground and air \nambulance crew members and first responders for certain benefits; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I again introduce legislation to \ncorrect an inequity in the U.S. Department of Justice's Public Safety \nOfficers Benefits, PSOB, Program, by extending benefits to nonprofit \nEmergency Medical Services, EMS, providers who die or are permanently \ndisabled in the line of duty. I am pleased to be joined in this effort \nby Senator Sanders and Senator Schumer.\n  The legislation is named after Dale Long, a long-time paramedic and \nshift supervisor with the Bennington Rescue Squad in Vermont. Dale Long \ndied two years ago in a tragic, on-duty accident while treating and \ntransporting a patient. He had a superb 25-year career as a Vermont \nparamedic. He helped many, many people in ways they will never forget, \nand Dale Long will not be forgotten.\n  I had the pleasure and honor of meeting Dale in 2009--less than two \nmonths before his death--when he was in Washington to receive the \nprestigious Star of Life Award from the American Ambulance Association. \nDale earlier had received Vermont's EMS Advanced Rescuer of the Year \nAward, in 2008. In 2010, Dale was honored as part of the National EMS \nMemorial Service.\n  Dale's tragic passing highlighted a major shortcoming in the current \nPSOB program, which Congress established more than 30 years ago to lend \na hand to police officers, firefighters and medics who lose their lives \nor are permanently disabled in the line of duty. The current benefit \nonly applies to public safety officers employed by a Federal, State, or \nlocal government entity. With many communities around the United States \nchoosing to have their emergency medical services provided by nonprofit \nagencies, medics working for these nonprofit services unfortunately are \nnot eligible for this help under the PSOB program.\n\n[[Page S885]]\n\n  Nonprofit public safety officers provide identical services to \ngovernmental officers and do so daily in the same dangerous \nenvironments. With a renewed appreciation for the vital and timely \ncommunity service of first responders since the national tragedy of \nSeptember 11, 2001, more people are answering the call to serve their \ncommunities. At the same time, more rescue workers are falling through \nthe cracks of the PSOB program.\n  The Dale Long Emergency Medical Service Provider Protection Act will \ncorrect this inequality by extending the PSOB program to cover \nnonprofit EMS officers who provide emergency medical and ground or air \nambulance service. These emergency professionals protect and promote \nthe public good of the communities they serve, and we should not \nunfairly penalize them and their families simply because they work or \nvolunteer for a nonprofit organization.\n  The modest cost of this remedy also is fully offset and will not add \nto the federal deficit.\n  This is a carefully crafted, commonsense remedy to a clear \ndiscrepancy in the law. I am pleased with the widespread support this \nbill has earned. Momentum continues to build for this solution, and I \nwill keep at this effort until the Dale Long Emergency Medical Service \nProvider Protection Act becomes the law of the land.\n  I thank several first responder organizations--including the American \nAmbulance Association, the National Association of EMTs, the \nInternational Association of Fire Fighters, the International \nAssociation of Fire Chiefs, and the Fraternal Order of Police--for \ntheir support of this effort.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 385\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide assistance to certain employers and States \nin 2011 and 2012, to improve the long-term solvency of the Unemployment \nCompensation program, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, employers in several States, including \nIllinois, are facing an automatic tax increase if Congress doesn't do \nsomething. That is right. Businesses that are struggling in this \nrecession face a Federal tax coming their way if we don't act.\n  I am introducing a bill today that will prevent that. This is a time \nwhen we need to help businesses--small businesses in particular--to \nspend every dime they have on hiring people looking for work.\n  Here is why I am introducing the bill.\n  Current law requires States that have overdrawn their unemployment \ninsurance trust funds to raise taxes on employers to fill that deficit. \nThe recession put tens of millions of Americans out of work, and the \nnumber of people who have been unable to find new work for more than 6 \nmonths is unprecedented in recent history. Unemployment insurance has \nhelped these families through a difficult time, and it has been a good \ninvestment. It is money that has been given to the unemployed that is \nquickly put back into the economy, creating demands for goods and \nservices.\n  The Congressional Budget Office ranks unemployment benefit payments \nas one of the most stimulative things we can do to turn this economy \naround. So we know it is good economics. That spending is going to help \ndrive up demand for what private companies sell, which encourages them \nto hire more workers. But the ferocity of the economic downturn has \nstrained the unemployment insurance trust fund in many States.\n  Let me be clear. This problem has nothing to do with the operating \ndeficits many States are facing. That is a bigger but unrelated \nproblem. The UI trust funds can only be used by States to pay \nunemployment insurance, and it is these trust funds that we need to \nreturn to solvency. That is what the Unemployment Insurance Solvency \nAct, which I have introduced, would do.\n  Here is what it specifically sets out to accomplish:\n  First, it would waive the requirement that States immediately charge \nlocal employers higher taxes for the next 2 years. This would save \ncompanies located in my State of Illinois, for example, over $300 \nbillion over the next 2 years and save businesses nationwide between $8 \nbillion and $11 billion between now and the end of 2013.\n  Second, it would waive the interest payments that States would \notherwise be required to pay for the next 2 years. That is going to \nsave Illinois $200 million in interest payments over the next 2 years.\n  Finally, it gives States--Governors, State legislatures, and local \nemployers working together--greater flexibility in figuring out how to \nreplenish their unemployment trust fund starting in 2014.\n  It would give States three options to explore: First, to restructure \ntheir UI tax base and rates to fill any hole in the trust fund; second, \nseek forgiveness from the Federal Government for a portion of the debts \nthe State might owe to its trust fund in return for entering into a \nlong-term solvency plan with the Department of Labor to protect the \ninterests of the jobless who need unemployment insurance; third, \nmaintain existing solvency that a State has already achieved, earning \nhigher Federal UI interest payments and lower Federal UI taxes for its \nemployers.\n  The President included a version of this proposal in his budget he \nsubmitted to Congress on Monday. I commend him for it.\n  With 13.9 million people out of work and $14 trillion in Federal \ndebt, we need to find creative solutions to solve problems facing \nworkers and employers. This bill I have introduced, cosponsored by \nSenator Jack Reed of Rhode Island and Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, is \none that I think addresses this issue in a proper manner. It removes \nthis new burden on small businesses, a tax burden which can only hold \nthem back from hiring the people they need and reducing unemployment, \nand it gives to States that are hard-pressed because of other financial \nproblems at least 2 years where they don't need to pay the interest \nthey owe on the money for unemployment insurance. It is a stopgap \nemergency measure supported by the Obama administration which I am \nhappy to introduce.\n  This bill will prevent immediate tax increases on employers. It \nensures unemployment insurance will be there when workers need it. And \nit does not raise the Federal debt. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 386\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S886]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to prohibit Members of Congress and the President from \nreceiving pay during Government shutdowns; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I send a bill to the desk on behalf of \nmyself and Senators Casey, Tester, Manchin, Warner, and Wyden.\n  I want to explain it. I hope we will see action on this bill in the \nnear future because we are on very delicate ground right now as we try \nto resolve the budget issues before us.\n  We have two sides to the legislative branch--the House and the \nSenate. I think we have very different approaches to this deficit \nproblem which is quite real. Both sides should be respectful of each \nother. But the messages I am getting via the media in terms of the \nlanguage being used on the other side is: We don't really much care \nwhat the Senate thinks. It is kind of ``our way or the highway'' type \nof rhetoric.\n  The problem with this is that the type of cuts that are coming from \nthe House side, from our Republican friends over there, a columnist \ntells us will cost 800,000 jobs to this Nation. Mr. President, 800,000 \njobs will be lost if we do not make some changes to what they have \ndone.\n  As someone from a State that has a very tough economic climate and \ntrying to climb out of this recession, that is just extreme. It is just \nextreme.\n  Are we willing to make cuts? Yes. It is my belief both sides have to \nsit down and work this out. We believe there are cuts to be made. They \nhave come out with cuts. We need to work together. But here is what \ntroubles me, and this is why I introduce this legislation. What \ntroubles me is there seems to be more and more threats of a government \nshutdown. In the early days of the new House leadership we did not hear \nthat. Now we are hearing it.\n  In Politico, one of the headlines recently said: ``McConnell won't \ntake shutdown off the table.'' That refers to our Republican leader.\n  In Reuters, Republican majority leader Eric Cantor ``refused . . . to \nrule out the possibility of a government shutdown.''\n  Republican Senator Mike Lee said: ``The 1995 government shutdown was \njust an inconvenience.''\n  I have to tell you, it is a lot more than an inconvenience when \nsenior citizens cannot get help getting their Social Security or \nveterans on disability cannot get their help. Hospitals close down. \nProjects shut down. These are real people out there. A lot of \ncontractors in the private sector rely on the government operating, \nsuch as road projects, bridges being repaired, and the rest. It is \nradical to say that a government shutdown is an inconvenience. It is a \nfailure. A government shutdown is a failure of those of us who are here \nto act like adults and resolve our differences.\n  CNN said:\n\n       Top Republican on the Senate Budget Committee said he's not \n     ruling out the possibility of a government shutdown.\n\n  The way Speaker Boehner spoke today had, to me, kind of a ``take it \nor leave it'' tone to it.\n  I have to tell you, that budget over there not only threatens 800,000 \njobs, but they legislated on appropriations. They legislated on an \nappropriations bill. They decided that women should not have access to \na full range of reproductive health care. They are bringing in the \nissue of abortion on a budget bill. I think the issue of a woman's \nright to choose and her reproductive health care and getting Pap \nscreenings and cancer screenings is important, and we should debate \nthat. If people want to repeal Roe v. Wade, let's debate that here.\n  What they have done with the Clean Air Act--and I know my friend \nsitting in the chair cares so much about this issue. The Clean Air Act \nwas brought to us by Richard Nixon. It had bipartisan support.\n  What they do is prohibit the Environmental Protection Agency from \nenforcing the Clean Air Act as it relates to carbon pollution--\npollution that is dangerous for our families, that endangers the lives \nand health of our families. That is what the Bush administration said \nwhen they were in charge, let alone the Obama administration.\n  Rather than bringing to the floor a bill to repeal the Clean Air \nAct--I\n\n[[Page S888]]\n\nwould welcome that debate, and I know my friend would as well--they do \nthis through the back door and tell the Environmental Protection Agency \nthey cannot protect us from pollution.\n  That is not what the American people expect to be in a simple budget \ndocument. We have to cut some programs. Let's cut some programs. Let's \nnot change abortion law on it. Let's not bring up how to repeal the \nClean Air Act on it. Let's not eviscerate law settlements. They have \ndone a range of things which require debate. I would love to put these \nquestions to the American people. I can tell you that people in my home \nState think government has no business in the issue of a woman's \nhealth. Stay away. That is what they say. We will make up our own \nminds. Some of us are pro-choice, some of us are not, but don't tell us \nwhat to believe. That is the thought of the majority of the people in \nmy State. They do not want Big Brother and the government telling \npeople what to do. Yet they put it on a budget bill. That doesn't make \nany sense.\n\n  Let me tell you, the people in my State want clean air. In all the \nyears I have been in office--and the President and I have been around a \nwhile and holding different offices--not one of my constituents has \never came up to me and said: Barbara, we need dirty air. The air is too \nclean. The water is too pure. The lakes are too pristine. The beaches \nare gorgeous. No. They want us to make sure we protect them from \npollution so their kids can breathe the air and not get asthma. So our \nfriends on the other side have these gargantuan cuts, and in addition \nto these cuts--which will cost us, according to Senator Inouye, 800,000 \njobs--800,000 jobs--they have legislated issues that are contentious \nand don't belong on a budget bill.\n  Here is the deal. I am worried they might say to us: It is our way or \nthe highway. I am worried about that. That is what I am starting to \nhear. They may lead us into a government shutdown if we fail to act \nlike adults and resolve this and keep the contentious issues off the \nbudget and cut reasonably and sensibly so we don't cause more \nunemployment. If we can figure that out and meet each other halfway and \neverything else you do when you compromise, we will be fine. But if \nthat isn't the case, I wish to be sure Members of Congress suffer just \nas much as any Federal employee. So I have written this bill, with my \ncolleagues, to say that in the event of a government shutdown or a \nfailure to lift the debt ceiling and we start defaulting on our \ncommitments, Members of Congress will not get paid because Members of \nCongress don't deserve to be paid if we can't act like adults and \nnegotiate this.\n  I am so tired of the hypocrisy I have seen. I know it is a strong \nword, and I am not leveling it at any particular individual, but I have \nto tell you, there are Members of the House who said ObamaCare is \nterrible, but then they took it for themselves. So what price are they \npaying? They vote no on health care for everybody else, but they keep \ngovernment health care. It is wrong. A lot of them are sleeping in \ntheir offices. Tell me one other person who is allowed to sleep in the \noffice of their corporation they work for. As far as I know, there is \nnobody. They do not pay any rent. They sleep in their offices.\n  So they do all these things: They do not help the housing crisis. \nThey sleep in their offices. They would not vote for health care, but \nthey take government health care. Now they might shut down the \ngovernment. Yet while Federal employees will not get paid, they will \nget paid--no way, wrong, not fair. They have to pay a price for all \ntheir extremism.\n  So I hope we will pass this bill and send it over to the House and \nthe House can decide if they think this is right. This is what I would \nlike to take to the American people. Because if they shut down the \ngovernment or they fail to raise the debt ceiling and we start to \ndefault and they pay no price, it is not fair. We cannot stamp our feet \nand say: It is the way I want it or I am taking my marbles and I am \ngoing home--or my teddy bear or my blanket or whatever. You can't do \nthat.\n  This is the greatest country in the world. As my friend, Senator \nSanders, who is in the chair, so beautifully said last night on a news \nshow--and it was so well done--the middle class is hurting. Real income \nis going down. As we look at these budget cuts, we have to think about \nthat. I am thinking a lot about it, and I am seeing hundreds of \nthousands of jobs being lost by the middle class, not by the wealthy \nfew. They are not going to be touched by this.\n  So this is a very simple bill. I will read what it says:\n\n       Members of Congress and the President shall not receive \n     basic pay for any period in which there is more than a 24-\n     hour lapse in appropriations for any Federal agency or \n     department as a result of a failure to enact a regular \n     appropriations bill or a continuing resolution, or if the \n     Federal Government is unable to make payments or meet \n     obligations because the debt limit has been reached.\n\n  So simple. So I am calling on my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle to take the option of a government shutdown off the table. I hope \nthis legislation will nudge them in that direction. Let them think \nabout what it is like not to get paid. Because if they shut down the \nFederal Government, a whole lot of folks would not get paid. A lot of \npeople in the private sector would not get paid and a lot of people on \npensions would not get paid. The only people who would be exempted, \npretty much, are Members of Congress, and we have to put an end to that \ndichotomy.\n  I thank the Chair for all his leadership on behalf of the middle \nclass and the working poor and I think the hypocrisy has to end. I feel \nwe have to come to this floor and start telling the American people the \ntruth. The truth is: The cuts over there on the other side are going to \nhurt the middle class. They are extreme. They have added language that \ndoesn't belong on a budget bill. Even though they said they were about \njobs, jobs, jobs, and maybe they were--how to lose another 800,000 \njobs, maybe that is what they meant--nobody thought the first thing \nthey would do is come in and attach abortion language and family \nplanning language and eviscerate the EPA's ability to clean up carbon \npollution on a budget bill. So we have to start letting the American \npeople know because they are busy and they do not get to read all the \nins and outs of what happens here. We have to put it in straightforward \nlanguage.\n  Today is a very good day in the Senate. We have been brought \ntogether, and a lot of that credit goes to Senator Rockefeller and \nSenator Hutchison. I am proud to serve on their committee. We are doing \na good job and working together. We have worked out our problems. We \nhad problems with new flights out of National, and no one thought we \ncould resolve it. But we were happy to work together--Republicans, \nDemocrats, people from the East and the West and the Midwest--and we \nshowed we can do something here today. As a result, we are about to \npass a very good bill.\n  My own bill of rights is in this bill, and I am thrilled about that. \nIt was a Boxer-Snowe bill. It has been incorporated in here. It says if \nyou get stuck on an airline, you should be able to expect that you will \nhave water and nourishment and that the toilets will not be overflowing \nand that if the plane is stuck for 3 hours, you should be able to have \nthe option to get off that flight.\n  So listen, there are good things we can do. We have proven it here \ntoday. But I am getting increasingly nervous about the threats of a \ngovernment shutdown. I think if Members know it isn't just pain that is \ngoing to be inflicted on someone else but they will have pain inflicted \non themselves and their families as well, maybe they will take that \noption off the table.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Begich, Mr. \n        Blumenthal, Ms. Collins, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. \n        Sanders, Ms. Stabenow, and Mr. Whitehouse):\n  S. 393. A bill to aid and support pediatric involvement in reading \nand education; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I introduce with my colleague, Senator \nGrassley, the Prescribe a Book Act. I thank Senators Begich, \nBlumenthal, Collins, Kerry, Lautenberg, Sanders, Stabenow, and \nWhitehouse for joining us as original cosponsors of this bipartisan \nbill.\n  Our legislation would create a federal pediatric early literacy grant \ninitiative\n\n[[Page S889]]\n\nbased on the long-standing, successful Reach Out and Read program. The \nprogram would award grants on a competitive basis to high-quality non-\nprofit entities to train doctors and nurses in advising parents about \nthe importance of reading aloud and to give books to children at \npediatric check-ups from 6 months to 5 years of age, with a priority \nfor children from low-income families. It builds on the relationship \nbetween parents and medical providers and helps families and \ncommunities encourage early literacy skills so children enter school \nprepared for success in reading.\n  Since fiscal year 2000, Federal funding for Reach Out and Read \nthrough the Department of Education has been an essential piece of a \nsuccessful public-private partnership that has been matched by tens of \nmillions of dollars from the private sector and State governments. This \nfunding has supported the training of nearly 50,000 health care \nproviders in literacy promotion, and the operation of programs in more \nthan 4,100 clinics and hospitals nationwide, including the 40 sites \nthat operate in Rhode Island. The Prescribe a Book Act would establish \na formal authorization for this successful partnership activity.\n  The Reach Out and Read model has consistently demonstrated \neffectiveness in increasing parent involvement and boosting children's \nreading proficiency. Research published in peer-reviewed, scientific \njournals has found that parents who have participated in the program \nare significantly more likely to read to their children and include \nmore children's books in their home, and that children served by the \nprogram show an increase of 4-8 points on vocabulary tests. I have seen \nup-close the positive impact of this program on children and their \nfamilies when visiting a number of Rhode Island's Reach Out and Read \nsites.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor the Prescribe a Book Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 393\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Sherman Act to make oil-producing and \nexporting cartels illegal; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the No Oil \nProducing and Exporting Cartels Act, NOPEC. This legislation will \nauthorize our government, for the first time, to take action against \nthe illegal conduct of the OPEC oil cartel. It is time for the U.S. \ngovernment to fight back against efforts to fix the price of oil and \nhold OPEC accountable when it acts illegally. Our legislation will hold \nOPEC member nations to account under U.S. antitrust law when they agree \nto limit supply or fix price in violation of the most basic principles \nof free competition.\n  NOPEC will authorize the Attorney General to file suit against \nnations or other entities that participate in a conspiracy to limit the \nsupply, or fix the price, of oil. In addition, it will specify that the \ndoctrines of sovereign immunity and act of state do not exempt nations \nthat participate in oil cartels from basic antitrust law. I have \nintroduced this legislation in each Congress since 2000. This \nlegislation passed the full Senate in the 110th Congress by a vote of \n70-23 in June 2007 as an amendment to the 2007 Energy Bill before\n\n[[Page S890]]\n\nbeing stripped from that bill in the conference committee. The \nidentical House version of NOPEC also passed the other body as stand \nalone legislation in the 110th Congress in 2007 by an overwhelming 345-\n72 vote. It is now time for us to at last pass this legislation into \nlaw and give our nation a long needed tool to counteract this \npernicious and anti-consumer conspiracy.\n  Since January 2009 the cost of crude oil has more than doubled, \nreaching today's level of $96 per barrel. Likewise, throughout 2009 and \n2010, gasoline prices have marched steadily upward, soaring to over $3 \na gallon in January 2011, a price that has nearly doubled in little \nover two years. And recently, OPEC ministers indicated that they may \ndecide against an increase an output in 2011, saying in the final days \nof 2010 that the world economy can tolerate a $100 per barrel price. So \nit is clear that the global oil cartel remains a major force conspiring \nto raise oil prices to the detriment of American consumers.\n  The actions of the OPEC cartel in recent years demonstrate the \ndangers it presents. A good example occurred at the end of 2008. On \nOctober 24, 2008, OPEC agreed to cut production by 1.5 million barrels \na day, and less than two months later, on December 17, 2008, OPEC \nagreed to a further 2.2 million barrels a day production cut. OPEC made \nno secret of its motivation for these production cuts. OPEC President \nChakib Khelil put it very simply in an interview published December 23, \n2008, ``Without these cuts, I don't think we'd be seeing $43 [per \nbarrel] today, we'd have seen in the $20's. . . . [H]opefully by the \nthird quarter [of 2009] we will see prices rising.'' In another \ninterview in December, Khelil was quoted as saying ``The stronger the \ndecision [to cut production], the faster prices will pick up.'' Sure \nenough, oil prices resumed their march upwards in 2009, and now is more \nthan $90 per barrel.\n  Since cutting its output in this manner at the end of 2008, OPEC has \nnot officially changed its output policy for more than two years. Oil \nprices have surged nearly $30 since last summer, and OPEC's Secretary \nGeneral Abdalla Salem El-Badri confirmed there would not be an increase \nin output, claiming in January 2011 that, ``At the moment there is more \nthan enough oil on the market.''\n  When the price of crude oil rises as a result of these actions by \nOPEC, there is no doubt that millions of American consumers feel the \npinch every time they visit the gas pump. The Federal Trade Commission \nhas estimated that 85 percent of the variability in the cost of \ngasoline is the result of changes in the cost of crude oil.\n  Such blatantly anti-competitive conduct by the oil cartel violates \nthe most basic principles of fair competition and free markets and \nshould not be tolerated. If private companies engaged such an \ninternational price fixing conspiracy, there would no question that it \nwould be illegal. The actions of OPEC should be treated no differently \nbecause it is a conspiracy of nations.\n  For years, this price fixing conspiracy of OPEC nations has unfairly \ndriven up the cost of imported crude oil to satisfy the greed of the \noil exporters. We have long decried OPEC, but, sadly, no one in \ngovernment has yet tried to take any action. This NOPEC legislation \nwill, for the first time, establish clearly and plainly that when a \ngroup of competing oil producers like the OPEC nations act together to \nrestrict supply or set prices, they are violating U.S. law.\n  It is also important to point out that this legislation will not \nauthorize private lawsuits. It only authorizes the Attorney General to \nfile suit under the antitrust laws for redress. It will always be in \nthe discretion of the Justice Department and the President as to \nwhether to take action to enforce NOPEC. Our legislation will not \nrequire the government to bring a legal action against OPEC member \nnations, and no private party will have the ability to bring such an \naction. This decision will entirely remain in the discretion of the \nexecutive branch. Our NOPEC legislation will give our law enforcement \nagencies a tool to employ against the oil cartel but the decision on \nwhether to use this tool will entirely be up to the Justice Department \nand, ultimately, the President. They can use this tool as they see \nfit--to file a legal action, to jawbone OPEC in diplomatic discussions, \nor defer from any action should they judge foreign policy or other \nconsiderations warrant it.\n  NOPEC will also make plain that the nations of OPEC cannot hide \nbehind the doctrines of ``sovereign immunity'' or ``act of state'' to \nescape the reach of American justice. In so doing, our amendment will \noverrule one 28 year old lower court decision which incorrectly failed \nto recognize that the actions of OPEC member nations was commercial \nactivity exempt from the protections of sovereign immunity.\n  The most fundamental principle of a free market is that competitors \ncannot be permitted to conspire to limit supply or fix price. There can \nbe no free market without this foundation. And we should not permit any \nnation to flout this fundamental principle.\n  Our NOPEC legislation will, for the first time, enable our Justice \nDepartment to take legal action to combat the illegitimate price-fixing \nconspiracy of the oil cartel. It will, at a minimum, have a real \ndeterrent effect on nations that seek to join forces to fix oil prices \nto the detriment of consumers. This legislation will be the first real \nweapon the U.S. Government has ever had to deter OPEC from its \nseemingly endless cycle of supply cutbacks designed to raise price. It \nwill mean that OPEC member nations will face the possibility of real \nand substantial antitrust sanctions should they persist in their \nillegal conduct. It will also deter additional nations who may today be \nconsidering joining OPEC.\n  I urge my colleagues to support our NOPEC legislation so that our \nnation will finally have an effective means to combat this price-fixing \nconspiracy of oil-rich nations.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 394\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to \nimprove energy efficiency of certain appliances and equipment, and for \nother\n\n[[Page S891]]\n\npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join with Senator \nMurkowski, the Ranking Member of the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources, in introducing the Implementation of National Consensus \nAppliance Agreements Act of 2011, INCAAA. This bill is an updated \nversion of the appliance energy efficiency standards legislation, S. \n3925, that apparently came within a single Senate vote of passage by \nunanimous consent last December, as the 111th Congress drew to a close.\n  As with the six appliance energy efficiency laws that have been \nenacted since 1986, this bill enjoys consensus support among appliance \nmanufacturers, energy efficiency advocates, and consumer groups. Such \nbroad support is to be expected, given the bill's many benefits. It \nwould reduce the regulatory burden on appliance manufacturers, \nincreasing their profitability and their ability to protect and create \njobs; reduce national energy and water demand, slowing the need for new \nenergy and water supplies, freeing capital for other investments and \nmaking our economy more competitive overall; save consumers money on \ntheir monthly energy and water bills, freeing household income for \nspending in other areas; and reduce power plant emissions and other \nenvironmental costs of energy production.\n  At the core of this bill are the appliance efficiency provisions that \nwere reported with bipartisan support from the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources in 2009 as a part of the comprehensive energy \nlegislation, the American Clean Energy Leadership Act, ACELA, S. 1462. \nINCAAA also includes the amendments reported from the Committee in May \n2010 to enhance ACELA. Finally, INCAAA includes several more-recent \nagreements and revisions on appliance efficiency that have been reached \nby industry, energy advocacy, and consumer stake holders.\n  I note that there are continuing discussions among stakeholders on \nSection 2(a) regarding the definition of ``energy conservation \nstandard'' and whether this term should allow an efficiency standard to \nhave more than one metric. For example, that a standard could require a \nspecified energy efficiency and also, say, specific water efficiency or \nsmart grid capability, or some other additional performance measures. \nStakeholders have agreed to allow inclusion of this provision in the \nbill for the purposes of introduction while discussions continue. Also \nunder continuing discussion are provisions regarding reflector lamps. \nThe Department of Energy is scheduled to complete its current \nrulemaking for these products this August and stakeholders continue to \nnegotiate what guidance could be given the Department for future \nrulemakings. I am committed to working with all stakeholders to resolve \nthese issues as the legislative process moves forward.\n\n  From a business point-of-view, INCAAA's greatest value is as a \nregulatory-reform bill. 25 years ago, the national appliance market was \nin danger of become unmanageably Balkanized because certain States were \nbeginning to enact appliance efficiency standards in response their \npower supply problems. Faced with a growing patchwork of state \nstandards, industry joined with energy efficiency and consumer groups \nto support Federal authority to pre-empt state standards and thereby \nassure a single national market for appliances.\n  INCAAA, as with the five appliance standards laws enacted since 1986, \nwould go a step further than simple Federal pre-emption of state \nstandards by enacting consensus standards that are negotiated among the \nstakeholders as the Federal standards. By directly enacting consensus \nstandards as Federal standards, these laws have the added benefit of \nsaving the time, cost, and uncertainty associated with a formal Federal \nrulemaking.\n  INCAAA would enact standards agreed to by the manufacturers of the \ncovered products and by the Nation's leading energy efficiency groups, \nthe Alliance to Save Energy, the American Council for an Energy \nEfficient Economy, and the Natural Resources Defense Council. These \ninclude new efficiency standards for certain outdoor lighting, as \nsupported by the National Electrical Manufacturers Association and \nmajor lighting manufacturers such as General Electric, Osram Sylvania, \nand Philips; increased efficiency standards for furnaces, heat pumps \nand central air conditioners, as supported by the Air-Conditioning, \nHeating and Refrigeration Institute and its dozens of member companies \nincluding Carrier, Johnson Controls, Rheem, Lennox, Nordyne, Goodman \nand Trane. The furnace provisions are also supported by the American \nGas Association; and Increased energy and water efficiency standards \nfor refrigerators and freezers, clothes washers and dryers, \ndishwashers, and room air-conditioners, as supported by the Association \nof Home Appliance Manufacturers and its many member companies including \nElectrolux, General Electric, Sub-Zero, and Whirlpool.\n  INCAAA also includes consensus standards that were earlier reported \nby the Energy Committee on smaller classes of products such as drinking \nwater dispensers, hot food holding cabinets, electric spas, pool \nheaters, and consensus standards that were negotiated more recently for \nservice-over-the-counter refrigerators.\n  The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy estimates that \nINCAAA would save the Nation nearly 850 Trillion Btus of energy each \nyear by 2030--enough energy to meet the needs of 4.6 million typical \nAmerican households. For comparison, the states of Utah and Connecticut \neach used just over 800 Trillion Btus of energy in 2008. Result in net \neconomic savings, benefits minus costs, to consumers of more than $43 \nbillion annually by 2030. Save nearly 5 trillion gallons of water \nannually by 2030, roughly the amount needed to meet the current needs \nof every customer in Los Angeles for 25 years. Improve the environment \nby reducing annual carbon dioxide emissions by about 47 million metric \ntons in 2030.\n  The Department of Energy's appliance standards program has been one \nof the nation's most powerful and successful tools for promoting energy \nand economic efficiency. ACEEE estimates that by 2010 appliance \nefficiency standards had reduced national non-transportation energy use \nto 7 percent below what it would otherwise be. For comparison, 7 \npercent of energy consumption in the U.S. is more than the annual \nenergy consumption of Florida or New York. Standards not only defer the \nconstruction of power plants, but also all of their associated costs \nfor planning, siting, operating, fueling, maintaining, and the \nenvironmental costs of their emissions, and the costs associated with \nthe distribution of that energy.\n  Finally, INCAAA contains no authorizations. Based on the CBO analysis \nconducted last year on ACELA, it is clear that this bill would not \nincur any no new spending.\n  This legislation represents government at its best, as a catalyst, \nbringing together stakeholders on consensus solutions to complex \nproblems. I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting enactment of \nINCAAA and reaching the goal that was so narrowly missed last December.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na bill summary be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 398\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

And now when given the opportunity to \n     afford their people the same rights as they called for on \n     behalf of the Egyptian people, once again, illustrate their \n     true nature.'';\n       Whereas, on February 15, 2011, President Barack Obama \n     saluted the ``courage'' of the Iranian people and said, ``We \n     are going to continue to see the people of Iran have the \n     courage to be able to express their yearning for greater \n     freedoms and a more representative government.'';\n       Whereas, on February 15, 2011, European Union High \n     Representative Catherine Ashton called ``on the Iranian \n     authorities to fully respect and protect the rights of their \n     citizens, including freedom of expression and the right to \n     assemble peacefully'';\n       Whereas, on February 3, 2011, the Senate passed Senate \n     Resolution 44, 112th Congress, reaffirming the commitment of \n     the United States to the universal rights of freedom of \n     assembly, freedom of speech, and freedom of access to \n     information, including the Internet, and expressed strong \n     support for the people of Egypt in their peaceful calls for a \n     representative and responsive democratic government that \n     respects these rights; and\n       Whereas the people of Iran also deserve support from the \n     United States in their peaceful struggle for a representative \n     and responsive democratic government that respects their \n     universal rights of freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, \n     and freedom of association, including via the Internet: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns the ongoing violence against demonstrators by \n     the Government of Iran and pro-government militias, as well \n     as the ongoing government suppression of independent \n     electronic communication through interference with the \n     Internet and cellphones;\n       (2) reaffirms the commitment of the United States to the \n     universal rights of freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, \n     and freedom of association, including via the Internet;\n       (3) expresses strong support for the people of Iran in \n     their peaceful calls for a representative and responsive \n     democratic government that respects these rights;\n       (4) calls on the Government of Iran to release all Iranians \n     detained or imprisoned solely on the basis of their religion, \n     faith, ethnicity, race, gender, sexual orientation, or \n     political belief;\n       (5) calls on the United Nations Human Rights Council to \n     establish an independent human rights monitor for Iran; and\n       (6) affirms the universality of individual rights and the \n     importance of democratic and fair elections.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I come to speak in support of the \nresolution submitted today by Senator Kirk, cosponsored by myself, \nSenator Kyl, Senator Bill Nelson, and Senator Casey.\n  Our resolution would add our voice to the many voices who are calling \nfor the Iranian Government to respect the undeniable and universal \nrights of its people. It would condemn continuing violent repression on \nthe part of the Iranian Government; reaffirm our Nation's commitment to \nuniversal freedoms; express our support for the Iranian people in their \npeaceful calls for reform; call on the Iranian Government to release \nthose detained solely on the basis of their religion, faith, ethnicity, \nrace, gender, sexual orientation, or political belief; call on the \nUnited Nations to establish an independent human rights monitor for \nIran; and reaffirm the universality of individual rights and the \nimportance of democratic elections. It would amplify and strengthen the \nmessage that 24 of us sent this week in letter to Secretary Clinton \nurging her to work with the United Nations Human Rights Commission to \nestablish a human rights monitor for Iran.\n  Recent events in Iran have continued a pattern of abuse, repression, \nand violation of civil and human rights that is all too familiar.\n  The people of Iran have rightly seen recent events in the Muslim \nworld, including the removal of dictators in Tunisia and Egypt, as \nconfirmation of the power of nonviolent protest. Just as they did in \nthe aftermath of flawed elections in 2009, the people of Iran have \nsought to speak out against the corruption and repression in their \ngovernment.\n  If justice is to be done, the Government of Iran would allow these \nprotests, hear the grievances of the people, reform a government whose \nautocratic substance is in no way concealed by the facade of \nrepresentative democracy that the regime has constructed. Instead, the \nIranian Government has quashed protest, cut off access to the Internet \nand other means of communication, and placed opposition leaders under \nhouse arrest. Members of the ruling regime have called for the \nexecution of opposition leaders and for violent repression of dissent.\n  We have seen in just a few short weeks the dramatic power of \nnonviolent protest. We have seen that ultimately, dictatorship will \nlose its iron grip. I believe we are all confident that the march of \ntime and progress will restore to the people of Iran the rights their \ngovernment denies them.\n  But today, as the Iranian people bear the brunt of autocracy and as \ndissenters face the threat of violent repression, it is important for \nall those who believe in universal rights to speak out against that \nrepression and violence, to let the people of Iran know that they do \nnot face these threats alone, and to declare that we are in support of \ntheir attempts to determine the course of their nation. I strongly \nsupport this resolution and call for its immediate passage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/17/senate-section/article/S918-2", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S918-S919]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 74--DESIGNATES FEBRUARY 28, 2011, AS ``RARE DISEASE \n                                 DAY''\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio (for himself and Mr. Barrasso) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n[[Page S919]]\n\n                               S.

Mr. President, in just a moment, I will ask the body for \nunanimous consent to adopt S. Res. 60. Before I do, I wish to talk \nabout the significance of this agreement we have come to on this \nimportant resolution.\n  Fifty years ago last September, President Eisenhower signed into law \nlegislation that established real estate investment trusts, or REITs, \nas an investment opportunity for all investors. Prior to 1960, access \nto the highly desirable investment returns of commercial real estate \nassets was limited to institutions and wealthy individuals that had the \nfinancial wealth to make direct real estate investments. By creating \nREITs, Congress recognized that small investors should be afforded the \nsame opportunity to invest in portfolios of large-scale commercial \nproperties and achieve the same investment benefits--diversification, \nliquidity, performance, transparency--as those able to make direct \ninvestments in real estate.\n  Some of my colleagues may not be familiar with each REIT property in \ntheir States, but they should be aware that these properties are making \na significant contribution to the economic vitality of their State and \nour Nation. REITs are companies dedicated to the ownership and \ndevelopment of income producing real estate, such as apartments, \nregional malls, shopping centers, office buildings, self storage \nfacilities and industrial warehouses. They operate under an intricate \nset of tax rules that require them to, among other things, meet \nspecific tests regarding the composition of their gross income and \nassets, in order to stay in business. For example, Federal tax law \nrequires that 95 percent of a REIT's annual gross income must be from \nspecified sources such as dividends, interests and rents, and 75 \npercent of the gross income must be from real estate related sources. \nSimilarly, at the end of each calendar quarter, 75 percent of a REIT's \nassets must consist of specified ``real estate'' assets. Consequently, \nREITs must derive a majority of their gross income from commercial real \nestate. And, the REIT rules require that at least 90 percent of a \nREIT's total income must be returned to the company's shareholders in \nthe form of dividends.\n  While REITs have played a major role in the U.S. economy since 1960, \ntheir mark in the investing world has primarily been achieved since \npassage of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, a time period many refer to as \nthe ``Modern REIT Era.'' This law removed most of the tax-sheltering \ncapability of real estate and emphasized income producing transactions, \nallowing REITs to operate and manage real estate as well as own it. I \nam pleased that over the years, Congress has adopted legislation to \nperfect the REIT method of investing in real estate. Among many \nproposals, these include the REIT Simplification Act of 1997, the REIT \nModernization Act of 1999, the REIT Improvement Act of 2004, and the \nREIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act passed in 2008.\n  REIT executives are hard-working business men and women who are \nsingularly focused on bringing increased value to their shareholders. \nAccording to the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, \nNAREIT, which is also celebrating its golden anniversary, these \nexecutives have proven to be successful in this objective, especially \nin the past two years in the wake of the financial downturn. Indeed, \nthe vision of Congress has come to fruition: the equity market \ncapitalization of REITs at the end of 2010 was $389 billion, up from \nonly $1.5 billion at the end of 1971, and listed REITs distributed \n$13.5 billion to shareholders in 2009.\n  I am pleased to be joined by my colleague, Senator Mikulski, who is a \ncosponsor of this legislation, and I am pleased that my home state of \nGeorgia is headquarters to several REIT companies that are engaged in \nthe daily business of creating wealth and employment for many investors \nacross the country and my constituents. These companies include Cousins \nProperties Incorporated, Gables Residential Trust, Piedmont Office \nRealty Trust, Incorporated, Post Properties, Incorporated, and Wells \nReal Estate Investment Trust. In total, there are more than 1400 REIT \nproperties located in Georgia, with an estimated historical cost in the \nbillions of dollars.\n  Commercial real estate represents more than 6 percent of this \ncountry's gross domestic product and is a key generator of jobs and \nother economic activities. Today, because of the foresight that \nCongress had 5 decades ago, anyone can purchase shares of real estate \noperating companies, and do so in a manner that meets their investments \nneeds by focusing on a particular sector in the commercial real estate \nworld and a specific region of the country. That is the beauty of the \nREIT method of investing, whose influence has now spread abroad to more \nthan 2 dozen countries that have adopted a similar model encouraging \nreal estate investment.\n  I again congratulate the REIT industry on this momentous occasion of \ntheir 50 years of leadership in the real estate investing market. REITs \nhave fulfilled Congress' vision by making investments in large scale, \ncapital intensive commercial real estate available to all investors. I \nthank my colleagues for supporting this resolution, and I look forward \nto continuing to work with them on issues of importance to REIT \ninvestors.\n  With that, I ask unanimous consent the Senate now proceed to the \nconsideration of S. Res. 60, which was submitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 60) recognizing the 50th anniversary \n     of the date of enactment of the law that created real estate \n     investment trusts (REITs) and gave millions of Americans new \n     investment opportunities that helped them build a solid \n     foundation for retirement and has contributed to the overall \n     strength of the economy of the United States.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I ask unanimous consent the resolution be agreed to, the \npreamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 60) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                               S. Res. 60\n\n       Whereas, on September 14, 1960, President Dwight D. \n     Eisenhower signed into law Public Law 86-779 (74 Stat. 998), \n     which enabled the establishment of real estate investment \n     trusts (referred to in this preamble as ``REITs'') throughout \n     the United States under regulations set by the Federal \n     Government;\n       Whereas the enactment of this law enabled REITs to provide \n     all investors with the same opportunity to invest in large-\n     scale commercial real estate that previously was open only to \n     large financial institutions and wealthy individuals through \n     direct investment in that real estate;\n       Whereas REITs have placed within the reach of the average \n     American investor large-scale commercial real estate \n     investment through publicly traded, regulated securities, \n     which provide investors with transparency and liquidity;\n       Whereas REITs, by expanding the opportunity to invest in \n     commercial real estate, a separate and distinct asset class \n     important to the creation of balanced investment portfolios, \n     have enabled millions of Americans to gain the benefits of \n     dividend-based income, portfolio diversification, and \n     improved overall investment performance;\n       Whereas REITs have helped millions of Americans \n     successfully invest for their retirements throughout the 50 \n     years preceding the date of agreement to this resolution; and\n       Whereas September 14, 2010, marked the 50th anniversary of \n     the date of enactment of the law that created the REIT \n     investment opportunity: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate recognizes the 50th anniversary \n     of the date of enactment of the law that created real estate \n     investment trusts (REITs) and the enhanced opportunities for \n     investment and retirement security that have been afforded to \n     Americans from\n\n[[Page S924]]\n\n     all walks of life as a result of this landmark law.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session to consider Calendar No. 12; that the nomination be \nconfirmed; the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon \nthe table, with no intervening action or debate; that any statements \nrelated to the nomination be printed in the Record; that the President \nbe immediately notified of the Senate's action; and that the Senate \nthen resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The nomination considered and confirmed is as follows:\n\n\n            office of the director of national intelligence\n\n       Stephanie O'Sullivan, of Virginia, to be Principal Deputy \n     Director of National Intelligence.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to support the nomination of \nMs. Stephanie O'Sullivan to be the Principal Deputy Director of \nNational Intelligence or PDDNI.\n  The Senate Intelligence Committee has carefully considered her \nnomination and stands strongly in favor of her nomination.\n  As is the case with many deputies to principals, the Principal Deputy \nDNI is an extremely important position that has two main \nresponsibilities: To assist the DNI, and to act on behalf of the DNI in \nhis absence or due to a vacancy in the position.\n  In broader terms, the role of the Principal Deputy DNI is a key one \nto the functioning of the Office of the DNI and in the effective and \nefficient operation of the Intelligence Community.\n  If confirmed, Ms. O'Sullivan will be the fourth Principal Deputy DNI \nsince Congress created the position in 2004. Like the past Directors of \nNational Intelligence before him, DNI Clapper has made clear the need \nto have this position filled. The tasks of managing the Intelligence \nCommunity, running the Office of the DNI, and serving as the primary \nintelligence advisor to the President is more than any one official can \nfulfill. It is, at minimum, two full time jobs--hence the need to \nconfirm a deputy.\n  Furthermore, it is a significant and welcome development that \nDirector Clapper recommended and that the President nominated Ms. \nO'Sullivan to serve in this role. As the current Associate Deputy \nDirector of the CIA and long-serving CIA official, Ms. O'Sullivan's \nconfirmation to the Principal Deputy DNI position should help end the \ndisputes between the Office of the DNI and the CIA that we have seen in \nthe past.\n  Ms. O'Sullivan was nominated to be the Principal Deputy DNI on \nJanuary 5, 2011. Ms. O'Sullivan completed the committee's standard \nquestionnaire and responded to a large number of pre-hearing questions. \nShe appeared before the committee on February 3 and answered all \nquestions put to her. On February 15, 2011, the Intelligence Committee \nvoted unanimously to recommend Ms. O'Sullivan's confirmation to the \nSenate.\n  It is clear from her background that Ms. O'Sullivan has the \nexperience necessary to be an effective Principal Deputy DNI. She has \nbeen the Associate Deputy Director of the CIA since December 2009. \nPrior to that position, Ms. O'Sullivan headed CIA's Directorate of \nScience and Technology for 4 years. In that role, she managed CIA's \ntechnological innovation and support to case officer operations. In \nall, Ms. O'Sullivan spent over 14 years combined in the Directorate of \nScience and Technology. Before the CIA, she worked in the Office of \nNaval Intelligence, and at TRW, which is now part of Northrop Grumman.\n  Her current role in the CIA is akin to that of chief operating \nofficer--similar to her position if confirmed to be Principal Deputy \nDNI. She has acquitted herself well in her current capacity and I am \nconfident she will do so in the position to which she has been \nnominated.\n  In sum, Ms. O'Sullivan will be a great asset to the Office of the \nDirector of National Intelligence and the intelligence community as a \nwhole because\n\n[[Page S927]]\n\nof her experience in the community and the management skills she \ndeveloped in her leadership roles at the CIA.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/17/senate-section/article/S927-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S927]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
