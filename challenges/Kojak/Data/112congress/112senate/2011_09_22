Dr. \nBeaman, born in Niagara Falls, NY, who started his mission work and his \nservice in Hamilton, Bermuda, with his wife, early on saw the \nchallenges of HIV/AIDS and the risks and opportunities for worship and \nfor mission that this pandemic provides to our community. He has been \nwith us now 19 years in Delaware. The two of them have been recognized \nfar and wide in our State and region for the beautiful Gate Outreach \nMinistry they have launched. I think it was Dietrich Bonhoeffer who \nfirst said most tellingly that it is the charge of ministry to afflict \nthe comfortable and comfort the afflicted. Pastor Beaman, through his \nleadership, his vision, his compelling sermons, and his compelling \nexample, in partnership with his wife Renee, has provided exactly that \nsort of challenging and effective leadership, that great and prophetic \nvoice for our community in Wilmington, DE.\n  I am grateful for the opportunity to have his prayerful reflections \nbegin our deliberations today.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, following leader remarks, the Senate will be \nin a period of morning business for an hour, Republicans will control \nthe first half and the majority will control the final half. Following \nmorning business, the Senate will resume consideration of H.R. 3832. \nLater today, the Senate will complete action on the GSP and TAA bill. \nThere will be up to five rollcall votes in relation to amendments and \npassage of this bill. I will work with the Republican leader to set a \ntime it is convenient to do that.\n\n\n                                  FEMA\n\n  More important, now that we have arrived at an agreement on how to \nmove the trade adjustment assistance out of here, is what is going to \nhappen in the House.\n  Last week, something all too rare these days happened in this \nChamber; we had some bipartisanship. Ten Republicans joined Democrats \nin voting to give FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the \nmoney they need to fund their important operations for the foreseeable \nfuture. The House bill would have jeopardized the\n\n[[Page S5850]]\n\nAgency's ability to help Americans affected by tragedy to put their \nlives back together, but that is what the House did.\n  What the House did last night was so wrong. We passed a bill a few \nmonths ago that would take care of funding for the rest of this year, \nfrom October 1 to October 1. Rather than doing what we had agreed upon, \nand the American people saw us work for months to agree upon, they \nreneged on that deal. They tried last night to send a continuing \nresolution for a few weeks and they attached to it--and they should not \nhave attached anything to it because we had already agreed on all \nthat--attached to it a very unfair FEMA funding measure.\n  To show how spiteful they were--we have done great things in this \ncountry, doing things with modern vehicles. I had an energy summit the \nend of August in Las Vegas. They had all these electric cars lined up \nthat they could show us. This is a result of money we have given here, \ntaxpayers' money, to stimulate that part of our manufacturing sector. \nIt has worked out great. It has been wonderful.\n  As Steny Hoyer, one of the Democratic leaders in the House, said, \nwhat the House did is try to legislate away 53,000 jobs. They took \nmoney that was in the pipeline to do more of those electric cars and \nother kinds of new vehicles and stripped it away. They applied that \ntoward something we have not done around here; that is, fund emergency \nsituations around the country.\n  To rub salt in the wound, they not only took that, 1 billion dollars' \nworth, but they took 500 million dollars' worth and they rescinded it, \nwiping out jobs, not applying it to the deficit, just doing it, I \nguess, to show they are in control of the House. But that fell apart \nlast night. It fell apart because Republicans and Democrats would not \nsupport that issue.\n  We don't know what they are going to do over there today. All kinds \nof rumors are floating around. We don't know. I have not spoken to the \nSpeaker or the majority leader over there. I haven't talked to them. \nThere are all kinds of rumors as to what they might do. They might try \nto send it back to us again. But the one thing I heard loudly and \nclearly, and my colleagues have to understand, the Republicans have \nannounced in the House they may be in session this weekend. I hope that \nis not the case. I have spoken to the Republican leader here. If they \nsend us something, we will do our very utmost to move as quickly as we \ncan on that to take action on whatever they send us.\n\n  But I wish to send this message to them. They should not renege on \nthe agreement that was legislated just a few short weeks ago; that is, \nfunding government for the next year. We have agreed upon that, and \nwhatever they send us, they should just send us a continuing resolution \nuntil we work on getting the appropriations bills done. Send us a \ncontinuing resolution with nothing attached to it. If they disagree \nover there with what we did--they have over on the House side our bill \nwhich passed in the Senate on a bipartisan basis. If they don't like \nthat, send us back something else.\n  We think the overwhelming support of the Nation is for something we \ndid but don't tie it to the CR. That is simply not the right thing to \ndo.\n  We are going to be alert and wait for the House to act. We are at an \nimpasse, not because of what we are doing but because of what they are \ndoing, and we will wait and see what action they take. It is extremely \nimportant that they act as quickly as they can.\n  We know we had scheduled next week to be off. We hope we can do that. \nWe have an important holiday next Wednesday. That is the reason we are \ntaking next week off. But I look forward to working with my colleagues \nin the Senate, both Democrats and Republicans, to move forward as \nquickly as we can.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/22/senate-section/article/S5850-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5850]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, over the past week, President Obama has \nbeen traveling around the country, trying to set a record for the \nnumber of times he can say the words ``pass this bill right away''--the \nnumber of times he can say it, actually in a 5-minute speech. Today he \nwill bring his act to a 50-year-old bridge that connects my own State \nof Kentucky with Ohio. The purpose of this visit is perfectly clear. \nThe President's plan is to go out to this bridge and say that if only \nlawmakers in Washington would pass his second stimulus bill right away, \nthen bridges such as this one would get fixed and that the only thing \nstanding in the way of repairing them is people like me.\n  I would like to make a couple points about all this. First, I find it \nhard to take the President's message all that seriously when his own \ncommunications director is over at the White House telling people he is \nno longer interested in legislative compromise when the leaders of the \nPresident's own party in Congress are treating this bill like an \nafterthought.\n  We would be more inclined to look at this so-called jobs bill if the \nPresident's own staff and members of his own party in Congress started \ntaking it a little more seriously themselves.\n  Second, I remind the President that the people of Kentucky and Ohio \nhave heard this kind of thing before. Don't forget, the President made \nthe same promises when he was selling his first stimulus. It is a \nmessage he brought to Ohio repeatedly. Here is what he said 2 years ago \nthis week at a stop in Warren, OH.\n\n       All across Ohio and all across the country, rebuilding our \n     roads and our bridges . . . that's what the Recovery Act has \n     been all about.\n\n  The Recovery Act is the stimulus bill, the first one. Yet 2\\1/2\\ \nyears later, what do we have to show for it? Politically connected \ncompanies such as Solyndra ended up with hundreds of millions of \ndollars, provided by the taxpayers, and bridges such as the one the \nPresident is attending today still need to be fixed.\n  It is worth noting, in fact, this one company blew through more \ntaxpayer money than the first stimulus allocated for every road and \nbridge in the entire State of Kentucky combined.\n  The President told Ohioans and Kentuckians, the first stimulus would \nkeep unemployment below 8 percent as well. Yet 2\\1/2\\ years later \nunemployment in both States is still above 9 percent.\n  We have heard these promises before, and I don't think the President \nshould expect anybody to fall for them again. I mean, how many stimulus \nbills do we have to pass before these bridges get fixed? How many? How \nmany Solyndras do we have to finance? How much money do we have to \nwaste before the President makes good on the promises he has already \nmade? If a bridge needs fixing, by all means let's fix it. But don't \ntell us we need to pass a $\\1/2\\ trillion stimulus bill and accept job-\nkilling tax hikes to do it. Don't tell the people of Kentucky they need \nto finance every turtle tunnel and solar panel company on some \nbureaucrat's wish list in order to get their bridges fixed. Don't \npatronize us by implying that if we pass the second stimulus, bridges \nwill get fixed right away. The American people heard the same thing \nwhen the administration was selling the first stimulus, only to turn on \ntheir television sets 2\\1/2\\ years later to see the President having a \nbig laugh over the fact that all these shovel-ready projects weren't \nquite as shovel-ready as they thought they were.\n  So I suggest, Mr. President, that you think about ways to actually \nhelp the people of Kentucky and Ohio, instead of how you can use their \nroads and bridges as a backdrop for making a political point. If you \nare truly interested in helping our State, if you truly want to help \nour State, then come back to Washington and work with Republicans on \nlegislation that will actually do something to revive our economy and \ncreate jobs and forget the political theater.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/22/senate-section/article/S5850-3", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5850]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

STATEHOOD EFFORTS\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I rise today to address the Palestinian \nefforts to gain statehood at the United Nations, which is occurring \nthis week. As most of us are aware, Palestinian Authority President \nAbbas has signaled that he intends to ask the United Nations for \nacceptance as a full member state. Several of my colleagues--and I \nmight add from both sides of the aisle--have expressed grave concern \nover this Palestinian initiative.\n  President Obama has indicated if this initiative is brought to a vote \nbefore the Security Council, the United States plans to veto it. I \nsupport that. However, even if the veto occurs, President Abbas may \nthen choose to ask the General Assembly to upgrade Palestinian status \nto that of a nonvoting observer state. If allowed to become a nonvoting \nobserver state, Palestinians could then participate on U.N. committees \nand bring allegations against Israel to the International Criminal \nCourt and International Court of Justice. Recognizing a Palestinian \nstate in this manner could also lead to further isolation of Israel \nwithin the Middle East. These are outcomes we simply cannot tolerate.\n  Israel, beyond any shadow of a doubt, is a stalwart friend and ally \nof the United States. They share our core values as a nation. They are \na thriving democracy in a part of the world where democracies are very \nhard to find. And importantly, they stand strong with us in the battle \nagainst international terrorism. Thus, it is absolutely imperative we \nstand with Israel and do everything we can to send a very clear and \nstraightforward message. That message is this: The United States stands \nwith our friends and we will not allow an international organization to \nundermine this important and valued friend.\n  Congress has been very clear on this imperative. Our strong \nbipartisan commitment was reinforced earlier this summer when both the \nSenate and the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed \nresolutions reaffirming the commitment of the United States to direct \nnegotiations between the Israelis and the Palestinians. The resolutions \nincluded opposition to this Palestinian bid for U.N. statehood in a \nPalestinian Government that includes Hamas.\n  In light of this unwavering bipartisan support from Congress, it is \ncrucial that our President continue to make it absolutely clear that \nthe United States stands firm in our opposition to this effort. We have \nan opportunity and we must signal to the rest of the world that a \nlasting peace, which we all want to achieve, will only result from \ndirect negotiations between the Israelis and the Palestinians and not \nthrough parliamentary procedure at some international organization. \nWhile the United States supports a two-state solution, we will not \ntolerate actions by international organizations to drive a wedge into \nthe Israeli-Palestinian peace process. Although President Abbas claims \nhis initiative is a peaceful approach to resolving the conflict, the \nPalestinian Authority has refused time and time again to come to the \nnegotiating table and to deal directly with Israel. Setting up \nroadblock after roadblock, President Abbas has demanded preconditions \nthat have not applied to previous negotiations.\n  This bid for U.N. statehood also violates the 1993 Oslo peace \nagreements signed by the Palestinian Authority which required the peace \nprocess to continue through direct negotiations. The U.N. statehood bid \nis counterproductive to a two-state solution as it will further damage \nIsrael's confidence in the Palestinian Authority as a legitimate \nnegotiating partner. Unfortunately, President Abbas's intention to form \na unity government with Hamas does not signal support or pursuit of a \nlasting peace. Hamas has made clear that they have no intention of \nending attacks on Palestinians or Israelis and working toward a two-\nstate solution.\n  Let me be very clear: If the Palestinian Authority continues to \nassociate with Hamas and refuses to negotiate directly with Israel, of \ncourse there are consequences. I can assure you the Senate and the \nHouse of Representatives will stand together to make our disapproval \nknown. U.S. aid to the Palestinian Authority is not on cruise control. \nCongress will not walk away from supporting an appropriate way forward \nin the peace process that respects the equal and inalienable rights of \nall people. We will not and cannot stand idly by while others attempt \nto use the United Nations, not to bring about peace, but to undermine \nour closest allies and friends.\n  As President Obama and his administration continue efforts to resolve \nthis issue before it is brought up to the Security Council, I ask them \nto do all they can to relay the disapproval of Congress and what \nPresident Abbas is trying to do and to stand without equivocation, \nshoulder to shoulder, with our friend, the state of Israel. It is our \nbest chance of bringing peace to the region.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I wanted to call to the \nattention of the Senate the aftermath of having passed the health care \nreform bill. There was a great deal of consternation at the time, while \nwe were deliberating, that Medicare was going to be cut. We will recall \nthat $500 billion was cut out of Medicare over the course of a 10-year \nperiod, and the amount that was being cut was considered to be a threat \nto Medicare.\n  As a matter of fact, when we passed it, the Medicare cuts came from \nproviders--often providers that stepped up and offered to have greater \nefficiencies and therefore Medicare savings over the decade. For \nexample, the hospitals of America came forth and said that we will save \n$150 billion. So one of the considerations in Medicare was that we were \ngoing to have to lean out the Medicare HMO Program called Medicare \nAdvantage.\n  If we will recall, back in 2003 when we passed the prescription drug \nbill, Medicare Advantage--the Medicare HMO--was actually given a bump \nup in Medicare reimbursement, some 14 percent over and above Medicare \nfee for service. As a result, people had the great incentive to go into \na Medicare HMO because the insurance companies--the HMOs--were getting \nso much more per Medicare beneficiary. But the fact is, we saw, on a \nlong, projected basis over time that it was going to be unsustainable \nfinancially for the U.S. Government to keep giving a 14-percent \ndifferential to insurance companies over what the average Medicare \nrecipient would get in Medicare fee for service.\n  That was one of the reforms of the health care bill--to take that 14 \npercent differential and lean it down over\n\n[[Page S5852]]\n\ntime, but at the same time make it more efficient, make the health care \nbenefits better by having a greater percentage of the actual delivery \nof that premium dollar go to health care instead of all the \nadministrative costs and all of that of an insurance company.\n  I am happy to report to the Senate that the Centers for Medicaid and \nMedicare Services came out last week with their new results on Medicare \nAdvantage--the Medicare HMO Program--as a result of the new health care \nbill.\n  Nationally, the premiums for seniors on Medicare Advantage have gone \ndown 4 percent and the enrollment is up 10 percent. Now that is a \nsignificant little victory coming out of the new incentives that were \nput in the health care reform bill--new incentives to insurance \ncompanies to improve their Medicare Advantage; nationally, 4 percent \ndown in premiums, but they are becoming more attractive and so the \nenrollment has gone up 10 percent. I am happy to tell you, in my State \nof Florida, where there are more Medicare Advantage enrollees than any \nother State--over a million--the premiums are down 26 percent and the \nenrollment is expected to go up almost 20 percent because of the \nincentives in the health care reform bill.\n  What in this reform bill has given new life to insurance companies to \nimprove their Medicare coverage that would cause the premiums to come \ndown and the enrollment to go up? Because CMS has now instituted a \nseries of financial incentives for the insurance company. And that is, \nif the insurance company boosts the quality of the service to its \nMedicare enrollees, then it will get a bonus per Medicare enrollee. So \nif it is rated as a 3-star or higher, each additional star gives more \nof a bonus and incentive to the insurance company, responding to the \nfact they have increased the quality. That is a good thing. The \ninsurance companies that are only rated 2\\1/2\\ stars now have the \nfinancial incentive to get to 3 stars.\n  What we have is a win all the way around. We have a win, clearly, for \nthe enrollees, who are the Medicare beneficiaries, because they are \ngetting better quality and their premiums have gone down in Florida by \n26 percent. We have a second win for the insurance company, because now \nthe higher quality it achieves, it is getting reimbursed from Medicare \nall the more as a reward for having a higher quality plan. The third \nwin is to the U.S. taxpayer. It lowers the overall amount the U.S. \ntaxpayer is going to have to pay as a result of the greater \nefficiencies in the Medicare Program. I wanted to come and share with \nthe Senate this win-win-win--triple win--as a result of our having \npassed the health care reform bill a couple of years ago.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                            DISASTER RELIEF\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I wanted to get here a little earlier \nthis morning, but I was chairing a panel and was unable to do so. I \nknow I only have 10 or 15 minutes or so before the Senator from Texas \nspeaks, so I appreciate the opportunity to say a few words about our \ndisaster recovery and the debate going on between the House and the \nSenate about that.\n  Yesterday, the House was unable to find the votes to pass the \ncontinuing resolution, and one of the issues of debate is how and when \nto fund our disasters. I know there are a lot of people following this \ndebate, so I want to bring everyone up to date on a couple of recent \ndevelopments.\n  First, the Chamber of Commerce has submitted a letter to us, strongly \nobjecting to the House using the Advanced Technology Vehicle \nManufacturing Loan Program as an offset to fund disasters.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe letter from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        Chamber of Commerce of the\n\n\n                                     United States of America,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 22, 2011.\n       To the Members of the United States Senate: The U.S. \n     Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest business federation \n     representing the interests of more than three million \n     businesses and organizations of every size, sector, and \n     region, strongly supports disaster relief funding to assist \n     victims of natural disasters. The Chamber is also a vocal \n     proponent of fiscal responsibility and recognizes that \n     Congress must make difficult but necessary choices among \n     competing priorities.\n       As Congress sets spending priorities, the Chamber wishes to \n     highlight a few important facts about the Advanced Technology \n     Vehicle Manufacturing (ATVM) loan program. First, the program \n     was authorized in the Energy Independence and Security Act of \n     2007, which was supported by both Republicans and Democrats \n     as an important step in reducing America's dependence on oil \n     from unstable regimes. Second, ATVM loans, which will be \n     repaid with interest, incentivize automakers and suppliers to \n     build more fuel-efficient advanced technology vehicles in the \n     U.S., providing new opportunities for American workers in a \n     sector of the economy that is critical to the nation's \n     recovery. Third, the fact that the Department of Energy has \n     yet to use the funds Congress appropriated for the program is \n     not the fault of industry; numerous loan applicants have been \n     in the queue for years, waiting for the Administration to \n     complete its due diligence.\n       Again, while the Chamber understands the importance of \n     reducing America's unacceptable debt and believes that all \n     programs must be on the table, the Chamber urges you to bear \n     in mind the facts about the ATVM loan program, which promotes \n     manufacturing in the U.S. and is an important component of \n     America's energy security.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  R. Bruce Josten.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, it is the position of the Democrats--and \nsome Republicans have taken this position--that this is not the right \nway to go about funding disasters, by requiring offsets. It is not \nnecessary, it has hardly been done in the past--it has been, but it is \nnot routine--and it is not recommended for a number of reasons I have \ntried to explain on the floor. But adding to that debate now is the \nChamber of Commerce saying that is not the right offset to use if you \nare going to insist on finding one.\n  Secondly, I want to push back on the argument the House position will \nprovide enough funding to get us through the next couple of weeks. That \nis only partially correct, and I want to be very clear. When people \nsay, well, we can go ahead and pass the 2.65 they have in for 2012, \nwhich is an extension of last year's number, and then the extra billion \nthey put in for 2011, and that will sort of get us by the next couple \nof weeks, let me be clear: It will get FEMA by. It will fill up the \ndisaster relief fund, which is running on fumes today. We are now down \nto $227 million in the fund, the lowest balance in recent memory. It \nwill provide a small amount of money relative to the core budget--$226 \nmillion. But I want to be clear: There is no money in the House \napproach for agriculture, there is no money in the House approach for \ncommunity development block grants--zero--and there is no money for the \neconomic development grants that chambers of commerce all over the \ncountry, in areas and counties that have been hard hit, use to help \ntheir communities and their businesses get back.\n  I just left a small business hearing, and the fact is, after a \ndisaster, whether it is in North Carolina or California or Florida or \nLouisiana--and this is very sad, particularly in these economic times--\nabout 70 percent of small businesses never make it back. So at a time \nwhen we are trying to create jobs in America, help Americans get back \nto work and strengthen their businesses, the House wants to pass a \ncontinuing resolution with zero money for these economic development \ngrants that chambers of commerce and other conservative organizations, \nas well as nonpolitical organizations, believe are very effective.\n  So, please, if you are going to vote for the House position, don't go \nhome and pat yourself on the back and say you took care of disaster \nvictims. You might have filled up the FEMA fund temporarily, but you \nhave not left here doing the job I think we need to do.\n  The third point I want to push back on--and I know my time is \nlimited--is this comment last night by several Members of the House \nthat we have offset disaster relief before. Yes, we have,\n\n[[Page S5853]]\n\nbut not, to my knowledge, in the immediate aftermath of the storms. As \nthese things have gone on over years--for instance, 4 years after \nKatrina we were trying to find money to rebuild one of our big military \nbases that collapsed, so we funded that through Defense and we found an \noffset. But that wasn't within the first couple of weeks of Katrina. \nThat was after 4 years, and we couldn't find the money and we really \nwanted to find it. So there are ways you can offset sometimes in the \ndistant future.\n  I am going to remind people that after Katrina, in the first 3 weeks, \nthe Federal Government funded $66 billion without an offset. After the \ncollapse of the Twin Towers, we funded $40 billion, and sent that to \nNew York after the collapse of the Twin Towers. After 2004, which was a \nvery terrible year for Florida, this Congress sent $2 billion within a \nfew weeks of four hurricanes hitting Florida. Had we not done that, \nthat State would be in a very serious economic downturn now. It never \ncould have recovered from four hurricanes in 1 year. They didn't hit \nLouisiana, they didn't hit Texas, they didn't hit Alabama. All four of \nthem hit Florida. Did we bellyache about it? Did anyone say: Let's run \nup to Washington and find a $2 billion program that is not working and \ncut it out so we can go help the people in Florida? Absolutely not. We \nsent the money to Florida, and I know they were grateful for it. That \nmight be one of the reasons Senator Rubio--who was not in the Senate \nthen but now is--has voted for this position, because he knows. He \nremembers.\n  I don't know what the House is going to do, and I most certainly \ndon't think we need to shut the government down over this debate, but \nit is a very important debate to be having. I am proud to be leading \nthe effort, along with many Democrats and some Republicans who are \nsaying, in the aftermath of a year that was one of the worst on record, \nwe do not need to find the offsets now.\n  I hope the House will stand strong and beat back that position, \nbecause it is not right today, it is not going to be right tomorrow, \nand it is not right for the future.\n  I just hope we can prevail.\n  Later on, when we are looking to figure out how to pay for all this, \nwe have time over the next year or year and a half or 2 or 3 or even 4 \nyears as we work on moving our deficit down. All of this is going to \nhave to be paid eventually. But I believe very strongly that we must \nnot think it is OK to get into a pattern of, when disaster strikes, \ninstead of opening shelters, instead of giving people immediate relief, \nthe first thing the leadership of this country does is run to \nWashington and try to gut several other programs overnight or quickly \nor without thought before we can fund disasters. That is not the way we \nshould operate.\n  I thank the Chair for being very considerate and giving me this extra \ntime. I thank my colleagues; I know others want to speak. Again, we \nhave a whole document here, which I have shown before, of projects in \nall of our States that have been absolutely shut down because we have \nrun out of money. The only programs that are being funded are real \nemergencies on the east coast. Everything else in Missouri, Louisiana, \nCalifornia, and Texas has been shut down to fund what is happening on \nthe east coast. This is no way to run a railroad. Let's get disaster \nrelief now.\n  I hope the House will reconsider their position. I thank the chamber \nof commerce for coming out strongly to remove that offset. Again, let's \nsee if we can find some money for USDA--Agriculture--community \ndevelopment block grants, and economic development block grants. If \nthey insist on doing it 6 weeks at a time, which I don't agree with, at \nleast put in a little more money for these other programs so we do not \nshut down, and we will come back here in 6 weeks or 8 weeks and figure \nit out.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/22/senate-section/article/S5853-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5853]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide Taiwan with critically needed United States-built \n multirole fighter aircraft to strengthen its self-defense capability \n           against the increasing military threat from China)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SALE OF F-16 AIRCRAFT TO TAIWAN.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Department of Defense, in its 2011 report to \n     Congress on ``Military and Security Developments Involving \n     the People's Republic of China,'' found that ``China \n     continued modernizing its military in 2010, with a focus on \n     Taiwan contingencies, even as cross-Strait relations \n     improved. The PLA seeks the capability to deter Taiwan \n     independence and influence Taiwan to settle the dispute on \n     Beijing's terms. In pursuit of this objective, Beijing is \n     developing capabilities intended to deter, delay, or deny \n     possible U.S. support for the island in the event of \n     conflict. The balance of cross-Strait military forces and \n     capabilities continues to shift in the mainland's favor.'' In \n     this report, the Department of Defense also concludes that, \n     over the next decade, China's air force will remain primarily \n     focused on ``building the capabilities required to pose a \n     credible military threat to Taiwan and U.S. forces in East \n     Asia, deter Taiwan independence, or influence Taiwan to \n     settle the dispute on Beijing's terms''.\n       (2) The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) conducted a \n     preliminary assessment of the status and capabilities of \n     Taiwan's air force in an unclassified report, dated January \n     21, 2010. The DIA found that, ``[a]lthough Taiwan has nearly \n     400 combat aircraft in service, far fewer of these are \n     operationally capable.'' The report concluded, ``Many of \n     Taiwan's fighter aircraft are close to or beyond service \n     life, and many require extensive maintenance support. The \n     retirement of Mirage and F-5 aircraft will reduce the total \n     size of the Taiwan Air Force.''\n       (3) Since 2006, authorities from Taiwan have made repeated \n     requests to purchase 66 F-16C/D multirole fighter aircraft \n     from the United States, in an effort to modernize the air \n     force of Taiwan and maintain its self-defense capability.\n       (4) According to a report by the Perryman Group, a private \n     economic research and analysis firm, the requested sale of F-\n     16C/Ds to Taiwan ``would generate some $8,700,000,000 in \n     output (gross product) and more than 87,664 person-years of \n     employment in the US,'' including 23,407 direct jobs, while \n     ``economic benefits would likely be realized in 44 states and \n     the District of Columbia''.\n       (5) The sale of F-16C/Ds to Taiwan would both sustain \n     existing high-skilled jobs in key United States manufacturing \n     sectors and create new ones.\n       (6) On August 1, 2011, a bipartisan group of 181 members of \n     the House of Representatives sent a letter to the President, \n     expressing support for the sale of F-16C/Ds to Taiwan. On May \n     26, 2011, a bipartisan group of 45 members of the Senate sent \n     a similar letter to the President, expressing support for the \n     sale. Two other members of the Senate wrote separately to the \n     President or the Secretary of State in 2011 and expressed \n     support for this sale.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) a critical element to maintaining peace and stability \n     in Asia in the face of China's two-decade-long program of \n     military modernization and expansion of military capabilities \n     is ensuring a militarily strong and confident Taiwan;\n       (2) a Taiwan that is confident in its ability to deter \n     Chinese aggression will increase its ability to proceed in \n     developing peaceful relations with China in areas of mutual \n     interest;\n       (3) the cross-Strait military balance between China and our \n     longstanding strategic partner, Taiwan, has clearly shifted \n     in China's favor;\n       (4) China's military expansion poses a clear and present \n     danger to Taiwan, and this\n\n[[Page S5854]]\n\n     threat has very serious implications for the ability of the \n     United States to fulfill its security obligations to allies \n     in the region and protect our vital United States national \n     interests in East Asia;\n       (5) Taiwan's air force continues to deteriorate, and it \n     needs additional advanced multirole fighter aircraft in order \n     to modernize its fleet and maintain a sufficient self-defense \n     capability;\n       (6) the United States has a statutory obligation under the \n     Taiwan Relations Act (22 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.) to provide \n     Taiwan the defense articles necessary to enable Taiwan to \n     maintain sufficient self-defense capabilities, in furtherance \n     of maintaining peace and stability in the western Pacific \n     region;\n       (7) in order to comply with the Taiwan Relations Act, the \n     United States must provide Taiwan with additional advanced \n     multirole fighter aircraft, as well as significant upgrades \n     to Taiwan's existing fleet of multirole fighter aircraft; and\n       (8) the proposed sale of F-16C/D multirole fighter aircraft \n     to Taiwan would have significant economic benefits to the \n     United States economy.\n       (c) Sale of Aircraft.--The President shall carry out the \n     sale of no fewer than 66 F-16C/D multirole fighter aircraft \n     to Taiwan.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, yesterday I came to the floor and spoke \nabout my intention to offer this amendment, which is now pending before \nthe Senate, which would require the U.S. Government to sell 66 F-16C/D \naircraft to the Government of Taiwan pursuant to our responsibilities \nunder the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, passed with bipartisan support \nof the Congress and signed into law by President Jimmy Carter. Under \nthis law, it is the responsibility of the U.S. Government to provide \nour ally Taiwan with sufficient defensive weapons in order to defend \nitself against any possible aggression by Communist China or from any \nother source. I spoke at some length about this yesterday, and I won't \nreprise all of those arguments.\n  At the outset, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \n3 letters--1 signed by 45 Senators supporting this sale of F-16s to \nTaiwan and 2 separate letters from Senator Lugar, the ranking member of \nthe Foreign Relations Committee, and Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, \nfor a total of 47 Senators who are on record as supporting this sale.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 26, 2011.\n     President Barack Obama,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We are writing to express serious \n     concern about the military imbalance in the Taiwan Strait. To \n     maintain peace and stability in the Strait, it is critical \n     that your administration accept Taiwan's Letter of Request \n     (LOR) and move quickly to notify Congress of the sale of 66 \n     F-16 C/D aircraft that Taiwan needs in order to modernize its \n     air force.\n       Successive reports issued by U.S. and Taiwanese defense \n     authorities clearly outline the direct threat faced by Taiwan \n     as a result of China's unprecedented military buildup. \n     Beijing presently has more than 1,400 missiles aimed at \n     Taiwan, and China is in the process of deploying next \n     generation Chinese and Russian manufactured ships, fighter \n     aircraft, and submarines. Military experts in both Taiwan and \n     the United States have raised concerns that Taiwan is losing \n     the qualitative advantage in defensive arms that has long \n     served as its primary military deterrent against China.\n       Taiwan desperately needs new tactical fighter aircraft. \n     Within the next decade Taiwan will retire 70% of its fighter \n     force structure. Its F-5s have reached the end of their \n     utility, its Mirage fighters lack parts and life-cycle \n     support, and its Indigenous Defense Fighters are being \n     converted to a trainer role. Additionally, Taiwan's existing \n     145 F-16 A/B fighters all require a mid-life upgrade. With F-\n     16s already in its inventory, Taiwan is seeking to combine \n     its fighter fleet around a single airframe with the \n     commensurate cost and operational benefits.\n       We are deeply concerned that further delay of the decision \n     to sell F-16s to Taiwan could result in closure of the F-16 \n     production line, and urge you to expedite this defense export \n     process before the line closes. Without new fighter aircraft \n     and upgrades to its existing fleet of F-16s, Taiwan will be \n     dangerously exposed to Chinese military threats, aggression \n     and provocation, which pose significant national security \n     implications for the United States.\n       The Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) of 1979 directs both the \n     Congress and the President to make decisions on arms sales to \n     Taiwan based solely on the ``judgment of the needs of \n     Taiwan,'' and we believe that Taiwanese pilots, flying \n     Taiwanese fighter aircraft manufactured in the United States, \n     represent the best first line of defense for our democratic \n     ally, while presenting no offensive threat to China.\n       We urge you to act swiftly and provide Taiwan with the F-16 \n     C/D aircraft that are critical to meeting our obligations \n     pursuant to the TRA and to preserving peace and security in \n     the Taiwan Strait.\n           Sincerely,\n         Robert Menendez, James Inhofe, Jim Webb, Jon Kyl, Joseph \n           I.

Hillary R. Clinton,\n     Secretary of State, U.S. Department of State, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Clinton: The issue of U.S. defense equipment \n     sales to Taiwan has now become an urgent matter. Taiwan has \n     legitimate defense needs, and its existing capabilities are \n     decaying. Replacement of its tactical aircraft is warranted, \n     is not provocative and is justified.\n       While it has acquired some Mirage aircraft, Taiwan has \n     acquired more than 400 tactical aircraft (F-16A/Bs and F-5s) \n     sold and produced in Taiwan from the United States. But there \n     have been no new sales of needed aircraft to Taiwan in many \n     years. Approved transactions involved only lower-level sales \n     and support for its Indigenous Defensive Fighter (IDF)--an \n     aircraft that the Defense Intelligence Agency has assessed \n     faces ``limited combat range and payload capacity [which] \n     restrict its effectiveness in air-to-air combat.''\n       Given the decrepit state of Taiwan's F-5s, the service life \n     issues associated with its IDF, and a growing problem faced \n     by all recipient countries in obtaining affordable and \n     sustainable access to spare parts for Mirages, I am very \n     concerned that if the Administration does not act favorably \n     on Taiwan's outstanding Letter of Request (LOR) for sales of \n     F16C/D aircraft, Taiwan will be forced to retire all of its \n     existing F-16A/B aircraft in the next decade, leaving it with \n     no credible air-to-air capability. Since Taiwan already has \n     many U.S. F-16 aircraft, replacement and augmentation of its \n     existing fleet would not affect the qualitative and \n     quantitative military balance in its region, and would also, \n     in turn, greatly assist the U.S. industrial base.\n       Any reasonable approach to Taiwan's existing tactical \n     aircraft requirements includes both sustainment of its \n     existing F-1 6A/Bs, but also, sales of new F-16C/Ds. Limiting \n     assistance only to upgrades of F-16A/Bs exacerbates both near \n     and long term air-to-air challenges due to the fact that a \n     substantial number of Taiwan's deployed F-16A/Bs would have \n     to be removed from service in order to undergo upgrades.\n       Over a year ago, Assistant Secretary of State for Political \n     Military Affairs Andrew Shapiro assured the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations that your Department would undertake an \n     extensive and honest discussion with the Foreign Relations \n     Committee regarding Taiwan. Such consultations have yet to \n     occur. In my view, a sensible place to start would be with \n     Taiwan's existing tactical aircraft capability, aside from \n     its other air defense challenges.\n       I am still awaiting proposed dates from the Department for \n     the initiation of these discussions. In order to be able to \n     produce needed F16C/Ds and deliver them by 2015, or even \n     sooner should Taiwan move quickly, an Administration decision \n     is needed in 2011 to act favorably on the F-16C/D request. I \n     am particularly interested in the Department's responses to \n     key questions: What are the major issues associated with \n     approval of this LOR? Why is the Administration apparently \n     unwilling to act on it? What are the risks and benefits in \n     agreeing to the sale?\n       Presently, we have not received any clear and consistent \n     information from the State Department regarding this matter, \n     and I believe it is time to engage in a meaningful \n     consultation with this Committee on Taiwan.\n       I look forward to your prompt consideration of this letter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Richard G. Lugar,\n     Ranking Member.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 13, 2011.\n     President Barack Obama,\n     The White House, Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: I am pleased to join with 47 of my \n     Senate colleagues in urging that your administration move \n     expeditiously to notify Congress of the sale of 66 F-16 C/D \n     aircraft that Taiwan needs in order to modernize its air \n     force.\n       Within the next decade Taiwan will retire 70% of its \n     fighter force structure. Its F-5s have reached the end of \n     their utility, its Mirage fighters lack parts and life-cycle \n     support, and its Indigenous Defense Fighters are being \n     converted to a trainer role. Additionally, Taiwan's existing \n     145 F-16 A/B fighters all require a mid-life upgrade. With F-\n     16s already in its inventory, Taiwan is seeking to\n\n[[Page S5855]]\n\n     combine its fighter fleet around a single airframe with the \n     commensurate cost and operational benefits.\n       The Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) of 1979 directs both the \n     Congress and the President to make decisions on arms sales to \n     Taiwan based solely on the ``judgment of the needs of \n     Taiwan,'' and I believe that Taiwanese pilots, flying \n     Taiwanese fighter aircraft manufactured in the United States, \n     represent the best first line of defense for our democratic \n     ally, while presenting no offensive threat to China.\n       Moreover, I am deeply concerned that further delay of the \n     decision to sell F-16s to Taiwan could result in closure of \n     the F-16 production line, and urge you to expedite this \n     defense export process before the line closes.\n       I urge you to act swiftly and provide Taiwan with the F-16 \n     C/D aircraft that are critical to meeting our obligations \n     pursuant to the TRA and to preserving peace and security in \n     the Taiwan Strait while strengthening America's economy by \n     keeping the F-16 in production.\n           Sincerely,\n\n\n                                               Lisa Murkowski,\n\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as I said, yesterday I spoke about the \nlegislation Senator Menendez and I had offered. That is a stand-alone \nbill; this is now an amendment to this pending trade bill. I do believe \nit is appropriate for us to consider this matter in the context of this \ntrade bill because, of course, we all recognize and common sense would \ntell us that selling to foreign customers the things that we grow here \nin America or that we manufacture in America sustains jobs right here \nat home. Indeed, we have circulated among various offices what the \nimpact on jobs would be all across the country when it comes to the \nsale and manufacture of these F-16s. A lot of jobs would be created in \nAmerica at a time when unemployment is intractably and unacceptably \nhigh. But that is not the main reason I believe this amendment is so \nimportant.\n  Let me back up to say that yesterday the President did announce that \nhe approved military exports to Taiwan, but I wish to address first the \ninsufficiency of the response.\n  Yesterday, Congress was officially notified by the Defense Security \nCooperation Agency that the administration had approved a retrofit for \n145 F-16A/B aircraft--aircraft Taiwan already owns. So this is not \nunprecedented. We have already sold Taiwan A/B versions of the F-16. \nBut, as the administration acknowledges by saying these need to be \nupdated and retrofitted, these are older aircraft and need to be \nmodernized in order to be effective.\n  There is no question that these upgrades on the existing 145 F-16 \naircraft are necessary, but it is not sufficient to deal with the \nairpower needs of our Taiwanese allies. You can see by this chart the \ndisparity between what the People's Republic of China has--about 2,300 \noperational combat aircraft versus 490 operational combat aircraft--\nowned by the Government of Taiwan.\n  But what I think the President's decision fails to acknowledge is the \nfact that many of the aircraft being flown now in Taiwan by the Taiwan \nAir Force are French Mirage aircraft which are some 20 years old or \nAmerican F-5 aircraft which were first delivered in 1975 through 1985 \nbut which are now virtually obsolete. It is for that reason the sale of \nthese additional 66 F-16C/D version aircraft is so important--to \nreplace those obsolete French Mirages and F-5s.\n  Taiwan's request had been, as I indicated earlier, not for the \nretrofit or for new aircraft, but they wanted both. The administration \nshould have approved both, and that is exactly what 47 Members of this \nSenate stated--the bipartisan letters I have admitted into the Record--\nencourage the administration to do to make the right decision and to do \nboth. But since the administration chose only to go the retrofit route \nfor existing aircraft, I think it is important for us to send a message \nand to exercise our authority under the Constitution to compel that \nsale.\n  There is a bigger point I would like to make as well. America's \ncredibility in East Asia and beyond is at risk by the administration's \ndecision yesterday. The President spoke at the United Nations earlier \nthis week and addressed many priorities of U.S. foreign policy. I am \nnot going to respond to each one of them because it was a 40-minute \nspeech, but my point is, the success of U.S. foreign policy in every \nregion of the world depends on the credibility of the U.S. Government--\nwhether we stand by our friends and whether we keep our commitments or \nwhether we will abandon our support for other democracies like Taiwan. \nThe answer to that question is of enormous interest not only to the \npeople of Taiwan, to whom we have pledged in this 1979 law, the Taiwan \nRelations Act that I mentioned earlier, but also to the people of \nIsrael, to the people of Eastern Europe, to the people of Japan and \nSouth Korea, and to the fledgling democracies now in Iraq and the \npeople of Afghanistan, to people who are suffering from oppressive \nregimes all across the world who want the same basic freedoms we do and \nwho share our values in self-government.\n  What kind of message does it send from America to these friends of \nfreedom? What kind of message does the Senate send by denying our ally \nTaiwan the purchase of military exports that they need and that they \nrequested? And what message can the U.S. Senate send to reassure our \nallies in Taiwan as well as people watching everywhere around the world \nwith our credibility on the line?\n  I want to reiterate that this is a bipartisan matter. This is not a \npartisan issue at all. Republicans and Democrats alike have supported \nthe Mutual Defense Treaty signed by President Eisenhower in 1954, and \nthe Taiwan Relations Act was supported with bipartisan support and \nsigned by President Jimmy Carter in 1979, and it remains the law of the \nland. That states specifically that the United States will provide to \nTaiwan the defense articles necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain \nsufficient self-defense capabilities in furtherance of maintaining \npeace and stability in the Western Pacific region.\n  We know the U.S. military has been stressed by repeated deployments \nin Afghanistan and Iraq and commitments around the world. So why in the \nworld wouldn't we want to improve the capacity of the Taiwanese \nGovernment to defend itself and reduce any potential burden on the \nUnited States in the process?\n  I want to remind my colleagues what sufficient defense capabilities \nmeans. This is part of a memorandum from President Ronald Reagan in \n1982, and I think it is worth reading.\n\n       It is essential that the quantity and quality of the arms \n     provided Taiwan be conditioned entirely on the threat posed \n     by the PRC [People's Republic of China]. Both in quantitative \n     and qualitative terms, Taiwan's defense capability relative \n     to that of the PRC will be maintained.\n\n  That was the understanding of Congress, that was President Reagan's \nunderstanding, and that was our explanation to the Chinese Government \nto reassure them about the purpose for these military sales--to provide \na defensive capability, not an offensive capability but a defensive \ncapability.\n  Why is Taiwan asking for these aircraft? Well, as I indicated \nearlier, Taiwan's air defense capabilities are nearly obsolete, while \nChina's military capabilities are growing at an alarming rate. But air \ndefense is not just a game of numbers; it is about the quality of the \naircraft as well.\n  So what about the quality of Taiwan's existing forces? Well, \naccording to the Defense Intelligence Agency in an unclassified report \nlast year, many of Taiwan's fighter aircraft are close to or beyond \nservice life and many require extensive maintenance support.\n  So China's capabilities are clearly newer, and they are growing and \nfocus clearly on intimidating Taiwan and, yes, even the United States.\n  China's official press agency reported in March that the People's \nRepublic of China will increase its military budget this year by more \nthan 12 percent. That is on top of an increase last year of 7.5 \npercent. But the Pentagon estimates that China is not being transparent \nwith regard to its military spending. In fact, China's official and \npublic budget of $90 billion is far less than the $150 billion that \nthey actually spent.\n  So whom does China intend to intimidate by this growing military \npower? Here is what the Pentagon had to say in its 2011 report to \nCongress called ``Military and Security Developments Involving the \nPeople's Republic of China.'' The Defense Department observed that \nChina continued modernizing its military in 2010, with a focus on \nTaiwan contingencies. The Pentagon also noted that China's Air Force \nwill remain primarily focused on\n\n[[Page S5856]]\n\n``building the capabilities required to pose a credible military threat \nto Taiwan and U.S. forces in the East Asia.''\n  Some say we shouldn't look at our policy with Taiwan in a vacuum, and \nI agree with that. We should look at it in the larger context, both of \nthe region and our strategic relationship with China. We know many of \nChina's neighbors in that region are concerned about the military \nbuildup and the increasingly bellicose rhetoric from the government.\n  Last year, China claimed the South China Sea as a core interest, \nwhich unsettled Vietnam and the Philippines and Indonesia and other \nnations in the region. China has renewed its longrunning border dispute \nwith India, and, frankly, it continues to be an enabler, as we know, of \nthe nuclear threat in North Korea. We know Pakistan's Defense Minister \npublicly discussed the possibility of China building a naval base in \nPakistan, which is already home to a new strategically important port \nat the mouth of the Gulf of Oman.\n\n  So it is important to look at the impact of China's growing military \nstrength and its bellicose rhetoric on the whole region because, \nfrankly, the disparity I pointed out earlier between the capability of \nthe People's Republic of China when it comes to air power and that of \nTaiwan is a destabilizing influence in the region. Why in the world \nwould we want to create a destabilizing condition in that region as \nopposed to a stable one that is in our best interests and that is in \nthe best interests of our allies?\n  We can tell that the Communist Chinese Government is trying to \nintimidate the United States from living up to its responsibilities. \nLast week, China's top official newspaper used a lot of unnecessary \nlanguage on the subject of the arms sales to Taiwan. They called those \nof us on Capitol Hill who are supporting this ``madmen,'' and said we \nwere ``playing with fire'' and said there would be a ``disastrous \nprice'' if we continued to support our allies in Taiwan. They would \nlike nothing better than for us to turn our backs on our allies in \nTaiwan, just like other bullies around the world would love for America \nto retreat and to pull back in our support for self-governing peoples \neverywhere.\n  I do not think we want to send the message--I know I do not want to \nsend the message--that the United States will give in to this kind of \nintimidation. We should pass this legislation to send a clear message \nto China and other nations around the world who are beating their \nchests and growing in military strength and posing destabilizing risks \nthat the real madmen are those who think America will abandon our \nfriends and allies and our principles and our long-range and \nlongstanding strategic interests in the stability of East Asia.\n  As I indicated earlier, there are a lot of people watching what we \ndo. It would greatly reassure our allies and partners around the world \nif we acted in a responsible way consistent with our legal obligation \nunder the Taiwan Relations Act, which apparently the administration has \ndeclined to do.\n  Many of my colleagues remember what President Clinton did in 1996. He \ndeployed two aircraft carrier battle groups during the Taiwan Strait \ncrisis then. That crisis developed when China tried to intimidate \nTaiwan, once again, on the eve of its first free Presidential election \nby conducting this series of so-called military exercises that included \nthe firing of missiles just a few miles north of Taiwan.\n  President Clinton responded by ordering the largest U.S. military \nforce since the Vietnam war to deploy to the region, including carrier \nbattle groups led by the USS Nimitz and the USS Independence. America's \nshow of resolve and strength did not escalate that crisis, it diffused \nit--exactly what would happen here if we made this sale to Taiwan. It \nwould send, as that did then, a welcome signal to the region.\n  According to an article in the current issue of Washington Quarterly, \nfollowing that crisis the region's confidence in the United States \nsoared. Japan, Singapore, the Philippines, and other nations in the \nregion all bolstered their security ties with the United States.\n  Isn't that what we want? If America is going to be an undependable \nally, there is no real benefit to people aligning their interests with \nours and joining with us in these sorts of strategic security ties.\n  The Taiwan Strait crisis was one of the real foreign policy successes \nof the Clinton administration, but the authors of that same article \nconclude that ``forsaking Taiwan now will likely have the opposite \neffect.''\n  I want to return to a subject I brought up earlier. In addition to \nour other interests, which are many, and having us seen as being a \ndependable ally to our friends and keeping our commitments, this bill \ndeserves the support of the Senate for other reasons as well. In \naddition to our longstanding bipartisan consensus on Taiwan, the \ngrowing gap in military capabilities between Taiwan and China, China's \naggressive behavior toward its neighbors and the United States' \ncredibility with our allies and free people everywhere, this is a jobs \nbill.\n  This is a policy that creates jobs. If we sell this American-made \nproduct to our friends and allies who are willing to pay for it--and it \nwill not cost one dime in taxpayer dollars--it creates jobs at home. \nThis chart shows, in yellow, all of the States where jobs would be \ncreated and sustained as a result of these sales. This map shows every \nState in which direct and indirect employment from this export sale of \nF-16s to Taiwan is projected to be at least 60 person-years of \nemployment, which is the equivalent of 10 American workers employed \nfull time for 6 years.\n  As you can see from this map, 32 States will have that level of job \ncreation or more, making this F-16 sale to Taiwan a coast-to-coast job \nengine. In fact, according to a report by the Perryman Group, the \nrequested sale of F-16C/Ds to Taiwan ``would generate some $8.7 billion \nin output.'' That is something the American economy could use now? \nFurthermore, it would directly support more than 23,000 jobs. That is \nsurely something we need now.\n  As I said, these jobs don't cost the American taxpayer a dime. Apart \nfrom the paperwork and processing necessary to approve the deal, these \nare private sector jobs, and it is exactly the private sector that we \nneed to take off again.\n  The one thing the Federal Government, the U.S. Government, needs to \ndo perhaps more than anything else is simply get out of the way and let \nthese Americans continue to stay on the job--and collect, in addition, \nan estimated $768 million in Federal tax revenue. That is something \nelse we could use, more tax revenue coming in from more employed \nworkers so we can close the gap in our $1.5 trillion annual deficit and \nbegin to work our way toward reducing the debt, which is more than $14 \ntrillion.\n  I thank, on a bipartisan basis, the Senators who have supported this \nlegislation. I note that of the 47 signatories on the letters that have \nbeen made part of the record supporting this sale, 13 are from our \nDemocratic friends across the aisle. This is truly a bipartisan effort.\n  For all the reasons I have mentioned, I hope we will vote yes and \npass this important amendment to this bill.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown of Ohio). Who yields time? The \nsenior Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the book of Ecclesiastes contains wisdom \nthat should guide us today, and I am paraphrasing. This is not exactly \nwhat the Scriptures say: For everything there is a season and a time \nfor every matter under the Sun. Or, to state it more colloquially, \nthere is a time and place for everything. Some times are better than \nothers; some places are better than others.\n  My colleague from Texas offered an amendment that required the \nPresident to sell F-16 fighter jets to Taiwan. I, respectfully, note \nthe debate on this trade adjustment assistance bill is not the \nappropriate time, season, or place to raise this issue. This is a trade \nbill. This is not about sales of F-16s to Taiwan or to any country. It \nis a wholly different subject. It has nothing to do with what we are \ntrying to debate today and focus our attention on so we can get this \nlegislation passed.\n  The adoption of an amendment on an unrelated and controversial issue \nof Taiwanese arms sales would derail the carefully negotiated \nbipartisan agreement on trade assistance. If this\n\n[[Page S5857]]\n\namendment would pass of itself, irrespective of the merits, it would \nderail passage of trade adjustment assistance because it would be an \namendment. So it would go over to the other body, they would have to \nwork with it, maybe concur with it, include maybe other amendments, and \nit would, perhaps, come over here again.\n  We have an agreement between the House and Senate and White House \nwhere we pass both trade adjustment assistance and then we can pass the \nfree-trade agreements and most everybody wins. This amendment \nultimately would imperil passage of the three pending trade agreements \nwith Colombia, Panama, and South Korea.\n  I know my good friend--I suspect; that would be presumptuous of me--\nbut I suspect my good friend from Texas is very much in favor of those \nthree trade agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. I know a \nnumber of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle also support the \nsale of F-16s to Taiwan.\n  But to paraphrase Ecclesiastes, this is an issue that should be \ndebated at another time. Not here. At another time.\n  Just 9 days ago, Senator Cornyn introduced legislation on the F-16 \nissue that tracks the substantive language of this amendment. That \namendment has been referred to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nwhere it belongs. That is, in fact, the right way to deal with this \nissue, through consideration by the committee of jurisdiction.\n  In the spirit of Ecclesiastes, I, therefore, urge my colleagues to \nsave this issue for another day to vigorously discuss and debate it, to \nlook at the merits, to see what makes sense and does not make sense. \nBut that is for another day. We should vote against the amendment at \nthis time. It could be a very meritorious issue, I am not passing \njudgment on it, but this is not the time and place. If it were adopted, \nit would severely jeopardize the passage of trade adjustment assistance \nand also the free-trade agreements which are supported by many Members \nof this body.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 650\n\n  I would like to speak on another matter, and that is the Thune \namendment. The Thune amendment looks backwards to the past when we \nshould be looking forward to the future. I understand Senator Thune \nwill offer his amendment very soon today.\n  The bill before the Senate restores urgently needed job training for \nAmerican workers impacted by trade. It also clears the path for \nCongress to approve our job creating trade agreements with Colombia, \nPanama, and South Korea. The bill reflects the understanding among the \nSenate, the House and the President, about how to move the trade agenda \nforward. But the Thune amendment looks, not forward, it looks \nbackwards. It calls for a new government report on the harm from \ndelaying the pending free-trade agreements. No one disputes the harm; \nthat is not the issue. The issue is how quickly can we adopt them.\n  Harm; that is, delay, is well documented, and there is blame to go \nall around, so we should not waste scarce resources to score political \npoints; that is, it is not worth time trying to point the finger of \nblame anywhere. Rather, it makes much more sense to get the job done; \nthat is, pass the free-trade agreements. And passage of the trade \nadjustment assistance will mean passage of the free-trade agreements. \nSo we should instead use our resources to identify foreign trade \nbarriers that impede U.S. exports. We should help small businesses \nsucceed in global markets, and we should monitor whether our trade \npartners are abiding by the rules.\n  So let's look forward, not to the past. Let's avoid further delay of \nour trade agreements. Let's defeat this amendment and send to the House \na clean bill on trade adjustment assistance.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 651\n\n  Speaking on another amendment--first was the Cornyn amendment, second \nwas the Thune amendment, and now is the Rubio amendment, which will be \nvoted upon soon--I urge my colleagues to vote against Senator Rubio's \namendment. It would limit trade adjustment benefits only to workers who \nlose their jobs as a result of imports from a country with which the \nUnited States has a free-trade agreement. The United States has only \nabout 17 free-trade agreement partners. We do not limit our trade just \nto those countries. There is a lot of trade around the world. The \nUnited States trades with virtually every country in the world, not \njust to countries with which we have free-trade agreements. In fact, we \nexport to nearly 200 countries around the world. Remember, we have only \n17 free-trade agreements, but we export to nearly 200 countries around \nthe world.\n  Under this amendment, the Rubio amendment, workers who lose their \njobs as a result of trade with 8 of our top 10 trade partners, \nincluding China and Japan, would not receive TAA benefits. Why? Because \nthere is no free-trade agreement with those countries. It makes no \nsense whatsoever. In fact, the Rubio amendment would say to workers \naround the country, if you lose your job due to trade with China, you \nare out of luck. If you lose your job due to trade with India, you are \nout of luck. Only if you lose your job with a country with which we \nhave a free-trade agreement do you get assistance.\n  The Rubio amendment would significantly, therefore, limit the number \nof workers who get help under trade adjustment assistance. Why would we \nwant to do that? Why would we want to do that at a time when 14 million \nAmericans are looking for work? Trade adjustment assistance helps \nAmericans get the important retraining they need to find good-paying \njobs, and now is not the time to shut out those Americans.\n  So for these reasons--and also because passage of the Rubio amendment \nwould jeopardize passage of trade adjustment assistance and jeopardize \nthe passage of free-trade agreements--I urge my colleagues to oppose \nthat amendment as well.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 651 to Amendment No. 633\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I call up Rubio amendment No. 651 and ask \nfor its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Rubio] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 651 to amendment No. 633.\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To limit eligibility for trade adjustment assistance to \n workers who are laid off because of an increase in imports from, or a \n shift in production to, a country with which the United States has a \n                    free trade agreement in effect)\n\n       On page 5 of the amendment, between lines 6 and 7, insert \n     the following:\n\n     SEC. 212.

Mr. President, we have had this important conversation \nthis week about trade policy in the United States, and it is an \nimportant one. Clearly, one of the great things that will help us grow \nour economy in the years to come is further free trade. As we have \nthese pending free-trade agreements--and most everyone around here I \nhave run into says they are in favor of, including the President, the \none with South Korea, the one with Panama, the one with Colombia--there \nhas been a prerequisite put in place by those in charge in the Chamber, \nand that is we deal with the TAA issues. That is why we are on the \nissue today, which clearly has been linked, free-trade agreement and \nthe TAA law.\n  I wish to talk a little bit about the free-trade agreements because \nwe are continuing to wait for them to be sent down to us. These \nagreements would increase U.S. exports by billions of dollars and \ncreate jobs here in the United States. For example, there are exports \nof about $12 billion annually, adding about $14 billion to the U.S. \neconomy. These are real numbers.\n  The South Korea agreement alone, for example, is estimated to add as \nmany as 70,000 American jobs. These benefits are not realized because \nthe President has not submitted these for approval to this body or to \nthe Congress. The debate we are having is not a new one. The trade \nadjustment assistance, or TAA, has been a policy of the United States, \nfor better or worse, since the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.\n  Interestingly, this policy was first proposed by Senator John F. \nKennedy when he aptly titled it the Trade Adjustment Act. The initial \ngoal was to respond to perceived effects of trade policy. In essence, \nyou enter into a trade policy, such as a free-trade agreement with \nanother country, and American workers may lose their job in the short \nterm, but you create a fund to help them transition to what you hope \nwill be the new jobs created by the free-trade agreement. As you create \nthis new relationship with new countries and new economies, the effect \nof it is while some jobs may be lost, those jobs are replaced with new \nopportunities and new jobs. In the process of that transition, between \nthe job you once had and the job you hope to have in the future as a \nproduct of free trade, you create this fund to help workers adjust from \npoint A to point B. That is the purpose of it. That is why it has been \nincluded in things such as the Trade Act of 1974. It was ushered in \nwith the North American Free Trade Agreement under President Clinton. \nIt was also included in the Trade Act of 2002, the last authorization \nof the trade promotion authority so vital to promoting the free-trade \npolicies in the United States.\n  From its inception, TAA has been linked to free trade. Basically the \nunderstanding is when you enter into free-trade agreements with another \ncountry, there are short-term disruptions and you need a fund available \nto help workers transition during the disruption. Very simply put, you \nhave a job, maybe it goes overseas in the free-trade agreement, but a \nnew job is created in America as a result of that agreement and we are \ngoing to help you transition through this fund.\n  That was the purpose of it until 2009 when under the stimulus bill \nthat has been changed and has been vastly expanded. Now in order to \nqualify for it, all you need to prove is that somehow your job or the \ncompany you work for has moved operations potentially overseas. That is \na big problem in America. It is a big problem in Florida.\n  If you talk to people, they will tell you, we are losing our jobs. \nOther countries are taking our jobs. Jobs are going overseas. There are \na lot of reasons for that. The first is unfair trade practices. This \nbody should address that, beginning with China and other nations that \nunfairly deal with the United States, whether it is manipulation of \ntheir currency, whether it is dumping, among other things they do that \nare unfair, not to mention some of these nations have no environmental \nregulations, no protections for their workers or wages. There are \nincredible amounts of headwinds we face with regard to that. That \nshould be dealt with. It should be dealt with seriously through public \npolicy, and it is something we should look at. That is not a temporary \nissue. That is permanent. That is ingrained and entrenched. Unless we \ndeal with the issues involved in that and those unfair trade practices, \nno temporary measure like TAA is going to help us deal with that. We \nhave to deal with that on a permanent basis. That was not the purpose \nof the TAA.\n  The second thing we need to deal with is some of the impediments we \nare creating ourselves. That is why I am encouraged when I hear \nbipartisan talk of tax reform, things that will make it easier for \npeople to build in the United States and open businesses here. Also, \nregulatory reform. Let there be no doubt that while there are \nsignificant currency manipulation problems and significant trade \nimpediments in terms of unfair trade practices by other countries, some \nof the wounds are self-inflicted through a regulatory and a Tax Code \nthat makes it difficult for people to do things and do business in the \nUnited States.\n  Again, I am encouraged when I hear bipartisan talk about regulatory \nreform and tax reform. These are the kinds of things that can deal \npermanently with a permanent and entrenched problem. That is not the \npurpose of TAA. Today we stand here considering this as a gateway issue \nbecause we have been told we have to pass this bill before we can get \nto the free-trade agreements, and so clearly it links the two. If we \nare going to link the two, we have to make it very clear that this sort \nof existence was created for the define purpose and the specific \npurpose of helping people to transition because of a disruption created \nin their job status as a result of a free-trade agreement.\n  This is a pretty simple amendment. It says this assistance is only \navailable to those workers who lose their jobs to a country we have a \nfree-trade agreement with because this is designed to deal with the \nunintended consequences and the temporary disruptions that might be \ncreated by a free-trade agreement with another country. So that is what \nthe amendment does, and I am hoping to have the support of as many of \nmy colleagues as possible in putting this program back into its \nhistorical purpose.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. I wanted to speak generally about the matter that is \nbefore the Senate on trade adjustment assistance. I especially \nappreciate the work that has been done by the Presiding Officer from \nOhio over many years, including his time in the House of \nRepresentatives and here in the Senate as well.\n  I want to make two comments, one about one of the amendments we will \nconsider today by the Senator from Florida, but also to speak more \nbroadly about this legislation. When the Senate is considering \nlegislation, we do not every day do a good job of trying to put \nourselves in the position of other people, workers and people who are \nsuffering through a tough economy. When the Senate is doing its best \nwork, part of the way we get there is by trying to figure out and \nunderstand, as best we can, what it is like to lose a job or suffer \nfrom--we are dealing with natural disasters and natural disaster \nassistance as well--but try to understand the people we represent. I \nknow we cannot do that with full knowledge because many of us have \nnever had to suffer through that kind of experience. I think it is \nimportant we try our best to\n\n[[Page S5859]]\n\nunderstand what this legislation is all about.\n  This is legislation which basically says the American people, through \nour government, are going to do everything possible to help folks when \nthey lose a job, and especially when they lose a job as a result of \nunfair foreign competition. I have seen it in Pennsylvania for decades. \nWe have been getting hammered because we have not often stood up for \nour own workers. We have not fought battles to help them get through \nthe horror of job loss because of unfair foreign competition. All we \nare saying is we are going to try to help them to cross that bridge \nfrom losing that job in many cases they had for years or decades. So, \nNo. 1, we are going to try to help them in that crisis.\n  No. 2, we are going to do everything we can to retrain them. They \nhave to go to the training. This is not something we can hand to them. \nThey have to work at the training and prepare themselves. I think most \nAmericans believe when someone is in crisis, you try to help them, but \nyou also want to make sure they can help themselves through training \nand retraining.\n  I think we should consider here what it would be like for one of us. \nEach of us has a salary and has health care here in the Senate and we \nhave a pension plan, so we are doing pretty well. Imagine what it is \nlike, though, to work in a plant for decades doing the same work, and \nyou do that work with pride and dignity; you take care of your family; \nyou work in a job that has a sustaining wage. You do that for decades, \nthe same job virtually every day, every year, but you have two things: \nYou have the ability to provide for your family and you have some \ndignity. Imagine when a hurricane, or unfair foreign competition, which \nour government has not done enough to fight against, sweeps through \nyour factory and wipes you out before you can even think about it. It \nwipes out every job, or a lot of jobs. Sometimes physically it lifts \nthe equipment off the floor and moves it to another country. That is \nwhat we are talking about here. So someone who has been doing this work \nfor decades, in some cases, and all of a sudden they are not only \nwithout a job--that is bad enough--but they are faced with the prospect \nof not being able to transition because they have been in the same job \nand they have not had access to education or training that would allow \nthem to transition. It would be nice if we had an economy everyone \ncould transition, that you could get an educational level--and this is \nwhat it should be if we are doing the right thing providing this--that \nwe have an educational level and an exposure to an immersion in skills \nand other advantages that will allow you to absorb that shock, allow \nyou to pivot when someone with unfair trade wipes out your job. That is \nthe ideal. That is what we hope we can develop in our education, our \ntraining system, training strategies. That is why workforce development \nis so important, so people have the broadbased skill level and they can \nabsorb those shocks. But a lot of people can't.\n  All we are saying with trade adjustment assistance is we are going to \nhelp you with what we hope will be a short-term crisis for you and your \nfamily, and we are going to try to provide the training opportunities.\n  We are going to try to provide training opportunities so people \ncannot just get a new job but maybe can get a job because they have \ndeveloped a skill that will allow them to have the same income for \ntheir families that they are used to but at least--at least--provide \nsome short-term help for folks, and then give them skills for the long \nterm. That is what this is all about. This is not complicated. It is \nall about that.\n  I understand we have a lot of folks here who have concerns about the \nlegislation. They have concerns about one or the other aspect of it. \nBut I hope we would not limit our horizons to helping all the folks who \nare adversely impacted.\n  For example, if we look at one of the provisions--this is why I want \nto get to the amendment itself that we are talking about. Here is what \nit does: The underlying amendment covers workers whose firms shift \nproduction to any country--any country--including China or India, not \njust countries with which the United States has entered into a free-\ntrade agreement.\n  Look, I do not think we should be treating workers we are trying to \nhelp under trade adjustment assistance any differently if they do not \nfall within that category of only the 17 countries with which we have \nfree-trade agreements. So I think we should make sure that--of course, \nthis is one of the changes the underlying amendment will validate, that \nwe are trying to help anyone in that category who has been so adversely \naffected. So I do not think we should limit it to just 17 countries. We \ntrade with countries all over the world, and we should do our best \nwithin the limits of this legislation to make sure it applies to a lot \nmore than 17 countries, and that is the effect of the underlying \namendment.\n  The Rubio amendment would only cover workers who lose their jobs due \nto trade with those 17 countries with which we have a trade agreement. \nIn some ways--this is my own opinion on it--it puts the burden on the \nworkers to somehow prove they are in the right category when the burden \nshould be on us to make sure we are doing everything possible to help \nthem--again, short-term help for the crisis, long-term help by way of \nskill development.\n  We have 14 million people in the country out of work; 14.4 million is \nwhat I saw at last count. Of the 14.4 million people, almost 4.5 \nmillion have been out of work for 1 year or more. Just imagine that. \nThat is bigger than the population of a number of States. In \nPennsylvania we have 12.5 million people. If we can just consider more \nthan one-third of a State's population being out of work for more than \n1 year.\n  So we have a lot of people who are out of work a long time, and they \nare especially disadvantaged if they happen to work in those industries \nthat are particularly sensitive to or adversely impacted by trade with \ncountries that are not playing by the rules.\n  We are going to have a discussion today, as well, about the \nintroduction of currency legislation as it relates to China, where a \nnumber of us, including the Presiding Officer--and it is a bipartisan \nbill--think we have to get much tougher as it relates to Chinese \ncurrency policy. If China cheats, that costs jobs. So we should be very \ntough in those instances, and I think we can be, and do it in a \nbipartisan way.\n  But I would hope, with a program that works, we would be doing \neverything possible to keep it expanded for people affected by \ncountries beyond just those 17. I know the Senator from Florida is \nconcerned about those workers. I just hope we can keep the provisions \nin place to protect all our workers as best we can and not just start \nto limit it to 17 countries at a time when we need help for folks--\nshort term with the crisis but longer term with skill development so \nthey can transition and start a new worklife, even if they are 45 or 50 \nor 55 years old. A lot of these folks are in that age category.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I would like to speak in support of \nSenator Rubio's amendment and thank him for helping us to focus on the \noriginal intent of trade adjustment assistance.\n  Obviously, we want to help folks who are unemployed or displaced \nbecause of trade. But we have to realize where we are with our country \nright now. We are using borrowed money and sometimes printed money in \norder to help people. So we have a responsibility to taxpayers and to \nsome form of fiscal sanity, as well as to those who have lost their \njobs. What Senator Rubio is trying to do is to restore those original, \nresponsible boundaries of trade adjustment assistance to make sure this \nprogram is focused on those who are hurt by trade agreements.\n  The discussion is somewhat odd in the first place in that for several \nyears the President has been telling us these trade agreements are \nactually going to increase jobs in our country, expand exports--which I \nbelieve they will--but to use this as an excuse and to hold these trade \nbills hostage for several years in order to fund a program which \nduplicates many other programs--because we need to remember, those who \nare put out of work in our country today have not only regular \nunemployment benefits but they have been extended much beyond what we \nhave done before, and there are dozens of State and Federal training \nprograms now that duplicate each other. Unfortunately, many of them \nhave been\n\n[[Page S5860]]\n\nfound to be ineffective. But for us to lay another layer of duplication \non top of that under the guise of showing compassion, I think we also \nhave to make sure we are being responsible.\n  So we want to help folks who are unemployed, but we do need to make \nsure we are being responsible to the taxpayers. As I said, the trade \nadjustment assistance was originally designed to help those who were \nput out of work. And, believe me, coming from a textile State such as \nSouth Carolina, trade with China and other countries has displaced a \nwhole lot of textile workers. Retraining is very important. The new \njobs that moved in required more technical capabilities. But what we \nhave found, as we have seen how our good intentions have hit the ground \nin South Carolina and around the country, is that even our own Office \nof Management and Budget rated TAA as ineffective.\n  The program costs taxpayers $1.3 billion in just this year, in 2011, \nand we are finding that what it was intended to do it is not doing. It \nis not well managed. It is not helping the people it is supposed to \nhelp. Since its inception, the program has gone from a focus on those \nwho lose their jobs because of trade to all kinds of institutions, \ntraining groups, and, frankly, fraud, duplication, and not helping the \nfolks it is intended to help.\n  If we want to know how far out of bounds the program has gone, we all \nknow the story of Solyndra solar company that got over $\\1/2\\ billion \nfrom the American taxpayers and then went bankrupt and we lost our \nmoney. The workers now at Solyndra are applying for TAA benefits not \nbecause trade put them out of business, but, frankly, a coordinated \neffort of our government and Solyndra management have put these people \nout of work. But we can see, if they are now using a program called \ntrade adjustment assistance to add to their unemployment benefits, the \nprogram is no longer within the bounds that it was intended.\n  If we are going to tell the taxpayers this program is intended for \none thing, we need to make sure it is. What we are talking about now \nare trade agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. No one has \ncome and told us these agreements are going to cost American jobs. Yet \nwe have to pass more spending programs and add on to a program that has \nbeen proved ineffective in order to add jobs in America. That is not \ngood policy. I do not think it is good politics.\n  I am thankful Senator Rubio is taking the leadership to shine a \nspotlight on the need to help people while at the same time being \nresponsible to taxpayers. We do not need to be funding additional \nunemployment for every company that goes out of business and was not \nproperly managed. If we keep the program focused, it will help the \npeople we need to help while, again, being responsible for hard-working \nAmericans who are paying the taxes.\n  I encourage my colleagues to take a look at this amendment. Federal \nprograms that continue to expand and expand and expand, they become \nless and less effective; they cost more and more money. If we are going \nto continue this program, let's do it responsibly.\n  Mr. President, I yield back and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 634\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I want to speak briefly again on my \namendment as to the sale of F-16C/Ds to Taiwan and respond to the \ncomments of the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, \nSenator Baucus, who said this was neither the right bill nor the right \ntime. I understand every manager of a bill wants a clean bill; in other \nwords, they do not want amendments. They would like to bring it here \nand have the Senate pass it without any changes whatsoever. But that is \nnot the way our system works.\n  Indeed, it is actually urgent we get this matter settled in a \npositive way because, as I mentioned earlier, there are 23,000 jobs in \nAmerica that depend on this sale--many of them in the production line \nin Texas--but there are jobs all over the United States that depend on \nthis.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na document titled ``Projected Nationwide Employment Impact of \nProduction of 66 F-16C/Ds for Taiwan.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n PROJECTED NATIONWIDE EMPLOYMENT IMPACT OF PRODUCTION OF 66 F-16C/DS FOR\n

firm), ``An Assessment of the Potential Impact of the Lockheed Martin\n  F-16 Program on Business Activity in Affected States and Congressional\n  Districts''\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. This is a very interesting document because it breaks \ndown on a nationwide basis where jobs would come from or be affected by \na refusal to sell these F-16s. In California, for example, 11,399 job-\nyears.\n  If you are wondering, like I was, what a job-year is, that is one \nperson employed for 1 year. So that is pretty significant.\n  In Connecticut, 5,876 job-years; in Ohio--I know the current occupant \nof the chair, the distinguished Senator from Ohio, will be interested \nto know that Ohio would see 10,577 job-years as a result of this sale.\n  So as manufacturing is important in the State of Ohio, it is \nimportant in the State of Texas. Why would we not want to see these \njobs created by this sale?\n  Mr. President, I have another document which is a letter signed by \n181 Members of the House of Representatives to the President of the \nUnited States endorsing this sale. I ask unanimous consent it be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 1, 2011.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We are writing to express our concerns \n     about the military imbalance in the Taiwan Straight. In order \n     to maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, we \n     believe it is critical for the United States to sell the \n     government of Taiwan all the F-16 C/D it requires. We \n     respectfully request that your administration move quickly to \n     announce its support for such a sale and submit the required \n     Congressional Notification for a sale as soon as possible.\n       Successive reports issued by U.S. and Taiwanese defense \n     authorities outline the threat Taiwan continues to face, \n     including the continued military buildup by the People's \n     Republic of China. For example, Beijing has more than 1,400 \n     missiles aimed at Taiwan and continues to add to this total. \n     China is forging ahead and deploying next generation military \n     technology. Military experts both in Taiwan and in the United \n     States have raised alarms that Taiwan is losing its \n     qualitative advantage in defensive arms that have long served \n     as a primary military deterrent.\n\n[[Page S5861]]\n\n       Due to impending changes within Taiwan's force structure, \n     we respectfully urge a timely resolution to the aircraft sale \n     issue. Within the next decade Taiwan will retire 70% of its \n     fighter force and without new fighter aircraft and upgrades \n     to its existing fleet of F-16s, Taiwan's situation could \n     become quite precarious.\n       As you know, the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 (TRA) states \n     that it is U.S. policy ``to consider any effort to determine \n     the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means . . . of \n     grave concern to the United States.'' We remain deeply \n     concerned that delays in the decision on the sale of F-16s to \n     Taiwan and subsequently notifying Congress of their sale \n     could very well result in closure of the F-16 assembly line. \n     In addition to enhancing Taiwan's security, approval of the \n     sale would support thousands of American jobs--especially \n     well-paying jobs in the manufacturing sector.\n       Thank you for your consideration. We look forward to your \n     reply.\n           Sincerely,\n         Shelley Berkley, Phil Gingrey, M.D., Gerald E.

But I want to just say we \nneed to understand what would happen if this production line of F-16s \nwas shut down. The people who work on that production line would have \nto be let go or reassigned, actually exacerbating the high unemployment \nthat we know is intolerably high. Once the production line of a \nsophisticated aircraft like the F-16 is shut down, we cannot decide, \nwell, next year or the year after we are going to start up again--\nunless we are going to add tremendously to the cost. It makes it far \nless likely it will ever get made because of the costs and because of \nthe sheer magnitude of the effort of trying to get this production line \nback together and all the people who were employed there back to work.\n  So that is why, to respond to the distinguished chairman of the \nFinance Committee, the manager of the bill, it is so important in terms \nof the timeliness. I agree there is a time for everything, but the time \nfor this is now.\n  I will just say, finally, as I indicated earlier, this is a \nbipartisan measure, as demonstrated by the 47 Senators who signed \nletters to the President urging the sale; 13 Democrats, along with the \nremainder being Republicans.\n  In the House, this letter I mentioned earlier which has been made \npart of the Record, there are 181 Members of the House--a bipartisan \nlist--I actually think that if the manager of the bill, the chairman of \nthe Finance Committee, would accept this amendment, it would enhance \nthe votes for the very bill he wants to see passed out of the Senate, \nperhaps later today.\n  In conclusion, I ask unanimous consent that the time allocated for \nSenator Thune be reserved within the time allocated to the minority and \nthat quorum calls be charged equally between the majority and minority \nbill time first.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the short \ntime I am asking for as in morning business not be taken from either \nside in this agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me say, as far as the subject is \nconcerned right now, I am very proud to have one of the first \nsignatures on this effort. It is good for every reason the Senator from \nTexas mentioned. On top of that, we have allies we are dealing with. We \nhave the employment situation. I know this is going to be successful. I \nappreciate all the effort that has gone forth.\n\n\n                       Honoring Our Armed Forces\n\n                  Specialist Christopher David Horton\n\n  Today, I wish to recognize and pay tribute to Army SPC Christopher \nDavid Horton from Owasso, OK. That is home of the Rams in case people \ndid not know. Chris was born in Tulsa on October 1, 1984. He was \ndeployed to Afghanistan with over 2,000 Oklahoma National Guard \nsoldiers from the 45th Infantry Brigade Combat Team. There were \nactually 3,000 initially in this deployment. Some of them actually went \nto Kuwait at the last minute.\n  He was deployed to Afghanistan. This combat team, the 45th, has \nprobably had more deployments than anyone else, although this was \nChris's first deployment. His unit was attacked by enemy forces in \nPaktia Province on September 9, 2011. Chris and two of his fellow \nsoldiers, SGT Bret Isenhower and PFC Tony Potter, died of injuries \nsustained from that firefight.\n  He would have turned 27 next week, on October 1. Chris attended the \nMissouri Military Academy in Mexico, MO, and graduated in 2003. He \nexcelled both militarily and academically during his 6 years at \nMissouri Military Academy. He was the 2nd platoon leader his senior \nyear, captain of the rifle team, on the honor roll, earning him the \nAcademic Fourragere Award.\n  Chris lived a remarkable life, driven by service and excellence. He \noften spoke of his desire for America to excel. He was a business owner \nand a volunteer police officer. He was extremely patriotic and very \npassionate in his love for America and for its freedoms, knowing they \nhave to be protected.\n  Chris was an accomplished recreational shooter and a professional \nsponsored shooter through the U.S. Shooting Academy of Owasso, OK. Some \nof his marksmen awards include the Gus Hadwiger Award of 2009. He \nreceived first place in novice pistol in the Oklahoma National Guard, \nfirst place in novice pistol in the Governor's Twenty Match. This guy \nwas very good. He excelled and was among the very best. That was \nsomething he enjoyed.\n  But in addition to shooting--this is kind of interesting because \nthings bond us together. I came so close to meeting him, but I never \nactually did. But one of the things we had in common is we\n\n[[Page S5862]]\n\nare both avid fishermen. He loved fishing. That is one of the things he \nenjoyed very much. Every opportunity he had, he would fish both ocean \nand freshwater.\n  His younger brother Nick said:\n\n       He was the best big brother I could ever have asked for. He \n     taught me how to drive a car and how to fish.\n\n  That pretty much tells it all. Chris's mother Cherie Horton said:\n\n       My son's passion his whole life was to be a part of the \n     military.\n\n  He wanted to be part of the military.\n\n       He loved his country, and he really wanted to serve his \n     country. He was absolutely made to be a solder.\n\n  This is a mother speaking. Chris enlisted in the Oklahoma National \nGuard in 2008, was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 279th Infantry \nRegiment of the 45th Brigade of the Army National Guard.\n  He attended basic training at Fort Benning, GA, became a sniper-\nqualified infantryman, and to no one's surprise, graduated at the top \nof his class. Chris leaves behind his parents, Cherie and David Horton, \nhis brother Nicholas, sister Tenley, and his wife Jane Horton. Chris \nmet Jane while attending the Kings College in New York City. Jane said \nit was Chris's fiery passion and their mutual love for politics that \nbrought them together.\n\n       He was the most honorable man I'd ever met in my life. \n     That's why I snagged him and we were engaged within 2 months. \n     We were married very fast.\n\n  She knew what she was out after. I know this is true because my staff \nand I got to know Chris through his wife Jane. She was an intern for \nme. She worked in my office, and we had these exchanges all the time. \nAs could be expected, Jane took a personal interest in operations in \nAfghanistan. She worked with my legislative staff, responsible for \nmilitary and veterans affairs.\n  During her time in Washington, she coordinated a campaign that \nresulted in over 20 care packages being sent to the Oklahoma National \nGuard Infantry Combat Brigade. I can tell everyone this, having been \nover there at a time when a lot of these care packages come in, we \nknow, as we go across this country in helicopters, a lot of these \npackages, even though the people at home do not know it, are dropped to \nkids on the ground who love what we are doing there.\n  So I think Jane represents the best asset our military has at its \ndisposal; that is, the military spouses. Her zeal and dedication are \nnot uncommon attributes for military spouses who ``hold down the fort'' \nwhile their loved ones are deployed.\n  I had looked forward to meeting Chris during my upcoming trip to \nAfghanistan another week from now. I had a meeting during the break, \nthe recess, in Collinsville, OK, and Jane was there. We talked about \nhow we were going to meet up with Chris in my upcoming trip to \nAfghanistan. I had looked forward to meeting him during that trip.\n  While this personal conversation will not happen, I am committed to \nmaking Chris's desire that our Nation be led down the right path a \nreality. Chris lived a life of love for his family, friends, and \ncountry. He will be remembered for his commitment to and belief in the \ngreatness of our Nation.\n  Here are some of the comments posted online in honor of his life. I \nthink it is kind of neat to read a lot of these. They come from \nassorted different people. Some are members of the family, some are \nnot. Here is one of them:\n\n       God's got a good warrior up there with him now.\n\n  Another one:\n\n       I want to thank the families of this wonderful young man \n     who was willing to give his life for our freedom. May no one \n     in America take this act lightly. Love and prayers to all of \n     the family and friends.\n\n  Here is another:\n\n       Christopher David Horton was the kind of young man who \n     would do anything for anybody.\n\n  Another one:\n\n       He is a hero--each and every servicemen/women are--they \n     protect our freedoms and without them we cannot. Thank you \n     Specialist Christopher Horton--may you rest in peace. Prayers \n     being said for your family.\n\n  But here is my favorite one. It is actually by his brother Nick. He \nsaid:\n\n       You will be missed more than anything brother, especially \n     on the range, you always gave me a run for my money. Till we \n     meet again in heaven!\n\n  That is kind of great. This tough fight took place and took the life \nof Chris. But make no mistake, Chris's sacrifice made a difference and \nwill continue to make a difference not just in Afghanistan but here in \nthe United States.\n  We are safe and our country is secure because of Chris and all the \nservice men and women. We have to continue in our unwavering support \nfor them. Although each servicemember we lose hurts, it is because of \nour connection to Jane that my staff and I are particularly affected by \nthe loss of SPC Chris Horton.\n  I extend the deepest gratitude and condolences to Chris's family. I \nwill say something I will be criticized for--I always am. I have always \nbeen a Jesus guy. I find out, of course, that so is Chris. So when \nsomething such as this happens, even though we did not personally meet, \nwe are brothers. So, in a case such as this, we do not say: Goodbye, \nChris. We say: We will see you later.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 634\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, are we under a time limit to discuss \nthe Cornyn amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Cornyn has 33 minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I want to speak on the Cornyn amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be listed as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, the Cornyn amendment is important \nbecause the President of the United States has refused to allow the \nsale of 66 F-16C/D model aircraft to Taiwan. Taiwan is trying to \nmodernize its air force, and it is not an issue of our not selling to \nTaiwan. They have bought the A/B models, so they have 145 F-16s in the \nearlier model, the A/B. They are trying to get the next generation of \nthem.\n  This is a foreign policy issue, but also a domestic issue, because \nthese are very important sales--the 66--for the F-16 line to be \ncontinued, and the hope is that this sale will go through. It is very \nimportant so that we can continue to make them for ourselves but also \nsell them to our allies. Most certainly, Taiwan is an ally and has used \nand likes the F-16. Taiwan has also used the French Mirage, but the \nFrench Mirage has a shortage of parts for Taiwan. They are trying to \nconsolidate, with F-16s, American jobs and American fighters.\n  Now they are running into the roadblock of the administration. Within \nthe next decade, Taiwan will retire 70 percent of its fighter force \nstructure. Its F-5s have reached the end of their utility. The Mirage \nfighters lack parts and life cycle support, and their indigenous \ndefense fighters are being converted to trainers. Taiwan's existing 145 \nF-16A/B fighters all require a midlife upgrade. With the F-16s already \nin the inventory, they are seeking to combine their whole fighter fleet \nwith the single airframe, with the cost and operational benefits and \nthe efficiencies that one fighter frame would give them.\n  We are concerned that further delay of the decision to sell the F-16s \nto Taiwan could in fact close the production line. That is why 45 \nmembers of the Senate have signed a letter to President Barack Obama, \nasking him to go forward with this sale of 66 F-16C/Ds to Taiwan.\n  The Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 directs Congress and the President \nto make decisions on arms sales to Taiwan based solely on the judgment \nof the needs of Taiwan. We believe that the Taiwanese pilots flying \nTaiwanese fighter aircraft manufactured in the United States represent \nthe best first line of defense for our democratic ally, and do not pose \nany threat to China. There is no offense here. The Taiwan air force \njust patrols the Taiwan Strait to assure its safety and security.\n  I rise in support of the amendment that has been offered. It is very \nimportant. Bipartisan support in Congress\n\n[[Page S5863]]\n\nfor working with our ally, Taiwan, without any offense to China is \nimportant and we need to assure that it remains solid and firm.\n  I hope our colleagues will help us with the amendment that will \nassure this sale goes through, that we keep the commitments we have \nmade, and that we have the ability to sell to Taiwan; otherwise, they \nwill surely look for other countries to buy from.\n  That is not in our interest. Here we are trying to create jobs in \nAmerica. It is certainly in our strategic interest to have our ally buy \nour product, so we can do the training and work with them and have a \nstrengthening of not only our trade but our defense alliance. It just \nmakes sense to go forward. It is not as if we don't sell to Taiwan. \nThey have already bought 145 F-16s. They now want 66 more of the newer \nversion.\n  It is time for us to do what is right for our country, for jobs in \nour country, for our national defense, and for the keeping of our \ncommitments and ties with our ally, Taiwan. I urge support for the \nCornyn amendment. Since so many Democrats have signed a letter to the \nPresident, I hope that will translate into votes for the amendment so \nit will be clear that the bipartisan support in the Senate for the F-16 \nsale to Taiwan is accomplished.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KIRK. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      U.S. Assistance to Pakistan\n\n  Mr. KIRK. I rise to commend the Senate Appropriations Committee, \nunder the leadership of Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Graham, on a \ndecision we made yesterday as a full committee with regard to U.S. \nassistance to Pakistan.\n  In short, what the Senate did was to remove nearly all the guarantees \nof assistance funding to the Pakistani Government, based on new \ninformation and statements made by senior U.S. Government officials on \nthe Pakistani Government and its intelligence service's--called the \nISI--support for an organization called the Haqqani network, one of the \nmost dangerous terrorist organizations on Earth.\n  We have learned from statements by our U.S. Ambassador in Kabul, U.S. \nAmbassador in Islamabad, Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, and \nthe Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that the Haqqani network has \nbecome the principle threat to the Afghan Government, to U.S. troops \nserving in Afghanistan, and to our NATO allies.\n  We have seen the U.S. Embassy in Kabul and NATO Headquarters were \nattacked on September 12. At least 16 people were killed, including 5 \nAfghan police officers and 11 civilians, in an attack organized and put \ntogether by the Haqqani network under the direct protection and support \nof Pakistan's Government itself. Just a few days earlier, at Combat \nPost Sayed Abad in Wardak Province, on September 10, over 77 U.S. \nsoldiers and 17 Afghans were injured by a massive truck bomb likely put \ntogether by the Haqqani network, probably in Afghanistan, for an attack \non Americans. This June 28, at the Hotel Intercontinental in Kabul, 12 \nAfghans were killed and 8 were wounded during a nighttime attack, also \nlikely sponsored by the Haqqani network. That same network attacked \nKabul Bank on February 19, with over 40 people killed.\n  The Haqqani network is a different branch of the Taliban. The Taliban \nlargely does not have a safe sanctuary in Afghanistan or Pakistan. They \nhave surrendered much of their operational control and initiative in \neastern Afghanistan to the Haqqani network.\n  The reason why the Haqqani network has become so powerful and so \nstrong is because it is protected by the Government of Pakistan itself, \na claimed ally of the United States that receives substantial \nassistance provided by this Congress.\n  We have seen a very clear picture emerge from the administration \ndirectly connecting the Government of Afghanistan to the Haqqani \nnetwork in support and assistance that has been involved in the death \nof American service men and women and our NATO and Afghan allies.\n  This started out on September 13, when one of our most able Foreign \nService Officers, a real hero of Foreign Service, our Ambassador in \nAfghanistan, Ryan Crocker, highlighted Pakistan support for the Haqqani \nnetwork and its role in attacks in Afghanistan.\n  Four days later, our U.S. Ambassador, his counterpart in Islamabad, \nCameron Munter, gave a very important and I think brave interview on \nPakistani radio, highlighting the role of the Pakistani Government \nsupport for this terrorist organization and its attacks on U.S. service \nmen and women in Afghanistan.\n  The following day, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, during a \nmeeting with Pakistan's Foreign Minister Khar, also highlighted the \ngovernment support for this terrorist organization and its attacks on \nAmerican citizens serving in uniform in Afghanistan.\n  Finally, on September 20, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nAdmiral Mullen, in a presentation before the Carnegie Endowment for \nPeace, also highlighted Pakistan's official government support for the \nISI and the Haqqani network.\n  In testimony today in the Senate Armed Services Committee, Admiral \nMullen reiterated these claims, stating the ISI, Pakistan's Government, \nhad provided explicit support for an attack on the U.S. Embassy in \nKabul and NATO headquarters. The Haqqani network, supported by the \nGovernment of Pakistan, is also responsible for attacks on Afghan and \nIndian construction efforts in the Kabul-Gardez Road at Camp Chapman, \nan attack that killed seven CIA employees and enabled the kidnapping of \nAmerican and British journalists.\n  Within Pakistan, the Haqqani network serves as a trusted intermediary \nbetween the Pakistani intelligence service and terrorist organizations \nactive also against the Indian democracy in Kashmir and throughout the \nsubcontinent. These include Lashkar-e-Taiba and Tehrik-e Taliban \nPakistan, organizations responsible for the 2008 and 2011 Mumbai \nattacks.\n  Secretary Clinton, Secretary Panetta, Admiral Mullen, General Allen, \nAmbassador Crocker, Ambassador Munter, and the Congress, Republicans \nand Democrats here in the Senate, now all agree that the Pakistani \nGovernment's complicity and longstanding history of support and \nprotection for the Haqqani network is a major impediment of the U.S. \ngoal of achieving safety and security in Pakistan and Afghanistan. The \nPakistani Government should end its protection of the Haqqani network.\n  The Haqqani network is a wholly owned subsidiary of the ISI, and is \nresponsible for the death of American service men and women and \ncivilians in Afghanistan. Both the United States and Pakistan would \nbenefit from a strong and stable Afghanistan, but the ISI part of the \nPakistani Government disagrees and supports terror. That is why it is \nimportant that the Senate made this decision to remove all but the \ncounterterrorism accounts from Pakistan and to put in new language \nconditioning any extension of aid to Pakistan on cooperation against \nthe Haqqani network.\n  We will need to define what ``cooperation'' means, and I hope what it \nwill mean is, No. 1, a substantive and continuous reduction in Haqqani \nop tempo against U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, showing that \nnearly all of the attacks have been eliminated within the calendar year \nand, on top of that, authority or action by the United States or NATO \nallies to hit Haqqani targets in the frontier autonomous tribal area, \nwhere they have been protected to date.\n  Unless we can meet these two conditions, I believe the decision we \nhave made to remove the floors and stop the guaranteed funding for \nPakistan is a wise one. This is a rare moment in which the U.S. \nAmbassador in Kabul, the U.S. Ambassador in Islamabad, the Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Secretary of Defense, and Secretary of \nState have all said that the Pakistanis directly support terror through \nthe Haqqani network and it needs to stop. In these tough economic times \nwhere nearly all of the assistance under the legislation approved \nyesterday is in the overseas contingent operation account--which, \nremember, is all borrowed money to be provided to\n\n[[Page S5864]]\n\nPakistan--it should be done only if their policy of supporting the \nHaqqani network ends.\n  I am very glad the administration and now the Congress have spoken \nwith a clear voice. I only hope we hold our nerve because, otherwise, \nif we go by past policies of having mere Pakistani promises and \nofficial statements be the cause for releasing U.S. aid, we will repeat \nthe failures of the current policy. We need actual action. We need to \nunderstand that senior Pakistani officials--of their foreign ministry, \nof their intelligence service, and of their defense department--have \ndirectly lied to American officials. Only by action and cutting off the \nHaqqani network can we make sure that at least the U.S. taxpayer is not \nsupporting this terrorism.\n  I commend the action of the Foreign Operations Committee yesterday. I \ncommend that it was a bipartisan action. Now I hope we stick to our \nguns and make sure we do not provide assistance to Pakistan unless they \nstop supporting this most dangerous now terrorist operation operating \nagainst our men and women in uniform serving in Afghanistan.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak \nas in morning business for up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I first rise to speak for 30 \nseconds on the trade adjustment assistance legislation and the \namendment Senators Baucus and Casey and I have been working on, to make \nsure that trade adjustment is available to workers who have lost their \njobs because of service or manufacturing and trade competition--only \nnot real competition, because so often the deck is stacked far too much \nagainst American workers and American companies. Other amendments \nnotwithstanding, I don't want to see this restricted to only those \nworkers who have lost their jobs from unfair competition from countries \nwe do not have trade agreements with. It sounds almost silly to have to \nsay that. We need to keep this program focused on all workers who need \nsome assistance, who need to be retrained. They lost their jobs through \nno doing of their own.\n  It suggests the next issue, and that is something a bipartisan group \nof Senators has raised. Republican Senators, Senator Burr, Senator \nGraham, Senator Sessions, Senator Snowe, and Senator Collins, and \nDemocratic Senators, Senator Schumer, Senator Stabenow, I am one of the \nfive, Senator Hagan, and Senator Casey--each of us has pushed for \nlegislation dealing with the problems of currency. The Chinese have \nclearly gamed the system.\n  We spent all this time on the budget deficit. It is certainly worth \naddressing in a big way. But we spend so little time on the trade \ndeficit, and the trade deficit cuts right into eliminating American \njobs.\n  Recent studies show that literally hundreds of thousands--some 2.8 \nmillion jobs have been lost to China since 2001, in a decade. Two-\nthirds of those were manufacturing jobs lost because of unfair trade \npractices, in part because of the way the Chinese game the system on \ncurrency. Our legislation says several things. One of the most \nimportant parts of this legislation is simply telling the U.S. \nGovernment, when it is doing an investigation on trade cases, it must \nconsider currency manipulation by the Chinese.\n  This will result, we know, in significant job growth in our country. \nIt will mean more exports of U.S. products to China because it takes \noff that advantage they have. It will mean American companies making \nproducts here can compete with Chinese competition trying to sell into \nour market--again because it takes away the unfair subsidies the \nChinese have had.\n  You do not have to go very many places--in West Virginia, in \nConnecticut, in Ohio--to see how many cases there are of products sold \nin this country that used to be made here that are now being made in \nChina. Currency is not the only reason but it is surely one of the \nreasons.\n  I will close with this, a brief story about a company in southwest \nOhio which manufactures paper. Until a decade and a half ago, the \nChinese, the People's Republic of China, did not even have a coated \npaper industry. That is the sort of magazine paper, glossy paper we are \nall familiar with. The Chinese did not even have the kind of technology \nto make that paper for a decade and a half. Since then, they started \ntheir industry. They buy their wood pulp in Brazil, they ship it a long \nway to China, they mill it in China, they ship it back to the United \nStates and they undercut American companies by underpricing American \ncompanies--southwest Ohio, in many cases, southern Ohio, American \ncompanies, and other places. They undercut them with price.\n\n  They tell me when you make paper, only 10 percent of paper costs are \nlabor costs. What that means is the Chinese are subsidizing in water \nand in credit, in land, in energy, and in labor, and in currency. We \nhave been somewhat successful in fighting back and showing that the \nChinese are cheating. But if we have that additional tool, they cannot \ngame the currency system, and we will not see the kind of job loss, the \nhemorrhaging of jobs in West Virginia and Ohio and all over this \ncountry.\n  American companies are some of the most efficient in the world. The \nworkers are the best in the world. We will be able to compete on a much \nmore level playing field. That is the importance of the legislation \nthat 10 Senators, 5 Democrats and 5 Republicans, are introducing. We \nspoke about it today. It is essential the Senate move forward on it.\n  I thank Senator Blumenthal for yielding me these 5 minutes and I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. (Mr. Manchin). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are not in morning business.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I will proceed, then, as in morning business.\n  First, I thank and commend the Senator from Ohio on his very \nimportant efforts on Chinese currency manipulation. I am proud to be a \ncosponsor with him on his legislation. I intend to introduce my own. He \nhas been a very stalwart advocate and champion of U.S. trade interests \nand deserves the thanks and commendation of this body and the American \npeople. I thank the Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                                 Israel\n\n  I rise today to restate at this crucial juncture my unwavering \ncommitment, as stated so eloquently by many in this body over the \nyears, to the United States-Israel relationship and America's \nunshakeable commitment to Israel's security.\n  I thank the President of the United States for his address to the \nUnited Nations, which very powerfully and courageously stated that \ncommitment. The President's strong message shows again that our shared \ninterests, as well as our friendship with Israel, are deep and \nenduring.\n  As my colleagues know all too well, the Israelis and Palestinians \nmust reach agreement through negotiations on the issues that divide \nthem, not through the United Nations. Israel has repeatedly endorsed a \ntwo-state solution that will sustain it as a Jewish and democratic \nhomeland. To be achievable, any lasting peace and any plan for peace \nmust acknowledge the real security concerns that Israel faces day in \nand day out and has faced throughout its history.\n  The President's powerful remarks at the United Nations were inspiring \nin a forum that has been repeatedly hijacked by dictators and despots \nfor the purpose of delegitimizing Israel and fomenting anti-Semitism. \nThe Palestinian Authority's bid for United Nations recognition is a \ndistraction from the hard work, the really hard work needed to achieve \npeace and find an equitable solution.\n  As the President said, ``The fact is peace is hard.'' To succeed, \n``peace depends upon compromise among people who must live together \nlong after our speeches are over.''\n  Tough compromises will have to be made by both the Israelis and the \nPalestinians. The United States is ready to assist both peoples in \ntaking necessary risks for peace, and Israel is willing to sit down and \ncommence those talks immediately with the Palestinians.\n\n[[Page S5865]]\n\n  The bid for United Nations recognition is also a distraction from the \ndeteriorating situation in the Middle East, where governments of the \nregion, both old and new, seem all too willing to use Israel as a \ntarget and as a scapegoat, rather than face the legitimate needs of \ntheir own people.\n  In Turkey, for example, the government has stretched to seek a \nconfrontation with Israel rather than address the humanitarian disaster \non its doorstep in Syria. In Egypt, the government honored those who \nattacked the Israeli Embassy in Cairo, rather than release from \ndetention their citizens arrested for advocating for democratic reforms \nand freedom. Most concerning to this Chamber, Iran's Government has \ndoggedly pursued nuclear weapons and threatens to destabilize the \nentire region. Nobody is fooled about the military dimensions of Iran's \nnuclear program.\n  On this day we do not yet know how the Palestinian Authority's bid \nfor statehood recognition at the United Nations will be resolved. I do \nknow my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will not be sidetracked \nfrom advocating for the hard work toward peace. By encouraging the \nPalestinian Authority to return to the negotiating table, which they \nhave refused to do, and by continuing strong United States-Israel \ndefense cooperation our Nation will deter those who would seek to \nachieve victory over Israel by either using the force of arms or \nmanipulating international institutions such as the United Nations.\n  By sending the Iran, North Korea, and Syria Sanctions Consolidation \nAct of 2011 to the President for his signature, we can do our part to \ncall attention to Iran's use of denial and deceit to advance its \nnuclear program. By passing a foreign operations appropriations bill \nfor fiscal year 2012 that aligns our assistance with our international \ncommitments--including over $3 billion in aid to Israel--this body \nwill, again, demonstrate its leadership in striving for peace.\n  Finally, I would be remiss if I did not call attention to the fact \nthat while each of us was free to hear the President's remarks, \nyesterday was and today remains another day that Gilad Shalit is held \nhostage by Hamas. As a nation founded on the unalienable right to \nliberty, we must repudiate those who seek to forge a nation while \ncontinuing to collaborate with his captors. I urge his release.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues and the President on all \nof these efforts. They are truly bipartisan. They unite us as a body \nand they unite the American people. I thank you.\n  I yield to the distinguished Senator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask to speak as in morning business for \nup to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I would like to thank my friend, the Senator from \nConnecticut. Let me add my voice to his. There is no better friend or \nstronger ally. This is one of the key relationships our country has. \nLike the Senator from Connecticut and the Presiding Officer and others, \nwe have a lot of things in this body we disagree with, but our firm \nsupport for Israel, particularly at a time when there is so much \nturmoil in that region, it is important the Senator from Connecticut, \nMr. Blumenthal, spoke on that issue.\n\n\n                     Recognizing Federal Employees\n\n  I am going to take a moment today to repeat something I do on a \nregular basis. It is something I inherited from the former Senator from \nDelaware, Mr. Kaufman, when he was here. He would, on a fairly regular \nbasis, come down and recognize the great work of individual Federal \nemployees.\n  We spend a lot of time in this body talking about what government \ndoes not do well and how we need to rein in and get our government in \norder. I know the Presiding Officer and I share those beliefs. There \nare an awful lot of good folks who work for our Federal Government day \nin and day out who do not get much recognition but provide incredibly \nvaluable service to literally 300 million Americans.\n  So following in Mr. Kaufman's footsteps, I come down and pick a \nFederal employee to recognize. I will get to this Federal employee in a \nmoment.\n  Let me just say we have already seen rumblings in the press of \nanother potential political brinksmanship around the end of the fiscal \nyear. I see my good friend, the Senator from Maryland, who, like me, a \nSenator from Virginia, has a disproportionate number of Federal \nemployees in our respective States. The Presiding Officer from West \nVirginia probably has a disproportionate number of Federal employees as \nwell.\n  Every time we get to that eleventh hour, we put all these Federal \nemployees' lives in limbo, and that is not fair. It is not right. Every \ntime we do this, we self-inflict upon this economy another effort \nimposed by us that slows our economic recovery. I know the majority \nleader and others are trying to work in good faith to make sure we do \nnot have another brinksmanship around the end of the fiscal year.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Let me thank my colleague from Virginia. He is absolutely \nright. We went through a pretty tough time a month ago when we reached \nan agreement on the funding levels. It should be a very simple process \nto get a continuing resolution passed that will extend the government \nbased upon the agreement that was reached just a month ago.\n  The Senator from Virginia is right about our Federal workforce. Our \nFederal workforce is doing more work with less people. They are \nsubjected to a 2-year pay freeze, which they were subjected to before \nwe had an agreement to deal with the deficit. For the sake of our \nFederal employees, for the sake of the people who depend upon their \nservice, and for the sake of our economy and for good governance, the \npassage of what we call a clean continuing resolution that allows us to \nwork out the individual appropriations bills should be beyond any \ndisagreement.\n  I thank the Senator from Virginia for his leadership not only on \nbehalf of Federal employees, but also on behalf of sensible budgeting \nso we do not have to go through this type of ordeal and put people \nthrough this unnecessary anxiety.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator from Maryland. I will now take a \nmoment in this continuing effort to recognize examples of the kind of \npeople who serve our government--oftentimes for not much recognition, a \nlot less pay and, candidly, some disdain from people on both sides of \nthe aisle.\n\n\n                        Honoring Alfonso Batres\n\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to honor Dr. Alfonso Batres, who is the \nchief readjustment counseling officer at the Veterans Health \nAdministration. He has direct oversight of 300 vet centers, 50 mobile \nvet centers, and over 1,900 vet center staff providing readjustment \nservice to war zone veterans and their families across the United \nStates. He has worked extensively to ensure vet centers--which are \nsmall storefront operations located throughout the country--are \naccessible to as many people as possible. His efforts led to nearly \n200,000 veterans and their families to visit vet centers a total of 1.2 \nmillion times in 2011 alone.\n  Dr. Batres has also expanded the scope of coverage for vet centers \nand worked to improve the quality of the services offered to veterans. \nFor example, he provided family bereavement service and the Combat Call \nCenter, which allows veterans to talk to other combat veterans about \nreadjustment issues they may be experiencing.\n  Dr. Batres' dedication to providing quality veteran-centric care has \nled to praise throughout the health care community. According to \nLawrence Deyton, a former Veterans Affairs colleague:\n\n       Dr. Batres' combination of vision and personal experience . \n     . . has translated into the Vet centers becoming the gold \n     standard, and a model for public health programs.\n\n  In an interview, Dr. Batres said:\n\n       The opportunity to serve veterans and their families as a \n     civil servant through the Vet centers program has been a \n     dream realized and an honor.\n\n  In 2009, when I first joined this body, I helped launch a \ncomprehensive study that evaluated the quality of care and benefits we \nare providing to our returning combat veterans, especially women who \nare affected by post-traumatic stress syndrome and traumatic brain \ninjury. I think we are very fortunate to\n\n[[Page S5866]]\n\nhave someone as dedicated as Dr. Batres working on these important \nissues.\n  I hope my colleague will join me in honoring the doctor, as well as \nall of those at the Department of Veterans Affairs, for their excellent \nwork today. I also am proud to recognize that Dr. Batres, as a \nVirginian and a Vietnam veteran, has dedicated 37 years to public \nservice.\n  As I was saying earlier, along with the Senator from Maryland, there \nwill be issues on which we disagree with our friends on the other side \nof the aisle. We have to have a way to argue, debate, and decide on \nthose disagreements, but let's make sure we do not put this country and \nour Federal employees in more--and, equally important, the 300 million \nAmericans who not only depend on those services that are provided, but \nmostly are about trying to recover in this economy--let's not have act \n3 of that kind of political brinksmanship which started in the spring \nand then over the debt crisis and now potentially at the end of this \nmonth, which are, in effect, self-inflicted wounds on our economy that \nis struggling so much to recover.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 651\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank Senator Rubio for offering his \nimportant amendment that will constrain spending on TAA by limiting TAA \nbenefits to workers negatively impacted by free trade agreements \nnegotiated by the U.S. Government.\n  As I explained in offering my amendment yesterday to tighten the \nstandard of eligibility for TAA, the expanded TAA Program will grow and \ngrow and cost more and more taxpayer money. The expanded TAA Program \nproposed by the chairman is no longer about trade policy but, rather, \nabout expanding a domestic spending program. The TAA Program proposed \nby our friends across the aisle extends TAA to services workers and to \nworkers impacted by shifts of production or services to any foreign \ncountry. In an integrated and rapidly expanding global economy, \nconceivably all business decisions made at home and abroad could \ntrigger TAA's generous benefits.\n  As I predicted at the beginning of this debate, many of my friends \nwho support TAA have argued that more people used the TAA Program when \nit was expanded in 2009; therefore, it must be working. I strongly \nreject this argument. Spending more money and certifying more workers \ndoes not mean a program is succeeding; it simply means the program is \nexpanding and costing more and more taxpayer dollars.\n  Proponents of an expanded TAA Program tell us there is a moral \nobligation for the government to help mitigate the costs from job \nlosses associated with increased imports and offshore outsourcing, \nwhich often occurs as a result of direct government policies, that is, \ntrade agreements. But why do we choose to reward some Americans who \nlose their jobs due to adjusting to some Federal policies--in this \ncase, trade policy--but not others? Even if one were to concede that \nthe Federal Government has some obligation to help those who lose their \njobs due to the trade policy actions of the United States, surely \nworkers who lose their jobs for reasons that have nothing to do with \nFederal Government actions should not receive these favorable TAA \nbenefits.\n  I have heard lots of talk about the improvements made in the 2009 TAA \nstimulus expansion. One word I do not hear much anymore is \n``globalization,'' because if you go back and look at the actual bill, \nthe 2009 stimulus TAA package was actually called TGAA, trade and \nglobalization adjustment assistance. The chairman has dropped the \n``globalization'' reference in the title of the TAA extension amendment \nwe are considering today, but the legislation retains the untenable \nexpansion of eligibility criteria included in the 2009 stimulus \nversion.\n  The TAA Program we will vote on today, as offered by the chairman has \nlost any nexus to U.S. trade policy actions. Under the chairman's \nexpanded TAA Program, workers who lose their jobs, allegedly due to \nshifts in production to non-free-trade agreement countries, will be \neligible for the generous TAA benefits.\n  As I highlighted in my remarks yesterday about Solyndra, in a dynamic \nU.S. and global economy, businesses can start up and shut down for many \nreasons that have absolutely nothing to do with foreign trade and \ncertainly nothing to do with any specific U.S. trade policy. Solyndra \nfailed due to a bad business model and an ill-conceived Federal loan of \na half a billion dollars in taxpayer money--it was a little bit more \nthan that--not because of trade policy. That Solyndra workers may \nreceive TAA benefits highlights the problems with the program.\n  Globalization has changed how our businesses operate--both large and \nsmall--and all the variables that now impact buying and selling \ndecisions through global supply chains, shifting demographics, shifting \ndemand trends, different tax regimes, and ever-changing investment \nclimates will necessarily create opportunities and challenges for all \nAmerican businesses. We should help American businesses and farmers \ncompete for the new customers and consumers around the world, and we do \nthis best by prying open those markets, protecting American \nintellectual property rights and investments, and strengthening the \nrule of law.\n  That is why my colleagues and I continue to push the White House to \nsend the three pending free-trade agreements to Congress for a vote, so \nwe can help our businesses and farmers better compete in a global \neconomy. If we want to help our economy and create jobs, passing the \nFTAs should be our first order of business.\n  The best response to globalization is to harness its dynamic growth \nto our benefit, not to choose winners and losers and give them unproven \ntraining and additional income support and health care entitlements. If \nthe purpose of TAA is to help workers adjust to trade policy actions by \nthe government, then only those workers impacted by trade with U.S. \nfree-trade agreement countries should be eligible.\n  Again, I thank my colleague and friend, Senator Rubio, for offering \nthis important amendment and trying to look out for the taxpayer and \nnarrowly constrain spending on TAA. I urge my colleagues to support his \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 650\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 650 to make it \npending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Thune] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 650.\n\n  Mr. THUNE. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 650\n\n(Purpose: To require a report on the consequences of failing to act on \n                           trade agreements)\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n                         TITLE ___--ITC REPORT\n\n     SEC. __01.

The analysis shall examine \n     all relevant factors impacting United States businesses and \n     individuals, including--\n       (A) lost market shares for United States exports in foreign \n     markets resulting from new trade agreements implemented \n     between the country with respect to which the trade agreement \n     was entered into and any other country, and market shares \n     lost for United States exports resulting from any other \n     factor;\n       (B) how the delay in implementing the agreement is \n     affecting the advancement of United States trade objectives, \n     described in the Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of \n     2002 (or any subsequent trade promotion authority); and\n       (C) how the delay in implementing the agreement is \n     affecting the protection of intellectual property rights of \n     United States businesses operating in foreign markets.\n       (2) The impact on employment in the United States resulting \n     from the delay in implementing the agreement.\n       (3) An estimate of the probable impact on United States \n     businesses, in terms of exports, profitability, and \n     employment, if the trade agreement does not enter into force \n     by the end of the calendar year following the date of the \n     Commission report\n       (c) Applicability.--The International Trade Commission \n     shall submit the report required by this section with respect \n     to--\n       (1) any trade agreement entered into on or after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act; and\n       (2) any trade agreement entered into before the date of the \n     enactment of this Act if such agreement has not entered into \n     force with respect to the United States by June 30, 2012.\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I rise in support of this amendment, which \nI filed yesterday afternoon, which deals with what I believe is a very \nimportant topic; that is, the high cost of delay when it comes to the \npending free-trade agreements. I raised this issue yesterday, and I \nwish to reemphasize my comments in light of the fact that we will be \nvoting on this amendment this afternoon.\n  Most of the debate the last few days has been about the merits of \ntrade adjustment assistance. But there is another aspect of trade \nadjustment assistance renewal we should consider. It is the fact that \nthere has been a real cost to America's economy and to the American \nbusinesses as a result of the President's strategy to link passage of \nthe three trade agreements to a renewal of an expanded Trade Adjustment \nAssistance Program.\n  This is very unfortunate, especially considering that even the White \nHouse acknowledges that passing the trade agreements is one of the best \nthings we could do in the short term to create jobs. According to the \nBusiness Roundtable, the passage of the trade agreements will support \n250,000 American jobs. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce estimates that as \nmany as 380,000 U.S. jobs could be in jeopardy if we do not pass the \nfree-trade agreements.\n  One would think passage of these trade agreements, which were signed \nin 2006 and 2007, would have been an early priority for the Obama \nadministration. Yet here we are more than 2\\1/2\\ years into this \nadministration, and the President still has not made a commitment to \nsend us the trade agreements so we can consider them.\n  Perhaps some might say it takes time to get an agreement implemented \nafter it has been signed. Let's consider some recent trade deals the \nUnited States has negotiated. Consider the U.S.-Australia Free Trade \nAgreement. This agreement with an important ally was signed on May 18, \n2004, and entered into force on June 1, 2005, a little over 1 year \nlater.\n  Consider the U.S.-Chile agreement. This agreement was signed on June \n6, 2003, and entered into force on January 1, 2004, only a little over \nhalf a year later. Perhaps we should look at the U.S.-Peru agreement. \nThis agreement was signed on April 12, 2006, was passed by the \nDemocratically controlled House in November of 2007, and the \nDemocratically controlled Senate in December of 2007.\n  Let me repeat. A Democratic House and Democratic Senate took up and \npassed an agreement, negotiated and signed by a Republican President, \njust over a year and a half after it was signed. So we know that even \nwhen the President and the majority in Congress come from different \nparties, we have still been able to implement our trade agreements \nexpeditiously for the good of the country.\n  My point is not simply that the three pending free-trade agreements \nare long overdue. The point is, our process for considering trade \nagreements did not envision such long delays between signing and \nimplementation. Nevertheless, we need to respond to this unfortunate \nreality, and my amendment helps us to do so.\n  It is very simple. Under current trade promotion authority \nprocedures, the International Trade Commission must prepare a report \nthat is submitted to the Congress no later than 90 days after a trade \nagreement is signed. However, there is currently no requirement that \nthe ITC conduct a study to assess the negative impact on U.S. \nbusinesses when we delay implementation of an agreement, as we have for \nmore than 4 years with Korea, Colombia, and Panama.\n  My amendment would simply require the ITC to assess the negative \nimpact to U.S. businesses if a trade agreement is signed but has not \nbeen considered by Congress within 2 years. The ITC study would focus \non lost U.S. export opportunities, how the delay has impacted U.S. \ntrade objectives as set out under trade promotion authority, as well as \nhow the delay impacts the protection of U.S. intellectual property \noverseas.\n  The study would also estimate the impact on U.S. employment if the \ntrade agreement in question continues to languish. Finally, the ITC \nwould be required to update their study in every subsequent year that \nthe trade agreement is not considered by Congress or if it is still not \nentered into force.\n  My amendment follows a very basic principle. If the President \nbelieves a trade agreement is in America's national and economic \ninterests, he needs to submit it to Congress. If he does not submit it \nto Congress, we need to have better information as to what the costs \nare of that delay. If we think these trade agreements are important--\nand the President spent much of the month of August talking about the \nneed to pass them, so clearly he believes they are important--then we \nneed to be able to more effectively weigh the disadvantages imposed \nupon American businesses and consumers as a result of not implementing \nthem.\n  I wish to emphasize this is not a partisan amendment. It will apply \nto any future President who delays implementation of a trade agreement, \nDemocratic or Republican. Why is this so important? Because the global \neconomy in which American businesses compete is not static. It is \ndynamic, fast moving, and ever changing. As we stand here today, there \nare more than 100 new free-trade agreements currently under negotiation \naround the world. Yet the United States is a party to only one of those \nnegotiations, the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n  I have with me the ITC report on the U.S.-Colombia agreement issued \nshortly after it was signed. The date on this report is December 2006, \nover 4\\1/2\\ years ago. Would it not be helpful to have a recent report \nthat would take into consideration the impact to U.S. businesses from \nthe Canada-Colombia trade agreement that recently went into effect or \nthe EU-Colombia Free Trade Agreement that will go into effect next \nyear?\n  Let's consider the cost of delay to just one U.S. company, \nCaterpillar. As we all know, Caterpillar is a leading producer of large \nconstruction and mining equipment and a major U.S. exporter. \nCaterpillar exports 92 percent of its American-made large mining \ntrucks. Caterpillar's large truck exports to Colombia face a 15-percent \nduty, which adds about $300,000 to the cost of each of those trucks \nexported to Colombia.\n  Just imagine the advantage Caterpillar could have had for the last \nseveral years over its Japanese and Chinese competitors if the \nDemocratic House in 2008 had not refused to consider the Colombia \nagreement when President Bush submitted it or if President Obama had \nsubmitted it promptly upon taking office.\n  But the Caterpillar example is just one company. We did an unbiased, \nobjective, and expert study on the cost to all U.S. businesses of \ndelay. My amendment would accomplish this.\n  Consider that U.S. companies have paid more than $5 billion in \ntariffs to Colombia and Panama since the trade\n\n[[Page S5868]]\n\nagreements with these nations were signed more than 4 years ago. More \nimportantly, U.S. businesses have lost countless business opportunities \nin Korea, Colombia, and Panama.\n  Consider another example, the market for agricultural products in \nKorea, which is the world's 13th largest economy. Korea's tariffs on \nimported agricultural goods average 54 percent, compared to an average \n9-percent tariff on these imparts into the United States. Passage of \nthe Korea Free Trade Agreement will level the playing field. Yet this \nadministration continues to delay sending these agreements to Congress.\n  At a time of near-record unemployment and slow economic growth, this \ndelay is unacceptable. This ongoing delay is having a real impact on \nAmerican businesses, and it will only get worse as the EU-Korea \nagreement has now entered into force and European companies are getting \nthe benefits of lower tariffs and market access.\n  The Colombian market for agricultural products is another good \nexample of the high cost of delay. In 2010, for the first time in the \nhistory of U.S.-Colombia trade, the United States lost to Argentina its \nposition as Colombia's No. 1 agricultural supplier.\n  Consider the story of the three main crops we grow in South Dakota: \ncorn, wheat, and soybeans. The combined market share in Colombia for \nthese three U.S. agricultural exports has decreased from 78 percent in \n2008 to 28 percent in 2010, a staggering decline of 50 percentage \npoints. This situation will only get worse now that the Canada-Colombia \nagreement has taken effect as of August 15 of this year.\n\n  As Gordon Stoner, a wheat grower from Outlook, MT, testified before \nthe Finance Committee earlier this year: ``Our share of the Colombia \nwheat market has declined from 73 percent in 2008 to 43 percent in \n2010, and industry representatives in Colombia indicate we could lose \nour entire market share following implementation of the Canada-Colombia \nfree trade agreement.''\n  We are living in a global economy where America cannot afford to \nstand still on trade. There is another cost to the delay in submitting \nthese free-trade agreements to Congress that we should consider. This \nis the loss of trust we may experience and be creating with new \npotential trade agreement partners. Consider, if a country is an \nemerging economy today and they have the opportunity to negotiate a \ncomprehensive trade agreement with either the European Union or the \nUnited States, what message is our delay sending to those potential \ntrading partners?\n  Unfortunately, the message appears to be that if they negotiate with \nthe EU, they will get the benefits of an agreement much sooner than if \nthey spend the time and effort to negotiate an agreement with the \nUnited States. This is best exemplified by the negotiations with South \nKorea, a large economy, a major market for agricultural goods, as I \nmention, and manufactured goods as well as services.\n  The U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement was signed in June of 2007. \nKorea's trade agreement with the EU was launched in May of 2007, just 1 \nmonth earlier. We had basically finished the entire negotiation process \nand wrapped up our agreement with Korea by the time the EU was just \nlaunching the beginning of their negotiations with Korea. As I \nmentioned earlier, the EU-Korea agreement has now taken effect, and the \nPresident has not even yet submitted our agreement with Korea to \nCongress for consideration.\n  Again, we are not creating a favorable impression for any future \ntrade agreement partners. As emerging economies mature, millions of new \nmiddle-class consumers enter the global marketplace. This is an \nimpression we simply cannot afford to let persist. American businesses \nand exporters need acces to fast-developing markets.\n  Imagine if American business operated the way Washington, DC \noperates. What if American companies, such as Apple or IBM, waited 4 or \n5 years to develop their next product? Would they continue to \noutinnovate their foreign competition? Of course not. Just as U.S. \nbusinesses cannot afford to stand still, the U.S. Government cannot \nafford to stand still as we have on trade for these past several years.\n  In 1960, exports accounted for only 3.6 percent of U.S. GDP.\n  Today, exports account for 12.5 percent of our GDP. Exports of U.S. \ngoods and services support over 10 million American jobs. It is long \npast time that we get back in the game by passing the three pending \ntrade agreements.\n  My amendment will ensure that if we delay, if we fail to act, we will \nhave a better assessment of the cost to American businesses and \nconsumers of that delay. Hopefully, that information will make us more \nlikely to act with a sense of urgency.\n  My amendment should not be controversial. It doesn't change the \nunderlying bill or change trade adjustment assistance. It should not be \nsomething that would affect the ability of this legislation to pass the \nHouse. It is a forward-looking amendment that will improve the process \nunder which we consider future trade agreements.\n  It is important that we get this done. The year 2006 is the last time \nwe had an assessment of the impact of not acting on the Colombia Free \nTrade Agreement. Earlier today, Senator Baucus made some remarks about \nmy amendment and referred to it as a ``backward-looking'' amendment. \nNothing could be further from the truth. It is not about casting blame \nor looking back; it is about improving trade by giving Congress better, \nmore comprehensive information on the impact of delay.\n  Senator Baucus said earlier that nobody disputes the harm from \ndelaying agreements. But has the U.S. Government quantified the harm of \nthe delay in a comprehensive fashion so that we know exactly the cost \nthe delays are imposing on U.S. businesses and individuals and impact \non U.S. employment or on the protection of U.S. intellectual property \nin foreign markets? The answer is no. As a result, it is more difficult \nthan it should be to balance the benefits of this delay on the one \nhand, which would be any benefits from renewal of the expanded TAA, \nwith the cost on the other hand. This is 9 months away. I certainly \nhope the Colombia, Korea, and Panama Free Trade Agreements will pass \nsoon and go into effect long before next June.\n  This amendment is forward looking, as it applies to future trade \nagreements, if they are not submitted to Congress or considered by \nCongress or not entered into force within 2 years of being signed. This \nwill apply to a trade agreement by a future Republican President just \nas much as by a Democratic President. If there is a substantial delay \nin implementing a trade agreement the United States signed in good \nfaith with another nation, whatever the reason for the delay, maybe we \nin Congress should have better information as to the specific impact on \nU.S. businesses of this delay. That is all this amendment would do. It \ndoesn't affect GSP or TAA. It would not imperil this bill in the House. \nThere is no good reason to oppose this amendment. I hope we can adopt \nit today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the amendment \nfiled by my colleague from South Dakota. This amendment deals with an \nimportant issue, namely, the cost of delay when it comes to free-trade \nagreements.\n  The President's desire to increase spending on TAA--an expensive \ndomestic spending program of debatable worth--at a time when taxpayers \nare struggling to make ends meet during a recession makes no sense to \nme.\n  His strategy to link passage of FTAs to renewal of this expanded TAA \nprogram is equally perplexing. TAA is meant to assist workers who have \nallegedly lost their jobs due to trade. But the administration has \nrepeatedly stated that the three pending trade agreements will create \njobs, not cause people to lose them.\n  According to the Business Roundtable, passage of the three pending \ntrade agreements will support 250,000 American jobs. Since jobs will be \ncreated rather than lost, it makes no sense to link the passage of an \nexpanded version of trade adjustment assistance to these three FTAs. In \nfact, the only jobs lost to date have been those caused by the \nPresident's refusal to send these FTAs to Congress. His refusal to act \nhas caused U.S. farmers, manufacturers, and service providers\n\n[[Page S5869]]\n\nto cede market share to our competitors in Panama, Colombia, and South \nKorea.\n  Given the state of the economy under this administration, one would \nthink passage of these trade agreements--which were handed to the \nPresident wrapped up in a bow by his predecessor--would be the first \norder of business. Yet, here we are, more than halfway into this \nadministration and the President has not even made a commitment to send \nus the trade agreements so we can consider them.\n  My colleague's amendment would help us assess the impact of the \nPresident's delay, and future Presidents as well, on the American \neconomy.\n  The amendment would require the ITC to assess the negative impact to \nU.S. businesses if a trade agreement is signed but has not been \nconsidered by Congress within 2 years. Among other things, the ITC \nstudy would highlight lost U.S. export opportunities, the impact on the \nprotection of U.S. intellectual property overseas, the impact on U.S. \nemployment to date, and the prospective impact on U.S. employment if \nagreements are not sent to Congress.\n  If the President believes these trade agreements will create jobs, he \nneeds to submit them to Congress. It is absurd that they are still \nsitting on the President's desk, while our companies and workers lose \nmarket share to our competitors in Colombia, South Korea, and Panama.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from New Hampshire be \npermitted to make her remarks at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I thank my colleague. I agree with both of my \ncolleagues, who have spoken, that we live in a globalized economy, and \nit is important for us to make sure we have the benefits of that \nglobalized economy in America. It has offered us incredible new \nopportunities. But there are opportunities that have not been shared \nequally across our economy and our workforce.\n  I believe that when given a level playing field, the American \nworkforce has shown it can outcompete and outinnovate any economy in \nthe world. That is the way we will get our economy moving again, by \nunleashing the power of American entrepreneurship.\n  I have spoken before about ending the false debate between so-called \nfree trade and fair trade. I think we need competitive trade, a policy \nthat focuses on growing U.S. exports, opening new markets for U.S. \ncompanies, job training for our workforce, and tough enforcement of \ntrade rules.\n  We can help our workforce compete by giving them access to foreign \nmarkets. Fully 95 percent of the world's consumers live outside of the \nUnited States, but only 1 percent of U.S. small businesses is doing \nbusiness outside of the United States, or exporting their products. \nIncreasing our exports is vital to the long-term health of our economy.\n  At the same time, we have to acknowledge that trade creates new \nchallenges for many American companies and American workers. We have to \nunderstand no graph showing GDP growth is a comfort to a mother who \nsuddenly cannot feed her family because her factory has shut down; and \nno statistic about market efficiency is going to pay a young man's rent \nwhen his company moves its engineering operations overseas. When \nCongress promotes international trade, it enters into a compact with \nall American workers that they will not be left behind. Competitive \ntrade means making sure all of us can compete.\n  For nearly 50 years, the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program has been \nlending a hand to workers faced with the negative consequences of \ninternational trade. It has been supported by liberals and \nconservatives, Democrats and Republicans. Its premise is simple: If you \nlose your job to foreign trade, we will help you prepare for a new \ncareer and help keep you afloat while you train. Over the last 2 years, \nalmost a half million Americans have begun a new chapter in their lives \nwith the help of trade adjustment assistance.\n\n  In 2009, Congress enacted some commonsense reforms to the TAA \nProgram. For years, Americans who lost their jobs to India or China \nwere denied access to this program because the United States doesn't \nhave a specific trade agreement with either country. Given the growing \neconomic power of those two nations, that left an unacceptable number \nof Americans facing trade effects on their own. In 2009, we changed the \nprogram so that TAA supported all Americans whose jobs were sent \noverseas. But those reforms have, unfortunately, expired. This week, we \nhave the opportunity to restore them, and we should.\n  The 2009 reforms also updated the TAA Program to protect workers in \nservice industries, in addition to those in manufacturing. Fifty years \nago, when the program was created, no one could have imagined the \nadvances in technology that would allow foreign service workers and \nengineers to compete with our own domestic workers in those fields. \nThis week, we have an opportunity to restore the 21st century \nperspective to the TAA Program.\n  I want to share a couple of stories about New Hampshire workers who \nhave benefited from trade adjustment assistance. The first is a story \nabout Joanne Sanschagrin of Gilmanton, who worked at Aavid Thermalloy \nfor 22 years. She was a buyer for the company, but the company was \nthreatened by competition from several nations, including China. She \nknew she needed to get a new job before she was laid off. Under the old \nTAA terms, the ones we are operating under now, she would not qualify \nfor help under TAA. Under the 2009 reforms, Joanne sought and received \ntraining as a licensed nursing assistant. She completed training in \nJune, and last month she began a job in her new career, and she loves \nit. TAA has supported her through this process and paid for her \ntraining, so instead of being unemployed, she is now a dynamic part of \nour economy, working in one of its fastest growing fields.\n  Another New Hampshire worker, Robert Arsenault, who is a veteran, had \nworked for 21 years making paper at the mills in Gorham and Berlin. The \npaper industry has been devastated by offshore competition. As the \nChair knows, we have lost so many of our mills throughout northern New \nEngland. When those mills in Berlin and Gorham closed, Robert used \ntrade adjustment assistance to get a commercial driver's license at the \nWhite Mountains Community College. He recently started a new full-time \njob with a paving and contracting company.\n  TAA doesn't just help out individual workers; it also helps small \nbusinesses that are being hurt by international trade. New England \nForest Products is a hardwood manufacturing company that has been \noperating in Greenfield, NH, since 1993. But during the recent \nrecession, they found themselves losing business to cheap Chinese \nlumber. In search of answers, they applied to the local trade \nadjustment assistance center for help. They worked with TAA to develop \na marketing strategy and advertising materials that now help the small \nbusiness sell their hardwood flooring and other products directly to \nconsumers. In part because of this important program, New England \nForest Products saw sales increase 28 percent in the following year.\n  This isn't just one encouraging story. Of the 18 businesses in New \nHampshire that have received TAA in the last 4 years, all 18 are still \noperating, and many are adding employees. These are the kinds of \nstories the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program makes possible, but \nonly if we sustain these critical reforms and strengthen TAA's role as \nboth a critical safety net and a driver of the American economy for \ndecades to come.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the trade adjustment assistance \namendment when it comes to the floor for a vote later today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I want to emphasize one final time, as we \nget closer to votes on these amendments, the importance of getting the \nfree-trade agreements passed and put into force, but also the \nimportance of understanding that, as we move into the future, we not \nmake the mistakes we have made with respect to these agreements, and \nthat is to let them languish literally years, and at the same time be \nlosing market share, be losing jobs for Americans, and be losing market \nopportunities for American businesses.\n\n[[Page S5870]]\n\n  Again, I wish to point out just a couple things I think personalize \nthis; one, as I mentioned in my earlier remarks, we have a company such \nas Caterpillar, which makes large mining trucks and exports 92 percent \nof them. They pay a $300,000-per-truck tariff to get into the Colombian \nmarket. Think of a country such as South Korea, with the 13th largest \neconomy in the world. They are a big importer of American agricultural \ngoods, with 54 percent right now being the average tariff on goods that \nare exported from the United States--agricultural products exported \nfrom here to Korea, but 9 percent is the average tariff on their goods \ncoming into this country. That 54-to-9 ratio is an incredible \ndisadvantage, putting American businesses at a tremendous disadvantage \nrelative to the countries around the world with whom they have to \ncompete.\n  At the same time these trade agreements have been languishing here \nfor over 4 years, other countries have stepped in--the European Union, \nAustralia, and Canada--and filled the vacuum we have left. As a \nconsequence, American businesses have been hurt and hurt profoundly. \nMore importantly, as we sit in this economy we are in and talk about \nthe importance of job creation, there isn't anything we could do that \nwould probably create jobs more quickly than to get these trade \nagreements enacted. It means thousands of jobs for Americans, it means \nbusiness opportunities for American businesses overseas, and it means \nmarket share we should be maintaining or perhaps even acquiring and \nthat we are losing as a result of not having these agreements entered \nin force after they have been negotiated these many years ago.\n  So my amendment looks prospectively into the future. It requires that \nwe know specifically--quantitatively--what are the impacts of delay \nwhen it comes to getting these free-trade agreements not only ratified \nby the Congress but entered into force with these other countries. I \nthink it is critical information we need to know. We need to know what \nharm, what economic consequences are the result of these trade \nagreements being delayed.\n  I hope we will get bipartisan support for this amendment today. It \ndoesn't do anything to alter TAA. It doesn't do anything to alter GSP. \nIt doesn't do anything to affect the passage of this agreement in the \nHouse. But it will, as we look into the future, make it much more clear \nto us what these economic impacts are with regard to these trade \nagreements and our delay in getting them implemented.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 634\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the amendment that \nhas been introduced by the Senator from Texas, Mr. Cornyn. I think it \nis amendment No. 634. I will take only a few minutes, as I know my \ncolleague from Indiana is waiting, but I do wish to speak to it, if I \nmay.\n  The Senator from Texas has introduced an amendment that takes an \nunprecedented step in the Senate; that is, the step of actually \nrequiring the President, by mandate--with respect to one weapon system \nin one singular amendment--to sell a specific weapon to another \ncountry. Specifically, the Senator wants to take the unprecedented step \nof requiring the President of the United States to sell 66 new F-16 \nfighter aircraft to Taiwan.\n  The amendment mandates the sale of these new aircraft, despite the \nfact that just yesterday the President and the administration notified \nCongress of their intention to provide Taiwan with nearly six billion \ndollars' worth of items in defense goods and services, on top of money \nthey have already provided to Taiwan--including upgrades to Taiwan's \ncurrent fleet of 145 F-16s.\n  I will stand by my record of 26-plus years of voting for the \nappropriate defense relationship with respect to Taiwan and China. We \nhave always respected the Taiwan Relations Act, and I think we have \nconsistently stood by Taiwan and kept faith with that act. Without a \ndoubt, the growing military disparity between China and other countries \nin the region, as well as China and Taiwan, is something we need to be \nthinking about and taking into account as we contemplate the long-term \nfuture of all those relationships in that region. But that said, I am \nopposed to this specific amendment. I believe Senator Baucus, who has \nalready spoken in opposition to it, and others, I believe, are opposed \nto it for two appropriate reasons: one, the substance of the amendment \nitself--and I will speak to that--but also, plain and simply, this is \nnot the right vehicle to address this issue.\n  Everybody understands that consideration of TAA is part of a very \ncomplicated approach to what Senator Thune just commented on--a much-\ntoo-long-awaited dealing with several trade agreements a lot of us want \nto pass and we think we should pass. Passage of this TAA proposal--\nwithout these other issues being added to it, which would put it in \njeopardy--is critical to being able to help American workers as well as \nto lining up those three pending trade agreements which will create \njobs in the United States and which will also enhance our security. So \nif we were to pass the Cornyn amendment--which we know the \nadministration strongly opposes--that would imperil this very carefully \ncrafted jobs package we are now considering.\n  On that basis alone, I would urge colleagues to vote against this \namendment. But I believe there are powerful, substantive reasons for \nwhy this amendment shouldn't pass just on its own. Mandating the sale \nof one particular weapon is not the way for the United States to \nrespond or to deal with or manage the complex national security \nchallenge of that region and the complexity of the relationship with \nTaiwan.\n  I would remind colleagues that the $6 billion in new arms sales, of \nvarious kinds--including a major upgrade package to all the 145 F-16s--\nis an enormous, important package which Taiwan wants and needs and \nwhich Taiwan believes will bring it up to par with respect to those \nsystems and the need to be able to defend itself.\n\n  I think we have to remember that ever since President Nixon opened \nthe door to China nearly 40 years ago, the United States has worked \nvery carefully to promote peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. The \nTaiwan Relations Act has long governed our policy toward Taiwan because \nwe don't have a formal diplomatic relationship or a formal treaty.\n  With respect to arms sales, let me share with my colleagues what the \nTRA says. It shall be the policy of the United States ``to provide \nTaiwan with arms of a defensive character'' and ``to maintain the \ncapacity of the United States to resist any resort to force or other \nforms of coercion'' which would jeopardize the security of the people \nof Taiwan. Finally, the TRA obligates the United States to provide such \ndefense goods and services to Taiwan as are ``necessary to enable \nTaiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense capability.''\n  The Obama administration and the committees of jurisdiction in the \nSenate and House, with respect to it, take the provisions of that act \nvery seriously. The administration has carefully analyzed, as have we, \nthe military balance across the Taiwan Strait, and we have consulted \nclosely with the Government of Taiwan as to how to best meet Taiwan's \ndefensive needs.\n  On Wednesday, the administration formally notified Congress of its \nintent to send a very substantial retrofit package that would upgrade \nthe current fleet. As I mentioned, there are 145 F-16s that Taiwan has \ntoday and that Taiwan relies on today for its current defense needs. \nThese upgrades include state-of-the-art avionics and weaponry--\nincluding Actively Electronically Scanned Array Radars, targeting \nsystems, the AIM-9X air-to-air missiles, and precision-guided \nmunitions. So I don't believe there is any question but that the United \nStates is now, and will continue to be, in full compliance with the \nrequirements of the TRA.\n  But this package also makes clear that support for Taiwan is not a \npartisan issue. The Bush administration, in its 8 years--two full \nterms--notified Congress of the sale of roughly $15 billion total in \narms sales to Taiwan. With the announcement of this sale of the \nadditional items Taiwan needs, the administration--the Obama \nadministration--in less than 3 years has approved the sale of over $12 \nbillion in arms to Taiwan. So we have $15 billion\n\n[[Page S5871]]\n\nover 8 years from the Bush administration and $12 billion over 3 years \nfrom the Obama administration.\n  Moreover, the administration's $5.8 billion retrofit and training \nproposal provides the necessary parts, equipment, training, and \nlogistical support for a cost-effective upgrade of Taiwan's current \nstatus; most importantly, it elevates Taiwan's current fleet of F-16s \nto a level of capability consistent with the most advanced export \nvariants of this aircraft.\n  Let us understand where we are--what the state of play is. Taiwan has \nan urgent defense need today. They have 145 aircraft we have already \nsold them. We are prepared to provide them an upgrade that brings those \naircraft up to the total state of the art of the most advanced export \nvariants we are allowed to export to another country, and it will \nprevent these 145 aircraft from becoming obsolete. This is the most \nsensible, cost-effective, effective way to provide an upgrade and to \nprovide Taiwan with the capacity it needs.\n  To the degree people are thinking jobs in the United States of \nAmerica and what about selling, a lot of us have never believed we \nought to use defense sales or weapons sales to create jobs. There are a \nlot more effective ways of creating jobs. But to whatever degree \nanybody wants to measure this by that standard, the $5.8 billion sale \nannounced yesterday will be welcome news to the workers of Lockheed \nMartin, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, Pratt & Whitney, and many other \ndefense firms.\n  Again, I emphasize that is not the rationale for the sale, and none \nof us should resort to those kinds of sales for the purpose of jobs. \nBut if that is going to be a measurement or a consideration in \nanybody's mind, make no mistake, the $6 billion the President has \nproposed will have its own impact.\n  Finally, let me point out to colleagues, and I think it is an \nimportant consideration, nothing in the proposed upgrade package will \npreclude the United States from providing new F-16s as we go down the \nroad, as they may be necessary, as a judgment is made about them or any \nother similar platform to Taiwan in the future. The administration has \ntaken pains to make clear to Congress and to Taiwan the approval of \nthis sale does not and will not prejudice any future decision on new \naircraft.\n  Yesterday, President Ma Ying-jeou of Taiwan said the upgrades to \nTaiwan's existing F-16A/B jets are aimed at maintaining the country's \nself-defense capabilities while pursuing peaceful development across \nthe Taiwan Strait.\n  The President of Taiwan said of the upgrade package:\n\n       We have to develop peaceful ties with Mainland China. But \n     we haven't for one second let our guard down when it comes to \n     Taiwan's security.\n\n  I don't believe the Taiwanese believe they are letting their guard \ndown. I don't think they believe we are not meeting their needs. \nObviously, Congress has an important role to play in determining how to \nmeet those needs, but I don't think we should, in the wake of the \nevidence here, make an independent judgment outside of what is already \nhappening. We certainly shouldn't blindly defer to the Executive on \nTaiwan arm sales. But I think to compel the Executive to make a \nspecific arms sale to a specific country measured against the steps \nalready taken and the steps being taken would be an unprecedented \nintervention by the Senate under circumstances where there just has not \nbeen made the kind of compelling, urgent argument that that is the only \nway to proceed. So I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment when \nthe time comes for us to vote on it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes out of my \nremaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank my colleague from Indiana.\n  I would like to respond briefly to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  This isn't an assessment I have made that Taiwan needs these \naircraft; this is one made by the Department of Defense in their 2011 \nreport on China's growing military power. They detailed the \nincreasingly precarious situation in the Taiwan Strait, stating that \nChina seeks the capability to deter Taiwan independence and influence \nTaiwan to settle the dispute on Beijing's terms.\n  So it is clear from the press reports from China's state-run \nnewspaper, the very bellicose comments, that this is really an attempt \nby mainland China, the People's Republic of China, to intimidate not \nonly Taiwan but also the United States, and we should not give in to \nthat intimidation.\n  This chart which I pointed to earlier demonstrates the growing \nimbalance in the Taiwan Strait. This is why these additional aircraft \nare needed. The red one is 2,300 operational combat aircraft for the \nPeople's Republic of China versus 490 operational combat aircraft for \nthe Taiwanese.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is correct to the extent that the \nupgrades are welcome on the 145 F-16s we previously sold to Taiwan. But \nit is not adequate because 100 of these aircraft currently operational \nby Taiwan are obsolete and are going to be retired. Taiwan has intended \nthat the new F-16C/D series replace the fleet of F-5s--those were \npreviously sold U.S. aircraft from the 1975 to 1985 range which are now \nold and obsolete--and then the French-made Mirage 2000-5 fighters. So \n100 of these planes demonstrated here, of the 490, are going to be \nretired, and the 66 aircraft that are the subject of this amendment \nwill replace some of those retired vehicles.\n  So I don't think that thinking about the future of our relationship \nwith Taiwan or problems we may see on the horizon is enough. We need to \ndo something now.\n  I would also point out that you can't just take the production line \nat Lockheed Martin and basically eliminate it because there are no \nfurther demands or contracts for F-16 sales. Basically, all the \npersonnel--the 23,000 people directly involved in those jobs--will be \nreassigned or be fired, let go, because there are no contracts in place \nas late as the fourth quarter of this year for new F-16s. So I think \nlooking at this down the road doesn't take into account the current \nloss of jobs or the disruption of disbanding this production line, \nwhich cannot easily be reconstituted if there are no contracts, \nincluding the sale of these 66 F-16s.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, may I inquire as to the allocation of time? \nThe Senator from Vermont has generously yielded me the opportunity to \nspeak for a few moments. I want to make sure I don't get the situation \nmixed up here so that we run out of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida, Mr. Rubio, has 17 \nminutes. The Senator from South Dakota, Mr. Thune, has 9 minutes.\n  Mr. COATS. I ask unanimous consent to take 6 minutes of Senator \nRubio's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would not object, but I ask consent that \nupon completion of that, I be allowed 7 minutes as though in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President I want to respond to some of the statements \nthat have been made by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nregarding the need to add disaster relief to the Continuing Resolution \nwe will consider this week.\n  There is no question that there is a need for some emergency \nsupplemental appropriations for fiscal year 2011 disaster relief. There \nis agreement on both sides of the aisle that FEMA is short of money to \nmeet its immediate needs in this fiscal year which expires at midnight \non September 30. The Disaster Relief Fund is dangerously low, and on \nSeptember 9 the President requested $500 million in emergency \nappropriations to finish out the immediate needs between now and the \nend of this fiscal year, which is just a little more than 1 week away, \nand that has been provided and taken care of.\n  The House is working on sending the Senate a continuing resolution \nthat includes this emergency funding and more--more than the \nPresident's $500 million request. The House CR is expected to include \n$774 million for\n\n[[Page S5872]]\n\nFEMA--the Federal Emergency Management Agency--plus an additional $226 \nmillion for the Army Corps of Engineers for emergency flood control. \nThis emergency funding is not covered by the Budget Control Act, so in \naccordance with procedures that have been put in place this year and in \ntrying to be as careful with taxpayers' money as we can, the House \noffered an offset. That was defeated yesterday in the House.\n  While this funding covers FEMA's immediate needs, as requested by the \nPresident, through the rest of the fiscal year, the House bill also \nincludes additional funding at the current level of $2.65 billion in \nfiscal year 2012 for FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund, which will provide \nthe necessary funding to deal with the requests and make sure people \nget the support they need from losses in the various disasters through \nthis continuing resolution period, which will go to around November 18.\n  It is important to note that, despite some of the allegations being \nmade, Republicans support this disaster funding. It is critical to \nrespond to the many disasters that have affected so many States over \nthe past few months. However, the additional funding for fiscal year \n2012 sought by Senator Reid and Senate Democrats is not needed \nimmediately. In fact, the President has not requested immediate passage \nof any of this additional funding beyond what is needed to provide FEMA \nwhat it needs to address the situations and to make the necessary \npayments between now and the expiration of this current resolution \nwhich we will be voting on this week.\n  This is not to say we should not consider additional disaster relief. \nI recognize the challenges that so many States face in response to the \ndisasters that have recently struck across the country. My own home \nState of Indiana has experienced floods that merited a disaster \ndeclaration from the President earlier this year. As a nation, we need \nto step forward and address these immediate needs, but we have a \nprocess in place in this body to address this.\n  The Budget Control Act recently passed by Congress does allow a \nprocess for providing disaster relief in fiscal year 2012 through a \ndisaster cap adjustment. As a result from that, the Senate \nAppropriations Committee--which I am the ranking member of the Homeland \nSecurity Subcommittee which oversees FEMA--has been considering the \nfiscal year 2012 bill and has included disaster assistance, where \nappropriate, pursuant to the disaster cap adjustment in the Budget \nControl Act. The key words here are ``where appropriate.'' We need to \nbe in a position to provide additional funding should more disasters \noccur. But there is no need to go forward with what Senator Reid has \nproposed, that is, dumping a lot of money that has not yet been \ncertified as needed into an expenditure, particularly at a time when \nevery dollar of expenditure needs to be carefully weighed in terms of \nour current fiscal situation.\n  Some have noted that while the CR may adequately fund FEMA, it \ndoesn't address the other agencies that need additional disaster \nfunding. If that is the case, then why hasn't the President requested \nthese additional funds immediately?\n  On September 9, the President sent Congress his request for \nadditional FEMA disaster relief funding, including the $500 million \nemergency funding for the remainder of fiscal year 2011. However, this \nrequest did not include any funding for the other agencies in Senator \nReid's proposal.\n  I ask unanimous consent for just 1 more minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. If this is the case, why did he not ask for this? We don't \nneed to include this additional funding to meet the needs of the people \nfor the disasters that have already occurred. The funding necessary to \ndo that is included in the House bill on which we will be voting.\n  Republicans want to ensure that the communities devastated by \ndisasters receive the resources that will help them rebuild. We \nrecognize that American citizens have had their lives turned upside \ndown by Mother Nature. The CR will provide adequate disaster relief \nthrough November in accordance with the President's request and FEMA's \nstated needs. As a result, there is no need to have all of this \nadditional assistance immediately as part of the CR. I urge Members to \nsupport passage of the CR the House will be sending us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n               Remembering Master Sergeant Shawn Stocker\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have spoken many times here on the floor, \nas has the distinguished Presiding Officer, about the disaster and \ntragedy Vermont faced from Hurricane Irene.\n  We all learned with profound sadness that MSG Shawn Stocker of the \nVermont Air National Guard suffered a fatal heart attack while working \non a road reconstruction project in Cavendish, VT. Sergeant Stocker was \nthe first sergeant of the Vermont Air Guard's Civil Engineering \nSquadron. We in Vermont mourn this tragic loss, and our thoughts and \nprayers are with Sergeant Stocker's wife Kristine and their children. \nWhen I spoke with Kristine today, I told her that I would talk about \nher husband on the floor, and his sacrifice for his community, and for \nour country.\n  It struck me that what happened on the morning of Sergeant Stocker's \npassing says much about him, and about the Vermont National Guard. When \nSergeant Stocker passed, his troops gathered to consider how best to \nhonor his memory that day. Ultimately, They decided to keep on working, \nto continue helping their neighbors in Cavendish. ``It is what Shawn \nwould have wanted us to do,'' they said.\n  We have talked often of the loss and suffering in Vermont in the \naftermath of Hurricane Irene. But we must recognize the skillful and \ntireless work of the Vermont National Guard, which has been so critical \nto rebuilding our state. They have answered the call to duty to help \ntheir neighbors in need. Sergeant Stocker and his fellow Guard members \nput their country first, do whatever the mission requires, and we will \nnever forget that.\n  From the very beginning of the disaster up until today, the Vermont \nNational Guard has been deployed to help Vermonters in need. I spoke to \nSecretary Panetta last night in Washington, and I told him what a great \njob the Vermont National Guard is doing.\n  Let me show my colleagues a photograph. This photo is of a Vermont \nairdrop of supplies to a Vermont town. That town was totally cut off. \nThe only way we could get in the supplies was to bring them in by \nhelicopter. In the days following Irene, the Vermont National Guard \nimmediately went into action to make sure the storm victims cut off by \nIrene's destruction received emergency supplies. Helicopters airdropped \nfood and water, and we reached out to other State Guards.\n  I talked with the Senators from Maine. They told me how happy their \nGuards were to be able to come down and help out. It demonstrates the \nversatility of the National Guard.\n  In addition to meeting our immediate needs, the Vermont Guard has \ntaken on major projects such as debris removal and road construction. \nAs in so many other States, when Vermont has a need, our National Guard \nis there for us. Often they are the first to arrive and the last to \nleave. Guard units who have come to Vermont to help include ones from \nNew York, Ohio, Maine, West Virginia, Virginia, South Carolina, and \nIllinois. All of these Guard units have said: We are here. Call us. \nTell us what you need. That is one of the things we love about the \nNational Guard. When one State needs help, every State steps up.\n  One thing Vermont did need in the immediate aftermath of Irene was \nhelicopters. The distinguished Presiding Officer and I helicoptered \naround the State. It was regrettable that our State needed more \nairlift. Why did we? Because many of our Black Hawk helicopters were \nstill in Iraq following the most recent deployment. They are the most \nmodern in the fleet, but they are in Iraq. In this season of war, it \ntakes a moment to remember the troops and equipment sent overseas are \nnot going to be available to help out at home if we need them in an \nemergency.\n  Like that deployment of equipment, every dollar we spend on the \nconflict in Iraq and Afghanistan is one less dollar we have to invest \nin recovery and rebuilding in America.\n  Let me show another photograph to my colleagues. Look at that \nNational\n\n[[Page S5873]]\n\nGuard working to put in these roads. They are stretched thin, as are \nthe National Guards all over this country because so many of them serve \noverseas in Iraq and Afghanistan. These are talented engineers, \ntalented men and women, people who know what to do and have the \nequipment. They can do things nobody else can do, certainly not in our \nlittle State.\n  This is a time to choose investment at home first. I hear people tell \nme we can't pay for disasters in America unless we take money out of \neducation or medical research or other things Americans need, but we \ncan sign a blank check to rebuild Iraq and Afghanistan. I am saying, \nlet's worry about America. Americans need help. We are asking for a \ntiny percentage of what we are spending on a credit card for Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  America needs us. The citizens in our States are suffering because of \na natural disaster. The men and women of the Guard who have come to \ntheir aid deserve nothing less.\n  For the last decade we have waged two wars on the Nation's credit \ncard. We totally ignored paying for it during that time, even though we \nhave raised taxes to pay for every other war in this Nation's history. \nWe did, however, pause to throw ourselves a party in the form of tax \nbreaks tilted toward the very wealthiest among us. The policy was \nwrong, and it hurt America.\n  Now, after all these years of funding wars and rebuilding other \ncountries overseas, the leadership of the House of Representatives, in \ntheir continuing budget resolution that was defeated yesterday, \nbrazenly told the American people we can no longer afford to come to \nthe aid of Americans in need. Instead we are going to offset the costs \nof rebuilding America by cutting a program that Americans badly need.\n  This is ``Alice in Wonderland.'' Are they asking the wealthy to pay \ntheir fair share? No. Are they asking the oil and gas companies making \nrecord profits quarter after quarter to sacrifice their tax giveaways? \nNo. Are they asking a sacrifice from those companies who get tax breaks \nfor shipping American jobs overseas? No.\n  That is wrong. We cannot ask these suffering people to sacrifice and \nrefuse to ask those who have the most to contribute their fair share.\n  We can't cut programs that are going to create new jobs, that provide \na basic safety net for struggling families and seniors, while giving \nevery break possible to the very wealthiest among us. It is \nunconscionable. It is not the American way.\n  I have been privileged to be in the Senate representing our great \nState of Vermont for 37 years. We have always dealt with disaster bills \ntogether. We have worked across the aisle in the spirit of \nbipartisanship. Vermonters have not asked why we help out with an \nearthquake in California. We do it. Vermonters don't ask why we help \nout in Louisiana or Texas or Virginia. We do it.\n  We are the United States of America. We work together. We can not \nafford to toss aside that tradition.\n  The decision of some to inject politics and political point scoring \ninto disaster relief is a new low for Congress, a Congress that is \nalready scoring records for unfavorability. Leader Reid is right to \ncall for a continuing resolution that includes an emergency disaster \nrelief package that will get aid to all 50 States suffering from the \neffects of these unprecedented natural disasters.\n  We try to rebuild Iraq and Afghanistan and nobody questions that. \nInstead, let's rebuild America.\n  I encourage my colleagues here and in the House of Representatives to \ndo the right thing for people who need our help and move forward with \nLeader Reid's bill. Our fellow Americans need our support. Let's start \nspending some time worrying about America.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum, with the time \nto be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 633\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Casey-Reid \namendment. Over the past several days we have had the opportunity to \npublicly discuss and debate a number of serious flaws in the Trade \nAdjustment Assistance Program and its proposed expansion. Perhaps the \nmost egregious aspect is voting to spend more taxpayer dollars on an \nexpanded domestic spending program of dubious value at the very same \ntime our colleagues on the supercommittee are scrutinizing every penny \nof Federal spending in a bipartisan effort to get our Federal deficit \nunder control.\n  It makes me wonder whether this body understands the gravity of the \ndeficit we are facing. As a country, we are simply spending more money \nthan we have. If it continues we are going to be bankrupt. We will \nbankrupt our country and leave behind a grim future for our children \nand grandchildren.\n  We will hear many of my colleagues talk about how important it is to \nspend this money, and I am sure a lot of them will feel good about \ntheir votes. But we all know the good feeling that comes from buying \nthings we cannot afford is fleeting while the debt accrued hangs like a \ndark cloud over our daily lives. We simply cannot afford to continue to \nspend money our country does not have. This is why I, for one, am \nvoting no.\n  Despite my concerns, I am convinced that this amendment and bill will \npass. This spring, the President made it clear that if this domestic \nspending program was not expanded and approved he would abandon our \nallies in Colombia, Panama, and South Korea, and cede these growing \nmarkets to our foreign competitors. How shortsighted.\n  While the President may have been willing to accept that outcome, \nmany of my colleagues were not. They stepped up to the plate and vowed \nto support efforts to move the process forward. As a result, the deck \nin favor of this bill was stacked long ago.\n\n  Still, I am glad we have had an open debate on the merits of this \nprogram. Earlier this year, the President attempted to shield TAA from \nstrict scrutiny and debate by jamming it into the South Korea \nimplementing bill. Doing so would have been a clear abuse of U.S. trade \nlaws and would have denied the Senate an opportunity to fairly debate \nand amend TAA. The American people deserve better than this and Finance \nCommittee Republicans fought hard to ensure that this did not happen. \nIt is largely a result of their efforts that we are here today.\n  Even though the deck was stacked against our amendments long ago, \nthis discussion has been a useful exercise. It has been over 9 years \nsince the Senate engaged in a real trade debate on the Senate floor. \nSenators deserve an opportunity to have their voices heard on issues \nrelated to international trade, and by engaging in debate we are \nhonoring our republican constitutional traditions. We are doing what \nthe American people expect us to do: openly discussing problems and, in \ndoing so helping to resolve them.\n  During this debate, a number of amendments were offered that enabled \nSenators to go on record regarding their trade priorities and core \nbeliefs. For the first time in years, we were able to draw clear \ndistinctions between rhetoric and action. Of course, there has been \ndebate about the merits of the free-trade agreements themselves.\n  As I noted earlier, the President and many of my colleagues who \npurport to support these agreements made it clear that in reality they \nonly support the FTAs in exchange for something else. That something \nelse turned out to be a demand for more spending. I am worried that \ngoing forward this pattern will continue. I certainly hope not. As a \nnation we cannot afford to hold our international economic \ncompetitiveness hostage to unrelated demands for more spending or for a \nmore liberal social agenda.\n  During the course of this debate, I have expressed concerns that the \nreal cost of the TAA expansion bill is unknown. Recall that benefits \nunder TAA are paid out on top of unemployment insurance, which is \nsupposed to take care of those who are out of work. As more and more \npeople take advantage of the program, and as the number of weeks of \nregular unemployment insurance contract, the cost of this entitlement \nprogram could spiral out of control. So a number of amendments were \noffered that would help constrain its future growth so we do not end up\n\n[[Page S5874]]\n\nsticking the American taxpayer with another out-of-control spending \nprogram.\n  Every single one of these amendments was rejected by my colleagues \nacross the aisle. Their passion for spending runs so deep that even an \namendment by my friend and colleague, Senator Kyl, which implemented \none of President Obama's recommendations to cut TAA funding for firms, \nwas rejected. At a time when the supercommittee is struggling to cut \nspending in areas such as defense and health care, I find it \nastonishing that my colleagues cannot support eliminating a program \nthat even President Obama agrees should be cut. That is a true rarity--\nthat is, that President Obama agrees to any kind of a cut, not that my \ncolleagues will not support eliminating a program. That, we know, has \nhappened around here for all of the 35 years I have been in the Senate. \nBut even when President Obama, one of the biggest spenders in the \nhistory of the world, agrees that a program should be cut, they will \nnot even do that.\n  My colleagues across the aisle also chose to reject an amendment to \nprovide their own President with the authority to negotiate new trade \nagreements. Can you believe that? We all know the authority to \nnegotiate trade agreements expired years ago. Since then the United \nStates has been sitting on the sidelines while other countries \nnegotiate agreements all around the world. Everyone knows if we are not \nin the game we do not even have a small chance to win. Right now, the \nUnited States is not in the game.\n  While it is true that the President is in the process of negotiating \nan agreement to create a transpacific partnership, we all know that the \nchances of it actually succeeding are actually almost nonexistent \nwithout trade promotion authority.\n  While the protrade rhetoric sounds good from the other side, when it \ncomes down to concrete action, President Obama and his Democratic \ncolleagues are absent once again. I am perhaps most disturbed by their \nrejection of my amendment which would have made the expansion of this \ndomestic spending program contingent upon submission, approval, and \nsignature of our pending free-trade agreements with Colombia, Panama, \nand South Korea. This amendment simply held President Obama \naccountable.\n  The President said there would be no FTAs unless Congress passed \nTAA. The insinuation is that if Congress does pass TAA, the President \nwill submit, support, and sign all three FTAs.\n\n  Yet, even today we do not know if that is the case. My understanding \nis the White House has given no indication they will actually submit \nthese agreements for a vote. That is truly pathetic. They are willing \nto spend more. They are willing to pass TAA so they can spend more \nregardless of whether they are sincere about doing these free-trade \nagreements that will provide almost 250,000 new jobs in this country, \nor at least jobs.\n  My amendment simply called for Presidential accountability. But even \nPresidential accountability was rejected by the other side. Once again, \nprotrade rhetoric of the past several months has been shown to be \nnothing but a facade. I will be voting against the amendment to expand \nTAA, and if it is approved, I will vote against final passage of the \nbill. I simply cannot condone more spending on a program with dubious \nvalue at a time when our Nation is clearly broke. I remain hopeful \nPresident Obama will submit our pending free-trade agreements to \nCongress. If he does, and they are approved, I am confident President \nObama and his team will drape themselves in the protrade flag and claim \nresponsibility for moving these agreements forward. The fact of the \nmatter is the authority to negotiate these agreements and the actual \nnegotiation of these agreements themselves is due to the hard work of \nlate nights of President Bush and his team. This is one instance where \nPresident Obama can rightly place responsibility at the feet of his \npredecessor.\n  My Republican colleagues and I put forward a number of amendments \nduring the week to constrain government spending, open foreign markets \nfor our products, and hold the President accountable for his rhetoric. \nUnfortunately, every single one was defeated, mostly along party lines. \nBut we will not be deterred. We will continue to fight against out-of-\ncontrol government spending. We will continue to fight for Presidential \nauthority to open foreign markets to U.S. exports. We will continue to \nfight for transparency and accountability in our international trade \npolicy. While we may not win the battle today, I am confident we will \nwin in the end.\n  Over the next year I plan to conduct rigorous oversight of President \nObama's trade policy. If these agreements are eventually submitted and \napproved, I will work hard to make sure they enter into force quickly. \nI also plan to conduct extensive and continued oversight of the \noperation of the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program. I am convinced it \nis a flawed program and that strong congressional oversight will help \nexpose those flaws. I will also work hard to make sure our next \nPresident, whoever that may be, has the authority to negotiate strong \ntrade agreements that tear down barriers to American exports. Over the \npast several days many of my colleagues expressed interest in updating \nthis authority. I welcome that interest and want to express my sincere \ndesire to work with them to immediately see that trade promotion \nauthority is renewed. Our Nation and our workers cannot afford to wait.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we divide the quorum call I am about to \nsuggest equally between both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent the votes with respect to \namendments and passage of H.R. 2832, the GSP bill, occur at 4:30 p.m.; \nthat all after the first vote be 10-minute votes; that prior to the \nvote in relation to the Cornyn amendment, there be 10 minutes equally \ndivided, with remaining provisions of the previous order remaining in \neffect; finally, the amount of additional time this agreement adds for \ndebate on the bill and amendments prior to the votes be equally divided \nbetween the two leaders or their designees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Education Reform\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, according to the Washington Post this \nmorning, the President and his Education Secretary will announce \ntomorrow that the Department of Education will begin a process to grant \nwaivers to States from the provisions of No Child Left Behind. No Child \nLeft Behind, of course, is a law that was passed with bipartisan \nsupport in 2001 and 2002 by Congress. We are in its ninth year of its \nimplementation.\n  It needs to be fixed, and Congress needs to act to fix it. Republican \nSenators and Members of the House have already offered legislation that \nwill begin to do that, which I will talk about in a minute. But my \npurpose in coming to the floor is to talk about the waiver requests the \nSecretary of Education may begin to approve. My request of the \nSecretary and of the President is that as they establish a waiver \nprocess and as they begin to approve waivers, they show restraint and \nnot take unto themselves responsibilities that are the responsibilities \nof Congress.\n  The truth is, the Secretary has the States over a barrel. We have \nabout 100,000 public schools in America, and as he has correctly said, \nabout 80 percent of them, under the current law,\n\n[[Page S5875]]\n\nare going to be deemed as failing schools soon.\n  The President and the Secretary and we Republicans would like to take \nthe responsibility for determining which schools are succeeding or \nfailing and put that back in the hands of the States. We would like to \ntake the responsibility for determining which teachers are highly \nqualified and put that back in the hands of the States. That is a part \nof the legislation we introduced last week.\n  Substantially, those ideas are ideas the President and the Secretary \neither have advanced or agree with. So we have a lot of agreement about \nthis. But the Secretary has the States over a barrel. Most Governors \nwant a waiver. Almost every State, from Missouri to Tennessee to \nGeorgia, will be asking for a waiver.\n  What I hope the Secretary will do is to look at the applications, and \nif those applications submitted by the States for exemption from the \nrequirements of No Child Left Behind, if they would enhance student \nachievement, then approve them. If they would not advance student \nachievement, then deny them.\n  But the restraint I am asking for is that the Secretary not use this \noccasion, when the States are over a barrel, to become a national \nschool board and begin to impose on the States those requirements that \nCongress would not do through legislation and that States ought to be \ndeciding for themselves. This is the request of the States themselves.\n  The States have been working over the last 10 years in very good ways \nto take steps forward together. They have created common standards. \nThey have created tests to measure performance against those standards. \nThe chief State school officers are in the middle of creating an \naccountability system. A lot of progress has been made in what I like \nto call the holy grail of elementary and secondary education: finding a \nway to reward outstanding teaching by connecting it to student \nachievement. This is something Tennessee became the first State in the \ncountry to do when I was Governor in 1983 and 1984 and which many \nschool districts in many States are trying to do now.\n  So the difference of opinion I have, potentially, with this Secretary \nand this President on what to do about No Child Left Behind may seem \nvery small. Let me compliment the President and let me compliment the \nSecretary in this way. They stuck their necks out and have taken some \npositions to help make better schools that are not popular with their \nnatural constituents.\n  I admire that. I respect that. They have advocated a number of \nchanges in the schools; for example, getting rid of the adequate yearly \nprogress provision, moving out of Washington the responsibility for \ndeciding whether schools are succeeding or failing; changing the highly \nqualified teacher provision so States can figure that out through their \nown systems.\n  All those are things we agree on, Republicans and Democrats. Where we \nmay disagree, and the reason we have not advanced ahead with bipartisan \nlegislation on No Child Left Behind, is what I would call the \ndifference between Washington mandates and approving State requests or \none might even say, the difference between a national school board and \ngiving States the responsibility for making their own decisions.\n  Here is an example of what I mean. There is agreement, as I said, \nthat this process called adequate yearly progress for a lot of schools \nshould not be decided here. We will read in the paper that such and \nsuch school is not succeeding or it is failing. It is a good idea for \nTennessee or for Missouri or for California to set performance targets \nto replace adequate yearly progress. But those performance targets \nought to be in the States' application and not be required and defined \nby the U.S. Department of Education in Washington, which could turn it \ninto a national school board.\n  A growth model, the idea of giving States and school districts credit \nfor making progress, sort of an A for effort, to go along with an A for \nachievement, that is a good idea. President Bush, in his \nadministration, began to permit that exemption from No Child Left \nBehind.\n  But superintendents ought not to be flying to Washington from \nNashville and Denver and different parts of America and asking anybody \nin Washington to approve their growth model or even be required to have \none if they have some other way to decide whether schools are \nsucceeding or failing.\n  Let me take another example that I have a very deep interest in. \nTeacher and principal evaluation systems related to student \nachievement. Tennessee became the first State in 1984 to pay teachers \nmore for teaching well. Up until then, not one State paid teachers one \npenny more for teaching well. In my office this morning were the two \nPrincipals of the Year from Tennessee and three representatives of the \nTennessee Education Association. Four out of the five were voluntary \nparticipants in our Master Teacher Program or Career Ladder Program and \nwere telling me how grateful they were for that.\n  But let me tell you this, it was a controversial and difficult \neffort. It was opposed massively by the National Education Association, \nwhose members this morning were thanking me for the program, because it \nis not easy to determine, in a fair way, how to reward outstanding \nteaching, particularly if we are going to relate it to student \nachievement and particularly if we are going to relate it to \nperformance pay.\n  The best way to do that is to encourage States and encourage school \ndistricts to try different ways of doing it and hope they succeed and \nborrow ideas from one another. This is what the Teacher Incentive Fund \nhas done for the last few years as a part of No Child Left Behind. I \nfully support that program and hope we will continue giving money to \nhelp school districts who want to try different forms of performance-\nbased pay.\n  But to require a student-teacher evaluation in order to get a waiver \nfrom No Child Left Behind runs the risk of school districts all over \nthe country--100,000 schools--being supervised by a national school \nboard.\n  I have had very good conversations with well-meaning superintendents \nand others in school districts who say: But Congress has to make us do \nit or we will not do it. I do not buy that. I do not think you can make \nschools better from Washington, DC. We can create an environment in \nwhich they might succeed. Schools are similar to jobs. We have a \nnational responsibility for them, but we cannot create them here. We \ncan create an environment to make it easier and cheaper to create jobs, \nprivate sector jobs. We can create an environment to make it easier to \ncreate better schools.\n  Then, the next thing someone would say is: There is no harm in just \nsaying in a Federal law or in a requirement for a waiver that we must \nhave a growth model or we must have a performance standard or we must \nhave a teacher-principal evaluation program. What is wrong with that?\n  Here is what is wrong with it. That is not the end of it. Because \nthere is the habit then, every time I have seen it--one time when we \npassed a law saying the Secretary of Education could not do it, of \ncreating regulations to interpret what the Federal Government means by \ngrowth models, performance standards or teacher-principal evaluation \nsystems, a lot of well-meaning staff members and other people and peer \nreview groups then decided what a teacher-principal evaluation system \nrelated to student achievement looks like. That is going to be very \nhard to do since nobody knows what it looks like. That would be akin to \ntelling people--requiring them to drive cars before the car was \ninvented.\n  We have had several good experiments around the country that are \nidentifying good teaching, rewarding performance, relating it to \nstudent achievement and relating it to better pay. But it has been very \nhard to do. No one is absolutely sure how to do it.\n  The worst thing we could do at this time with teacher and principal \nevaluations related to student achievement, even though I believe it is \nthe holy grail of school reform, is to impose any version of it from \nWashington.\n  I am simply asking the President and the Secretary to show restraint \ntomorrow. I have a lot of admiration for this Secretary and respect for \nthe President's positions on kindergarten through the 12th grade \neducation. Many of the ideas in the legislation advanced by Republican \nSenators last\n\n[[Page S5876]]\n\nweek to fix No Child Left Behind were suggested by Secretary Duncan. He \nhas gone out of his way to work with Republicans, as well as Democrats. \nHe has been an energetic, able Secretary, and I support most of his \nideas.\n  For example, he supported the idea--we agreed to it, Democrats and \nRepublicans, Senate and House--that instead of reauthorizing this big \nlaw, we would fix it. Then we identified nine areas we tried to fix. \nThe Secretary was comfortable with that, and so were Democratic \ncolleagues and Republican Senators. We set a new, realistic, \nchallenging goal to help all students succeed. We agree on that: \nInstead of a goal that would require 80 percent schools to be labeled \nas failing, we will have a new goal that says students will be college \nand career ready when they graduate from high school.\n  We agreed we should free 95 percent of schools from the Federal \nrequirement of conforming to a federally defined adequate yearly \nprogress mandate. What that simply means is, instead of Washington \ndeciding whether a school in Nashville is succeeding or failing, that \ndecision will be made by the State of Tennessee. The State of Tennessee \nwill be able to do it a lot better today than it could in 2001, because \nsince then we have had common standards adopted by 44 States--tests of \nthose standards adopted by about the same number. We have chief state \nschool officers agreeing on the principles of accountability systems--\nthese are the performance targets, growth models, and other such \nthings. In the case of Tennessee, they won the Race to the Top \ncompetition, which I also support.\n  The third thing is that the Federal Government will help States fix \nthe bottom 5 percent of their schools--that is 4,500 schools picked by \nthe States. The Secretary agrees with that, and we Republicans agree, \nand I believe our Democratic colleagues agree.\n  We agree on requiring States to have high standards that promote \ncollege and career readiness for all students. We agree on encouraging \nthe creation of State and school district teacher and principal \nevaluation systems to replace Federal highly qualified teacher \nrequirements. But for us that means allowing States--if they choose to \ndo it--to use title II money to pay for it. We are not going to require \nit or define it. We are going to let it flourish.\n  We believe in continuing the necessary reporting requirements. This \nmay be the greatest contribution of No Child Left Behind since 2002. It \nrequires reports on how schools are doing by subgroup, not on the \naverage. So we can find out if African-American children or Hispanic \nchildren are doing as well as other children. We have this great volume \nof information now from school districts all over the State, so that we \nhave, in effect, better report cards.\n  We believe on the Republican side--and I think there is agreement, in \nprinciple, at least, on the Democratic side--that we should allow \nschool districts to transfer Federal funds more easily to meet their \nneeds and to consolidate Federal programs.\n  We believe in empowering parents. In my office this morning, one of \nthe State Principals of the Year from Tennessee was from Powell Middle \nSchool in Knoxville. Their enrollment is up this year, from 920 to \n1,060, because parents were choosing to take their children out of \nschools that weren't succeeding, and they were permitted to transfer \nthem to another school--in this case, the Powell Middle School, where \nthey could succeed.\n  That is my request of a Secretary I admire and a President whose K-12 \neducation policies I respect: Please show restraint. Just because you \nhave every State over a barrel, doesn't mean you should be tempted to \nuse this opportunity to become a national school board. Step back, look \nat the applications for waivers. If they enhance student achievement, \nsay yes; if they don't, say no.\n  Then one last point. Someone might say, and they'd be exactly right, \nthat the real reason the Secretary is granting waivers is because \nCongress hasn't done its job. We're in our ninth year of No Child Left \nBehind and we should have fixed it 4 years ago when the law expired. It \nhas just continued, according to the provisions of the original law. We \nhave substantial agreement in the Senate, except for these \naccountability provisions, these differences over whether we are \ncreating a national school board. We should come to a conclusion about \nthis. We should get a result. We shouldn't create a situation where \nevery Governor has to come to Washington to get a waiver from standards \nthat don't work anymore. That is our job. The Secretary has the power \nto grant waivers, but he should do it in a limited way and Congress \nshould get to work fixing No Child Left Behind so there is no need for \nwaivers. I call on our Democratic colleagues, with whom we have met \ndozens of times, to redouble our joint effort to get a result.\n  This is not a case where we don't want President Obama to succeed, as \nsome have suggested. We want him to succeed, because if the President \nsucceeds on K-12 education, the country succeeds. We substantially \nagree on how we need to fix No Child Left Behind. We still have a few \ndifferences of opinion. The Secretary's regulatory action should not do \nwhat the Congress ought to be doing. I respectfully suggest that he \nshould show restraint and we should get to work.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as \nin morning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Disaster Relief\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, we find ourselves in a peculiar \ncondition. We must have the people across this country scratching their \nheads and wondering: What are those guys doing? We know the American \npeople do not think much of us as it is, but they are surely going to \nthink less of us when they see what is happening.\n  We have a tradition in our country that when disaster strikes, we \nrespond. Americans pull together and help each other. We saw that \nhappening in the aftermath of Hurricane Irene, which devastated New \nJersey and other States along the east coast, and other natural \ndisasters hitting our country across its breadth--forest fires in one \nState, water shortages in another, and other problems in others. There \nisn't a State in this country that hasn't felt the wrath of a storm or \nthe difficulty that nature presents. But the one thing we don't see is \nthe spirit of cooperation. It certainly doesn't extend to some of our \ncolleagues.\n  I look at the House disaster relief proposal, and one thing is for \nsure: It is totally inadequate. Madam President, this is an emergency, \nand it is just plain heartless for our colleagues to turn their backs \non families who are struggling to rebuild their shattered lives. I \ndon't know what they are thinking because we know difficulties have \nstruck all 50 of our States at one time or another, a lot fairly \nrecently. Yet these people are saying: No, we are not going to give you \nenough money to deal with the emergencies that we have.\n  I hope the people who are in their districts or in their States look \nat their representatives and say: Hey, wait a second. We have problems \nhere. And these people who are so negatively disposed are raising havoc \nwithin the families of their own States or their own districts. They \nare just turning their backs on them.\n  The early estimates suggest that Hurricane Irene could become 1 of \nthe 10 costliest storms in American history, with damages that could \nexceed $10 billion. This violent storm produced some of the worst \nflooding in a century, destroying homes and displacing countless \nfamilies.\n  In my State of New Jersey alone, 11 lives were lost, people were \nturned out of their houses. In many cases, as I saw them--as President \nObama saw them when he came to my State--they can't go back to those \nhouses. They certainly, for the most part--those who had to evacuate \ntheir homes and put their furniture out on the front lawn--their \nfurniture is unusable even if they can get in their houses. So life has \na grim picture for these people.\n\n[[Page S5877]]\n\n  The President came to New Jersey to see for himself the destruction \nthat Hurricane Irene caused. I joined him on a tour of the city of \nPaterson, NJ. It is my hometown. I was born there. It was one of the \ncities hardest hit by flooding. We have a picture. It has lots of \npretty colors, but it is a disastrous portrayal--water all over the \nplace, a bridge just about underwater. We witnessed unforgettable \nimages--streets and sidewalks covered in mud, and in some houses the \nsecond floors were covered in mud as well.\n  But Paterson is not alone. This picture shows the damage in Bound \nBrook, NJ. Here we see, again, flooded roadways. By the way, my State \nof New Jersey happens to be the most densely populated State in the \ncountry. We have 9 million people living in a very small area. So when \nsomething like this hits, it hits a lot of people in a hurry.\n  In Cranford, NJ, this material we see here you might call trash, but \nthe people who lived here didn't call it trash. These were their \npossessions. These were the things their kids slept on night after \nnight, or tables they ate from every day. Trash. These people across \nthe Capitol--people on the other side in the House of Representatives--\nthey say: Oh, too bad. First of all, we will have to go find the money \nif we are going to do anything; and, secondly, we are just not going to \ngive enough money to deal with the problem.\n  We have a city called Boonton, NJ. People are unable to get what they \nneed. There was a bridge there before. It is gone. How do they get \nacross town? Well, maybe they just don't.\n  With Hurricane Irene we witnessed nature's power to destroy, and now \nit is time to see the Federal Government step up; get in there to \nrepair, rebuild, restore, and give people encouragement. When the \nPresident of the United States stood before the people in New Jersey, I \nsaw them weep when they held his hand. They wept not because it was a \nsad picture for the President, but because it was a sad picture for \ntheir lives. They are thinking about their own kids and their own \nlives, and seeing the President was a sign of relief. They were \nthinking: The President of the United States is here. He is going to \nmake sure we get help in a hurry.\n  But our Republican friends on the other side, they say: No hurry. No \nhurry. I hope the people in these States, the people in these \ndistricts, will record these moments. We will remind them about it.\n  Even before this hurricane struck, FEMA's primary source of funding \nfor cleanup and recovery--the Disaster Relief Fund--was already on life \nsupport. They didn't have enough money to do their job. The fund was \ndepleted by recent tornadoes, flooding that wreaked havoc across the \nMidwest and South, and wildfires that ranged across the South and the \nWest. So here in the Senate we passed a bill, and it wasn't easy.\n  A lot of our colleagues stood up to the assignment and said: OK, I \ndon't necessarily agree, but I agree conceptually. Therefore, I will \nagree to make $7 billion in funding available to help victims of \nHurricane Irene as well as victims of the recent tornadoes and \nwildfires. Our bill provides funding to get us through the end of the \nmonth because the fiscal year ends at the end of September--just a few \ndays away--and to support emergency needs when the next fiscal year \nbegins in October.\n  Last week, 10 Republicans had the guts to stand up and say: I don't \ncare that it is the Democrats who are proposing this; I care about the \npeople it is going to serve. They stood up and voted with us. It took \ncourage. They stood up for their constituents and people across the \ncountry who are trying to rebuild their lives. This was a courageous \nvote for them, and it shows there is bipartisan support for the Senate \ndisaster relief bill.\n  In contrast, the House Republicans couldn't even get enough support \nfrom their own party to pass their measly proposal last night. It is \ntime for them to embrace the Senate plan on disaster relief and stop \nusing disaster victims as political pawns.\n  Who are they going to hurt? Are they going to hurt President Obama? \nAre they going to hurt Democrats who are in office? No. The pain goes \nto the ordinary people who work for a living and take care of their \nfamilies and those proud Americans serving in our military. Those are \nthe people to whom they are saying no.\n  It is too bad. It is too bad. A lot of these people are veterans and \nhave come back from dangerous duty. They go home, their unemployment \nrate is high, and very often they are rebuilding their lives. If they \nhave a home, a domicile, in these areas, they say we can't help them.\n  The House Republicans' halfhearted approach offers little more than \n$3\\1/2\\ billion in disaster relief. That sounds like a lot of money, \nbut it is not even close to being enough. It is going to leave our \nresidents, our States, our cities and towns out in the cold at a time \nwhen they desperately need help.\n  In addition to shortchanging FEMA, the House provides zero funding \nfor many of the programs that are needed to help us recover. Our Senate \nbill includes funding for the community development block grants--a \nvery important program. It gives communities money and the latitude to \ndeal with the problems that face them. It provides our communities with \nlong-term support and Economic Development Administration grants to \nhelp businesses grow again--to hire people and to produce product. It \nalso includes funding for the Department of Agriculture to help farmers \nand residents in rural areas to recover. It is the kind of help we \noffered in 2008 and 2010 when hurricanes and heavy rains caused \ndestruction in States such as Texas and Kentucky, Tennessee and \nIndiana, and it is what we have to do again.\n  The House Republicans failed to provide funding for farmers, economic \ndevelopment, or long-term support for local communities to rebuild. \nThat is what you do when you have a crisis or a natural disaster, and \nthere can't be any debate about the help that is required in all 50 \nStates. It requires bipartisan support because we can't get it done \nwith only one party.\n  Every State has experienced a disaster in recent years. This year \nalone, Federal disasters have been declared in 48 States. FEMA is \nworking in every one of those States to help communities rebuild and \nrecover--if they have the resources. If they don't, they will not be on \nthe job and people will continue to suffer. So if the House Republicans \nget their way, every State is on the verge of disaster.\n  Incredibly, the House proposal pays for disaster relief by taking \nmoney from advanced technological development that will help our \nautomobile industry, for instance, and create jobs. In the Senate, we \nhave to reject this misguided approach. We have to say no way. We are \nnot going to rob Peter to pay Paul. They simply want to rob Peter and \nPaul--that is what they want to do--of assistance and help.\n  We should ask why it was acceptable to provide more than $800 million \nto invade and then rebuild Iraq without paying for it, no questions \nasked. Ask the families who made sacrifices in that war how they felt \nabout it. We turn our back on it. That is what we have done. But when \nthe time comes to rebuild America, some Republicans want to hold the \nmoney hostage until painful spending cuts are inflicted elsewhere.\n  They are gunning for the President of the United States. They think \nthey are going to be able to smash President Obama's accomplishments: \ngetting a couple million people to work, the packages that got the \ndecline stopped where it was and started to turn around.\n  We have to remember something. I was once the senior Democratic \nmember on the Budget Committee, so I know about balancing budgets. But \nwhen these reckless tax cuts came up for the wealthy and cost $700 \nbillion over 10 years, they were approved without being paid for. It is \npretty clear, when it comes to giving big tax breaks to millionaires \nand billionaires, the wealthy among us--and I say this without meaning \nto boast. I ran a very good company, a company I helped start with two \nother fellows that now employs 45,000 people, where there were three of \nus, and I, with my education being paid for by the government because I \nserved in the Army for 3 years and I got the G.I. bill.\n  So I will tell you this--and I will tell this to all my colleagues \nand I hope they hear me. I think it is time for people like me who have \nmade money to pay something back, to give strength to our country, and \nnot argue about whether they pay enough tax. They\n\n[[Page S5878]]\n\ndon't pay enough tax. Warren Buffet says they don't pay enough. They \nlisten to him, that they don't pay enough tax. It doesn't hurt those of \nus who have been successful the least bit to pay a few more percent in \ntaxes. We can feel good about it. Look in the mirror after we have put \nsomething in of value that our country needs, that strengthens the \nworking class of people that tells them: Listen, we have gotten our \nshare, and now it is our responsibility to give back some part of that \nshare.\n  It is pretty clear; when it comes to giving big tax breaks to \nmillionaires and billionaires, the Republicans don't give a second \nthought as to how much they cost. But to our country's disaster \nvictims, they have to go to the back of the line and wait their turn.\n  When disaster strikes, victims don't want us to reach for the budget \nax. They want us to extend that helping hand that gets their lives back \nstarted again. The fact is, disaster victims have enough to worry \nabout. In many years, people's lives have seen moments of jeopardy and \ndifficulty, and they fully gave what they had to help their country, \nfeeling all the time that the government is going to stand behind them.\n  That is what this country of ours is about, this democracy. The \nConstitution demands that we improve the lives of our citizens; that we \ngive them rights, we give them support, we give them a view of life.\n  House Republicans want to turn their backs on storm victims. A lot of \nthem are new here. They ought to enjoy these terms because they may not \nhave another one when the public finds out what they are doing, turning \ntheir backs on storm victims, local communities, regional economies, \nand farmers. Their proposal will cost us jobs, and I hope their jobs \nwill be included in it when it comes time next year to vote.\n  I appeal to my Republican colleagues, stand--stand for those who live \nin your States, including our neighbors, including the States' \nchildren, including the States' families. Remember this, Republican \nSenators, Republican House Members. We represent people across \npolitical lines, across religious lines, across all different lines, \nand our obligation is to take care of those people when they need help; \nto give them some support, to give them some hope, to give them some \nvision.\n  That is what we are supposed to be doing. We are supposed to be \nencouraging our citizens, our constituents, and not simply turning our \nback. What we ought to have is a camera in here that shows every time \npeople vote no on issues and make sure it is clearly understood when \npeople turn their backs on their fellow citizens.\n  We face serious fiscal challenges in our country, but we cannot put a \nprice on human life. Nothing--nothing is more important than keeping \nour communities, our families, and our economy safe.\n  I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 651\n\n  Under the previous order, the question occurs on amendment No. 651, \noffered by the Senator from Florida, Mr. Rubio. There will be 2 minutes \nof debate equally divided prior to the vote.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I will be brief.\n  The amendment is simple and straightforward. It just returns the TAA \nProgram back to its original intent. It was designed to help workers \nwho were displaced from their jobs or lost their jobs as a result of \ntrade practices, primarily as a result of free-trade agreements between \nthe United States and other countries. It is one of the reasons why, I \nbelieve, the majority has brought this issue before us before \nproceeding to the free-trade agreements with South Korea, with Panama, \nand with Colombia. What this does is it returns it back to that. It \nclearly recognizes there are workers who have been hurt by unfair trade \npractices unrelated to trade agreements, whether it is what China does \nor other nations do, and those things need to be dealt with, but they \nneed to be dealt with separately.\n  This program was originally designed to help workers who were harmed \nin the short term. That is why it is called adjustment. These are \nworkers who are trying to adjust as a result of some disruptions that \nmay have occurred as a result of a trade agreement.\n  I think what we can take solace in knowing is that the best thing you \ncan do for a worker who has lost his job is to get him a job. \nUltimately, that is what free-trade agreements do. They create jobs in \nAmerica, as the White House has recognized.\n  My hope is that we will proceed quickly to the passage of the three \nfree-trade agreements, and again I urge the White House to submit those \nand that this body take them up as soon as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, the conflict here with regard to the \namendment that has been proposed is that on our side of this debate, we \nthink this should be a broad array of help for workers. If a worker \nloses his or her job and we can provide eligibility for trade \nadjustment assistance, we shouldn't limit that just to the 17 countries \nwith which we have a trade agreement.\n  Say if we have a problem with massive job loss as a result of what \nChina is doing, either because they are cheating on currency or not \nplaying by the rules--as we know they have not in many instances. I \nhave a table here that indicates that in fiscal year 2012, when you \nlook at the estimated number of workers certified under trade \nadjustment, whether they are import-related certifications or whether \nthey are all other certifications, you add it up and there are more \nthan 287,000 people who are impacted. A lot of those are impacted by \nway of unfair trade from China.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. CASEY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

Under the previous order, the question occurs \non amendment No. 650, offered by the Senator from South Dakota, Mr. \nThune. There will be 2 minutes of debate equally divided.\n  The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, my amendment simply requires a study by \nthe International Trade Commission when a trade agreement has been \nsigned but the implementing legislation has not been taken up by \nCongress within 2 years. The study will examine the impact of lost \nexport opportunities, the impact on U.S. jobs, and the impact on and \nthe protection of U.S. intellectual property resulting from the delay.\n  Today we have anecdotal evidence, but there isn't a comprehensive \ngovernment report on what delay means for U.S. businesses in our \neconomy. I wish we did not need this amendment, but we have seen with \nthe Korea, with the Colombia, and with the Panama agreements we cannot \nassume an agreement will be implemented swiftly after it is signed.\n  This amendment is not about casting blame. The study will apply to \ntrade agreements whether negotiated by a Democratic or a Republican \nPresident. It is not about the past. It is just the fact that Congress \ndeserves better information about the impact when we delay these trade \nagreements. This does not affect TAA, it does not affect the underlying \nbill, and it does not affect passage in the House. It is a commonsense \namendment.\n  I hope my colleagues will support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment. Our \nexporters face major challenges in global markets. We are faced with \nsurging imports from China. China has a regime in place that is \ncheating American innovators and forcing them to share their \nintellectual property.\n  Instead of dedicating the scarce resources of the International Trade \nCommission to look into these issues and to identify other foreign \ntrade barriers that impede our exporters, we would essentially task the \nInternational Trade Commission to tell us what we already know.\n  For example, we know that in the case of the pending agreements, we \nhad an opportunity to get a better deal for our companies that export \nautomobiles and to promote human rights in Colombia by reducing \nviolence.\n  We are on the precipice of considering these agreements. Let's not \nturn back the clock. Instead of using scarce resources to have an \narmchair debate about what we already know, let's dedicate the \nresources of this agency to help workers and businesses.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote, the yeas are 44, the nays are \n52. Under the previous order requiring 60 votes for the adoption of \nthis amendment, the amendment is rejected.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 634\n\n  There is now 10 minutes of debate prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 634 offered by the Senator from Texas, Mr. Cornyn.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition \nto the Cornyn amendment that would force the administration to sell new \nF-16s to Taiwan.\n  Yesterday, the administration announced details of a $5.8 billion \narms package to Taiwan.\n  The central element of this package is the decision to support a \nsubstantial upgrade to Taiwan's existing fleet of 145 F-16 A/Bs.\n  The upgrades include state-of-the-art avionics and weaponry such as \ntargeting systems, AIM-9X air-to-air missiles and precision guided \nmunitions.\n  The deal also includes the active electronically scanned array radars \nthat, according to Taiwan's Defense Ministry, will allow its planes to \ndetect China's new J-20 stealth aircraft.\n  The package also includes pilot training and spare parts for Taiwan's \nF-5 jets and C-130 transport planes.\n  It will significantly improve Taiwan's self-defense capabilities \nwithout increasing cross-strait tensions.\n  As we all know, Taiwan has asked the administration to accept a \nletter of request to sell 66 of the newer F-16 C/Ds.\n  Those who support the sale of new F-16s to Taiwan were clearly \ndisappointed by the decision to move forward with only upgrades to \nTaiwan's existing fleet.\n  Senator Cornyn described the decision as a ``capitulation to \nCommunist China'' and a ``slap in the face to strong ally and longtime \nfriend.''\n  Nothing could be further from the truth.\n  First, let's be clear: The administration has deferred the decision \non the sale of new F-16s to Taiwan, it has not rejected it outright.\n  It has acted in a manner consistent with the previous administration \nthat also refused to accept Taiwan's request for new F-16s.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that under the Obama administration, \ntotal arms sales to Taiwan have totaled $12.25 billion, more than \ndouble the amount sold during President George W. Bush's first term.\n  It is clear these attacks are more about politics than the security \nand self-defense capability of Taiwan.\n  Next, let's look at the arms sales package itself.\n  The decision to upgrade Taiwan's existing fleet of F-16 A/Bs will \nprovide many of the same capabilities as the new F-16 C/Ds.\n  According to the Pentagon, with a robust retrofit the F-16 A/B and F-\n16 C/D are comparable aircrafts. The upgraded F-16 A/Bs will have \nactive electronically scanned array, AESA, radars, equal to the new F-\n16s; embedded global positioning system inertial navigation systems, \nequal to the new F-16s; ALQ-213 warfare management systems, equal to \nthe new F-16s; night vision goggles, equal to the new F-16s; AIM-9X \nSidewinder missiles, equal to the new F-16s; sensor fused weapons and \nlaser guided bombs, equal to the new F-16s.\n  And the list goes on.\n  According to Mark Stokes of the Project 2049 Institute and a former \nPentagon China expert, the radar ``offers a significant capability that \nwould be able to maintain Taiwan's qualitative advantage'' over China.\n  Michael Pillsbury, a current Pentagon consultant on China, argued \nthat the A/B upgrades could be perceived as\n\n[[Page S5880]]\n\nproviding Taiwan with more capabilities than the C/Ds.\n  Supporters of this amendment will argue in favor of both upgrades and \nnew planes, as requested by Taiwan.\n  Allow me to repeat: The administration has not formally rejected the \nsale of new F-16s. It is still under active consideration.\n  Clearly, the decision to upgrade the F-16 A/Bs does not prevent the \nadministration from later selling Taiwan the newer planes.\n  Regardless of timing, we have to consider carefully what impact the \nsale of new F-16s to Taiwan would have on cross-straits relations.\n  In May 2010, I had the pleasure of visiting China and Taiwan for a \nseries of meetings with Senators Mark Udall and Kay Hagan.\n  We had full and rewarding discussions on a range of issues, including \ncybersecurity, energy, trade, and cross-strait relations.\n  One bright story in the region, I believe, is that of Taiwan and its \nrelationship with the mainland.\n  The reports we received on our visit were encouraging.\n  The three direct lines--air service, sea service and postal service--\nare all in place.\n  The number of flights between Beijing and Taiwan has reached 270 per \nweek, and I understand they are packed to the brim.\n  There is also substantial Taiwanese in China today.\n  Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou told us he was thrilled that \nnegotiations were successful on an Economic Framework Agreement, known \nas ECFA, which he subsequently signed and was ratified by Taiwan's \nlegislature.\n  On the 1-year anniversary of its passage, Taiwanese officials \nannounced that agricultural exports to China covered by the agreement \njumped 262 percent--to $69.31 million--in the first 7 months of 2011 \ncompared to the same period in 2010.\n  Overall, Taiwanese exports to the mainland in the first half of 2011 \ntotaled $61.56 billion, up 10.53 percent from the year before.\n  Follow-on talks have recently begun between both sides which will \nfocus on the trade in goods and services and dispute resolution.\n  With the momentum generated by the agreement, I believe China and \nTaiwan should begin to address the security situation across the \nstrait.\n  It is my strong belief that China should begin to reduce its more \nthan 1,000 ballistic missiles deployed along its coast.\n  I deeply believe that enhanced economic cooperation and constructive \ndialogue will move China and Taiwan away from military confrontation to \na clear path of resolving differences diplomatically.\n  In my view, the arms sales package for Taiwan announced by the \nadministration will improve Taiwan's self-defense capabilities and \nstill enhance this ongoing cooperation and dialogue.\n  Selling the new F-16's to Taiwan would only serve to undermine the \nprogress we have made with China this year.\n  Military escalation between Taiwan and China, which the sale of the \nF-16 C/D variant would be construed as, is not in the best interests of \nthe United States.\n  Finally, let me discuss how this amendment is being proposed.\n  Simply put, a trade bill to renew the Generalized System of \nPreferences and the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program is not the \nproper vehicle for a sensitive foreign policy debate.\n  The administration and most of my colleagues on this side of the \naisle have made it clear that we must renew trade adjustment assistance \nbefore we consider the trade agreements.\n  If this amendment passes, it will threaten the chances of passing \ntrade adjustment assistance in the House and, ultimately, consideration \nof the three outstanding free trade agreements with South Korea, Panama \nand Colombia.\n  If we are to have this debate, it should be during consideration of \nthe Defense authorization bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the Cornyn amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the amendment \noffered by Senator Cornyn regarding the sale of F-16C/D fighter \naircraft to Taiwan.\n  Let me begin by reiterating that I am a strong supporter of Taiwan's \nright to self-defense. That is why I am proud to support the proposed \narms sale package to Taiwan that the Obama administration transmitted \nto Congress just yesterday.\n  This package would provide an estimated $5.85 billion in arms sales \nto Taiwan, including a significant advanced technology upgrade to 145 \nF-16A/B aircraft that are currently part of Taiwan's air defense fleet.\n  But what I cannot support is the process by which Senator Cornyn is \nseeking to require the sale of additional F-16C/D aircraft to Taiwan.\n  Instead of mandating this sale on a trade adjustment bill, I would \nlike Congress to continue to work with the Obama administration to \ndetermine how to best meet our obligations under the Taiwan Relations \nAct to ``make available to Taiwan such defense articles and defense \nservices in such quantity as may be necessary to enable Taiwan to \nmaintain a sufficient self-defense capability.''\n  A defeat of the Cornyn amendment does not take the potential sale of \nF-16C/D aircraft to Taiwan off the table. In fact, the administration \nhas stated that it is still considering the possibility of F-16C/D \nsales to Taiwan.\n  I am confident that the United States will continue to help ensure \nTaiwan's security and stability long into the 21st century.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I would like to offer a bipartisan proposition to my \ncolleagues here in the nature of this amendment. The reason I say this \nidea enjoys bipartisan support is 47 Senators, Democrats and \nRepublicans, have joined in a letter to the administration asking that \nthe administration grant a sale of F-16C/D models to our ally Taiwan.\n  This amendment would compel that sale because unfortunately the \nadministration declined to make that sale yesterday, notwithstanding \nthe fact that the Taiwan Relations Act signed by Jimmy Carter and \npassed by a bipartisan Congress requires the United States to provide \nTaiwan with defense articles necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain \nsufficient self-defense capabilities.\n  They have lost that capability, as demonstrated by this chart taken \nfrom Defense Department records. Currently, the People's Republic of \nChina has about 2,300 operational combat aircraft to Taiwan's 490. \nTaiwan, by comparison, has 490 operational aircraft, of which about 100 \nneed to be retired, French Mirage aircraft, F-5 aircraft. About 100 of \nthem need to be retired because they are literally obsolete.\n  What this amendment would do would be to compel the sale of 66 F-16C/\nD models to our friends in Taiwan. Why is this important? Well, the \nDepartment of Defense reports that China's military power is in an \nincreasingly precarious situation for the region and that China seeks \nthe capability both to deter Taiwan independence and influence Taiwan \nto settle the dispute between them on China's terms.\n  This amendment would compel that sale. My colleague from \nMassachusetts argued earlier that the retrofit of 145 of the F-16A/B \nmodels, which Taiwan has, which the United States sold, is an adequate \nsubstitute. It is not. All that will do is help upgrade 145 of these \naircraft that I identified earlier. It will not meet the need created \nby the retirement of the obsolete French Mirages and the F-5.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I think all of us agree with the intent and \nthe direction the Senator from Texas wants to go here with respect to \nour friendship and our support of Taiwan. In the 26 years I have been \nhere, I have never not supported doing what is necessary to live up to \nthe Taiwan Relations Act. But the Senator is reaching way beyond what \nwe have ever done in the Senate, which is to compel a single weapons \nsystems sale by the President with respect to a complex relationship \nsuch as China-Taiwan and the entire presence of the United States in \nthe areas of the straits and in that region. We have never done that.\n  Moreover, the President of Taiwan has said it is entirely adequate. \nHe feels they will have the defensive capacity necessary under the TRA \nin\n\n[[Page S5881]]\n\norder to be able to defend themselves at the current level with the \nupgrade we are providing.\n  Let me point out that under President Bush, over 8 years, we provided \n$12 billion to Taiwan--over 8 years. In 3 years of the Obama \nadministration, he has provided about $12 billion--3 years. So there \nwas $15 billion by Bush over 8 years, $12 billion by Obama over 3 \nyears.\n  The upgrade that is being provided--$6 billion worth of upgrade, \nsales of weapons--includes state-of-the-art avionics and weaponry, \nincluding the Active Electronically Scanned Array Radars, targeting \nsystems, Aim-9X air-to-air missiles, and precision-guided munitions. \nThose airplanes, those 145 F-16s, will have state-of-the-art capacity \nat the highest level of any F-16 that we are allowed to sell to any \ncountry in the world.\n  Moreover, the administration has made it absolutely clear that this \ndoes not preclude the sale of F-16s maybe in the next months, maybe in \nthe next year, but that ought to be done by any administration, \nRepublican or Democratic, in an orderly way as a matter of good arms \npolicy and as a matter of good foreign policy. In addition to that, the \nadministration is unalterably opposed to this.\n  So here we are working hard under a fairly careful script to get TAA \nout of here so we can move to three trade agreements that a lot of us \nwant to move and pass, which means jobs for America. They have been \nlong overdue. We pass this amendment, we lose that opportunity. It is \nthat simple.\n  So these are all tradeoffs, but this is a tradeoff measured against \nthe lack of any need for urgency as a matter of defense policy and \nforeign policy to do this. So I say to my colleagues, why, for the \nfirst time, without that showing of urgency and need, particularly \ngiven the President of Taiwan's own statements, are we going to for the \nfirst time compel a President to do something he does not think he \nwants to do in the context of the relationship with both China and \nTaiwan?\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as my colleagues know, under article I, \nsection 8 of the U.S. Constitution, Congress is given the power to \nregulate commerce with foreign nations. That is why this amendment is \nrelevant to this trade bill we are getting ready to pass, because it is \nimportant that products manufactured in the United States, and produce \ngrown here, that we sell it to markets abroad because it creates jobs \nhere at home, in addition to fulfilling our legal obligation under the \nTaiwan Relations Act.\n  I must say I disagree with my colleague from Massachusetts. The \nupgrade on the 145 aircraft does nothing to substitute for the retiring \nof the French Mirage aircraft and the F-5s, given the disparity of air \npower between China and Taiwan.\n  Because we are all concerned about jobs, let me remind my colleagues \nthat 32 different States will receive benefits by way of jobs as a \nresult of these sales. This isn't the primary reason why this is \nimportant. This is about American prestige, keeping our promises, and \nnot letting the bullies of the world, including China, intimidate the \nUnited States; and it is about keeping solemn commitments to our \nallies.\n  I ask my colleagues to vote yes, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute 24 seconds.\n  Mr. KERRY. Let me say, very quickly, that the sale of weapons \nmeasured against the policy decisions in a set of relationships that \nare critical to the balance of power and the threat and danger and so \nforth has never been translated into a jobs program. If you want it to \nbe--$6 billion spent on these upgrades--Northrop Grumman, Lockheed \nMartin, and a host of companies will benefit from that $6 billion and \nmay benefit from the sale of weapons down the road.\n  This is a policy issue. The policy question is whether the President \nof Taiwan can speak for Taiwan as the Senator from Texas speaks for \nTaiwan. It is whether we are going to be adequately meeting the needs \nof the TRA and the foreign policy priorities of an administration that, \nit seems to me, given the statements of the President of Taiwan, not \nonly don't violate it but sustain the relationship of the TRA.\n  I have proudly voted in support of Taiwan for the entire time I have \nbeen here, 26 years. I believe I am voting for them today, even as I \noppose this amendment but support the administration's $6 billion \nprogram for upgrade and those 145 F-16s--and maybe we will sell them \nsome others.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has elapsed.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, briefly, once this production line is shut \ndown for the production of the F-16, it cannot be reconstituted. The \n2,000 people currently working on the F-16 production line will be \nreassigned or fired and so this is important.\n  This isn't something we can take up willy-nilly later on because we \nfinally have gotten around to it. It is timely, and it needs to be done \nnow to keep our commitment to our ally and show the Chinese what they \nneed to see from America; that is, strength, not weakness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask an affirmative vote on this \namendment.\n  Trade adjustment assistance is very simple. We have a job crisis in \nthe country.

Mr. President, this is a caustic program of dubious value. \nIn our hearings, the representatives of the administration couldn't \ncome up with one job that would be lost as a result of these free-trade \nagreements.\n  There is no evidence that TAA works and, in all honesty, there is no \ncommitment from the President we are going to have the free-trade \nagreements come up anyway. I have to say that even though we haven't \ndone a trade agreement in years, TAA continues to grow and TAA is on \ntop of unemployment insurance that we are paying anyway, and it isn't \njustified.\n  All I can say is, literally, this program should not be adopted at \nthis particular point.

On this vote, the yeas are 69, \nthe nays are 28. Under the previous order requiring 60 votes for the \nadoption of this amendment, the amendment is agreed to.\n  Under the previous order, the clerk will read the bill for a third \ntime.\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  There is now 10 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote on \nthe passage of the measure.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, this bill addresses our country's most \nurgent priority--jobs. It helps American workers acquire the skills \nthey need to compete and win in the global economy. It gives American \nbusinesses better access to the materials they need to make world-class \nproducts, and that is just the beginning. It also opens the door to an \nambitious trade agenda, an agenda that will increase U.S. exports, grow \nour economy, and create jobs. That agenda includes our pending free-\ntrade agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea.\n  The first step is to renew the trade adjustment assistance. Trade \nadjustment assistance has been an essential part of U.S. trade policy \nfor nearly 50 years. When we negotiate trade agreements, we create new \neconomic opportunity and spur growth but also increase competition. TAA \nhelps American workers and businesses meet that competition with job \ntraining, income support, health coverage, and technical assistance.\n  Over the years we have reformed TAA to keep pace with the changing \nglobal economy. In 2009 we extended TAA to cover service industry \nworkers and workers whose jobs shifted overseas to any country, and we \nincreased funding for job training and health care. But the 2009 \nreforms expired. They expired last February.\n  Congress has never approved one free-trade agreement, much less \nthree, with TAA expired. This year must be no exception. This \nlegislation will restore the 2009 TAA reforms and responsible program \ncuts to achieve necessary cost savings. This legislation will clear the \npath to consider and approve our free-trade agreements with Colombia, \nPanama, and South Korea.\n  If we do not approve this legislation we will impose a roadblock that \ncould derail our three free-trade agreements. We cannot afford to fail. \nWeak consumer demand at home threatens to stall our recovery. We need \nthese agreements to increase sales of U.S. farm products, manufactured \ngoods, and services abroad.\n  The International Trade Commission estimates that these agreements \nwill boost U.S. exports by $13 billion. Most important, these \nadditional exports will increase economic growth and support tens of \nthousands of American jobs. We cannot delay.\n  This summer, for example, trade agreements between the European Union \nand Korea, and between Canada and Colombia entered into force. U.S. \nexporters are losing sales to their European and Canadian competitors. \nAmerican jobs are at risk. Let's restore U.S. trade adjustment \nassistance for American workers, let's expand trade preferences for the \nbenefit of American manufacturers, and let's move quickly to our \npending free-trade agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I will vote in support of the amendment \nto renew and extend both the General System of Preferences and trade \nadjustment assistance. It is the correct approach for Congress to \nextend trade adjustment assistance, TAA, including an extension of the \n2009 bipartisan reforms, before considering the pending trade \nagreements with South Korea, Colombia, and Panama.\n  TAA is not a substitute for fighting to keep jobs here in the United \nStates. However, given the realities of a global economy we must \nprovide a safety net so workers who lose their jobs as a result of \nexpanded trade and globalization are able to transition to new jobs \nthrough retraining and that they have access to affordable health care \ncoverage.\n  The 2002 TAA law covered only manufacturing workers who lost jobs as \na result of imports or if those jobs shifted to FTA partner countries. \nIn 2009, as part of the Recovery Act, the TAA Program was expanded \nthrough bipartisan efforts to increase training funding. It also \nexpanded eligibility to include the service sector and farmers and to \ncover workers whose jobs were been moved anywhere offshore, not just to \na FTA partner country. Finally, it expanded access to TAA's health \ncoverage tax credit, which helps certified workers purchase private \nhealth insurance.\n  Those 2009 expansions expired on February 13, 2011 and are overdue \nfor reauthorization. The bill the Senate is considering today is a \nbipartisan agreement to restore most of the 2009 provisions through \nDecember 31, 2013. It will also apply the benefits retroactively from \nFebruary 12, 2011.\n  There is clearly a need for an expanded TAA Program. Since the 2009 \nreforms, almost 450,000 workers have been certified for TAA assistance: \nover 40 percent of whom were certified\n\n[[Page S5883]]\n\nunder the expanded provisions and coming from every state in the union. \nAs a leading manufacturing state and a significant contributor to \nglobal trade, Michigan has relied on the TAA Program to retrain workers \nfor new careers and certified nearly 50,000 workers since the 2009 \nreforms.\n  Michigan also houses the Great Lakes Trade Adjustment Assistance \nCenter. The Great Lakes TAA Center helps hundreds of firms in Michigan, \nIndiana and Ohio compete in the global economy. The TAA for firms \nprogram assists mostly small and medium-sized companies that experience \nloss of jobs and sales because of foreign imports. TAA for firms has \nhelped to retain or create tens of thousands of jobs by saving \ncompanies and jobs imperiled by import competition. This TAA extension \nincludes $16 million for this important program--TAA for firms.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor the renewal of Trade Adjustment Assistance programs which for \ndecades have served as a critical lifeline for thousands of Mainers \nwhose jobs have been adversely affected by increases in foreign imports \nand shifts in production overseas.\n  During my entire tenure in Congress, I have worked tirelessly with my \ncolleagues to reform and expand TAA programs to assist workers, \nbusinesses, and communities harmed by trade liberalization in competing \nin an increasingly global marketplace.\n  And frankly if there were ever a moment to rebuild and equip our \nworkforce to make greater strides when it comes to competing in the \nglobal economy is there any doubt, that time is now?\n  Consider that China will surpass the U.S. economically in 2016--a \nmere five years from now--according to the International Monetary Fund. \nConsider that the total U.S. international trade deficit for 2010 was \n$497 billion, up from $374 billion in 2009. And our trade deficit with \nChina increased from $226 billion in 2009 to $273 billion in 2010--a \n20-percent increase in just 1 year alone!\n  Whoever is elected President in 2012 will be the last President to \npreside over a U.S. economy on top of China's if we continue with our \ncurrent policies, which, in large part are fueling our decline and \nChina's rise. Make no mistake, this is the regrettable direction in \nwhich we are headed as long as we import more than we export, amass \nsoaring deficits, consume more than we produce, and outsource thousands \nof jobs.\n  Domestically, our Nation's $14.7 trillion debt is projected to reach \n100 percent of GDP this year; unemployment has been hovering near or \nabove 9 percent; and 22 million Americans are either unemployed or \nunderemployed. Indeed, we are experiencing the longest unemployment \nperiod in American history since data collection started in 1948, \nsurpassing even the 1982 double-dip recession.\n  Manufacturing has also grown at the slowest pace in 2 years. The \nhousing downturn is still plaguing the country, with no plausible end \nto foreclosures in sight. Home prices in March fell to their lowest \nlevel since 2002. Consumers, confronted with higher gas and food \nprices, are spending less on discretionary items.\n  And in my home State of Maine wage and salary employment levels have \nfallen precipitously through December 2010, with job losses of 26,900, \na 4.4-percent drop. Overall, employment numbers in my State have \nreturned to year 1999 levels, erasing the economic gains of the past \ndecade.\n  At a time when Maine and our Nation are struggling to revive our \nlackluster economy--the worst since World War II, renewing and \nreforming TAA represents a central avenue we must take if we are to \nreinvigorate our workforce so that American enterprise is positioned to \nbattle for customers with our counterparts in countries like China.\n  TAA programs--such as TAA for Workers, TAA for Firms, and TAA for \nFarmers have proved invaluable to accelerating the adjustment process \nand expediting the means by which laid-off workers are able to rejoin \nthe workforce and contribute to the bottom-line at a high level.\n  TAA is crucial in providing Americans with the skills and assistance \nneeded to meet this challenge. As President Kennedy said in 1962, TAA \nis ``a program to afford time for American initiative, American \nadaptability and American resiliency to assert themselves.''\n  Under the TAA for Workers Program, eligible beneficiaries in Maine--\nsuch as laid-off pulp and paper manufacturers--participate full-time in \ncustomized and on-the-job training or pursue coursework at local \ncolleges and universities to acquire the skills they need to reenter \nthe workforce. As of the end of 2010, thousands of Mainers had been \ncertified for TAA and reentered the workforce.\n  Additionally, under the TAA for Farmers Program, hundreds of \nblueberry producers and lobstermen in my state, facing increased \npressure from foreign products, have found the program's technical \nassistance and training extremely useful in retooling their businesses \nto ensure Maine's agriculture industry and fisherman remain among the \nbest in the world.\n  Likewise, the New England Trade Adjustment Assistance Center recently \nreported that 15 Maine companies have taken part in the TAA for Firms \nProgram over the last several years. These companies have taken \nadvantage of the program to reconfigure their business models, develop \nnew strategies, and make other adjustments necessary to remain \ncompetitive in the international economy--benefiting a combined 1,120 \nMainers employed by these firms.\n  However, despite these irrefutable successes, I have no doubt that \nsome of my colleagues will argue in favor of allowing TAA to expire. \nAnd they might argue that we should not be giving ``special treatment'' \nto individuals whose jobs have been affected by trade.\n  Allowing this vital program to lapse would amount to a colossal \nmissed opportunity not only for American workers but for our economy as \nwell. When a Maine saw or paper mill closes and the orders it used to \nhandle are filled by a Canadian or Chinese plant, that has a cascading \naffect across not just Maine's forestry industry but shipping \nbusinesses, our service sector, and the thousands of additional workers \nand rural communities that rely on this industry for their very \nsurvival.\n  The fact is, losing one's job to trade is not equivalent to losing \none's job because of technological advancements or economic adversity \nand downturn. The difference is that trade liberalization actions--such \nas implementing NAFTA or accepting China into the WTO--are the chosen \npolicy of the U.S. Government--a path I would argue has often \nsacrificed manufacturing jobs in order to gain market access for other \nsectors of our economy. Consequently, our government is all the more \nobligated to aid our workers and communities hurt by foreign trade.\n  To those who point out that there are inefficiencies associated with \nTAA, I agree that efforts at reform must reduce costs and eliminate \nwaste. That is why this bill lowers program expenditures, includes \ncost-cutting provisions from areas such as case management and \nadministrative expenses, and grants States greater discretion to manage \nthe programs.\n  Furthermore, the reforms made in this legislation require new \nperformance measures, metrics, and accountability as a precondition for \nreceiving training and benefits. In fact, the bill raises the standards \nby which applicants may receive waivers from training program \nrequirements--eliminating many of the loopholes that previously could \nhave been used to avoid participation in key job skill programs.\n  Finally, I am pleased that the legislation before us maintains the \nexpanded eligibility for service workers and those displaced by trade \nwith non-FTA partners like China and India. And it maintains \ninitiatives I have championed such as the health coverage tax credit--\nall of which are vital components to helping sustain both workers and \nbusinesses and enable them to contribute to our economic recovery.\n  Along with the enforcement of our existing trade laws, trade \nadjustment assistance must be a central pillar of our Nation's trade \nagenda. On February 8 I sent a letter to the Senate's leadership urging \nthat they work with me to secure a long-term reauthorization of TAA so \nthat families in Maine and across the U.S. are prepared for new \nemployment opportunities. Unfortunately, as so often seems to be the\n\n[[Page S5884]]\n\ncase in the Senate, action on this job creation package has been \ndelayed for far too long--over 7 months since I sent my letter.\n  Congress still has an opportunity to overcome this legislative \ninertia in order to benefit U.S. industries that have been devastated \nby foreign imports. American businesses and their employees are doing \ntheir part--Congress must do likewise.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise in opposition to this bill before \nus. It extends the generalized system of preferences program for 2 \nyears, as amended and, as amended, expands the trade adjustment \nassistance program.\n  I want to be clear. I support the underlying bill passed by the House \nthat extends the GSP Program. GSP helps American companies compete in \nthe global marketplace while helping developing countries grow their \neconomies and achieve sustainable economic growth to lift their people \nout of poverty.\n  As I have made clear over the past few days, I have serious concerns \nwith expanding the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program as it has been \namended by this bill. We can no longer afford to increase domestic \nspending on programs that have dubious value and unproven results. That \nis what this bill will do.\n  I cannot condone this spending, so I will vote no. I offered an \namendment that would have ended the mystery surrounding the sequencing \nof TAA and the three pending free-trade agreements that have been the \nsubject of much intrigue and speculation.\n  My amendment would have called off the expansion of TAA until our \nfree-trade agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea were \nenacted. Everything would move together. Isn't that what this whole \nbargain is supposed to be about?\n  Well, that amendment did not pass and the White House still refuses \nto say when they will send up the FTAs for a vote. That does not seem \nright or fair to me. TAA is an unproven and costly and \ncounterproductive program.\n  I urge my colleagues to also oppose this bill, but should it pass, I \nhope the President finally matches actions with words and sends the \nFTAs up for a vote. I am convinced all three will receive strong \nbipartisan votes. American businesses, farmers, and workers, and our \nfriends and allies in Colombia, Panama, and South Korea cannot afford \nany delay.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, has the time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes remain.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. After today's vote, the White House has no more \nexcuses. The time has come to send the three pending trade agreements \nto Congress. We waited for the chance to pass these trade agreements \nthat our economy desperately needs and that even the White House admits \nwill create tens of thousands of jobs.\n  The White House asks us for a path forward on trade adjustment \nassistance in exchange for sending these deals up to Congress and we \ngave it to them. I cannot say I am happy about that. This is a program \nthat I and many Republican Members have serious questions about. Thanks \nto the leadership of two of our Members, Senator Blunt and Senator \nPortman, we are where we are today, and the Senate will soon pass TAA \nwithout an amendment. Both parties in the Senate have acted in good \nfaith to move this process forward. Now it is the President's turn. No \nmore moving the goalposts; no more excuses. It is time for the \nadministration to demonstrate something that seems to be in short \nsupply on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, and that is trust. The \nSenate today will have acted on trust in passing TAA even before we \nhave received the agreements. The White House has refused to show the \nsame trust in congressional Republicans who have assured them that TAA \nwill move along with the free-trade agreements.\n  I kept my promise I would allow TAA to move forward in the Senate as \nlong as Republicans had a chance to amend it. It is time for the \nadministration to deliver theirs. It is time for the President to send \nup these long-pending free-trade agreements without further delay.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. For the benefit of the Senators, so we can look at the \nschedule a little bit this evening, first of all, I appreciate the \nsupport for this trade adjustment assistance from my Republican \ncolleagues. It is an important piece of legislation. I am glad we are \nable to complete this at least in the Senate.\n  As I have said many times, we have to make sure the House also passes \nthis. I have been told by the Speaker and others in the Republican \nleadership in the House that they will do that. I am hopeful and \nconfident they will. Once that is done--and they have ways of making \nsure through a rule they can issue, it would not be sent to the \nPresident. They do not have to enroll it until the trade bill is \npassed. Once the trade bill is passed, of course, they would send the \ntrade adjustment assistance to the White House.\n  This is the first step of this agreement, I don't need to tell \neveryone here--I have spoken to the Republican leader many times--I do \nnot support any of those trade agreements, but I am going to live up to \nwhat I said I would do and do what I can to move those through the \nSenate as quickly as possible so there are fair votes on all of them. \nWe are waiting for the House to take action also.\n  Finally, without belaboring the point on trade adjustment assistance, \nI repeat what I said earlier. I appreciate very much the support of the \nRepublicans in getting the votes necessary to pass this bill. It was a \nnice vote and I appreciate it very much.\n  As far as the rest of the evening, I just talked with the House \nDemocratic leadership, some of them, and right now the Republicans are \nstill trying to get enough votes to pass something over there. Right \nnow they have not been able to do that so they have not even asked for \nthe rule to be issued. We are waiting to see what they do. Some of the \nreports out of the House are troubling, to say the least. One of the \nlatest proposals we have heard--remember, one reason this went so bad \nis that 53 House Republicans wrote a letter to the Republican \nleadership in the House and said, unless you cut back the CR--remember, \nthat is an agreement we worked on for 3 months to get agreements so we \ntook care of the 301(a)s and 301(b)s for the rest of the year. They \nsaid until you cut that by $28 billion, we are not going to vote for \nit--$28 billion.\n  The latest we have heard from the House in an effort to satisfy the \n$28 billion that the 53 Republicans want is they said they are going to \ncut renewable energy projects by another $110 million. So if that goes \nthrough, then the 53 Republicans, instead of settling for $28 billion, \nare going to settle for $110 million. From Las Vegas, those are not \nvery good odds in a card game.\n  I hope we do something that is fair and realistic. I hope they send \nus a CR. I hope they send a reasonably important number on FEMA. We \nknow what is needed. The Secretary of Homeland Security was in Joplin, \nMO, today, looking at the devastation there and the work that has \nstopped in that town that was struck by winds of 300 miles an hour.\n  We are here. We are going to have a caucus in 20 minutes, but I \ncannot see us doing anything tonight.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If my friend would yield on that point.\n  Mr. REID. Surely.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I think I can probably speak for everybody on this \nside that if we had a choice between wrapping all of this up sometime \ntonight, as opposed to coming back tomorrow, I think I am pretty safe \nin saying we prefer, if it is possible, to complete the job tonight \nknowing full well we are scheduled not to be here next week. Presumably \nif we finish the job in a way that is satisfactory to both the House \nand the Senate, I think our preference would be to grind through and to \ntry to get to the end tonight.\n  Mr. REID. I understand what my friend is saying. I am sure if we took \na vote, everyone would agree on that. If we don't get that bill until \nafter midnight tonight, there is a limit as to what we can do. It may \nbe necessary to come back sometime tomorrow morning. I have a number of \nus over here who have important things to do, not only legislatively \nbut some with their own personal business. So I understand\n\n[[Page S5885]]\n\nif we have to come back tomorrow, we will try to do it as early as \npossible. We have some very serious things to do here. We have millions \nof people who are struggling because of this disaster relief. We talk \nabout disaster relief as if it is some number up in the air, but these \nare jobs we are talking about. These are millions of dollars we are \ntalking about providing for renovation, repair, and all of the other \nthings that need to be done in the disaster areas. These are jobs. \nPeople are waiting to do that work and, of course, the CR is very \nimportant.\n  I would hope the House would send us something that is fair and \nreasonable, because if it is more of the same as yesterday, I do not \nthink they are going to get the Democratic votes in the House. I do not \nthink they will get any over here. This is not a high school game of \n``I've gotcha.'' We are willing to be reasonable, but we are not \nwilling to vote unreasonably.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill (H.R. 2832), as amended, pass?\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? ``There appears \nto be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. KYL.

Madam President, this is a historically significant week \nfor the United States and for all those who care about peace and \nstability in the Middle East. As we know, it is a region that is \nalready roiled by protests and war and faces the prospect now of even \nmore tension, more uncertainty, and potentially more violence.\n  We know this to be the case if the Palestinian Authority's President \nAbbas goes forward with his plan to seek recognition of Palestinian \nstatehood at the United Nations in New York. We have known for some \ntime that this was coming and, thankfully, the U.S. Government has \nexpressed opposition to this ill-conceived idea, and the administration \nplans to direct a veto of the measure.\n  Our government has also worked to persuade other nations to join us \nin opposing the Palestinian statehood bid. But I am afraid we have not \ndone enough to convince the Palestinians there will be consequences for \ntheir actions.\n  By pursuing recognition of a state at the U.N., President Abbas is \nchoosing confrontation rather than negotiations with Israel. In doing \nso, he is violating the Oslo peace agreements signed 18 years ago which \nstate that the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians must be \nsolved through direct negotiations between the two parties. Direct \nnegotiations are not just the best way to achieve peace, they are the \nonly way to achieve lasting peace.\n  Direct negotiations are meant to bring the two sides to the finish \nline, where all the final status issues, including borders, can be \nresolved. By rejecting negotiations with Israel and appealing to the \nU.N., the Palestinians are trying to make the previous agreed-upon \nfinish line the new start line. If President Abbas pursues statehood \nthis week at the U.N., the Palestinians will find it more difficult to\n\n[[Page S5892]]\n\ncompromise in the future, given the terms of the state they are seeking \nrecognition for.\n  Israel will also find it more difficult to enter into future talks \nwhen the starting point is already an unacceptable result. Years of \nAmerican efforts to foster peace will be set back and threats to \nsecurity will increase once the Palestinians discover that votes in \nfavor of their statehood have not changed any of the circumstances of \ntheir daily lives.\n  The Palestinian statehood bid will do nothing to bring Palestinians \nor Israel peace, for peace cannot be made by votes in the Security \nCouncil or the General Assembly. All parties involved stand to lose if \nPresident Abbas pursues statehood at the United Nations.\n  It is important the truth be told. Israel is not what stands in the \nway of a Palestinian state; neither is the United States standing in \nthe way of a Palestinian state, for both the United States and Israel \nhave endorsed the creation of that future state. What prevents the \nstate's creation is the Palestinian refusal to recognize Israel as a \nJewish state with historical rights going back thousands of years, to \nthe land and to Jerusalem.\n  The Palestinians must recognize Israel's right to exist as a Jewish \nstate and must return to the negotiating table. Rejecting these terms \nand instead going to the United Nations will result in widespread \nrepercussions. The Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian people \nrely heavily upon international donors and support. Chief among those \nbenefactors are the American taxpayer. Last year, Americans sent about \n$550 million to the Palestinians.\n  In June, this Senate unanimously passed a resolution cosponsored by \n90 Senators, including me. That resolution stated that the Senate \nintends to consider reductions and restrictions on aid to the \nPalestinian Authority should it continue its efforts to circumvent \ndirect negotiations by turning to the United Nations.\n  My request this evening of my colleagues is that we should abide by \nthis resolution. There might be consequences. Lasting peace requires \nit.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/22/senate-section/article/S5892-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5892]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECESS SUBJECT TO THE CALL OF THE CHAIR\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator \nMitch McConnell from Kentucky and Senator Cornyn from Texas as \ncosponsors on S. 1595, the Solidarity with Israel Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I encourage all Senators to get on board \nwith that bill. It is time to send messages that the U.N. will \nunderstand.\n  Madam President, it appears the leader of the Palestinian Liberation \nOrganization and the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, is going to \nrequest that the United Nations recognize Palestine as a member state. \nThis action will create a major, unnecessary, and avoidable obstacle \nfor peace. It is quite simply intolerable.\n  For that reason, yesterday I, along with 15 of my colleagues, \nincluding my colleague and friend from Kentucky, the Republican leader, \nintroduced S. 1595, the Solidarity with Israel Act. Should the United \nNations recognize a Palestinian state, this legislation would terminate \nthe U.S. funding for the U.N.\n  I recognize that the consequences for recognizing a Palestinian state \nare severe, but they are appropriate.\n  Recognition of a Palestinian state at this point would undermine the \npeace process, and some have even questioned its legality. It would be \na deeply irresponsible action that brings into further doubt the \nlegitimacy of the United Nations as a good-faith actor in securing a \nmore peaceful, more free, and more democratic world.\n  As I, and many of my colleagues have repeatedly stated on the floor \nof the Senate, the sole means to create a lasting and enduring peace \nbetween Israel and the Palestinians is through direct negotiations. By \nattempting an end run around these negotiations--and make no mistake, \nthat is the aspiration of this Palestinian endeavor--the only result \nwould be to delay the critical decisions which must be made to obtain a \ndurable peace.\n  What is required is leadership--real leadership--to impress upon the \nPalestinians and the world community that if the United Nations \ncapitulates and changes Palestine's status before a comprehensive peace \nagreement is reached, there will be consequences. Unfortunately, \nPresident Obama, in his speech to the United Nations yesterday, failed \nto provide that leadership and to take control of this quickly \ndeteriorating situation.\n  Accordingly, yesterday, I and my colleagues introduced the Solidarity \nwith Israel Act. The United States can and should exercise its Security \nCouncil veto if the Palestinians make good on their threat to attempt \nto change their U.N. status. However, the use of our veto power might \nnot be enough to stop this subterfuge.\n  There are two methods by which the Palestinians could attempt to \nchange their United Nations status. The first is to have the Security \nCouncil recommend to the General Assembly that Palestine become a \nmember nation of the United Nations. But in the Security Council, the \nUnited States can veto a proposed change. However, the Palestinians \nalso have another means to alter their status. They could petition the \nGeneral Assembly directly--where the United States does not have a \nveto--and seek an upgrade from their current position as a permanent \nobserver entity to a nonobserver state. If this occurs, the \nPalestinians will be in a much better position to manipulate U.N.-\naffiliated agencies, such as the International Criminal Court.\n  It should go without saying, but I will remind this body that the \nprospect of Palestinians bringing actions against Israel's leaders and \nmilitary forces for defending our sovereign ally's right to exist is \ncompletely unacceptable.\n  We should expect more from the United Nations, but in spite of its \nsweeping statements in support of individual rights and peace, it has a \nmixed record at best when it comes to the treatment of Israel, a \nliberal democracy. The low point of its long and tarnished history on \nthis subject was the General Assembly's contemptible 1975 resolution \nequating Zionism with racism. A General Assembly upgrade of the \nPalestinians to nonobserver statehood status would be another in a long \nline of hostile acts toward Israel and another hindrance to the peace \nprospect and process.\n  Deterring this outcome is the primary objective of the Solidarity \nwith Israel Act. Israel is a friend and ally of the United States. It \nis a beacon of democracy and liberality in a part of the world that is \ntoo frequently lacking in both. Although the Palestinians have \nofficially recognized Israel's right to exist, their rhetoric continues \nto bring the strength of this commitment into question.\n  Therefore, we cannot sit passively while the United Nations \nundermines Israel. Simply put, if the United Nations votes to harm our \ntrusted ally by changing Palestine's U.N. status, this legislation \nwould require termination of U.S. funding of the United Nations until a \ncomprehensive peace agreement is reached with Israel.\n  The message of our legislation is also simple. The time for these \ntypes of games has ended. We will not stand by and allow a political \nspectacle to be created which only maligns our ally. The Solidarity \nwith Israel Act seeks to deter those who would engage in false charades \nand redirect the international community toward promoting the only \nmeans to truly achieve a lasting peace: direct negotiations between \nIsrael and the Palestinians.\n\n[[Page S5893]]\n\n  It is my earnest hope that even greater numbers of Members will join \nus in this cause. I think this is an important issue, and I hope we can \nget every Member of this community, of this Senate, to join with us in \nthis particular cause.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/22/senate-section/article/S5893-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5893]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO IRA JACKSON ``RED'' CORNETT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I rise today to recognize a very \nsuccessful and hard-working Kentuckian, Mr. Ira Jackson Cornett. Ira--\nknown to his friends as ``Red''--celebrated his 95th birthday September \n12 and is the proud founder and owner of the internationally known \nengine rebuilding firm, Cornett Machine Shop. Red is extremely proud of \nhis God-given ability to rebuild all types of engines and claims if you \ncan break it, then he can certainly fix it.\n  Red was born in London, KY, and moved to Oregon with his family when \nhe was young. He later returned to Somerset where in 1948, he bought \nland and established Cornett Machine Shop, which specializes in the \nrebuilding of racing engines from all over the world. Over the years, \nRed's unique skills have been crucial to his success and helped him \ngain international recognition. Red once sold an engine to Tiger Woods' \ncaddy and shipped it to New Zealand. Another time, Red had the \nopportunity to rebuild a V-12 airplane engine like the one flown by \nEddie Rickenbacker, a famous American fighter ace in World War I. \nCurrently, Cornett Machine Shop is rebuilding a Jones car that was made \nin Kansas in 1917--a car he feels very few these days realize were ever \nmade.\n  Red's Cornett Machine Shop has been a successful and reputable \nbusiness for decades. Now located on a hilltop on the west side of \nsouth U.S. 27, the business is still running full tilt and Red has \nfaith the tradition will continue as he has passed along his talents to \nhis sons, David and Jack. However, until then, Red says he plans to \nkeep on going, as he still has a lot of work to do.\n  Mr. Ira Jackson ``Red'' Cornett continues to exemplify the character \nand success that define generation after generation of Kentuckians; I \nask unanimous consent that a recent article published in Kentucky's \nPulaski County-area Commonwealth Journal that highlights Red's lifelong \nachievements be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Commonwealth Journal, Sept. 22, 2011]\n\n             Red Cornett: Engine Builder Going Strong at 95\n\n                   (By Bill Mardis, Editor Emeritus)\n\n       ``The Lord gave everybody a talent to make a living and a \n     person ought to enjoy doing it.''\n       Ira Jackson Cornett--his friends and everybody call him \n     ``Red''--has been using his God-given talent longer than most \n     people live. He passed his 95th birthday September 12. That's \n     correct. He has been living for nine decades and a half and \n     just keeps on going. ``Red'' Cornett shows up for work every \n     day at his beloved Cornett Machine Shop.\n       ``I go home for lunch,'' Cornett reflected. His wife, Mary \n     Elizabeth, is in poor health and he goes home to see about \n     her. They've been married 70 years.\n       ``I've still got a lot of work to do,'' said Cornett, \n     grinning and guiding his power chair among sophisticated \n     machinery in the sprawling Cornett Machine Shop on South U.S. \n     27.\n       Cornett loves to talk about his business. He relaxes in his \n     chair, stopping a moment as he and a visitor toured the \n     plant.\n       Someone spoke, calling him ``Red.'' He rubbed a hand \n     through a headful of gray hair. ``My hair used to be bright \n     red,'' he laughed. ``My whiskers still are . . . and they're \n     thick too.''\n       Cornett Machine Shop is his baby. He loves it. It is part \n     of his life. The internationally known engine rebuilding firm \n     rebuilds engines, all kinds of engines; racing engines; \n     engines from all over the world. ``Red'' Cornett knows how it \n     works.\n       ``The Lord gave me a talent . . . if you can break it I can \n     fix it,'' said Cornett. ``If nobody else wants to tackle it, \n     I'll do it.'' He has passed his talents along to son, David, \n     who manages the machine shop, and to Jack, who is in charge \n     of the Racing Division.\n       ``We sold (golfer) Tiger Woods' caddy an engine last \n     week,'' noted Cornett. ``We shipped it to New Zealand. We \n     sent an engine to Bend, Oregon, yesterday.''\n       Recently, Cornett Machine Shop rebuilt a V-12 airplane \n     engine like the one flown by Eddie Rickenbacker, an American \n     fighter ace in World War I. ``We built parts for it,'' \n     Cornett said.\n       Cornett Machine Shop currently is rebuilding a Jones car \n     made in Kansas in 1917.\n       ``Very few people know there was a Jones car,'' Cornett \n     laughed. ``They were making them back in 1902 and 1903.'' \n     Nearby was a flathead Ford engine circa 1939-40.\n       Currently, Cornett Machine Shop has 16 employees. ``One \n     fellow has been here for 55 years,'' Cornett said. ``At one \n     time I had about 30 employees,'' he related. Each employee \n     has his own private air-conditioned room in which to work.\n       Age has not tempered Cornett's strong opinions. ``Young \n     people don't have the same work ethics we have,'' he \n     declared. ``They don't love their work like we do.''\n       Cornett didn't reveal his political persuasion, but he \n     isn't too impressed with the current administration in \n     Washington. ``Obama sure has been a disappointment,'' he \n     offered.\n       About the economy, Cornett has an unusual perspective. \n     ``Things are no higher than they ever were. Money is junk . . \n     . it's getting more worthless.''\n       ``I started out on my own in 1948,'' he recalls. His first \n     machine shop was located on South Main Street. `` . . . The \n     telephone company and me were in the same block,'' he said.\n       Next, Cornett Machine Shop moved to U.S. 27 where the \n     Tradewind shopping center is now located. ``(U.S. 27) was a \n     single lane (each way) then,'' he remembers. ``Finley's \n     (Drive-in) was the next thing that built out there.''\n       ``I bought that lot (Tradewind location) for $2,000,'' \n     Cornett remembers. ``I went to Pope Walker at First and \n     Farmers Bank and he told me I could borrow all the money I \n     needed.'' Cornett Machine Shop has since located on a hilltop \n     farther south on the west side of U.S. 27, now a six-lane \n     boulevard.\n       Cornett was born in nearby London but his family moved to \n     Oregon. They later returned to Somerset.\n       ``I worked for the forest service in Idaho for $7.50 an \n     hour,'' Cornett recalls. His love for the outdoors has \n     lingered throughout his life. His hobbies are shooting, and \n     big-game hunting. ``I've killed moose, elk, deer, antelope \n     and millions of prairie dogs in South Dakota and Montana.''\n       In addition to David and Jack, the Cornett's have two \n     daughters, Mary Ann Bingham who lives in Alabama, and Arlene \n     Warner of Somerset.\n       Cornett is not letting 95 years stand in his way. ``I plan \n     to keep on going. That's my talent; that's what God said for \n     me to do.

Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nproud and grateful Kentucky veteran. Mr. Jim Moore was born and raised \nin Laurel County, KY, and takes pride in the many changes he has \nwitnessed over the past 80 years. One of 12 children, Jim grew up on a \nsmall farm on McWhorter Road and recalls the tears and triumphs of \ngrowing up in Laurel County.\n  Jim's parents, John and Lillie, provided food from the family farm as \nwell as occasionally peddled on Main Street to make ends meet. Jim's \nparents set up a booth every year at the Laurel County Fair and sold \neverything from corn stalks and tobacco to canned goods and bakery \nproducts.\n  Jim, along with his siblings, attended school in a one-room \nschoolhouse where one teacher taught all subjects to 60-70 students at \na time. Jim recalls being expelled from the school on his very first \nday; Jim's teacher wrote a note to his mother after he deliberately \ndisobeyed the teacher's orders to not leave school grounds. Jim \nreturned to school the next year and began first grade.\n  Jim also remembers the time when one of the first cars appeared in \nLaurel County. Jim was in school one afternoon when everyone heard the \nunfamiliar sound of a car coming down the road. Everyone, including the \nteacher, ran outside to get a glimpse of it as it drove by. To Jim's \nsurprise, the car was in his driveway when he returned home after \nschool--Jim's Uncle Leslie was the proud owner of the vehicle and had \ndriven it all the way from Oregon. Jim reminisces how his family \nthought that his uncle was rich because he would make multiple trips to \nget all 16 members of the family to the Reda movie theater and paid 10 \ncents per person to get everyone in.\n  Jim eventually joined the U.S. Army and served for several years \nbefore being discharged. Once out of the military, Jim drove a freight \ntruck for 35 years before eventually retiring. Like countless other \nKentuckians, Jim cherishes his childhood memories and is very fond of \nhis deep roots in our great Commonwealth.\n  Madam President, the Laurel County Sentinel Echo recently published \nan article highlighting Mr. Jim Moore's life and memories. I ask \nunanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S5894]]\n\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the Laurel County Sentinel Echo, June 6, 2011]\n\n             Moore Thinks Times Are Good, Better Than Past\n\n                     (By Carol Mills, Staff Writer)\n\n       Jim Moore, 82, grew up in the depression when times were \n     tough, but there was always food on the table.\n       He was born and raised in Laurel County on a farm on \n     McWhorter Road. There were 12 children in his family and only \n     one, besides him, Bill, is still living.\n       ``We raised most of what we needed on our land,'' he said. \n     ``People who lived in big cities had to wait in soup lines \n     two times a day because they didn't have any land to farm.''\n       His parents peddled what they could at the Laurel County \n     Fair, which was on south U.S. 25 about where Tincher-Williams \n     is now.\n       ``Every year they would set up a booth at the fair,'' Moore \n     recalled. ``They would take corn stalks, tobacco, canned \n     goods, and bakery products. Mom got two or three blue ribbons \n     about every year for her canning.''\n       Moore's father, John, and mother, Lillie, also peddled on \n     Main Street.\n       ``I've seen it when the wagons were lined up and down Main \n     Street and people sold watermelons, cantaloupes, whatever \n     they had to sell. Watermelons sold for a nickel, dime or \n     quarter depending on the size.''\n       The family also went to the Laurel County Homecoming every \n     year.\n       ``One year someone was selling R.C. Cola and dad bought \n     some bottles for about a nickel each and we would take a \n     drink and pass it around.''\n       The Moore children all went to school in a one-room \n     schoolhouse and one teacher taught all the classes. There \n     were about 60 or 70 students.\n       ``I got expelled the first day I went to school,'' Moore \n     laughed. ``I disobeyed the teacher. The teacher told two of \n     the guys to go to a neighbor's house and carry buckets of \n     water to the school. I started to go with them and she told \n     me not to. I thought, `Who are you to tell me not to go \n     somewhere.' I went and she wrote a letter to my mom.''\n       Moore went back to school the next year and started first \n     grade. He said he was too young the previous year anyway.\n       Moore said hardly anybody had a car back then.\n       ``One day at school we saw a car coming down the road,'' he \n     said. ``All of us, the teacher too, went to the banks along \n     the road to the schoolhouse to wait on the car. When the car \n     came by, we were all waving.''\n       When Moore got home from school, the car was sitting at his \n     house.\n       ``It was my dad's brother, Uncle Leslie, and his wife. They \n     drove that Model A all the way from Oregon. One day he took \n     us to the movies at the Reda Theater in town. The car had a \n     rumble seat. There were 16 of us altogether including grandma \n     and grandpa. I don't know how many trips he took to take us \n     up there and then going back and getting the rest. He paid 10 \n     cents for each of us to see the movie. We thought he was a \n     rich guy.''\n       His father gave up some of his land so that Johnson \n     Elementary School could be built.\n       ``He gave the school board 10 acres,'' Moore recalled. ``He \n     might have gotten $2,000 or $3,000 out of it. I don't know \n     back then. It was in the corner of the farm. We had a one-\n     room schoolhouse and a church on McWhorter Road. That was in \n     the Maplesville district. The school and church were both \n     called Macedonia. Up the road, they had a Johnson School \n     there on the corner of Old 80 and Johnson Road before they \n     built the one on McWhorter.''\n       There was someone on the school board by the name of \n     Johnson at the time so that is where the school got its name, \n     Moore said.\n       Because Moore's father had 12 children, he was not drafted \n     into WWII.\n       ``That's the only way you got out was to have an extra-\n     large family,'' Moore said.\n       One day Moore's mother loaded up five of her children and \n     took them to Dr. H.V. Pennington to have their tonsils taken \n     out. He had an office above Begley Drug Store, where Pocket \n     Park is today. They came back home that evening.\n       ``They didn't want us to eat anything that day, but I \n     wanted a biscuit and molasses. I cried my eyes out. I thought \n     they were going to starve me to death.''\n       ``That amazes me,'' said Mildred, Moore's wife. ``She took \n     five kids to get their tonsils take out at one time. Can you \n     imagine taking care of five? One's bad enough.''\n       ``They put a cloth over my face and then sprinkled ether \n     over it until you fell asleep,'' Moore said. ``I can still \n     smell that ether now.''\n       Moore also recalled there used to be a Poor House in London \n     at the location of Laurel Heights Home for the Elderly. He \n     said whole families could stay there, much like the Christian \n     Shelter for the Homeless on Fourth Street.\n       Moore remembered the first radio to come into his \n     neighborhood. His grandfather bought it.\n       ``It had a dry battery and a wet battery and had a wire \n     going through the garden to pick up signals. Everyone would \n     come in on Saturday night and listen to the radio, especially \n     the Grand Ole Opry. I think it's the oldest radio station in \n     the nation.''\n       ``They also had the ring-a-ding telephones,'' he continued. \n     ``Your ring might be two short, one long, or one long, two \n     short. Everybody had a different ring. You could pick up the \n     phone and hear anybody talking. It was a party line.''\n       When he was 16 or 17, Moore joined the U.S. Army. He stayed \n     in the army for three or four years and after he was \n     discharged, he drove a freight truck for 35 years before \n     retiring.\n       Moore was married to his first wife, Ethel, for 51 years \n     before she passed away. Mildred, his second wife, said they \n     will be married for three years this December. They both had \n     been widowed for several years when they met at the VFW Club \n     while going to one of their dances.\n       Moore said he has had a good life overall, but the best \n     time is the present.\n       ``We have running water. No more getting up in the cold \n     morning and having to build a fire.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/22/senate-section/article/S5894-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5894]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNIZING HEIMERDINGER CUTLERY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of \nLouisville, KY's oldest and most renowned locally owned businesses, a \ntrue treasure of my hometown that adds to the River City's charm. I am \nspeaking of Heimerdinger Cutlery, a family-owned business that \ncelebrates 150 years as a Louisville institution this month. \nHeimerdinger was first listed in the Louisville city directory in 1861 \nas ``A. Heimerdinger: Cutler and Sewing Machine Repair.''\n  In the 150 years since, Heimerdinger Cutlery has become one of \nLouisville's premier shops for kitchen and pocket knives, scissors, \nshaving needs, sharpening stones, magnifiers and many other items as \nwell as a first stop for learning about blade quality. It is one of the \noldest family-owned cutlery stores in the Nation.\n  Heimerdinger Cutlery celebrated its 150th anniversary with a special \nceremony and ribbon cutting earlier this month in Louisville, kicking \noff a week-long celebration event for its customers. This celebration \nincluded a special promotion honoring America's servicemen and women.\n  Residents of the Louisville area were also able to meet and learn \nfrom one of the editors of Knife World Newspaper, who came to \nHeimerdinger Cutlery to assess the value of older, collectible knives \nand sign books. Heimerdinger Cutlery also celebrated its anniversary \nwith products from another Louisville institution, Louisville \nStoneware.\n  Heimerdinger Cutlery is currently owned and operated by two proud \nLouisvillians, Carl and Glenna Heimerdinger, who carry on the family \nbusiness started in 1861 by Carl's great-great grandfather August \nHeimerdinger, originally born in Germany. When August started the \ncompany, he focused on scissors, butcher knives and sewing machine \nrepair.\n  Over the years, Heimerdinger Cutlery expanded into barber and beauty \nsupplies and secured the original patent on grass shears. In 1996, to \ncelebrate their 135th anniversary, Heimerdinger Cutlery had a ``Hanging \nof the Shears Day,'' and placed a 6-foot-long, 70-pound, working pair \nof shears on display in their store.\n  I congratulate Carl and Glenna Heimerdinger for the success of their \nLouisville institution. Businesses like theirs are the reason the city \nof Louisville and the Commonwealth of Kentucky will continue to thrive \nand grow. Here's hoping for many more years of success to Heimerdinger \nCutlery of Louisville.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/22/senate-section/article/S5894-2", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5894-S5895]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SECURING AIRCRAFT COCKPITS\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, this February I joined with \ncolleagues from both sides of the aisle to offer an amendment to the \nFAA Air Transportation Modernization and Safety Act to secure aircraft \ncockpits by making it a Federal criminal offense to knowingly aim the \nbeam of a laser at an aircraft. Our commonsense and bipartisan \namendment to protect passengers and pilots received overwhelming \nsupport in this body, and was agreed to by a vote of 96 to 1. A similar \nmeasure subsequently passed the House, without controversy, by voice \nvote under the suspension rules. Unfortunately, the larger bill to \nwhich my amendment was attached has been held up because of unrelated \nissues. As a result, today I am joining with Senators Kirk, Boxer, and \nFeinstein to re-introduce this provision as a stand-alone bill.\n  When targeted at aircraft, laser pointer strikes can instantly flash \nthroughout the cockpit, temporarily\n\n[[Page S5895]]\n\nblinding the pilot and crew. One pilot described the feeling of being \nhit by a laser like this: ``It immediately [lit] up the whole cockpit \nand it hit both of my eyes and burned both of my corneas. Instantly, I \nwas blinded. It felt like I was hit in the face with a baseball bat--\njust an intense, burning pain.'' FAA Administrator Randy Babbitt warned \nthat lasers can ``damage a pilot's eyes or cause temporary blindness.'' \nIn an event on this topic held last year at T.F. Green Airport in my \nhome state of Rhode Island, a pilot explained that the temporary \nblindness from a laser hit can last several seconds or longer, and when \na plane is rapidly approaching the ground for landing, ``one second can \nmake a big difference.''\n  This kind of threat to a pilot's sight--particularly during the \ncritical phases of takeoff and landing--poses an unacceptable risk to \nthe travelling public, our pilots and crew, and citizens on the ground. \nSecretary of Transportation Ray LaHood has thus described laser \nincidents as ``a serious safety issue.''\n  The problem has grown in recent years. According to a report earlier \nthis year by the Federal Aviation Administration, 2,836 pilots reported \nthey were targeted with lasers in 2010, nearly double the number in \n2009. These strikes occur at airports all across the country. At T.F. \nGreen Airport, for example, there were 12 such reported incidents last \nyear. The threat, which puts interstate commerce and travel at risk, \nrequires attention at the national level.\n  Current Federal law does not provide prosecutors with sufficient \ntools to prosecute and deter this dangerous conduct. Ill-fitting \nexisting statutes can only be used in limited cases, leaving even \nidentified perpetrators to go unpunished. My legislation would solve \nthis problem by creating a criminal offense that clearly covers this \nharmful conduct. It would explicitly criminalize knowingly aiming the \nbeam of a laser pointer at an aircraft. Violations would lead to \npunishment of imprisonment for up to 5 years or fines up to $250,000. \nThe bill would exempt valid uses of laser pointers in the aviation \ncontext, such as designated research and development activities, flight \ntest operations, training, and emergency signaling. Prosecutors thus \nwould have a new valuable tool to protect air safety without any burden \nbeing imposed on legitimate use of lasers.\n  I thank Senators Kirk, Boxer, and Feinstein for their leadership on \nthis issue, and our partners in the House for their work. I hope \nSenators from both sides of the aisle will join me in enacting this \nlegislation to protect American aviation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/22/senate-section/article/S5895-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5895]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CENTRAL AMERICA REPORT\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, as chairman of the Senate Caucus on \nInternational Narcotics Control, I am pleased to release a report today \noutlining key steps that the United States can take to assist our \nfriends in Central America as they try to reduce escalating violence. \nThe report--entitled ``Responding to Violence in Central America''--is \nendorsed by all seven Senators on the Caucus. In particular, I want to \nthank my cochairman Senator Grassley for his efforts on this report.\n  Violence in Central America has reached crisis levels. Throughout \nCentral America, Mexican drug trafficking organizations, local drug \ntraffickers, transnational youth gangs, and other illegal criminal \nnetworks are taking advantage of weak governance and underperforming \njustice systems.\n  Contrary to what many might think, the murder rates in Central \nAmerica last year were significantly higher than those in Mexico. In \n2010, there were 18 homicides per 100,000 people in Mexico. In \ncomparison, there were 50 murders per 100,000 people in Guatemala, 66 \nin El Salvador and 77 in Honduras. GEN Douglas Fraser--the Commander of \nU.S. Southern Command--said that ``the northern triangle of Guatemala, \nEl Salvador and Honduras is the deadliest zone in the world outside of \nwar zones.''\n  Our report calls for security in Central America to become a greater \npriority across all U.S. Government agencies. The caucus calls for a \ntwo-track approach to U.S. assistance to Central America focusing in \nthe short term on highly vetted law enforcement units while not losing \nsight of the long-term goal of strengthening institutions.\n  The report's key recommendations include:\n  Expand vetted units: The caucus calls for the expansion of vetted law \nenforcement units which work with the Drug Enforcement Administration--\nknown as sensitive investigative units--to all seven countries in \nCentral America. Vetted units provide a trusted partner to U.S. law \nenforcement in countries where corruption is often rampant. I supported \nlanguage that was included in the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on \nCommerce, Justice and Science's Fiscal Year 2012 Appropriations bill \nthat recommends the expansion of these units throughout Central \nAmerica.\n  Speed up security assistance: Our report calls on the State \nDepartment to speed up the arrival of security assistance to Central \nAmerica by changing it from being managed remotely by the U.S. Embassy \nin Mexico to allowing it to be managed directly by each of the U.S. \nembassies in Central America.\n  Increase drug traffickers' extraditions: Our report recommends that \nthe Obama administration encourage our partners in Central America to \nincrease the extradition to the United States of their nationals who \nare involved in international drug trafficking. Currently, Panama, \nHonduras, and Costa Rica will not extradite their nationals to the \nUnited States.\n  The caucus believes that extradition from Mexico to the United States \nhas been a critical tool in combating Mexican drug trafficking \norganizations. Bringing these fugitives to the United States for \nprosecution ensures that they cannot evade justice through bribes or \nthreats of violence in their home countries.\n  Support witness, judge and prosecutor protection programs: Next, our \nreport calls for the State Department and USAID to use existing funds \nto provide support for witness, judge and prosecutor protection \nprograms in Central America. Far too often, witnesses in Central \nAmerica are afraid to testify at hearings because of corruption in the \njudicial system and fear of retaliation. Judges and prosecutors are \nequally afraid to pursue cases against high-profile criminals.\n  Map sources of violence: Our report recommends that the countries of \nCentral America map the causes and sources of violence in the region. \nWithout a clear understanding of the causes and sources of violence, it \nwill be difficult to provide relevant solutions to the security \nsituation in Central America.\n  Reduce the U.S. demand for drugs: Last, but certainly not least, the \ncaucus's report emphasizes that drug consumption in the United States \nfuels violence in Central America. The United States continues to be \nthe world's largest consumer of illegal drugs. The 2010 National Survey \non Drug Use and Health found that 22.6 million Americans aged 12 or \nolder were current illegal drug users.\n  Senator Grassley and I have asked the Government Accountability \nOffice to conduct a study to evaluate the successes and shortcomings of \ndrug prevention and treatment programs in the United States. I have \nalso asked my staff to prepare a report on how to most effectively \nreduce the U.S. demand for drugs.\n  Central America is at a dangerous crossroads. A further deterioration \nof the security situation in Central America could severely damage \nalready weak institutions and justice systems. I, therefore, urge the \nObama administration and my colleagues in Congress to make security in \nCentral America a priority.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/22/senate-section/article/S5895-2", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5895-S5896]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL DAVIDSON\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise today to recognize Mr. \nMichael Davidson, the former General Counsel of the Select Committee on \nIntelligence, for his long and distinguished service to the U.S. \nSenate. Mike quietly retired from the U.S. Senate for the second time \non Labor Day, September 5, 2011.\n  At the Select Committee on Intelligence, where he worked for 8 years \nduring his second career here in the Senate, he was always a source of \nwisdom and optimism. Mike was invariably calm, thoughtful and \nconstructive. These qualities, in combination\n\n[[Page S5896]]\n\nwith his brilliant legal mind and prodigious memory, made him an \ninvaluable member of the committee staff. Indeed, Mike had a unique \nability to recall past legislation, reports, or other parts of Senate \nhistory, and find them in archives and mostly forgotten records, to \nmake sure that present day decisions were informed by the past.\n  In addition, Mike was known and respected throughout Washington. He \nwill be greatly missed, not only by our committee, but by the many \npeople who have had the privilege to work with him from other offices \nin the Congress, the executive branch, and the private sector. I know, \nand am appreciative, that the Office of the Director of National \nIntelligence will be honoring Mike in October for his numerous services \nto the committee and the intelligence community.\n  I have often been amazed at the varied backgrounds of Senators and \nSenate staff alike, and Mike Davidson is another example why. He grew \nup in Brooklyn, NY, where his father was a professor of theater at \nBrooklyn College, and where we believe his devotion to the New York \nMets was born. Mike received his bachelor of arts in history from \nCornell University in 1961 and his law degree from the University of \nChicago in 1964. With law degree in hand, Mike became one of the first \nPeace Corps volunteers in Kenya where he served for 3 years. Upon his \nreturn to the United States, he worked at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund \nbetween 1967 and 1973, trying civil rights cases and arguing appeals in \nvarious Federal courts. From 1974 to 1977, Mike taught clinical law at \nthe State University of New York at Buffalo. Moving to Washington in \n1977, he served as the chief staff counsel for the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia.\n  In 1979, Mike became the Senate's very first legal counsel, \nrepresenting the Senate in separation-of-powers and other litigation, \nand assisting committees in ethics, impeachment and other special \ninvestigations. One of the separation-of-powers cases Mike argued \nbefore the Supreme Court was INS v. Chadha. It turned out that Mike \nfrom his Peace Corps days actually knew the appellee Jagdish Chadha, \nwho had been born in Kenya of Indian parents. Not only did Mr. Chadha \nnot take personal offense that the Congress, through opposing counsel \nMichael Davidson, was trying to deport him, but because of his respect \nand admiration for Mike, Mr. Chadha brought a bottle of champagne to \nthe Senate Legal Counsel's Office the next day to celebrate Mike's \nappearance before the Court.\n  In 1995, Mike retired from the Senate for the first time, but he soon \nfound himself directing or serving as counsel to projects led by \ncurrent or former U.S. Senators, including a project at the Aspen \nInstitute, a joint project of the American Enterprise Institute and \nBrookings Institution, and a project at the Constitution Project.\n  Mike returned to the Senate in 2002 to serve as the general counsel \nfor the Joint Inquiry into Intelligence Community Activities Before and \nAfter the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001. Mike's work for the \njoint inquiry involved not only fact finding about the conduct of U.S. \nintelligence agencies prior to the terrorist attacks, but also \nsuccessful advocacy before Judge Leonie Brinkema in the case of United \nStates v. Moussaoui. The appearance was necessary to ensure that the \ncongressional Joint Inquiry had the testimony it needed to tell the \nstory of the FBI's Moussaoui investigation prior to the 9/11 attacks \nwithout interfering with the Moussaoui proceedings or other pending \ncriminal prosecutions and investigations. Shortly after the completion \nof the Joint Inquiry in 2003, Mike joined the Select Committee on \nIntelligence as minority counsel for then-Vice Chairman Jay \nRockefeller. In 2007, he became the committee's general counsel, first \nfor Chairman Rockefeller and later myself.\n  As general counsel, Mike led the work of the committee on all \nlegislation referred to it and reported from it. Mike's tireless \nefforts, and his skill in bringing people together to talk about the \nissues, even after others had given up, led to the passage of an \nintelligence authorization act signed into law in October 2010, the \nfirst authorization bill for the intelligence community enacted in 6 \nyears.\n  I can certainly attest that passage of that legislation was far from \nassured. The administration showed little enthusiasm for it, other \ncommittees objected to numerous provisions included, and the House of \nRepresentatives appeared insistent on two provisions--having to do with \nintelligence notifications to Congress and with investigations by the \nGovernment Accountability Office into intelligence matters--that were \nsubject to veto threats. Mike was instrumental in resolving both those \nissues, and with working through countless other hurdles, in achieving \nenactment.\n  Within 9 months, the committee also saw passage and enactment of its \nsecond intelligence authorization act, with the fiscal year 2011 bill \nsigned into law on June 8, 2011. We are well on our way with a third \nauthorization bill in 12 months with the intelligence authorization act \nfor fiscal year 2012.\n  Mike's careful legislative approach was very much in evidence during \nthe much more prolonged congressional consideration of the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act Amendments Act of 2008, during which he \nworked patiently to find legislative solutions that would satisfy the \nconcerns of the intelligence community in modernizing one of the most \nimportant of its authorizing statutes, while also addressing a range of \nviews in the Senate and the House and respecting the privacy and civil \nliberties concerns of Americans. Mike's painstaking attention to detail \nin the committee's reports and statements, with this act and throughout \nhis tenure, has resulted in exemplary legislative histories for the \nbills we have reported--an important, and sometimes neglected, aspect \nin how our laws are implemented and interpreted.\n  Mike also paid special attention to building the public record \nconcerning the work of the Intelligence Committee. Because of his \nefforts, the committee has greatly increased the number of public \ndocuments available on the committee's website, from the committee's \nown biennial activities reports to the yearly legislative request from \nthe executive branch. Behind the scenes, Mike sought systematic \napproaches to informing the public about U.S. intelligence activities \nto the maximum extent possible consistent with national security.\n  Mr. Davidson was also essential in the committee's efforts to honor \nthe sacrifices made by the men and women of the intelligence community, \nand their families, and to ensure that all intelligence agency \nemployees received fair treatment and appropriate recognition by the \nNation they served. All Senators understand the importance of taking \ncare of their constituents. The Intelligence Committee attempts, where \npossible, to take care of intelligence professionals who often have no \nother place to turn. Not surprisingly to those who know him, Mike took \nspecial care with this responsibility. I recall one example--involving \na legal dispute over a family member of an intelligence officer--where \nMike's intervention led to justice being done, a family being \npreserved, and an intelligence professional being able subsequently to \nfocus his attention on an absolutely essential operation.\n  As I mentioned, Mike retired from the Senate very quietly, working \naway on committee business to the last minute of his last day on the \njob. We know, however, that he is relishing the chance to spend more \ntime in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado where he and his wife Karen \nhave a second home near Denver, the home of son Jesse, daughter-in-law \nEllen, and grandchildren Jordan and Garrett, and where his daughter \nKate often visits. We fully expect, however, that with Mike's great \nenergy and legal abilities he will continue to make a contribution to \nhis country from his home here in the District of Columbia as well.\n  With gratitude for his service to the Senate and the Nation, for \nmyself and the many others who have benefited from that service, I wish \nMike the very best in all his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/22/senate-section/article/S5896-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5896-S5898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             CONGRESSIONAL COALITION ON ADOPTION INSTITUTE\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, today I rise to commemorate the 10th \nanniversary of a very special organization that is near and dear to my \nheart, the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute, or CCAI as it \nis more commonly known. This institute was formally established in \n2001, but sprang\n\n[[Page S5897]]\n\nfrom the bicameral, bipartisan congressional caucus known as the \nCongressional Coalition on Adoption that began in 1985. CCAI is a \nnonprofit organization that works to raise awareness about the needs of \nchildren without families and to remove policy barriers that hinder \nchildren from experiencing the love and support a family provides.\n  In 1998, the congressional leaders of the Congressional Coalition on \nAdoption Caucus decided it was time that the coalition organize more \nformally and hire staff to carry out this important work. It was at \nthis point that we hired our first staff member, Kerry Hasenbalg, who \nwas later to become the first executive director of CCAI.\n  Kerry came to the coalition with extensive knowledge of orphan care \nand adoption policy having worked in the field for many years. Kerry \nworked both internationally and domestically on orphan care and \nadoption issues, and was often sent to Washington, DC, as a liaison to \nmeet with other professionals, leaders and both U.S. and international \ngovernment officials on international adoption issues. She also \ntraveled extensively abroad to meet with foreign officials and in-\ncountry workers, and most importantly she spent time in many orphanages \ngetting to know the children themselves. But even more than her \nprofessional experience, Kerry came to the Coalition with a heart and \npassion for changing the lives of orphans and foster youth, one child \nat a time.\n  The Congressional Coalition leaders designated members of their \npersonal staffs to work with Kerry to develop and advance the goals and \nvision of the coalition. These appointed congressional staff consisted \nof: Kathleen Strottman from my staff, Brooke Roberts from Senator Larry \nCraig's office, Bill Dolbow from Congressman Tom Bliley's office and \nChip Gardiner from Congressman Jim Oberstar's office. Through the \ndedicated leadership of the Coalition's Congressional leadership, and \nthe hard work of Kerry and the designated congressional staff, it soon \nbecame evident that the coalition could be more effective and have a \ngreater impact if an institute was created to enhance and expand the \nwork of the adoption caucus. After much research and investigation, it \nwas determined that the nonprofit Congressional Coalition on Adoption \nInstitute should be formed.\n  In May 2001, the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute was \nborn and Kerry Hasenbalg was designated as the first executive director \nwhere she served for 3\\1/2\\ years. Under her leadership, many of the \nflagship programs still in existence today were developed and \nimplemented. In addition to the congressional leadership, CCAI's \nfounding Board members included: Maxine B. Baker, President and CEO of \nthe Freddie Mac Foundation and Barbara W. Walzer, a philanthropist and \nlongtime, dear friend of Kerry's.\n  Although Kerry left her position as executive director when she and \nher husband Scott had the first of their three beautiful children, \nCole, Maya and Leah, Kerry continues to advocate for children in need \nof loving homes as a sought after keynote speaker, writer and \nconsultant on orphan care and adoption topics. She is also an advisory \nboard member for CCAI.\n  CCAI's initial and continued mandate includes service to the \ncongressional members of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Caucus \nthrough the following programs:\n  The Congressional Resource Program: CCAI presents and informs \ncongressional offices regarding current domestic and international \norphan care and adoption issues by hosting briefings, meetings and \nother events to best support congressional members as they serve their \nconstituents.\n  Congressional delegations: CCAI plans and arranges travel to \nstrategic countries to further discussions on adoption, orphan care and \nvulnerable children. The first of many delegation trips organized and \nhosted by CCAI began with a trip to China where the congressional \ndelegation met with President Jiang Zemin for nearly 2 hours. At the \ntime, more Americans were adopting from China than any other country. \nThis meeting was critical to further establish ties between our \ncountries regarding adoption and orphan care. Additional trips during \nthe early years of CCAI included congressional delegations to: Romania, \nRussia, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Uganda, and India. More \nrecent delegations have visited Haiti, Guatemala and Ethiopia and have \nbegun to include domestic delegations on child welfare as well.\n  Foster Youth Internship Program: This unique and very valuable \nprogram provides internship positions in both Houses of Congress to \ncollege students who have emancipated or spent time in the U.S. foster \ncare system. This program gives a voice to the near half a million \nchildren in the U.S. foster care system and gives Congress a first-hand \nperspective on what it means to grow up in the system. In the past \nseveral years these foster youth interns have researched and compiled \nrecommendations for Congress on policy and legislative changes that \ncould be made that would improve the foster care system. Some of their \nrecommendations have already been made into law.\n  National Adoption Day: CCAI is part of a collective national effort \nto raise awareness of the over 107,000 children in foster care waiting \nto find permanent homes and loving families through adoption. National \nAdoption Day has made the dreams of thousands of children come true by \nworking with courts, judges, attorneys, adoption professionals, child \nwelfare agencies and advocates to finalize thousands of adoptions for \nchildren out of foster care.\n  Angels in AdoptionTM: This very special annual event gives \ncongressional members an opportunity to highlight the unsung heroes in \ntheir states or districts who tirelessly serve and advocate for \nchildren in the U.S. and around the world in need of permanent and \nloving homes. Without these advocates, many more children would be \nalone without families to love and support them. In the years since the \nAngels in Adoption awards program has been in place, more than 1800 \nindividuals, couples and organizations from around the nation have been \nhonored by their Members of Congress.\n  Now, 10 years later, the same mission and vision of the founders of \nCCAI remains, due in large part to the leadership of its current \nexecutive director, my former legislative director and my dear friend, \nKathleen Strottman. At the helm, Kathleen not only maintains the \noriginal mission, integrity and continuity of CCAI, but continues to \npour her heart and soul into furthering the cause of the orphan. \nKathleen has been there from the founding of CCAI as one of the \noriginal congressional staff and worked side by side with Kerry as the \nvision and mission of CCAI grew and developed into what it is today.\n  Kathleen comes to her position as executive director with not only \nthe historical experience of CCAI but with Capitol Hill experience as \nwell. Kathleen served for nearly 8 years as my trusted adviser and in \nthat role she worked to pass legislation such as the No Child Left \nBehind Act, the Medicare Modernization Act, the Inter-Country Adoption \nAct, the Child Citizenship Act of 2000, the Adoption Tax Credit and the \nFamily Court Act. Kathleen has worked to increase the opportunity for \npositive dialogue andthe exchange of best practices between the United \nStates and countries such as Ethiopia, China, Romania, Russia, \nGuatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and India. Prior to joining my staff, \nKathleen attended Whittier Law School's Center for Children's Rights \nwhere she graduated with honors and received a State certified \nspecialty in juvenile advocacy. She and her very supportive husband, \nMatt, are the proud parents of three children, Grace, Noah and Liam.\n  I am proud to stand here today and honor CCAI on its 10th anniversary \nalong with Kerry Hasenbalg and Kathleen Strottman without whom this \ninstitute would not be where it is today and whose personal dedication \nand sacrifice have changed the lives of children around the world. CCAI \nhas not only stayed true to its original founding principles and \nmission, but under the dedicated leadership of its congressional \nmembers, board and executive directors, CCAI has grown and expanded to \nfurther enhance the important work of making a difference in the lives \nof children both here in the United States and around the world. May \nGod continue to bless the work of CCAI.\n\n[[Page S5898]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/22/senate-section/article/S5898-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 F_____\n                                 \n\n                   TRIBUTE TO SHIRLEY NATHAN-PULLIAM\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, today I wish to recognize and pay \ntribute to a dear friend, fellow Marylander and 16-year member of the \nMaryland House of Delegates, Shirley Nathan-Pulliam. Shirley has been a \ntireless advocate for eliminating health disparities throughout her \ncareer as a public servant. The Maryland Department of Health & Mental \nHygiene is appropriately honoring her on October 4 by announcing the \nestablishment of the ``Shirley Nathan-Pulliam Health Equity Lecture \nSeries'' at this year's annual Maryland Health Disparity Conference.\n  Shirley has strong convictions and has often stated: ``In a country \nas rich and powerful as the United States of America, no person should \nbe without a basic plan of health care.'' As a registered nurse and \nformer faculty associate at the Johns Hopkins University School of \nNursing, Shirley has seen firsthand how minorities are \ndisproportionately harmed by certain diseases and the inequality in \ncare across racial and ethnic lines. Her belief that health care is a \nbasic human right, and not a privilege, has compelled her to serve in \npublic office--a decision that has benefited all Marylanders and has \nhelped improve health equality in our State.\n  Shirley has had many successes as a legislator, but one of the most \nimportant has been her work in establishing the Maryland Office of \nMinority Health and Health Disparities in 2004. This office is charged \nwith promoting health equity for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, \nAsian Americans, Native Americans, and other groups experiencing health \ndisparities. Another key legislative accomplishment of Shirley's was \nher success in providing health care coverage to more than 100,000 \nchildren in Maryland.\n  Shirley is not a woman who idly witnesses society's inequities. Her \ncompassion and empathy drive her to come up with solutions for the \nproblems she sees. As a sponsor or cosponsor of hundreds of bills that \nhave been signed into law, Shirley has been instrumental in improving \nthe lives of Marylanders in countless ways. When Shirley discovered \nMaryland had the third highest oral cancer rate for African-American \nmen in the Nation, she secured $500,000 to fight the disease. She also \nwas lead sponsor of legislation providing $2.6 million annually for \nbreast cancer treatment for low-income women living in Maryland.\n  Shirley has been an indispensable partner and an inspiration in my \nefforts to address health disparities at the federal level. We worked \ntogether to codify the National Institute for Minority Health and \nHealth Disparities, correcting a long-standing bias in our health care \nsystem that was ill-equipped to deal with disparities among different \npopulations.\n  I wish the University of Maryland's Center for Health Equity and the \nState Office of Minority Health great success in their stewardship of \nthe ``Shirley Nathan-Pulliam Health Equity Lecture Series.'' There is \nstill a great deal of work to be done in achieving Shirley's dream of \nerasing health disparities and making health care a right for every \nhuman being. But with her leadership and legacy to follow, I am \nconfident her dream will one day become a reality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/22/senate-section/article/S5898-2", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ST. PETER'S CENTENNIAL\n\n Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, on October 16, 1911, the first \nItalian Catholic congregation in the city of Portland, ME, met under \nthe guidance of Father Agnello Santagnello. Seventy-five families came \ntogether, and plans were laid to build a church for the small but \ngrowing community of new Americans.\n  Before year's end, just in time for Christmas mass, an old stable was \ntransformed into a chapel at a cost of just under $2,800 and much hard \nwork. That modest chapel was named St. Peter's--the rock of the Church \non the rocky coast of Maine.\n  By the mid-1920s, the parish numbered nearly 1,000 families and the \nthriving Italian-American community needed a larger spiritual home. \nFather Teresio DiMingo, who took the reins of the congregation in 1927, \nwent house-to-house throughout Portland's Little Italy neighborhood \nsoliciting funds, and found generosity at every door.\n  The new church was under construction in 1929 when disaster struck--\nthe stock market crash and the ensuing Great Depression. Father DiMingo \nreturned the contributions to those in need. He matched that act of \ncompassion with determination, and continued the construction with his \nown life savings.\n  The Church of St. Peter was dedicated that August. That great \ncelebration included the blessing of Father DiMingo's second great gift \nto his parish--a cross made from fragments of the True Cross.\n  Since that day, worshipers have noticed a curious inscription above \nthe doorway--the letters ``L & L.'' That was yet another gift from \nFather DiMingo. Those letters represent the Latin words for ``him'' and \n``her.'' St. Peter's was then, and is today, a church for families.\n  Today, in this centennial year, the families of St. Peter's continue \nto build on that solid foundation. Their vibrant church remains a rock \nof faith.\n  And it grows as a center of charity and caring. In the early 1950s, \nan Italian priest came to America seeking aid for children orphaned \nduring the Second World War. The generous response from Portland led to \nthe founding of the Italian Heritage Center, which continues to enrich \nthe city with a culture of great food, music, and festivals.\n  That a small fellowship of faith was born in a stable and grew into a \nsomething mighty and lasting is more than powerful symbolism. It is a \ntestament to the spirit, the resolve, and the energy of Portland's \nItalian-American community. On the 100th anniversary of St. Peter's \nRoman Catholic Church, I offer the members of that parish the \ntraditional Italian wish for a long life of health and happiness--\n``Cent'anni!''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/22/senate-section/article/S5898-3", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5898-S5899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MICHIGAN VOLUNTARISM\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, our Nation's veterans made \nenormous sacrifices in defense of our Nation through their military \nservice. One of the many ways we recognize their service is through \nessential government programs that form the foundation of our Nation's \npromise to care for veterans. These programs are made stronger by the \nvaluable contributions of volunteers. Volunteers who freely offer their \ntime to improve the quality of life of American veterans provide a \npersonal reminder that a grateful nation will always remember and value \ntheir sacrifice. This spirit of generosity and compassion is embodied \nat the Grand Rapids Home for Veterans in west Michigan. A banquet to \nhonor the positive impact these volunteers have had over the past year \nwill take place on September 27, 2011.\n  In operation since 1886, the Grand Rapids Home for Veterans is a 758-\nbed home for veterans in need of long-term care. Residents are cared \nfor by a professional staff of doctors, nurses and social workers, all \nof whom tirelessly work to fulfill the home's mission of providing \nquality interdisciplinary care and helping residents ``achieve their \nhighest potential of independence, self worth, wellness and dignity.'' \nSupporting the professional staff in these efforts is a capable and \ncompassionate army of volunteers. In 2010 alone, almost 900 different \nvolunteers served at the home, with approximately 200 volunteers \nputting in at least 100 hours of service. Some volunteers are veterans \nthemselves; some are family members of current or past residents; \nothers have no personal connection to the home other than the desire to \nhelp American heroes.\n  Volunteers provide a host of services for the veterans and hold \nevents that improve the residents' quality of life. Perhaps the most \nessential service volunteers provide is something that most people take \nfor granted: visiting with veterans individually, offering human \ncompanionship. For veterans in homes, especially the elderly or \ndisabled, having someone read or play cards with them, or simply have a \nconversation with them can provide great comfort. In addition to \nproviding a simple yet powerful human connection, volunteers ensure \nthat veterans at the home live active lives by helping to run the \nhome's woodshop, bowling alley and library, as well as escorting \nresidents to painting and ceramics classes. Residents also enjoy the \nanimal therapy\n\n[[Page S5899]]\n\nprogram where volunteers bring in their own pet dogs and cats.\n  Last year, volunteers organized a number of special events, including \na Super Bowl Party, a Las Vegas Day, three fishing tournaments, a \ncarnival, a fall harvest festival, and a Christmas celebration called \nthe Veterans Star Christmas Project. As part of the project, volunteers \ndistributed more than 700 donated gifts to residents on Christmas Day. \nAccording to one resident, the celebration was especially meaningful \nbecause ``this kind of brightens our year, to know that there are \npeople thinking about you, that care about you.'' Surely, that kind of \nreaction is all the reward volunteers want for their efforts. Every \nday, these generous and dedicated men and women show the residents of \nthe Grand Rapids Home for Veterans that the American people have not \nforgotten them or their service to our Nation.\n  It is in this spirit of generosity that I know my colleagues will \njoin me in recognizing and thanking all those who volunteered at the \nGrand Rapids Home for Veterans. The positive impact they have had on \nthe lives of Michigan veterans is tremendous, and I extend my deepest \nappreciation for their service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/22/senate-section/article/S5899-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO ARTHUR W. DIVENS, JR.\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, today I recognize an \noutstanding public servant and longstanding resident of the great State \nof Maryland, Arthur W. Divens, Jr., as he completes more than 31 years \nof continuous service within the civilian leadership of the Department \nof Defense. Mr. Divens began his public service life in naval \nshipbuilding as a project engineer/contracting representative for the \nMilitary Sealift Command and is ending it as executive director for the \nAmphibious Warfare and Sealift Office, Program Executive Office, Ships, \nwhere he oversees one of the broadest acquisition portfolios in the \nNavy--including more than $30 billion in complex shipbuilding \nprocurements. Highly respected throughout the DOD acquisition community \nas a visionary leader and a man of uncommon character, he has left a \nlong and lasting legacy to our Nation--both through his unparalleled \ncontributions to the strength and flexibility of our Navy's surface \nforces and through the generation of professionals that he has mentored \nthroughout his time in Federal service. Today, it is my great pleasure \nto recognize his achievements and to thank him and his family for their \nservice to the Navy and our Nation.\n  Mr. Divens has a long and distinguished career of innovative thinking \nand aggressive execution of shipbuilding programs across the entire \nspectrum of naval shipbuilding. He has been directly involved in the \ndesign, construction, or delivery of over 150 ships and over 1,000 \nsmall boats and craft, more than any other individual in the Department \nof the Navy. Since joining Federal service in 1980 and the Senior \nExecutive Service in 2000, he has held a variety of key leadership \nroles throughout his professional life, including positions with the \nSpace and Naval Warfare Systems Command, the Military Sealift Command, \nand the Naval Sea Systems Command. He has also provided strong \nleadership to groups such as the National Shipbuilding Research Program \nand the Marine Engineering and Shipyard Management Program, where he \nhas worked tirelessly with his peers throughout government and industry \nto promote the open interchange of ideas and information and constantly \nimprove shipbuilding and ship repair processes and technology.\n  In 2002, Mr. Divens joined the Program Executive Office, Ships, where \nhe has played a critical role in defining and fielding our Navy's \nfuture Surface Fleet. During his tenure and as a result of his sound \nstewardship, 31 ships have been delivered to the U.S. Navy and our \nallies, including two first of class vessels--USS SAN ANTONIO (LPD 17) \nand USNS LEWIS AND CLARK (T-AKE 1)--and the amphibious assault ship USS \nMAKIN ISLAND (LHD 8), widely lauded for its revolutionary application \nof hybrid technology and integration of environmental efficiencies and \nfuel conservation initiatives in the earliest stages of ship design. In \nthe past year, he has worked tirelessly with General Dynamics NASSCO to \ncontract for three affordable and flexible mobile landing platforms, \nsaving the Navy nearly $2.1 billion and preserving the shipbuilding \ncapability of the Navy's only west coast shipyard. He has been an \ninfluential advisor to the LHA 8 analysis of alternatives which will \nresult in a well deck ship configuration for the next Marine Corps \nlarge deck amphibious ship, and has worked to maximize competition in \nthe Ship to Shore Connector Program, which will provide an \nunprecedented level of support to amphibious forces. He has been the \ncentral figure in some of the Navy's toughest negotiations involving \nnearly $10 billion in Navy shipbuilding funding, to include the award \nof LPD 22-26 and the LHA 6 amphibious assault ship, the joint high \nspeed vessel competition, and the Landing Craft Air Cushion Service \nLife Extension Program. At the heart of his efforts has been a \nrelentless drive to improve the strength, capability, and flexibility \nof our operating forces at the best possible value to the American \npublic.\n  Mr. Divens is also responsible for more than 100 foreign military \nsales cases, with more than 30 nations and a collective value of nearly \n$2 billion. Of special note has been his direct effort with United \nStates Forces--Iraq, helping Iraqi security forces develop the tools \nthey need to defeat terrorism and sustain an environment where they can \nlive free.\n  Mr. Divens' contributions to our Nation extend far beyond his \nmaterial achievements and programmatic accomplishments. He has served \nas an inspiration to all who have served with him, ensuring that all \nmembers of his team are keenly aware of their importance to the Navy \nand the true appreciation that he holds for their efforts. His unique \nability to recognize talent and to foster respect and camaraderie \nthroughout the workforce has had an enormous influence on junior \nSailors and civilians and will continue to steer the course of our Navy \nwell into the future.\n  Mr. Divens received his bachelor of science degree from the U.S. \nMerchant Marine Academy in Kings Point, NY in 1979 and his master of \nscience degree from the University of Maryland in 1997. Throughout his \ndistinguished Federal service career, he has been honored with numerous \nawards for his exceptional service, including the Navy Distinguished \nCivilian Service Medal, the Meritorious Presidential Rank Award and, \nmost recently, the Rear Admiral Wayne E. Meyer Memorial Award.\n  Mr. Divens' tireless leadership and lifelong commitment to the Navy's \nshipbuilding capability have earned him the deep respect of his peers \nand shipmates throughout the Navy acquisition and fleet support \ncommunities. It is, therefore, a pleasure to recognize him for his many \ncontributions in a life devoted to our nation's security. I know my \ncolleagues join me in wishing him, his wife Joan, his daughters Alison, \nLaura and Molly, and his grandson Daniel much happiness and fair winds \nand following seas as they begin a new chapter in their lives \ntogether.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/22/senate-section/article/S5899-2", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5899-S5900]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING BLACKSMITHS WINERY\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, my home State of Maine's long \ntradition of entrepreneurship includes a marked dedication to creative \nand quality craftsmanship. Small businesses in Maine strive to be both \nimaginative in design and superior in value. One such small business is \nBlacksmiths Winery of South Casco, one of Maine's largest wineries and \nthe first in the State to be awarded both the silver and bronze medals \nin international wine competitions. Today I commend Blacksmiths Winery \non their continued success and commitment to excellence.\n  In the late 1800s, William Watkins lived and worked as an apprentice \nand blacksmith in South Casco. He was known to be an exacting \ncraftsman, insisting upon making his own nails to ensure quality, \nrather than using the machine made variety. After William stopped \nworking the blacksmith's forge, his son Albert shouldered the \nresponsibility of the family business.\n\n[[Page S5900]]\n\nOver 100 years later, Blacksmiths Winery opened in the same location, \nwhich remains full of entrepreneurial vigor. The original buildings, \nincluding Watkins' home, barn, and shop make up the main structures of \nBlacksmiths Winery. As it takes its name from the profession of the \nearlier tenants, so Blacksmiths Winery certainly carries on the same \nenthusiasm for craftsmanship.\n  Blacksmiths Winery opened its doors in 1999, producing 1,000 cases of \nwine in the first year, and has since continually grown and expanded \ntheir award-winning product. Blacksmiths Winery now offers its \ncustomers a wide variety of over 20 different wines and sodas. They \nproduce the more traditional red and white wines, such as Cabernet \nSauvignon, but are widely popular for their fruitier and more \nadventurous flavors, including raspberry and rhubarb wines. Many of \nBlacksmiths' products are based on the flavors of locally grown Maine \nblueberries, elderberries, cranberries, and apples. Blacksmiths also \nmakes nonalcoholic soda from wine grapes, including Merlot and Riesling \nflavors, and is continually seeking to expand its offerings. Visitors \ncan taste these wines and sodas any day of the week, and on weekends, \nBlacksmiths opens its beautiful porch to guests where they can relax \nand enjoy a variety of beverages.\n  Highlighting Blacksmiths ingenuity, one of the company's popular \nfruit wines came about completely by chance. Through a packaging flaw, \nBlacksmiths acquired a large bunch of raspberries. Rather than waste \nthe fruit, the company produced sample batches of what has become its \nraspberry dessert wine. This happy accident was then sent to the \nshelves at retail locations across Maine, to the delight of thirsty \nwine drinkers.

A bill to enable transportation fuel competition, consumer \nchoice, and greater use of domestic energy sources in order to reduce \nour Nation's dependence on foreign oil; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n\n[[Page S5905]]\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \naimed at breaking oil's monopoly over our Nation's transportation \nsystem. I would like to thank Senator Lugar for helping develop and \nagreeing to cosponsor this important bill.\n  The Open Fuels Standard Act of 2011 would introduce competition among \nfuels in the U.S. transportation market by ensuring that most new \nvehicles in the United States will be capable of running on a range of \ndomestically produced alternative fuels.\n  By introducing competition among fuels, the Open Fuels Standard, OFS, \nAct aims to bring bout significant reductions in the high prices paid \nby U.S. consumers at the gas pump and in our Nation's dangerous \noverdependence on foreign oil. According to the Department of Energy, \nthis lack of competition imposes a ``monopoly premium'' of more than \n$200 billion on the economy each year--a direct transfer of U.S. wealth \nto the treasuries of OPEC countries and other foreign oil producers. \nKeeping this money within U.S. borders would sharply cut the U.S. trade \ndeficit, safeguard U.S. household income, and provide capital and \nmarket incentive for investment in new U.S. energy infrastructure.\n  The Open Fuels Standard Act requires that starting in 2015, 50 \npercent of new vehicles manufactured or sold in the United States be \nflex fuel capable--that is, able to run on non-petroleum fuels. These \nfuels would include domestically-produced ethanol or methanol or other \nalcohols in addition to--or instead of--petroleum-based fuels. In 2018, \n80 percent of new vehicles would need to be flex-fuel capable. Adoption \nof an Open Fuels Standard would spur the development and use of alcohol \nfuels such as ethanol and methanol that can be made from a wide variety \nof domestic energy resources including agricultural waste, energy \ncrops, natural gas, and even trash. By increasing the share of these \nabundant domestic fuels in the U.S. market, the Open Fuels Standard Act \nhas the potential to eliminate major drag on the American economy, \ncreating new jobs, strengthening our national security, and addressing \nchallenging environmental concerns such as air quality and climate \nchange.\n  Today's introduction of the Open Fuels Standard Act coincides with \nyesterday's launch of the United States Energy Security Council. The \nnew Council's purpose is to focus on reducing U.S. energy vulnerability \nand enhancing national security by finding alternatives to foreign oil. \nThis new group's members include former Secretary of State George \nShultz, former Secretaries of Defense William Perry and Harold Brown, \nas well as three former national security advisers, a former C.I.A. \ndirector, two former senators, a Nobel laureate, a former Federal \nReserve chairman, and several Fortune-50 chief executives.\n  The U.S. Energy Security Council is calling for Congress to enact a \nrequirement such as the Open Fuels Standard to end oil's monopoly as \nthe lynchpin of U.S. energy security, according to a New York Times op-\ned on September 21 by council members former National Security Advisor \nRobert C. McFarlane and former Director of Central Intelligence R. \nJames Woolsey.\n  The Open Fuels Standard Act will also complement and advance other \nkey legislation that Congress has passed in recent years with the goals \nof transforming the U.S. energy system to make it more secure, more \naffordable, and more environmentally sustainable. For example, the 2007 \nEnergy Independence and Security Act included the Renewable Fuels \nStandard, requiring the production of 36 billion gallons of biofuels by \n2022, and raising CAFE standards, corporate average fuel economy, for \nthe first time in 20 years for SUVs and trucks. The Open Fuels Standard \nAct, in conjunction with policies such as these that we fought hard for \nin previous Congresses, will play a major role in achieving our long-\nterm national energy goals.\n  Oil has had a monopoly over transportation fuel for too long and \nAmerican drivers have had no choice but to pay volatile and elevated \nprices at the pump. I am encouraged by the broad bipartisan and \nstakeholder support for the Open Fuels Standard Act, and again would \nlike to thank Senator Lugar, which I believe is a recognition that this \napproach will really help diversify our Nation's energy supply and spur \ninvestment and job creation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. PORTMAN (for himself, Mr. Pryor, and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 1606. A bill to reform the process by which Federal agencies \nanalyze and formulate new regulations and guidance documents; to the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I have heard from many Arkansans and \nbusinesses, particularly small businesses, which are struggling to meet \nan increasing regulatory burden. Each year, Federal agencies issue more \nthan 3,000 final rules, many of which have significant economic impact. \nIn Executive Order 13563, President Obama emphasized that our \nregulatory system should promote ``economic growth, innovation, \ncompetitiveness, and job creation.'' I agree. We need a 21st-century \nregulatory system that promotes future prosperity. However, there are \nsome rules where that goal appears to have been ignored and as a result \nour economy suffers.\n  Experience suggests that improvements in the regulatory process are \nnecessary to ensure that all agencies pay close attention to the impact \ntheir regulatory actions have on jobs and on the economy.\n  For example, the EPA is currently considering more stringent \nregulations of dust as part of the national ambient air quality. From \ncounty roads to farm fields, dust is an unavoidable reality in rural \nareas. Imposing strict dust regulations on these communities would hurt \nfamily farmers and rural economies across Arkansas and our Nation.\n  Another example comes from a county judge in Arkansas. He was rightly \nconcerned about a regulation stemming from the Bush administration that \nwould have cost municipalities and counties and States across the \ncountry tens of millions of dollars to replace their street signs. The \nburden of paying for hundreds of thousands of new signs at costs \nranging anywhere from $30 to $110 would have fallen to State and local \ngovernments, and that means State and local taxpayers. Fortunately, as \npart of the administration's review of regulations, Transportation \nSecretary Ray LaHood has decided that a specific deadline for replacing \nstreet signs makes no sense and that local and State transportation \nagencies are best equipped to determine when they need to replace these \nsigns in the course of their daily work.\n  In his Executive order, President Obama remarked that the regulatory \nsystem ``must identify and use the best, most innovative, and least \nburdensome tools for achieving regulatory ends.'' Last month, Cass \nSunstein, the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory \nAffairs, wrote in the Wall Street Journal that Cabinet Secretaries were \ninstructed to minimize regulatory costs, avoid imposing excessive \nregulatory burdens, and prioritize regulatory actions that promote \neconomic growth and job creation. I applaud the administration's new \ndirective.\n  One difference in what the administration is doing versus what we are \ndoing in the Portman-Pryor legislation is that the President is looking \nretrospectively. He is doing a review of regulations that are on the \nbooks now, which is good. I welcome that. But the Portman-Pryor \nlegislation will be prospective; it will go forward. We will talk about \nthat more as we go.\n  I think it is time that Congress reviewed several of the laws that \nform the basis of our Federal regulatory system. We need to find ways \nto make these laws more fair, reasonable, and effective in meeting the \ndual challenges of protecting the public while making our economy \nstronger and more competitive. That is why I have teamed up with \nSenator Portman on this important legislation.\n  Done right, I believe regulatory reform can lead to better, cheaper, \nand faster rulemaking. Specifically, agencies should, one, propose or \nadopt regulations only when the benefits justify the costs; two, write \nregulations so that they impose the least burden on society; and three, \nin choosing among alternative regulatory approaches, select those that \nstrike the right balance between minimizing costs and maximizing \nbenefits.\n  Portman-Pryor amends the Administrative Procedures Act to place \ngreater\n\n[[Page S5906]]\n\nemphasis on early engagement between agencies and parties subject to \nhigh-impact rules costing $1 billion or more per year and major rules \ncosting $100 million or more. These expensive rules are where our focus \nshould be. In fact, as a historical footnote, the Administrative \nProcedures Act was written in 1946 and has not really been revised and \nupdated since that time. So now that it is 65 years old, I think it is \ntime to look at it and update it.\n  Portman-Pryor makes better use of two existing regulatory tools. It \nrequires an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking for high-impact and \nmajor rules to enable agencies to solicit written data, views, or \narguments from interested parties. Second, although the Administrative \nProcedures Act already allows for formal hearings, agencies rarely use \nthis option. Portman-Pryor requires an agency to conduct a formal \nrulemaking hearing for high-impact rules and, in some cases, major \nrules so that data and information can be debated on the record--here \nagain, on the record. We are trying to make this process more \ntransparent.\n  Portman-Pryor strikes a balance between minimizing costs and \nmaximizing benefits. The bill makes clear that the agencies are \nencouraged to choose the least costly alternative that would achieve \nthe objectives of the statute authorizing the rule. However, the bill \nalso makes clear that the agency may choose--may choose--a more costly \nrule so long as it does two things: one, explains why it has done so \nbased on policy concerns addressed by the statute authorizing the rule \nand, two, shows that the added benefits are greater than the added \ncosts, which is by definition a push toward ``maximizing benefits.''\n  Today, the length of rulemaking varies widely from a few months to \nseveral years. After this reform, times will still vary in about that \nsame amount, but the final rules should be more stable and more \ncredible. A principal goal of Portman-Pryor is that the bill may \nshorten the rulemaking process because the final rule will be based on \nmore sound, thorough information and that fewer high-impact and major \nrules will be vacated by courts and sent back to the agency.\n  Finally, the bill reinforces that agencies must assess both the costs \nand benefits of their rules. However, the bill requires the \nAdministrator of OIRA to establish guidelines so that costs-benefit \nanalysis can be commensurate with the economic impact of the rule.\n  Regulatory reform is not an exciting subject, I know, but it is \nvitally important to our Nation's economic recovery. I look forward to \nworking with Senator Portman on this important legislation. I also look \nforward to working with other colleagues to try to get them interested \nand possibly cosponsoring and helping us get this bill through the \nprocess.\n  My final point is that this is a piece of legislation which not only \nis bipartisan but is bicameral. We have two Members of the U.S. House \nof Representatives who have announced this legislation with us today: \nLamar Smith, who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and Collin \nPeterson, who is the ranking member on the Agriculture Committee in the \nHouse. So it is rare when we get bipartisan, bicameral legislation \ncoming in this Congress.\n  I hope--I sincerely hope--I will have colleagues on both sides of the \naisle who will look at this legislation. I hope we will get broad \nbipartisan support and we will be able to move it through the \ncommittees and get it to the floor in a timely fashion.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 1609. A bill to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nto establish a demonstration program to award grants to, and enter into \ncontracts with, medical-legal partnerships to assist patients and their \nfamilies to navigate health-related programs and activities; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I join Senators Leahy and Inouye to \nintroduce the Medical-Legal Partnership for Health Act. This \nlegislation will reduce our Nation's health care costs and improve the \nhealth of vulnerable patients by building upon the great work that \nmedical-legal partnerships are doing every day, all across the United \nStates.\n  Medical-legal partnerships bring legal aid services into medical \nsettings, such as hospitals and community health centers, to help \npatients overcome problems that create and perpetuate poor health. In \ntoday's difficult economy, many Americans are struggling to meet the \nbasic health needs of themselves and their children. This may mean \nstruggling to pay the high costs of medical care or prescription drugs, \nor putting off an annual check-up until next year.\n  But some health care needs are non-medical in nature, like making \nsure your home is properly heated in the winter; that it is not \ninfested by insects or rodents; and that it is free of domestic \nviolence. These needs may require more than just medical care; they may \nrequire legal assistance.\n  Unfortunately, most health care providers are not equipped to deal \nwith the non-medical issues that lead some patients to seek medical \ncare repeatedly or on an ongoing basis. Despite the perception that \nlegal issues frequently affect their patients, a survey of physicians \nat Boston Medical Center revealed that fewer than 20 percent of doctors \nknew how to refer patients to legal resources. As a result, many \npatients never address the root cause of their health problems, leading \nto costly visits to the emergency room and lengthy hospital stays.\n  Medical-legal partnerships connect patients with the legal assistance \nthey need to address these root causes. Rather than just applying a \ntemporary fix to a health issue, they help patients get healthy and \nstay healthy.\n  In the process, medical-legal partnerships generate substantial cost \nsavings for families and the entire health care system. One study found \na 50 percent reduction in emergency room visits following the \nintervention of medical-legal partnerships, saving families hundreds of \ndollars per visit. Another study showed that medical-legal partnerships \nreduced the cost per pediatric asthma patient from $735 to $181 through \nfewer emergency room visits, while also resulting in decreased \nfrequency and duration of asthma attacks following an intervention. \nThese cost savings not only help keep families out of potentially \ncrippling debt, but they also help reduce emergency room overcrowding \nand decrease health care expenditures on preventable health conditions.\n  Unfortunately, many patients are unlikely to seek legal services on \ntheir own. Eighty-five percent of patients who sought legal assistance \nfrom one medical-legal partnership in California had not used legal \nresources before and more than 78 percent were not previously aware of \nlegal services at all. By embedding legal services in health care \nsettings, medical-legal partnerships raise awareness of legal services \nso that patients are more likely to address problems before they turn \ninto crises.\n  In an article about medical-legal partnerships last year, the Los \nAngeles Times told the story of Maria Perez. Maria had a fever of 103, \nher body ached and she had trouble breathing. After being told in the \nemergency room that she had pneumonia, she went to a clinic in South \nLos Angeles for a follow-up appointment. The doctor asked Perez about \nher housing situation. Her apartment had cockroaches and mice, and rain \nfell through a broken window and filled the walls with mold. The doctor \nwrote prescriptions to treat the pneumonia and an asthma flare-up and \nthen sent her down the hall to talk to a lawyer.\n  After the attorney contacted both the landlord and the Los Angeles \nHousing Department, Maria's living conditions improved, and so did her \nhealth. She told the Times: ``The medicine wasn't what cured me. It was \n[my lawyer] and what he did.''\n  Medical-legal partnerships also offer a critical lifeline to victims \nof domestic violence. In my home state of Iowa, a young woman named \nBrenda sought help to escape an abusive marriage. Her husband was a \ngang member and threatened to kill her or have members of his gang kill \nher. One night, while attempting to flee an attack, Brenda's husband \npulled her back into the house and beat and choked her until she lost \nconsciousness. When Brenda sought medical care the next day, her care \nproviders referred her to Iowa Legal Aid's Health and Law Project for \nhelp.\n\n[[Page S5907]]\n\nIowa Legal Aid helped Brenda obtain a protective order, which included \ncustody of the couple's daughter. Iowa Legal Aid is currently helping \nBrenda with a divorce so that she and her daughter will have protection \nand long-term autonomy from her abuser; thereby reducing the need for \nongoing health care.\n  The success of these programs is catching on. The first medical-legal \npartnership was created nearly two decades ago at Boston Medical \nCenter. By 2009, there were 60 such partnerships across the country. \nToday there are 90 medical-legal partnerships working with more than \n240 health services providers.\n  Medical-legal partnerships have attracted the attention of corporate \nAmerica, too. In July, Walmart became the first corporation to take a \nlead role in a medical-legal partnership, and I commend them for \nrecognizing the valuable role these programs can play in our \ncommunities.\n  After graduating from law school, I served as a Legal Services \nattorney in Iowa. I learned first-hand how crucial this assistance is \nto struggling families and individuals who have no place else to turn \nwhen they are taken advantage of or abused. I know the invaluable legal \nhelp provided to battered women trying to leave abusive relationships \nwhile fearing for their safety and the safety of their children. I know \nthat, without access to the legal system, the poor are often powerless \nagainst the injustices they suffer.\n  I am particularly proud of the success of a medical-legal partnership \nin my home state of Iowa. The Iowa Legal Aid Health and Law Project \nharnesses the talents of Iowa physicians and attorneys to improve the \nlives of vulnerable Iowans. By partnering with 17 hospitals and health \ncenters across my state, the Iowa Legal Aid Health and Law Project is \nable to extend services from Sioux City to Dubuque, and from Council \nBluffs to Fort Dodge. In 2009, the program served 880 Iowans, and 94 \npercent of their cases had a positive outcome. The Iowa Legal Aid \nHealth and Law Project does a remarkable job. They are just one example \nof the great work going on across the country.\n  You may be surprised to learn that when it comes to medical-legal \npartnerships, a little money can go a long way. Iowa's program was \nstarted with a federal investment of less than $300,000. The program \nprevents hospital admissions and emergency room visits that cost \nhospitals and patients many thousands of dollars in health care costs \nand insurance premiums. A modest investment in these community programs \ncan help people achieve healthier, safer lives and prevent future \nhospitalizations and health care costs. That sounds like common sense \nto me. And that's why, today, I am proud to introduce the Medical-Legal \nPartnership for Health Act: to give health care providers and lawyers \nacross the country the opportunity to start such programs.\n  The Act creates a federal demonstration program to help create, \nstrengthen, and evaluate medical-legal partnerships. Overall, this \nlegislation will support 60 partnership sites in community health \ncenters, the Veterans Administration, hospitals, and other health care \nsettings.\n  I was proud to have the support of former Senator Kit Bond of \nMissouri when I introduced this legislation during the previous \nCongress. I know there are many Americans who think that the two \npolitical parties in Washington can't agree on anything these days, but \nthis is an issue that has attracted bipartisan support in the past and \nit is my strong hope that it will do so again. In the spirit of \ncompromise and bipartisanship, I have taken contentious issues off the \ntable: the bill excludes federal money from being used toward class \naction law suits, medical malpractice cases, representation of \nundocumented individuals, and abortion or abortion-counseling services.\n  Medical-legal partnerships also have broad support from prominent \norganizations representing physicians and attorneys. They've received \nthe endorsement of the American Medical Association, the American Bar \nAssociation, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Hospital \nAssociation, and the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical \nEducation, to name just a few.\n  Through this community-based, common-sense investment, we will be \nable to help some of our most vulnerable citizens avoid illness and \nhospitalization, while reducing costs across the entire health care \nsystem.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this investment in \nmedical-legal partnerships.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1609\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Medical-Legal Partnership \n     for Health Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Numerous studies and reports, including the annual \n     National Healthcare Disparities Report and Unequal Treatment, \n     the 2002 Institute of Medicine Report, document the \n     extensiveness to which vulnerable populations suffer from \n     health disparities across the country.\n       (2) These studies have found that, on average, racial and \n     ethnic minorities and low-income populations are \n     disproportionately afflicted with chronic and acute \n     conditions such as asthma, cancer, diabetes, and hypertension \n     and suffer worse health outcomes, worse health status, and \n     higher mortality rates.\n       (3) Several recent studies also show that health and \n     healthcare quality are a function of not only access to \n     healthcare, but also the social determinants of health, \n     including the environment, the physical structure of \n     communities, socio-economic status, nutrition, educational \n     attainment, employment, race, ethnicity, geography, and \n     language preference, that directly and indirectly affect the \n     health, healthcare, and wellness of individuals and \n     communities.\n       (4) Formally integrating medical and legal professionals in \n     the health setting can more effectively address the health \n     needs of vulnerable populations and ultimately reduce health \n     disparities.\n       (5) All over the United States, healthcare providers who \n     take care of low-income individuals and families are \n     partnering with legal professionals to assist them in \n     providing better quality of healthcare.\n       (6) Medical-legal partnerships integrate lawyers in a \n     health setting to help patients navigate the complex \n     government, legal, and service systems in addressing social \n     determinants of health, such as income supports for food \n     insecure families and mold removal from the home of \n     asthmatics.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n       (1) support and advance opportunity for medical-legal \n     partnerships to be more fully integrated in healthcare \n     settings nationwide;\n       (2) to improve the quality of care for vulnerable \n     populations by reducing health disparities among health \n     disparities populations and addressing the social \n     determinants of health; and\n       (3) identify and develop cost-effective strategies that \n     will improve patient outcomes and realize savings for \n     healthcare systems.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to provide the Department of Justice with additional \ntools to target extraterritorial drug trafficking activity; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Targeting \nTransnational Drug Trafficking Act of 2011 with my colleagues and \nfriends, Senator Charles Grassley, Senator Charles Schumer, Senator \nRichard Blumenthal, Senator Tom Udall, Senator Robert Casey and Senator \nRon Wyden.\n  This bill will support the Obama Administration's recently released \nStrategy to Combat Transnational Organized Crime by providing the \nDepartment of Justice with crucial tools to help combat the \ninternational drug trade. As drug traffickers find new and innovative \nways to avoid prosecution, we must keep up with them rather than \nallowing our laws to lag behind.\n  This legislation has three main components. First, it puts in place \npenalties for extraterritorial drug trafficking activity when \nindividuals have reasonable cause to believe that illegal drugs will be \ntrafficked into the United States. Current law says that drug \ntraffickers must know that illegal drugs will be trafficked into the \nUnited States and this legislation would lower the knowledge threshold \nto reasonable cause to believe.\n  The Department of Justice has informed my office that with increasing \nfrequency, it sees drug traffickers from Colombia, Ecuador and Peru who \nproduce cocaine in their countries but leave transit of cocaine to the \nUnited States in the hands of Mexican drug trafficking organizations \nsuch as the Zetas. Under current law, our ability to prosecute source-\nnation traffickers from Colombia, Ecuador and Peru is limited since \nthere is often no direct evidence of their knowledge that illegal drugs \nwere intended for the United States.\n  Second, this bill ensures that current penalties apply to precursor \nchemical producers from other countries. This includes those producing \npseudoephedrine used for methamphetamine who illegally ship precursor \nchemicals into the United States knowing that these chemicals will be \nused to make illegal drugs.\n  Third, this bill will expand conspiracy liability when controlled \nsubstances are destined to the United States from a foreign country. \nThis means that members of any conspiracy to distribute controlled \nsubstances will be subject to U.S. jurisdiction when at least one \nmember of the conspiracy intends or knows that illegal drugs will be \nunlawfully imported into the United States.\n  As Chairman of the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control \nand as a public servant who has focused on law enforcement issues for \nmany years, I know that we cannot sit idly by as drug traffickers find \nnew ways to circumvent our laws. We must provide the Department of \nJustice with all of the tools it needs to prosecute drug kingpins both \nhere at home and abroad.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1612\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Targeting Transnational Drug \n     Trafficking Act of 2011''.\n\n     SEC. 2. POSSESSION, MANUFACTURE OR DISTRIBUTION FOR PURPOSES \n                   OF UNLAWFUL IMPORTATIONS.\n\n       (a) Possession, Manufacture or Distribution for Purposes of \n     Unlawful Importations.--Section 1009 of the Controlled \n     Substances Import and Export Act (21 U.S.C. 959) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating subsections (b) and (c) as subsections \n     (c) and (d), respectively; and\n       (2) in subsection (a), by striking ``It shall'' and all \n     that follows and inserting the following: ``It shall be \n     unlawful for any person to manufacture or distribute a \n     controlled substance in schedule I or II or flunitrazepam \n     intending, knowing, or having reasonable cause to believe \n     that such substance will be unlawfully imported into the \n     United States or into waters within a distance of 12 miles of \n     the coast of the United States.\n       ``(b) It shall be unlawful for any person to manufacture or \n     distribute a listed chemical--\n       ``(1) intending or knowing that the listed chemical will be \n     used to manufacture a controlled substance; and\n       ``(2) intending, knowing, or having reasonable cause to \n     believe that the controlled substance will be unlawfully \n     imported into the United States.''.\n       (b) Attempt and Conspiracy.--Section 1013 of the Controlled \n     Substances Import and Export Act (21 U.S.C. 963) is amended \n     by adding at the end the following: ``For a conspiracy to \n     commit such an offense that requires the person to intend, \n     know, or have reasonable cause to believe that a controlled \n     substance will be unlawfully imported into\n\n[[Page S5909]]\n\n     the United States, it is sufficient to prove a conspiracy to \n     commit the offense that only 1 member of the conspiracy \n     intended, knew, or had reasonable cause to believe that the \n     controlled substance would be unlawfully imported into the \n     United States.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself and Mrs. Hutchison):\n  S. 1613. A bill to improve and enhance research and programs on \nchildhood cancer survivorship, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by Senator \nHutchison in the introduction of the Pediatric, Adolescent, and Young \nAdult Cancer Survivorship Research and Quality of Life Act of 2011.\n  The population of survivors of childhood cancer has grown \nexponentially over the years. In 1960, only 4 percent of children with \ncancer survived more than 5 years. Today, nearly 80 percent of children \nwith cancer survive more than five years. While this is heartening \nnews, as a result of their cancer and treatment, many of these children \nunfortunately have health complications, often life-threatening, for \nyears to come. Indeed, after beating cancer, as many as \\2/3\\ of these \nchildren suffer from late effects of their disease or treatment, \nincluding second cancers and heart and lung damage. There are also \nserious psychosocial impacts that these survivors face.\n  With so many facing the risk of these late effects, it is critical \nthat resources are made available to help these survivors, especially \nthose in underserved communities. Our legislation would enhance \nresearch on the late effects of childhood cancers and improve \ncollaboration among providers so that doctors are better able to care \nfor this population as they age. It would also establish a new pilot \nprogram to begin to explore models of care for childhood cancer \nsurvivors. Creating standard protocols and procedures will help \nproviders, patients, and families know what to expect after beating \ncancer, including when to get certain check-ups and tests that guard \nagainst late effects.\n  This bill is part of a continuing effort to focus greater attention \non childhood cancers. In 2008, I worked on a bipartisan basis to enact, \nthe Caroline Pryce Walker Conquer Childhood Cancer Act. This law has \nincreased support for research on childhood cancers and improved \ntreatment for patients. But we must not stop there.\n  The legislation Senator Hutchison and I are introducing today to \naddress the late effects of childhood cancer, will do more to help \nchildhood cancer patients. I look forward to working with my colleagues \nto pass this legislation and help ensure that children who survive \ncancer live a long and healthy life.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1613\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Pediatric, Adolescent, and \n     Young Adult Cancer Survivorship Research and Quality of Life \n     Act of 2011''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) An estimated 12,400 children and adolescents under age \n     20 are diagnosed with cancer each year.\n       (2) In 1960, only 4 percent of children with cancer \n     survived more than 5 years, but by 2011, cure rates have \n     increased to 78 percent for children and adolescents under \n     age 20.\n       (3) The population of survivors of childhood cancers has \n     grown dramatically, to more than 300,000 individuals of all \n     ages as of 2007.\n       (4) As many as \\2/3\\ of childhood cancer survivors are \n     likely to experience at least one late effect of treatment, \n     with as many as \\1/4\\ experiencing a late effect that is \n     serious or life-threatening. The most common late effects of \n     childhood cancer are neurocognitive, psychological, \n     cardiopulmonary, endocrine, and musculoskeletal effects and \n     secondary malignancies.\n       (5) The late effects of cancer treatment may change as \n     treatments evolve, which means that the monitoring and \n     treatment of cancer survivors may need to be modified on a \n     routine basis.\n       (6) The Institute of Medicine, in its reports on cancer \n     survivorship entitled ``Childhood Cancer Survivorship: \n     Improving Care and Quality of Life'', states that an \n     organized system of care and a method of care for pediatric \n     cancer survivors is needed.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exempt \ncertain stock of real estate investment trusts from the tax on foreign \ninvestments in United States real property interests, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a critical bill for \nour economic recovery. As communities across the country continue to \nrecover from the economic downturn and devastating falling property \nvalues, commercial real estate properties throughout the nation are \nconfronting a severe equity crisis. Just as the crash in the \nresidential real estate market triggered the most severe economic \nrecession in generations, the looming crisis in the commercial real \nestate market, if left unchecked, could prove to be devastating for our \nfragile economic recovery.\n  Studies have shown that more than $1 trillion of commercial real \nestate loans will be maturing in just the next few years. In fact, by \n2018 more than $2.4 trillion dollars of loans held by insurance \ncompanies, thrifts, banks, and in commercial mortgage-backed securities \nwill mature. Just as we saw with home mortgages, if these borrowers \ncan't secure other funding options when these payments come due, \ncommercial properties across the country will go into foreclosure, \nleaving communities with even more vacant storefronts, less jobs, lower \ntax revenues, and a deeper economic hole to dig themselves out of.\n  Simply put, the commercial real estate industry has an equity problem \ntoo large for domestic investment alone to solve.\n  Unfortunately, certain tax rules--most of which were drafted 30 years \nago, before the current crisis could be foreseen--impose significant \npenalties on foreign investments in domestic real estate that do not \nexist on other types of U.S. investments such as corporate stocks and \nbonds. As a result, overseas investors are discouraged from investing \nin U.S. real estate at a time when their capital is sorely needed.\n  These rules, created by the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax \nAct, or FIRPTA as it is come to be known, freeze out foreign investment \nin our real estate markets by imposing an arbitrary withholding tax on \nthe gains realized by overseas capital invested in domestic properties.\n  Not only is this different treatment questionable as a policy, it is \ndamaging to the economy. At no point have these rules been more \ndamaging to the economy than today. They continue to keep capital out \nof the U.S. at a time when commercial real estate in all of our \ncommunities desperately needs the equity investment.\n  If these rules are not reformed, it is a real possibility that \nhundreds of billions of dollars in debt would go into default, \ntriggering massive foreclosures, significant decreases in property \nvalues and a severe constriction of capital available for U.S. \nconsumers and businesses--absolutely the last thing this economy needs \nright now.\n  That is why today, Senator Enzi and I are introducing bipartisan, \nbicameral legislation that would implement efficient and meaningful \nreform of these tax rules to encourage more equity investment in U.S. \nreal estate.\n  These reforms would help save communities all across America from the \ndrag of a wave of commercial real estate foreclosures, help to restart \nthe credit markets, and free up capital to create jobs and economic \nopportunities for families in every region of the country.\n  These provisions are modest but effective.\n  We are not tackling the bigger question of whether or not the \nexisting FIRPTA rules are effective in a 21st century economy. This \nlegislation simply creates targeted opportunities for investment in \nAmerican real estate while preserving the underlying foreign ownership \nlimits imposed by these tax rules.\n  We may not agree on a whole lot these days, but today we offer a \nbipartisan, bicameral solution to help the U.S. economy. I hope all of \nmy colleagues can take the time to look at this bill, understand the \npositive effects it will have for every State, and we can get this done \nfor the American people.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Johanns, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Merkley, \n        and Mr. Franken):\n  S. 1617. A bill to establish the Council on Healthy Housing and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I introduce with my colleague Senator \nJohanns, the Healthy Housing Council Act. I thank Senators Boxer, \nMerkley, and Franken for joining us as original cosponsors of this \nbill.\n  Many factors impact health and wellness. Typically, doctors and other \nhealth professionals are able to counsel patients on the importance of \nexercise and healthy eating, for example, to prevent diseases and \nconditions. Too frequently, however, these providers overlook the \npossibility of housing-related health hazards that patients knowingly \nor unknowingly come into contact with, which can also cause a variety \nof preventable diseases and conditions like cancer, lead poisoning, and \nasthma.\n  While there are many programs in place to address these hazards, \nthese programs are fragmented and spread across many agencies. Our \nlegislation, the Healthy Housing Council Act, would establish an \nindependent interagency Council on Healthy Housing in the executive \nbranch in order to improve the coordination of existing but fragmented \nprograms, bringing these various efforts out of their respective silos \nand reducing duplication to improve the efficiency and efficacy of \nthese efforts.\n  Through periodic meetings, Federal, State, and local government \nrepresentatives, along with industry and nonprofit representatives will \nmeet to discuss ways to educate individuals and families on how to \nrecognize housing-related health hazards and access the necessary \nservices and preventive measures to combat these hazards. This \ncollaboration is particularly critical as every member of the council\n\n[[Page S5911]]\n\nwill bring a different perspective to the table on how to review, \nmonitor, and evaluate existing housing, health, energy, and \nenvironmental programs and work together to collectively improve these \nprograms for the future. Then, in order to ensure that members of the \npublic are informed of and benefit from the council's activities, the \ncouncil would hold biannual stakeholder meetings, maintain an updated \nwebsite, and work to unify healthy housing data collection and \nmaintenance.\n  It is our goal for this council to help reduce the more than 5.7 \nmillion households living in conditions with moderate or severe health \nhazards, 23 million additional homes with lead-based paint hazards, \n14,000 unintentional injury and fire deaths every year that result from \nhousing-related hazards, and 21,000 radon-associated lung cancer deaths \nevery year. Indeed, the council will help us embark on a path to assure \nthat affordable and decent homes are also healthy.\n  This council could also be critical in helping to curb overall health \ncare expenditures. For example, the annual cost of environmentally \nattributable childhood diseases, including cancer, lead poisoning, and \ncancer was $76 billion in 2008 dollars, 3.5 percent of total health \ncosts. Low-income and minority individuals and families who are \ndisproportionately affected by housing-related health hazards are the \nsame individuals and families who are typically enrolled in Medicaid or \nforgo insurance altogether, which costs Federal and States governments. \nHelping to improve housing conditions can help prevent an estimated \n250,000 children under the age of 6 from having elevated blood levels \neach year, nearly 10,000 emergency department visits for carbon \nmonoxide exposure, and 12.3 million asthma attacks. Keeping children \nout of the doctor's office and emergency rooms will save families and \nthe government money.\n  As Congress continues to explore methods to reduce spending and reign \nin our deficit and improve the health of individuals, children, and \nfamilies, promoting low-cost measures to eliminate subpar housing can \nmake a dramatic and meaningful difference, and I urge my colleagues to \njoin me and Senators Johanns, Boxer, Merkley, and Franken in supporting \nthis bipartisan bill and other healthy housing efforts.\n  Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1617\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Healthy Housing Council Act \n     of 2011''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In the United States--\n       (A) 5,757,000 households live in homes with moderate or \n     severe physical hazards;\n       (B) 23,000,000 homes have significant lead-based paint \n     hazards;\n       (C) 6,000,000 homes have had signs of mice in the last 3 \n     months; and\n       (D) 1 in 15 homes have dangerous levels of radon.\n       (2) Residents of housing that is poorly designed, \n     constructed, or maintained are at risk for cancer, carbon \n     monoxide poisoning, burns, falls, rodent bites, childhood \n     lead poisoning, asthma, and other illnesses and injuries. \n     Vulnerable subpopulations, such as children and the elderly, \n     are at elevated risk for housing-related illnesses and \n     injuries.\n       (3) Because substandard housing typically poses the \n     greatest risks, the disparities in the distribution of \n     housing-related health hazards are striking. One million two \n     hundred thousand housing units with significant lead-based \n     paint hazards house low-income families with children under 6 \n     years of age.\n       (4) Housing-related illnesses, including asthma and lead \n     poisoning, disproportionately affect children from lower-\n     income families and from specific racial and ethnic groups. \n     The prevalence of being diagnosed with asthma in a lifetime \n     is 24 percent among Puerto Rican children, 10.1 percent for \n     Mexican-American children, 12.4 percent for non-Hispanic \n     White children, and 21.8 percent for non-Hispanic Black \n     children. Black children are twice as likely to die from \n     residential injuries as White children, and 3 percent of \n     Black children and 2 percent of Mexican-American children \n     have elevated blood lead levels, as compared to only 1.3 \n     percent of White children.\n       (5) The annual costs for environmentally attributable \n     childhood diseases in the United States, including lead \n     poisoning, asthma, and cancer, total $76,000,000,000 in 2008 \n     dollars. This amount is approximately 3.5 percent of total \n     health care costs.\n       (6) Appropriate housing design, construction, and \n     maintenance, timely correction of deficiencies, planning \n     efforts, and low-cost preventive measures can reduce the \n     incidence of serious injury or death, improve the ability of \n     residents to survive in the event of a major catastrophe, and \n     contribute to overall well-being and mental health. Lead \n     hazard control in homes with lead-based paint hazards can \n     reduce children's blood lead levels by as much as 34 percent. \n     Properly installed and maintained smoke alarms reduce the \n     risk of fire deaths by 50 percent.\n       (7) Providing healthy housing to families and individuals \n     in the United States will help prevent an estimated 250,000 \n     children from having elevated blood lead levels, 18,000 \n     injury deaths, 12,000,000 nonfatal injuries, 3,000 deaths in \n     house fires, 9,600 emergency department visits for carbon \n     monoxide exposure, and 21,000 radon-associated lung cancer \n     deaths that occur in United States housing each year, as well \n     as 12,300,000 asthma attacks, and 14,000,000 missed school \n     days.\n       (8) While there are many programs in place to address \n     housing-related health hazards, these programs are fragmented \n     and spread across many agencies, making it difficult for at-\n     risk families and individuals to access assistance or to \n     receive comprehensive information.\n       (9) Better coordination among Federal agencies is needed, \n     as is better coordination at State and local levels, to \n     ensure that families and individuals can access government \n     programs and services in an effective and efficient manner.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to create livable communities through coordinated \npublic investment and streamlined requirements, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise to announce the introduction of \nthe Livable Communities Act of 2011.\n  The Livable Communities Act presents an opportunity to save taxpayer \ndollars, reduce household expenditures, improve partnerships, and help \nlocal communities create places of lasting value, where businesses want \nto invest and families want to live.\n  It will strengthen rural, suburban, and urban communities by \nsupporting local planning efforts to establish a vision for a desired \nfuture and chart a realistic course for getting there. The bill \npromotes local leadership by encouraging communities to partner \nstrategically to develop solutions that are innovative and reflect \ntheir unique character, assets, and needs. It also directs public \nagencies to use taxpayer dollars more efficiently by coordinating \ninvestments in infrastructure, facilities, and services to meet \nmultiple economic, environmental, and community objectives.\n  This bill is the next important step in transforming the Federal \nGovernment into a better partner in community efforts to achieve \nlocally-defined goals, support families when they need it most, and \nkeep the U.S. competitive in the global economy.\n  Dealing with change can be a real challenge--in our professional and \npersonal lives, with our families, and in our communities. But change \nis an opportunity to move forward, if only we are open to recognizing \nit. We can accept and manage change or we can be steam-rolled by it.\n  I have heard horror stories from across the country about veterans \nhospitals being built in places that are not accessible by public \ntransportation. I have heard of homebuyers who ``drive to qualify'' for \nmortgage financing only to rack up transportation costs that break \ntheir budgets when gas prices go up. Many of these families are paying \n50 percent of their household income on housing and transportation \ncosts alone. It may seem cheaper and easier in the short term to build \non a corn field outside of town than it is to re-use land located close \nto existing transportation, power, and water infrastructure, but it \noften does not make sense in the long run.\n  This is why I welcomed the opportunity to work with Chairman Dodd on \nthe Livable Communities Act in 2009 and why I am honored to be the \nleading sponsor of the updated legislation today. It is the most \ncomprehensive piece of planning legislation that has been proposed in \ndecades. If passed, it will have a transformative impact on the way the \nfederal government supports locally-driven planning processes.\n  Unfortunately, when many on the other side of the aisle hear the word \n``livable,'' they cringe. They think of top-down mandates from the \nFederal Government. What they fail to understand is that the beauty of \nwhat is ``livable'' is defined by the communities themselves to reflect \nthe unique character, assets, and needs of that community.\n  The fact is the private sector wants to be located in communities \nthat have dependable transportation systems to get their goods to \nmarket and their workers to their jobs. Businesses want to attract and \nretain workers and ensure that their enterprise will be viable in the \nlong run. Private enterprise has spearheaded some of the most notable \npast and current planning efforts and the Federal Government should be \na supportive, versatile partner in this work.\n  I invited bipartisan cooperation on the bill numerous times and \nalthough some offices quietly praise the good work going on in their \ncommunities, political pressure prevents them from doing so publicly. \nWe remain optimistic that supporting community efforts to proactively \nplan for the future and save money by coordinating capital investment \nstrategies are values we all support, regardless of the terminology we \nuse to describe them.\n  The Livable Communities Act of 2011 is a streamlined approach that \nwould keep the good work at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment going. Its intent is to find better ways to coordinate \ninterconnected but often silo-ed programs and policies that impact \nhousing, transportation, and the environment and affect the way we live \nour daily lives.\n  The bill would formally authorize the existing HUD Office of \nSustainable Housing and Communities, to work with the Department of \nTransportation and Environmental Protection Agency, to provide \ntechnical assistance and capacity support to communities working on \nintegrated planning for housing, transportation, water and sewer \ninfrastructure needs. These tools help communities develop projects \nthat support job creation, leverage significant private sector \ninvestment, and bolster long-term economic resilience by creating \nplaces where businesses want to invest. Increased coordination at the \nregional and Federal level will cut red tape and save communities money \nas they plan for their future needs. The bill also directs the Office \nof Sustainable Housing and Communities to provide best practices and \ntechnical assistance to ensure that communities of all sizes learn from \neach other's success.\n  The Livable Communities Act of 2011 also directs HUD to coordinate \nwith DOT and EPA to identify and eliminate Federal barriers to \nsustainable development. The Office of Sustainable Housing and \nCommunities will coordinate Federal sustainable development policies \nand research agendas to facilitate Federal collaboration by \nstreamlining and reconciling program requirements and policies. It will \nalso administer grant programs to support local planning for long-term \nhousing and infrastructure needs. This will enable communities to \nfoster economic development in an efficient and inclusive way. \nSelection criteria and eligible activities would be flexible to allow \nall sizes and types of communities to plan for a more sustainable \nfuture, including job creation; revitalizing existing small town Main \nStreets; reducing traffic congestion and pollution; protecting \nfarmland, working landscapes, and green space; addressing vacant, \nabandoned, and foreclosed properties; and building more affordable and \nhealthy housing.\n  The bill would also spur private investment in transit-oriented \ndevelopment, TOD, by helping communities overcome initial financing \nhurdles that so often lock up private investment and prevent desired \ntransit-oriented, mixed-use development. Locally directed TOD provides \nnumerous economic benefits, including increased property values and \nbusiness activity as well as congestion reduction. TOD also promotes \neconomic competitiveness by efficiently connecting our work force to \neducational and employment opportunities. This creates avenues for \nbusiness growth in communities across the country and keeps America \ncompetitive in the global economy.\n  I know how important planning is to our communities. My home State of \nNew Jersey is the most densely populated in the country, so we know the \nvalue of good community planning. Over the years we have learned some \nimportant lessons about how vital it is to make sure that our \ndevelopment projects are functional, serviceable, and livable at the \nhuman scale, places where people feel safe, where they want to spend \ntime, relax as well as work--places where they can live, shop, and be \nconnected to their surroundings. If this economic crisis is teaching us \nanything, it is to live within our means,\n\n[[Page S5914]]\n\nthink creatively about opportunities to leverage resources, and to \ninvest now for future prosperity.\n  Good planning means saving $122 billion on water, sewer, and roads \nover the next 25 years. It means protecting housing values by putting \nhousing near transit. As President Obama remarked over two years ago, \nour days of building mindless sprawl are over. We simply cannot afford \nit. Now is the time to reinvest in our communities and infrastructure. \nThe HUD-DOT-EPA Partnership for Sustainable Communities is doing this \nin a very active way. There are many members of Congress who support \nthis important work, but we need to convince more of them that we are \nright, and that--for the good of their communities--they should be on \nour side.\n  The fact is, we all have a role to play. The environment is \nsubstantially different today than it was ten years ago--twenty years \nago when I was trying to get people on board with the idea reactivating \nan existing right of way to serve as the Hudson Bergen Light Rail when \nI was Mayor of Union City.\n  Today, communities are catching on. Innovation is happening. The \nFederal Government can be an important partner in helping communities \nachieve their goals. I can tell you that in Jersey City, ``livable'' \nmeans the transforming 111 acres of under-utilized industrial land into \na mixed use, walkable community along the Hudson Bergen Light Rail. A \nquiet revolution is underway and communities like Jersey City are \nleading by example. It's time for the Federal Government to catch up.\n  It is our job--together--all of us--to provide the information, \ntools, and encouragement these communities need, that Federal, State, \nand local agencies and elected officials need--to achieve the \naspirations that they set for themselves.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1621\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Livable Communities Act of \n     2011''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) When rural, suburban, and urban communities plan \n     transportation, housing, and water infrastructure \n     strategically it is estimated that these communities could \n     save nearly $122,000,000,000 in infrastructure costs over the \n     next 25 years.\n       (2) Key Federal programs are missing a vital opportunity to \n     boost economic growth at the local and regional level through \n     better coordination of housing, transportation, and related \n     infrastructure investments.\n       (3) Federal regulations and policies should support \n     community efforts to implement and sustain progress toward \n     the achievement of locally-defined development goals, in \n     terms of--\n       (A) geographic location and proximity to existing \n     resources; and\n       (B) maintaining structural and indoor environmental quality \n     and minimizing health hazards.\n       (4) Greater coordination of public investment will provide \n     direct support for immediate job creation and lay the \n     groundwork for long-term resilience and prosperity by \n     leveraging significant private sector and philanthropic \n     investment to make the most of Federal funding.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to strengthen rural, suburban, and urban economies by \n     enabling communities to establish goals for the future and to \n     chart a course for achieving such goals;\n       (2) to promote local leadership by encouraging communities \n     to develop innovative solutions that reflect the unique \n     economic assets and needs of the communities;\n       (3) to maximize returns on Federal funding of housing, \n     transportation, and other infrastructure projects through the \n     coordination of Federal grant programs, regulations, and \n     requirements, by reducing the number of duplicative Federal \n     programs and improving the efficiency and effectiveness of \n     programs and policies of the Department of Housing and Urban \n     Development, the Department of Transportation, the \n     Environmental Protection Agency, and other Federal agencies, \n     as appropriate; and\n       (4) to ensure that Federal funding supports locally defined \n     long range development goals.\n\n     SEC. 4.

I am pleased that Senators Alexander, Cantwell, Crapo, Corker, \nGillibrand, Graham, McConnell, Mark Udall and Tom Udall, have joined me \nin introducing this bipartisan legislation.\n  Since World War II, hundreds of thousands of men and women, including \nuranium miners, millers, and haulers, have served the United States by \nbuilding our nuclear defense weapons. We should all take time to \nremember our fellow Americans who have paid a high price for their \nservice to develop the nuclear program for United States.\n  Some of these workers have developed disabling or fatal illnesses, \nand we should recognize their sacrifice and contributions.
