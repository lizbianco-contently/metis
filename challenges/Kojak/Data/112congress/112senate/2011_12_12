Mr. President, today the Senate will vote on two \nnominations: those of Norman Eisen to serve as Ambassador to the Czech \nRepublic and Maria Carmen Aponte to serve as Ambassador to El Salvador.\n  These two Ambassadors are in their positions as we speak, having been \ngiven recess appointments. These nominees are accomplished, qualified \npublic servants who will continue to represent their Nation with \ndistinction. For my Republican colleagues, however, being qualified and \ndedicated doesn't seem to be enough anymore. Last week, they blocked \nthe nomination of a brilliant legal mind, Caitlin Halligan, to the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Obviously, they don't \nmind there are these vacancies because Republicans were in the majority \nin that court. So they wanted to defeat this competent woman, and that \nis what they did with these vacancies still there in that court.\n  They blocked the nomination of Richard Cordray to lead the Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau, despite his obviously deep qualifications \nfor the job. He has a long history of protecting the middle class \nagainst unfair practices by financial predators and he would have been \na great asset in our fight to protect Main Street from the kind of Wall \nStreet greed that caused the 2008 financial crisis. Yet Republicans \ndenied Mr. Cordray's nomination--I should say confirmation--and all it \ndoes is weaken the agency he was nominated to lead.\n  I hope Republicans will not turn every confirmation process into a \npolitical three-ring circus. The candidates today, Mr. Eisen and Ms. \nAponte, have jumped through enough hoops already. Ms. Aponte's \naccomplished record as Ambassador to El Salvador over the past 15 \nmonths speaks for itself. Experts in the region from across the \npolitical spectrum support her confirmation. The same enthusiasm is \nthere for Ambassador Eisen. If Republicans block the confirmation of \nthese excellent, qualified candidates, it will only be for nakedly \npartisan reasons.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/12/senate-section/article/S8469-8", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8469-S8470]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       PAYROLL TAX CUT EXTENSION\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, also under partisan assault this month is a \nDemocratic proposal to grant a $1,000-tax decrease on working families.\n  Senate Republicans have blocked four proposals to protect middle-\nclass pocketbooks. Every hour they delay and every day they filibuster \nis one more the Senate, by necessity, will have to stay in Washington \nto get its work done.\n\n[[Page S8470]]\n\n  Republicans have opposed our plan to pay for this legislation with a \ntiny surtax on a tiny fraction of America's highest earners. The tax \nwould only apply to the second or third or fourth million the \nwealthiest Americans make. But Republicans say the richest of the rich \nin our country--even those who make millions every year--shouldn't \ncontribute more to get our economy back on track. They call our plan, \ntime after time, a tax on job creators--and I say so-called job \ncreators--because every shred of evidence contradicts this red herring.\n  For example, there have been many outlets, but I will concentrate on \none: National Public Radio went looking for one of these fictitious \nmillionaire job creators. A reporter reached out to business groups, \nthe antitax lobby, and Republicans in Congress hoping to interview one \nof these millionaires. Days ticked by with no luck. Many of our job \ncreators are similar to unicorns; they are impossible to find and don't \nexist. That is because only a tiny fraction of people making more than \n$1 million--probably less than 1 percent--are actually small business \nowners, and only a tiny fraction of that tiny fraction is a traditional \njob creator. Most of these businesses are hedge fund managers or \nwealthy lawyers. They don't do much hiring and they don't need more tax \nbreaks.\n  One reporter looked for millionaire job creators hiding on Facebook. \nThis time they found a few, and they actually supported our plan. These \npeople on Facebook actually supported our plan to ask the richest of \nthe rich to pitch in to improve the economy for all Americans. This is \nwhat Jason Burger, owner of a contracting company that is hiring like \ncrazy, said:\n\n       It's only fair that I put back into the system. That is the \n     entire reason for my success.\n\n  Mr. Burger may be a millionaire, but he is not one in a million. The \nmajority of people who make more than $1 million a year say they would \ngladly contribute more to improve the economy.\n  It is often said that what is good for business is good for America. \nI hope my Republican colleagues will remember, as Mr. Burger does, what \nis good for America is also good for business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/12/senate-section/article/S8470-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8470]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, later this week Senators will have an \nopportunity to do three big things with a single vote.\n  By voting for the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act that \nwill soon come over from the House, Senators will be able to extend the \ntemporary tax relief working Americans continue to need nearly 3 years \ninto this administration, prevent more job losses in the middle of a \njobs crisis by blocking a new regulation on U.S. manufacturers, and \nfacilitate the creation of tens of thousands of new jobs through the \nconstruction of the Keystone XL Pipeline. One vote, three \naccomplishments. That is to say nothing of the other things the bill \nwould do such as the doc fix and unemployment insurance.\n  My suggestion is that once this legislation comes over from the \nHouse, we pass it without delay. Based on the merits of the bill, it \nshould be a strong bipartisan vote. Nothing could be more bipartisan \nright now than preventing job loss or facilitating the creation of new \nprivate sector jobs.\n  The President has said job creation is his top priority. Here is a \nbill that helps him achieve it without a dime of taxpayer money. The \nPresident says he wants to extend the payroll tax extension. Here is a \nbill that does it. The President says he wants unemployment insurance \nextended. This bill does that. The President says he wants the two \nparties to compromise. This is it. There is no reason this legislation \nshouldn't have the President's enthusiastic support.\n  The only reason--the only reason--for Democrats to oppose this job-\ncreating bill would be to gain some political advantage at a time when \nevery one of them says job creation is a top priority.\n  Here is what the junior Senator from West Virginia, a Democrat, had \nto say just today about the pipeline measure contained in the House \nbill:\n\n       I'm for the Keystone Pipeline. All the trade unions, \n     everyone's for it. It creates thousands of jobs.\n\n  I couldn't say it better.\n  The House actually had a stand-alone vote on the Keystone XL back in \nJuly. Forty-seven House Democrats voted for it. I would suggest to my \nfriends on the other side that they join with us and close out the year \non a bipartisan note.\n  The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act was written to \nappeal to both parties, and I have yet to hear anyone on the other side \noffer a single good reason for opposing it. So far, the only reason \nDemocrats have given for opposing this bill is that they would rather \nextend the payroll tax cut on its own without adding language about a \npipeline that many of them say they support anyway. So evidently they \nwould vote for both these things separately but not together. That \nmakes absolutely no sense.\n  Look, you are either for this pipeline project and the jobs that \nwould come with it or you are not. If you are for it, there is no \nreason to oppose it just because it is not offered as a stand-alone \nmeasure. That doesn't make any sense.\n  It is time to stop the posturing. Here is a bill that contains top \npriorities from both sides. Let's take it up and pass it without any \nmore theatrics. Let's pass this job-creating bill and give Americans \nthe certainty and the jobs they deserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/12/senate-section/article/S8470-3", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8470]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, last week, the highlight of the Senate was \ntwo Republican filibusters. Those are efforts by the Republicans to \ndemand 60 votes for the Senate to take action. It used to be rare. In \nfact, it was so rare that Jimmy Stewart made a movie about it: ``Mr. \nSmith Goes to Washington.'' My colleagues may remember it. It wasn't \nthis Chamber, but it looked a lot like it, and Jimmy Stewart was at a \ndesk in the back row because he was a freshman Senator and he literally \nspoke until he dropped, physically, but he won the argument, won the \nday--a great triumph in Washington. He used the filibuster effectively \nto stop what he thought was a greedy move, a selfish move by his \ncolleagues.\n  That is the movies. What is real life? Real life is when a Republican \nSenator says: I declare a filibuster and I will see you later; I am \ngoing out to dinner.\n  That is how it works around here. If we had a few more Jimmy Stewart \nmoments on the floor, where those who are pushing for a filibuster--an \nexceptional, extraordinary 60-vote margin--had to actually stay on the \nfloor and argue their point, I think they would go away. That is \nbecause 9 times out of 10, 19 out of 20, maybe even more, it turns out \nthere is no solid basis for what they are doing.\n\n  What they did last week with their filibusters was to stop a woman \nfrom\n\n[[Page S8471]]\n\nbeing appointed to the circuit court in the District of Columbia. Her \nname is Caitlin Halligan. She is from New York. She is an extraordinary \nperson who has argued many cases before the Supreme Court. I do not \nhave her resume in front of me, but I spoke to her nomination last \nweek. She was found unanimously well-qualified by the American Bar \nAssociation, and yet she was filibustered by the Republicans, and we \ncould only come up with one Republican vote to support us--only one. \nAll the rest said: The filibuster continues.\n  To put that in historic perspective, a few years ago we had a big \nconfrontation in the Senate, before the Acting President pro tempore \nwas elected to the Senate, so I do not implicate him in any way. But \nbefore the Acting President pro tempore was elected, there was an \nargument about whether you should filibuster nominees.\n  Well, a group of 14, a bipartisan group, said: only under \nextraordinary circumstances. Last week, with the filibuster of this \nnominee, they completely forgot that--except for one, Senator Murkowski \nof Alaska. She remembered that promise, and she kept it. She joined us \nin voting to break the filibuster. It was not enough. That nominee fell \nby the wayside.\n  It was not enough, though. One filibuster a week is not enough for \nthe other side. They came up later in the week with another one--that \nseems to be the sum and substance of their strategy in the Senate--and \nthis filibuster was of Richard Cordray. Richard Cordray is a former \nattorney general of the State of Ohio. He is now working at the \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the President wants him to be \nthe Director.\n  What is this bureau? Created by the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill, \nit will put in place for the first time in the history of the United \nStates an agency of government focused on making certain families and \nconsumers know what they are signing when they get into financial \ntransactions, and to stop those who are exploiting Americans and \nAmerican families. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. We have a \nton of agencies that work with the financial institutions. Some of them \nare good, close friends of those institutions. This would be the one \nagency of government on the side of consumers.\n  I know a little bit about it because I heard a speech once from \nElizabeth Warren. Elizabeth Warren, a Harvard law professor, one of the \nmost articulate spokespersons for consumer rights in America--and the \nwatchdog on the bailout funds Congress gave to the banks. She gave a \nspeech once and said: We ought to have one agency that says to the \nAmerican people, here are the tricks and traps you might find in a \nmortgage or a credit card agreement, and here are some things we should \nnot allow under the laws of America.\n  I liked it so much, I went up to her afterward and said: I wish to \nintroduce the bill. She and I worked on it. We introduced it. I put the \nfirst bill in. It gained support and popularity to the point where, \nwhen we came to the floor with the Dodd-Frank bill, Senator Chris Dodd \ntook my idea and, I will say, improved it dramatically--he did a great \njob--and included it in financial reform.\n  My hope--the hope of many people--was that Elizabeth Warren, the \nperson who conceived this idea, would head this agency. She was stopped \ncold. The banking interests and financial institutions in America said \nnot only no, but heck no, we are not going to allow her to be the head \nof this agency.\n  She worked at it, trying to get it up and running, get the right \npeople in place, and eventually went on, and I will not talk here about \nwhat her next effort will be. You can read about it anywhere in the \npapers. But she was the inspiration for this, and Richard Cordray was \nby her side, as they put this agency together.\n  The banks hate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau like the \ndevil hates Holy Water. The idea there would actually be an independent \nagency looking over their transactions and their legal instruments and \ninforming the American people when they have stepped over the line is \nsomething they find unacceptable.\n  Let me tell you about another person working over at the Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau. Her name is Holly Petraeus. If her name \nrings a bell, it should. Her husband, General Petraeus, has probably \nbeen in the forefront of keeping America safe since 9/11 more than any \nother individual, serving both Republican and Democratic \nadministrations. He has risked his life serving his country overseas. \nHe is completely committed to our men and women in the military, and he \nis currently head of the CIA. His wife is cut from the same cloth. She \nbelieves in the military in her heart and soul, and she has worked at \nthe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to stop predatory lenders who \nare taking advantage of military families. That is the kind of work \nthat can be done and is being done there. But they do not have a \nDirector. They do not have a leader.\n  So last week we brought Richard Cordray's nomination to the floor. It \nhas been here for a long time. No one--no one--has argued this man is \nnot extremely well qualified for the job. He is. The vote came up, and \nthere was another Republican filibuster. He fell by the wayside--just \nwhat the banks want. They want to make certain this Bureau does not \nhave a leader and cannot use its resources effectively. They are doing \neverything they can to cripple it.\n  Well, Mr. President, if that were the end of the story--two bad \nfilibusters last week--hold on to your hats because here we come again. \nThis week we are going to have Ambassador Mari Aponte, President \nObama's choice to represent our Nation as U.S. Ambassador to El \nSalvador, before the Senate.\n  We know Ambassador Aponte is more than qualified for this assignment \nbecause she is already performing that job with distinction. President \nObama appointed her by recess appointment nearly a year ago.\n  Let me tell you about two of the things she has achieved in a year as \nour chief diplomat in El Salvador.\n  First, she persuaded El Salvador to send troops to assist the NATO \ntraining mission in Afghanistan in August. This is the first time--the \nfirst time--any Latin American country has put troops on the ground in \nAfghanistan in support of American troops.\n\n  This represents a significant achievement for El Salvador. Twenty \nyears ago, the people of El Salvador were struggling in the midst of a \nbloody civil war. Today, they are strong enough and stable enough to \nhelp others around the world in Afghanistan establish their own stable \ndemocracy.\n  Ambassador Aponte has proven to be very effective advocating for U.S. \ninterests in Latin America--a region immediately on our doorstep and \nwith which we have many strategic interests.\n  Ambassador Aponte has helped to advance America's security interests \nin Latin America by expertly negotiating an agreement with El Salvador \nto open a new jointly funded electronic monitoring center to fight \ntransnational crime.\n  What are we talking about here? Drug dealing and terrorism. Such gang \nand narcotics-related crime impacts both our nations, Central America, \nand the world. This skilled diplomat is able to work now, as a recess \nappointment by President Obama, to ensure that El Salvador remains a \nstrong ally in the fight against these dangers.\n  She has already proven herself to be an accomplished diplomat in a \nshort period of time. She has a long history of public service and \nexperience in both the private and nonprofit sectors.\n  One of America's greatest strengths is that we are a diverse nation. \nAmbassador Aponte helps demonstrate that strength to the world. She is \none of the few Puerto Rican Ambassadors serving our Nation.\n  But despite everything I have said to you, her nomination has been \nmet with unjustified resistance on the Republican side of the aisle.\n  In 1998, Ambassador Aponte was appointed by then-President Clinton to \nbe Ambassador to the Dominican Republic. She withdrew her nomination, \nin 1998--13 years ago--after a Miami newspaper reported allegations \nthat a former naturalized Cuban-American boyfriend from the early 1990s \nwas actually a Cuban intelligence agent who was trying to recruit her.\n  The FBI looked into the matter. They investigated it. Aponte \ncooperated completely, and she also severed all her ties with this \nindividual. She\n\n[[Page S8472]]\n\nwas never the subject of any FBI investigation or ever accused of any \nwrongdoing.\n  Despite her full cooperation with the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, ultimately the FBI found no evidence to support the \nallegations against her--none.\n  When President Obama looked at Ambassador Aponte's record of public \nservice, he nominated her to serve as America's Ambassador to El \nSalvador in 2009. Once again, the critics raised the same allegations \nabout her former relationship, even though they had been thoroughly \ninvestigated and dismissed and discredited by the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation.\n  Senator DeMint of South Carolina objected to her nomination. He was \nthe only Senator objecting. So this time around, the chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, along \nwith Senator Menendez, our only Hispanic Senator on the Democratic \nside, from the State of New Jersey, made an unprecedented move. They \nsaid to Senator DeMint of South Carolina: We will allow you to \npersonally review the FBI files on Ambassador Aponte.\n  So Senator DeMint appeared to raise a new objection to Aponte at that \npoint. And listen to this one: This objection--new one--by Senator \nDeMint stems from an editorial the Ambassador wrote in a popular El \nSalvadoran newspaper in June about Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and \nTransgender Pride Month. The article was entitled ``For the elimination \nof prejudices wherever they exist.'' Her op-ed disavowed violence and \nhatred against individuals based on their sexual orientation, urging \neducation and understanding. Those are hardly radical ideas. Most \nMembers of the Senate--at least, let's say, many Members of the \nSenate--have given speeches along these lines.\n  Well, the Senator from South Carolina calls this op-ed provocative \nand argues that it is disrespectful of El Salvador's culture and that \nit inflamed tensions with an important ally. There is no evidence to \nsupport what he said--none.\n  To the contrary, El Salvador itself had already taken--before she \npublished this editorial--steps toward more equal rights with the \npassage of Decree 56 in May 2010. That law prohibits all forms of \ndiscrimination by the Government of El Salvador based on sexual \norientation--just what the Ambassador had asked for in her editorial.\n  Decree 56 was signed 1 year before Ambassador Aponte wrote her \narticle, 4 months before she was sworn in as Ambassador. The record is \nthere.\n  El Salvador reaffirmed its national commitment to equality again last \nJune when it joined the United States and more than 80 other nations in \nsigning the declaration for the elimination of violence against the \nlesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community during the Human \nRights Council of the United Nations.\n  Let me also note that Ambassador Aponte wrote that op-ed pursuant to \ncables from the State Department that went out to all ambassadors \naround the world, suggesting they write similar pieces or hold a \nrelated event. In fact, similar editorials to what Ambassador Aponte \nwrote were written and events were held at American embassies and posts \nall around the world.\n  Why is one Senator picking on this Ambassador? Quite simply, the \nnomination of a U.S. Ambassador to a strategically important ally such \nas El Salvador is no time for a political debate that has little or \nnothing to do with time-honored and accepted principles in the United \nStates and around the world.\n  Ambassador Aponte deserves a vote in the Senate based on her work, \nher achievements, and her demonstrated ability to effectively advocate \nfor the United States in El Salvador.\n  She has been thoroughly vetted by the FBI and the State Department, \nas is every nominee. She has passed two separate top secret security \nclearances. She has shown she is able to work with Salvadoran leaders \nand achieve way beyond what many believed could be achieved because of \nher skill.\n  We live in challenging times. Our ambassadors are the eyes and ears \nof America around the world. Some of the posts they serve in are very \ndangerous. Look at what Ambassador Robert Ford has been doing in Syria \namid that country's upheaval. Blocking qualified and talented Americans \nfrom serving in El Salvador or any place in the world is not in \nAmerica's best long-term interests.\n  During our recent Foreign Relations Committee markup, which the \nActing President pro tempore attended, related to Ambassador Aponte's \nnomination, Chairman Kerry offered Senator DeMint another opportunity \nto review all the materials we have regarding Ambassador Aponte. I hope \nhe took advantage of that offer. Should he still oppose her nomination, \nI disagree with him, of course, but respect his rights in the Senate. \nHe can register his vote along with the other Senators. But I certainly \nhope this critical and important nomination will not be unfairly held \nup and discredited with another filibuster. It is time for the Senate \nto move beyond filibusters, to work in an effort to try to solve our \nproblems.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/12/senate-section/article/S8472-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8472-S8473]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            PAYROLL TAX CUT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, there was a recent survey of how many \nfamilies in America have an immediate member of the family who is \nserving in the military. The number is one of the lowest in history. It \nturns out the families who actually know someone or have someone \nserving in the military are a small percentage of this great Nation.\n  My family has a nephew serving in Afghanistan with the 10th Mountain \nDivision. Not long ago, as a college student, he worked as a doorman \nhere in the Senate. But Michael is now serving overseas in Afghanistan. \nI think about him all the time. I send him boxes of things. I do not \nknow if he will have any use for them or enjoy them, but it is my way \nof reminding him we do not forget him.\n  We have a big family, and I am sure he gets plenty of stuff. I know \nsome of that must be a joy for him to receive. But more important than \nany material sent to him, I hope it is an expression of how we feel \nabout him, about the sacrifice he is making, as so many others are \nmaking, thousands around the world, as we meet in the safety of this \nSenate Chamber.\n  We ask an awful lot of our men and women in uniform. We ask them to \nrisk their lives for America. Many come back injured. Some do not \nreturn, having given that promise and that pledge. They make a \nsacrifice which many of us have never been asked to make.\n  I think about that in terms of the debate we enter into this week in \nthe Senate. We are trying to turn this economy around because so many \npeople are out of work. Businesses are struggling. The President put \nforward a jobs bill and has for months been pushing for its passage. We \nhave considered a lot of parts of it.\n  One part relating to veterans we actually agreed on. It was a \nbreakthrough. I am glad we did. But when it came to all of the others, \nthe million who are out of work in America, there is still wide \ndisagreement. We hope to finish this matter this week and head home for \nthe holidays where we all want to be. But, unfortunately, we are \nembroiled in a political fight again. The fight is over something very \nbasic. It is this: Should we ask the wealthiest in America to pay a \nlittle more in taxes so that we can provide a payroll tax cut for \nalmost 160 million Americans? That is it.\n  What we hear from the other side of the aisle over and over again is, \nno; we cannot impose a new burden on the wealthiest in America. We \ncannot ask any more sacrifice from people who are already earning at \nleast--at least--$1 million a year. I thought about that. I thought \nabout my nephew and so many like him who sacrifice every single day for \nthis great Nation, and to think that we could not ask the wealthiest \namong us to pay a little more in taxes to help us get out of this \nrecession and put America back to work.\n  Those two things, unfortunately, are in sharp contrast. I think it is \ntime for us to pass this payroll tax cut. It is desperately needed. We \nneed to maintain our unemployment insurance because we still have too \nmany people out of work: four unemployed Americans for every available \njob. That is a fact. Things are getting better slowly but too slowly. \nIn the meantime, these people are looking every single day for a job \nwhile they do their best to keep their families together, to keep their\n\n[[Page S8473]]\n\nfamilies with the basics in life, to make sure they pay the rent, the \nmortgage, the utility bills.\n  The first casualty in many of these families is health insurance. Can \nyou imagine raising children not knowing if one trip to the emergency \nroom will be something you could never hope to afford. Unemployment \nbenefits allow people to keep their families together and to continue \nlooking for work.\n  I urge my colleagues, before we consider leaving for the holiday \nseason, let's get the job done. President Obama has made it clear. He \nwill not allow us to go home until we get this job done. Extend the \npayroll tax cut for 160 million Americans; maintain unemployment \nbenefits for those millions who are counting on them to put bread on \nthe table and keep their families together during a very difficult time \nand let's pass a spending bill. We agreed on the limits on what we \nwould spend. Let's pass the bill now in a bipartisan fashion. I hope we \ncan reach that point.\n  One last point. I now hear the Republican Senate leader come to the \nfloor and tell us this entire debate, this entire breakdown, all the \nproblems we have had is about an oil pipeline. Now, I did not know that \nuntil last week. I wish he would have spoken up a lot earlier, that an \noil pipeline, the Keystone Pipeline, which has been controversial, has \nto be part of any deal. He said at one point that it may even create \n20,000 jobs.\n  I am quick to remind my colleague, there are 14 million Americans out \nof work and 160 million counting on this payroll tax cut. So 20,000 \njobs is important. I would love to see every job we can responsibly \nbring to this country. But let's not stop the business of government, \nlet's not stop helping this economy recover over one issue, whatever it \nmay be--whether it is a pipeline or whatever it may be.\n  We owe to the people who sent us here to respect them, to show that \nwe will do our best to keep this country moving forward and do it in \nthe name of so many of our men and women in uniform who are sacrificing \ntoday as we meet in the safety and security of this Chamber.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/12/senate-section/article/S8473-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8473-S8474]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           SPENDING AND TAXES\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, over the last few weeks the Senate has been \nengaged in a familiar exercise. The Democratic majority, urged on by \nthe President, offers up an increase in spending to be paid for by an \nincrease in taxes. If anything, this familiar refrain should cement in \nthe minds of the American people that President Obama and his \ncongressional allies remain committed to a policy of tax and spend. \nLet's not mistake any of this for carefully designed stimulus spending \nor tax policy. No, the series of tax-and-spend proposals brought to the \nSenate floor during the past few months were designed for political \nreasons only. It remains unclear what any of this has to do with job \ncreation. In fact, I suspect that much of this bread and circus routine \nis meant to distract the families and taxpayers from the President's \nmediocre record on job creation and economic growth.\n  For months the Senate has been asked to consider higher taxes, \nincluding surtaxes on the so-called rich to pay for whatever the \nDemocrats have settled on as their spending idea of the week. Most of \nthose ideas were sold as stimulus even though they include things such \nas an infrastructure bank, which would be a brandnew GSE to gobble \ntaxpayer resources--just like Fannie and Freddie--and which would take \nyears just to get off the ground. Most of the ideas have been designed \nto appease Democratic constituencies--mostly unions--and to construct \ncampaign-season talking points attacking Republicans for their failure \nto increase taxes on the evil rich in order to pay for the Democrats' \nspending sugar highs. The focus on politics has become such a priority \nfor the President that he is now in the unusual position of making a \nraid on Social Security's trust funds his principal policy objective.\n  At first, to pay for the very massive new stimulus plan of the \nPresident's, the Democrats wanted to limit deductions for people \nearning $200,000 or more, which in September was evidently how they \ndefined the so-called rich. Next came a proposed surtax of 5.6 percent \non people earning $1 million or more to pay for the President's \nstimulus scheme. We can't be sure, but I suspect this jump in the \nincome threshold for the Democrats' tax increases came when high-income \nDemocrats in high-income jurisdictions such as New York, California, \nand New Jersey made it clear that this is where they had to part \ncompany with the President. Next came a surtax of 0.5 percent on high-\nincome earners to give funds to States to help pay mostly union \nworkers. Then came a surtax of 0.7 percent on those earners to help pay \nfor a new Fannie and Freddie called an infrastructure bank. This was \nfollowed by a surtax of 3.25 percent on those earners for a payroll tax \nexpenditure. Finally came a surtax of 1.9 percent on those earners for \nthe payroll tax expenditure.\n  The pattern is clear: Democrats roll out their stimulus spending plan \nof the week, find out how much it will cost, and then find out what \nsurtax to slap on high earners, including business income recipients. \nThat is how we get tax proposals with rates of 5.6 percent, then 0.5 \npercent, then 0.7 percent, then 3.25 percent, and then 1.9 percent. Who \nknows what will come next. Never mind that businesses across this \ncountry have been clear that massive uncertainty about the current \nadministration's policies, regulations, and tax increases is holding \nback their hiring, job creation, and the economy. People are uncertain \nabout what their future health care costs will be, what their future \nenergy costs will be, what their future regulatory environment will be, \nand what their future taxes will be. Given the past few months of tax \nrate roulette being played by the Democrats, is it any wonder that \nfamilies and businesses are uncertain and pessimistic about the future?\n  These tax rates have nothing to do with designing optimal tax policy \nand everything to do with scoring cheap political points and growing an \nalready bloated Federal Government. These tax rates have nothing to do \nwith engineering greater wealth or income equality through the Tax \nCode. These tax rates have nothing to do with creating a foundation for \ngrowth in jobs and the economy. They have everything to do with paying \nfor politically favored, poll-tested stimulus spending.\n  In the President's $800 billion-plus stimulus of 2009, we were told \nthat the measures would be temporary and we would ``pivot'' later to \nfiscal austerity. But the promised pivot never comes. Still today we \nare told to spend more now and pivot later, but the promised pivots \nnever come. Unfortunately, unless we pivot, we will run off a budgetary \ncliff and face the deficit and debt crisis plaguing Europe today.\n  These tax rates recently proposed by Democrats have nothing to do \nwith long-term economic growth and more to do with the President's \nvision of government as the benevolent allocator of people's hard-\nearned income. Not content with his average deficits being close to 25 \npercent of the entire size of our economy--which we have not seen since \nthe years surrounding World War II--the President and my Democratic \nfriends here in the Senate want to permanently enshrine a European-\nsized government in the American economy. They don't just want \nadditional infrastructure spending, they want a brandnew government \nbureaucracy free of Congress to tax and spend. They want an all-\npowerful, unchecked government czar to control the provision and costs \nof consumer credit cards. They want an overzealous EPA to control \nreliable sources of energy no matter what the cost of their policies. \nThey want an activist Labor Department to control how workers and \ncompanies can bargain to control where they can operate a business and \nto push people into their union voting base whether they support the \nunion or not. The President's pursuits are not those of someone who \nthinks that in certain instances government is constitutionally \nauthorized to act and can occasionally do some good. His record is\n\n[[Page S8474]]\n\nthat of someone who is confident that in most cases, government \ntechnocrats can do better things with Americans' hard-earned incomes \nthan Americans can do for themselves.\n\n  When we look at the variable menu of recent tax rates proposed by \nDemocrats, we have to ask whether, once enshrined into law, the 5.6-\npercent rate or the 0.5-percent rate or whatever happens to be their \nflavor of the week is where my friends on the other side of the aisle \nwould leave things. I have every reason to doubt they would stop at \nthose rates and every reason to believe they will work as hard as they \ncan to keep increasing those rates, demolishing businesses and jobs as \nthey go. I have every reason to believe the current President will \nstick with his commitment to ``spread the wealth around'' and ask the \nso-called rich--and that could mean people who earn as little as \n$200,000, according to Democrats--to pay ``just a little bit more.''\n  So where will they stop? What is the optimal tax-the-rich rate of \ntaxation? Economist Peter Diamond, who was nominated by the President \nto serve on the Federal Reserve Board, has proposed in recent writings \nthat ``tax policy needs to be socially acceptable'' and then finds it \nacceptable to go on to say that the so-called optimal top tax rate \ncould be as high as 73 percent. The current top marginal tax rate on \nearnings in the U.S. economy is around 42.5 percent when we combine \nincome tax rates of 35 percent with the Medicare tax and average State \ntaxes. The cutoff for the top percentile of tax filers is about \n$400,000, according to Diamond's analysis.\n  When we consider the liberal conventional wisdom about how businesses \noperate, the American people, it seems to me, should be careful about \nwhere the Democrats' tax hike proposals might lead. The bottom line is \nthat the sky is the limit.\n  Consider the New York Times' December 9 editorial, tucked in between \nadvertisements for jewelry, properties, and baubles that only the \ntremendously megarich could afford, where the liberal press offered the \nfollowing guidance on tax policy:\n\n       The latest Democratic bill to cut the payroll tax, blocked \n     by Republicans on Thursday, called for a 1.9 percent surtax \n     on income over $1 million. More important, for any savvy \n     business owner, a surtax would have no bearing on hiring \n     decisions. If new workers are profitable before tax, they \n     will be profitable after tax, even if the employer has to pay \n     slightly more of the profit in taxes.\n\n  This perfectly encapsulates the understanding of the economy by folks \nwho have never run a business or tried to turn a profit. The liberal \nnotion is that business owners are immune to basic economics and that \ntheir hiring decisions are entirely unaffected by tax rates.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent to be able to speak for just a few \nminutes more.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. With this view in mind, it is not hard to imagine \nproposals for taxes upward of 73 percent because those megarich \nbusiness owners simply won't flinch.\n  The Democrats' burning desire to raise taxes seems to confuse income \nand wealth. They abhor the outsized wealth accumulation of the \nmegarich, even though they love the campaign contributions flowing from \nthem. They seem to think that massive increases in income taxes will \ncure the growth in inequality observed over decades in the United \nStates and in many foreign economies.\n  Some of our Nation's wealthiest individuals, such as Bill Gates and \nWarren Buffett, join this chorus and call for higher taxes on others, \neven though they channel large portions of their wealth to private \nfoundations, revealing their preference for resources to be allocated \nin the private sector rather than by the government.\n  Even our President calls for more taxes on himself, although he could \nwrite a check to the IRS at any moment. He calls for a Buffett rule, \neven though he paid a tax rate of 26.3 percent in 2010, which, \naccording to a recent Congressional Research Service analysis, means \nthe President violates his own idea of the Buffett rule by paying a \nlower tax rate than well over 10 million more moderate income \ntaxpayers.\n  The past few months have witnessed a variable menu of tax rates \noffered by my friends on the other side of the aisle. They claim these \ntax increases will secure equality, economic growth, job creation, and \nmore.\n  Those claims are false. The evidence is clear that the recent \nproposals from Democrats have been more of the same: tax and spend, \nmove toward a permanently larger government, and design politically \nmotivated bills they know will fail in the Congress in order to hone \nelection year talking points.\n  We need to be clear with the American people that these proposals \nmight be good for government, but they will do little to cure the ills \nof our economy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last Thursday marked the fifth time this year \nthe majority has initiated a vote on the so-called millionaires' \nsurcharge--a tax that primarily affects small businesses--in order to \n``pay for'' a piece of legislation. Notably, Thursday also marked the \nfifth time this year this tax increase failed to pass the Senate, which \nsuggests, of course, it is being used for political purposes.\n  President Obama and his supporters have argued that the tax increases \nthey support--such as the millionaires' surcharge--will not affect \nanyone but the wealthiest Americans, and that those people have to \nstart doing ``their fair share'' because they ``can afford it.'' They \nrepeat the phrase ``shared sacrifice.''\n  In a recent campaign speech in Kansas, President Obama took the class \nwarfare argument to a whole new level, injecting his speech with false \neconomic moralisms and evoking what he calls the ``you're on your own'' \neconomics of Republicans and suggesting that the ``breathtaking greed \nof a few''--these are his words I am using--has been crushing the \nmiddle class. The President's object seems to be purposefully \nconflating all upper income taxpayers with those reckless few who \nhelped cause the financial crisis, ignoring, I might add, those in \nCongress who also helped to create that crisis.\n  The President's rhetoric is not only wrongheaded, in my view it is \nirresponsible. I wish to make three points in response.\n  First, the President of the United States should not be pitting \nAmericans against each other. Class warfare has no place in American \ndebates. It is divisive, and it is unhelpful to the national discourse. \nIt is especially unbecoming of the President, who is the only person \nelected to represent all Americans. He should speak for all Americans, \nespecially in times of high unemployment and high economic uncertainty, \nnot pit them one against each other for short-term political gain.\n  America is not a caste society. There is no formal class structure \nengrained into our way of life. The opposite is true. That is why \nmillions of people left the old countries in Europe and elsewhere to \ncome here for economic opportunity and to compete in our free markets.\n  Why doesn't the President offer encouragement about America's \nstrengths and its future, rather than play into some Americans' fears? \nIn other words, why doesn't he run the kind of campaign he ran in \n2008--one based on unity and hope?\n  The answer, I am afraid, is because the President's record during the \nlast 3 years does not inspire much hope: a massive stimulus filled with \nspecial-interest goodies, a government takeover of health care, a \nfailed cap-and-trade agenda, an EPA power grab, and more new job-\nkilling regulations than one can count.\n  Obviously, the policies of the last 3 years have not left Americans \nin better shape than they were 3 years ago. Indeed, about three-\nquarters of Americans say the country is on the ``wrong track.'' As \ncolumnist Charles Krauthammer wrote in a recent column: ``Obama has \nspent three years on signature policies that ignore or aggravate'' \nstructural problems, such as\n\n[[Page S8475]]\n\nhigh unemployment, weak growth, vast debt, and our strained safety net \nand dysfunctional Tax Code.\n  So the President cannot run on his record. And he does not want \nvoters to focus on how his policies may have prolonged our economic \ntroubles or that his party controlled Washington for the first 2 years \nof his Presidency. His way out is to blame others.\n  But rather than stir up resentment and unease, I suggest the \nPresident focus on strengthening opportunity for all Americans. That \ngets to the second point, which addresses the assertion that upper \nincome taxpayers are not doing their fair share. This is patently \nfalse. Let me provide a few instructive numbers.\n  According to IRS data, the top 1 percent of taxpayers pays 38 percent \nof total income taxes but earns only 20 percent of total income. In \nother words, the top 1 percent earns 20 percent and pays almost double \nthat in their share of Federal income taxes.\n  The top 2 percent of taxpayers pays almost half of all the taxes--\n48.68 percent, to be exact. They only earn a little under 28 percent of \nthe total income and pay almost 50 percent. So the top 2 percent are \npaying almost 50 percent of all the taxes. And this is not a fair \nshare? This is not doing their part?\n  The top 5 percent of taxpayers pays 58.7 percent. They earn just a \nlittle over one-third of all of the income. In fact, the top 5 percent \npays more than the bottom 95 percent, total. The top 5 percent pays \nmore taxes by far than the rest of the 95 percent. And they are not \ndoing their fair share?\n\n  The top 10 percent of taxpayers pays almost 70 percent and still \nearns less than 50 percent of total income--45.7 percent, to be exact.\n  The bottom 95 percent of taxpayers pays 41.3 percent. They earn 65.3 \npercent of total income. So the bottom 95 percent--this is a big chunk \nof American taxpayers--is earning a lot more in percentage than they \nare paying in percentage of income taxes.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that 51 percent of all \nhouseholds, which includes both filers and nonfilers, had either zero \nor negative income tax liability for the year 2009. Such progressive \ntaxation is, in fact, ``shared sacrifice.'' The United States has the \nmost progressive income Tax Code of any country among developed \nnations. So the argument that top-tier earners are not doing enough \ndoes not hold water, and somebody needs to call the President on this \nfalse argument of his because it attempts to pit one group of Americans \nagainst the other when in point of fact the President, of all people, \nshould be unifying Americans.\n  The third point is related to who actually would pay this \nmillionaires' surcharge that the President advocates and our colleagues \nhave been urging us to vote for yet again. This proposed tax increase \nwill presumably be trotted out again and again. It cannot get the votes \nto pass, but it makes a nice political charge.\n  The President and his supporters claim it would only affect the \nwealthiest of the wealthy. Well, the fact is this tax would crush small \nbusiness owners. Many small businesses are organized as ``pass-\nthrough'' entities. That means they pay their taxes as individuals. \nThey are not organized as corporations. They do not pay their taxes as \ncorporations. They pay as individuals.\n  So when the plumbing company or the air conditioning company pays \ntaxes, that small business owner pays them as an individual and, \ntherefore, he pays at the individual income tax rates. If you are in \none of the top two rates--and 50 percent of small business income is \nreported in those top two rates--you are going to get clobbered by this \nsurtax on millionaires. And these are the very businesses, the most \nsuccessful small businesses, that create many of America's new jobs.\n  According to the National Association of Manufacturers' December 5 \nweekly report:\n\n       Small and medium-sized payrolls (those with less than 500 \n     employees) accounted for the bulk of the net new jobs, \n     continuing a familiar trend. This was true for both the \n     goods-producing as well as the service-producing sectors.\n\n  There is a lot of data that shows many of these job-creating small \nbusinesses would be slammed by a millionaires' surcharge.\n  For example, a Wall Street Journal editorial reports that the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation has estimated that taxpayers will declare $1.2 \ntrillion in business income in 2013. Of this reported tax income, 34 \npercent would be ``on tax returns with `modified adjusted gross income \nin excess of $1 million.' '' As the Journal notes, that means about \n$400 billion in business income would be subjected to the so-called \nmillionaires' surcharge tax.\n  And who pays that? As the Journal writes, the Treasury Department \nexamined IRS data in 2007 and found 392,000 tax returns with incomes \nabove $1 million, 311,000 of which were classified by the Treasury \nDepartment as ``business owners.'' So 80 percent of a payroll tax \nsurcharge will fall on these small business owners. That is a direct \ntax on job creation. What could you think of that would do more harm to \ncreating jobs in America than imposing a brandnew tax on the people who \nwe hope are going to create the new jobs coming out of this recession? \nRemember too that taxes are already set to go up in 2013 when the \ncurrent tax rates expire. On top of that, business investors will also \nface a 3.8-percent ObamaCare ``investment income tax surcharge'' set to \nbegin in 2013.\n  How is taking money away from these small businesses going to allow \nthem to expand and hire more workers?\n  John Mackey, who is the cofounder of the wildly successful Whole \nFoods chain, wrote an op-ed last month explaining, from his point of \nview, what policies can help and harm job growth. He writes:\n\n       One hundred years ago the total cost of government at all \n     levels . . . was only 8 percent of our gross domestic \n     product. In 2010, it was 40 percent. Government is gobbling \n     up trillions of dollars from our economy to feed itself \n     through higher taxes and unprecedented deficit spending--\n     money that could be used by individuals to improve their \n     lives and by entrepreneurs to create jobs.\n\n  Policymakers would do well to listen to the advice of entrepreneurs \nsuch as John Mackey about a real growth agenda. Americans are counting \non job creators in the private sector to help turn the economy around \nby putting capital at risk and hiring new employees. Relentless class \nwarfare and obsessing over income redistribution are not real policy \nprescriptions.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe op-ed piece by Charles Krauthammer which I mentioned.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Dec. 8, 2011]\n\n                 Obama's Campaign for Class Resentment\n\n                        (By Charles Krauthammer)\n\n       In the first month of his presidency, Barack Obama averred \n     that if in three years he hadn't alleviated the nation's \n     economic pain, he'd be a ``one-term proposition.''\n       When three-quarters of Americans think the country is on \n     the ``wrong track'' and even Bill Clinton calls the economy \n     ``lousy,'' how then to run for a second term? Traveling \n     Tuesday to Osawatomie, Kan., site of a famous 1910 Teddy \n     Roosevelt speech, Obama laid out the case.\n       It seems that he and his policies have nothing to do with \n     the current state of things. Sure, presidents are ordinarily \n     held accountable for economic growth, unemployment, national \n     indebtedness (see Obama, above). But not this time. \n     Responsibility, you see, lies with the rich.\n       Or, as the philosophers of Zuccotti Park call them, the 1 \n     percent. For Obama, these rich are the ones holding back the \n     99 percent. The ``breathtaking greed of a few'' is crushing \n     the middle class. If only the rich paid their ``fair share,'' \n     the middle class would have a chance. Otherwise, government \n     won't have enough funds to ``invest'' in education and \n     innovation, the golden path to the sunny uplands of economic \n     growth and opportunity.\n       Where to begin? A country spending twice as much per capita \n     on education as it did in 1970 with zero effect on test \n     scores is not underinvesting in education. It's mis-\n     investing. As for federally directed spending on innovation--\n     like Solyndra? Ethanol? The preposterously subsidized, \n     flammable Chevy Volt?\n       Our current economic distress is attributable to myriad \n     causes: globalization, expensive high-tech medicine, a huge \n     debt burden, a burst housing bubble largely driven by \n     precisely the egalitarian impulse that Obama is promoting \n     (government aggressively pushing ``affordable housing'' that \n     turned out to be disastrously unaffordable), an aging \n     population straining the social safety net. Yes, growing \n     inequality is a problem throughout the Western world. But \n     Obama's pretense that it is the root cause of this sick \n     economy is ridiculous.\n       As is his solution, that old perennial: selective abolition \n     of the Bush tax cuts. As if all that ails us, all that keeps \n     the economy from\n\n[[Page S8476]]\n\n     humming and the middle class from advancing, is a 4.6-point \n     hike in marginal tax rates for the rich.\n       This, in a country $15 trillion in debt with out-of-control \n     entitlements systematically starving every other national \n     need. This obsession with a sock-it-to-the-rich tax hike \n     that, at most, would have reduced this year's deficit from \n     $1.30 trillion to $1.22 trillion is the classic reflex of \n     reactionary liberalism--anything to avoid addressing the \n     underlying structural problems, which would require \n     modernizing the totemic programs of the New Deal and Great \n     Society.\n       As for those structural problems, Obama has spent three \n     years on signature policies that either ignore or aggravate \n     them:\n       --A massive stimulus, a gigantic payoff to Democratic \n     interest groups (such as teachers, public-sector unions) that \n     will add nearly $1 trillion to the national debt.\n       --A sweeping federally run reorganization of health care \n     that (a) cost Congress a year, (b) created an entirely new \n     entitlement in a nation hemorrhaging from unsustainable \n     entitlements, (c) introduced new levels of uncertainty into \n     an already stagnant economy.\n       --High-handed regulation, best exemplified by Obama's \n     failed cap-and-trade legislation, promptly followed by the \n     Environmental Protection Agency trying to impose the same \n     conventional-energy-killing agenda by administrative means.\n       Moreover, on the one issue that already enjoys a bipartisan \n     consensus--the need for fundamental reform of a corrosive, \n     corrupted tax code that misdirects capital and promotes \n     unfairness--Obama did nothing, ignoring the recommendations \n     of several bipartisan commissions, including his own.\n       In Kansas, Obama lamented that millions ``are now forced to \n     take their children to food banks.'' You have to admire the \n     audacity. That's the kind of damning observation the \n     opposition brings up when you've been in office three years. \n     Yet Obama summoned it to make the case for his reelection!\n       Why? Because, you see, he bears no responsibility for the \n     current economic distress. It's the rich. And, like Horatius \n     at the bridge, Obama stands with the American masses against \n     the soulless plutocrats.\n       This is populism so crude that it channels not Teddy \n     Roosevelt so much as Hugo Chavez. But with high unemployment, \n     economic stagnation and unprecedented deficits, what else can \n     Obama say?\n       He can't run on stewardship. He can't run on policy. His \n     signature initiatives--the stimulus, Obamacare and the failed \n     cap-and-trade--will go unmentioned in his campaign ads. \n     Indeed, they will be the stuff of Republican ads.\n       What's left? Class resentment. Got a better idea?\n\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nominations, en \nbloc, which the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read the nominations of Norman L. Eisen, of the \nDistrict of Columbia, to be Ambassador Extraordinary and \nPlenipotentiary of the United States of America to the Czech Republic, \nand Mari Carmen Aponte, of the District of Columbia, to be Ambassador \nExtraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the United States of America to \nthe Republic of El Salvador.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 1 hour \nof debate equally divided in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to speak about one of the votes \nwe are going to have this afternoon, and it has nothing to do with Mr. \nEisen's job as Ambassador. It is about why he has not been confirmed to \nthis point.\n  The President announced Mr. Eisen's nomination to be Ambassador to \nthe Czech Republic on June 28, 2010. On September 20, 2010, I provided \npublic notice of my intention to object to the nomination. In other \nwords, as I always do when I put a hold on something--a bill or a \nnomination--I put a reason in the Congressional Record so that \neverybody knows it is me. I am not a secret-holds guy.\n  The reason for my objection is not related to the substance of his \nduty as Ambassador; I object to his nomination because of the way Mr. \nEisen handled the controversial firing of Gerald Walpin and the \ncongressional inquiry into that firing. Mr. Walpin was the inspector \ngeneral at the Corporation for National Community Service, AmeriCorps. \nMr. Eisen was at the White House Counsel's office at the time.\n  Any attempt to undermine the independence and integrity of inspectors \ngeneral raises serious concerns with me, and anybody ought to know that \nabout this Senator. An inspector general who does his or her job runs \nthe risk of losing friends at any agency as well as maybe the White \nHouse. The Congress must not sit idly by when an inspector general is \nremoved improperly.\n  After the President abruptly removed Inspector General Walpin from \noffice, there were allegations that he was fired for political reasons. \nSo I started the investigation. There was evidence that the removal may \nhave been motivated by a desire to protect a friend and political ally \nof the President, mayor of Sacramento Kevin Johnson.\n  The inspector general and CNCS management were clashing over an \ninquiry into misuse of Federal grant money at a charity run by Johnson. \nThere were allegations that the grant money was used to pay for \npersonal services for Johnson such as maybe washing his car. There \nseemed to be evidence of that. There were allegations that the grant \nmoney has been used to pay for political campaign work. So what would \nyou expect an inspector general to do?\n  The IG was pushing aggressively to require Johnson to repay the \nFederal grant money that his charity could not account for. The \ninspector general was also pushing to have Johnson prohibited from \nreceiving future Federal grant funds. This caused, as you might expect, \na political uproar because some people feared that might prevent the \ncity of Sacramento from receiving Federal stimulus dollars during the \nfinancial crisis.\n  All of this background cried out for further investigation. I also \nlearned that Mr. Eisen personally delivered an ultimatum to Inspector \nGeneral Walpin. He demanded the inspector general resign or be \nterminated within 1 hour. At the time he delivered the ultimatum, no \nnotice had been given or provided to Congress as is legally required \nunder the Inspector General Reform Act.\n  The IG Act requires the President to tell Congress the reasons for \nremoval of an inspector general 30 days before taking action. That is \nwhat the law requires. Now, ironically, I cosponsored this provision \nwith Senator Obama before he became President Obama. The\n\n[[Page S8477]]\n\ngoal of that provision is to make sure Congress is aware of why an \ninspector general is being removed.\n  We need independent inspectors general. They should not be removed \nfor political reasons. So we need to make sure Congress is informed of \nthe reasons for getting rid of an inspector general. Mr. Eisen's 1-hour \nultimatum was an attempt to avoid that provision of law. If the \ninspector general had resigned under that pressure, Congress would not \nhave received any notice and the reasons for his removal would have \nremained a secret, but Inspector General Walpin did not resign, and the \nPresident began the process of removing him with a 30-day notice. At \nfirst the notice merely said he had lost confidence in the inspector \ngeneral. Senators from both political parties agreed that was too \nvague. So Mr. Eisen provided a second more detailed explanation. The \nsecond explanation said the inspector general had been ``confused and \ndisoriented'' at a board meeting on May 20, 2009. It essentially \nimplied that he might be senile.\n  So my staff met with Mr. Eisen to try to learn more. So here I give \nyou another reason for my hold on Mr. Eisen. During that interview with \nthe congressional staff on June 17, 2009, Mr. Eisen refused to answer \nat least 12 very direct questions. I wrote to the White House Counsel's \noffice immediately after the interview. I listed the 12 questions he \nrefused to answer and asked for written answers.\n  I never got a satisfactory reply. So I had to gather the facts \nindependently. So Mr. Eisen did provide some information during this \ninterview that very day in 2009. The problem is, the information turned \nout to be not true. Eisen tried to assure the staff that the firing was \nnot politically motivated. He claimed the agency's bipartisan board of \ndirectors unanimously supported the removal of Inspector General Walpin \nbefore the President decided to remove him. He also claimed the White \nHouse conducted ``an extensive review'' in response to concerns raised \nby the board about Walpin's fitness for that office. He said this \nreview was prompted by that incident at the May 20, 2009, board meeting \nwhere it appeared that the inspector general was disoriented.\n\n  When congressional investigators interviewed eyewitnesses, however, \ntheir accounts differed slightly. At a minimum, all agreed the \ninspector general lost his train of thought during the presentation. \nOthers described it as being a more serious episode.\n  The chairman of the board of directors suggested telling the White \nHouse about what happened. No one on the board objected. So he went and \nmet with Mr. Eisen in the White House Counsel's office.\n  Now, think about that, would you, please. If you think the inspector \ngeneral might be suffering from some mental incapacity or illness, why \nwould you run straight to the White House Counsel's office? It seems to \nme you would talk to his family or the people who worked with him every \nday about your concerns. That would be the only way to find out if \nthere had been similar incidents or if it was only a one-time \noccurrence.\n  Instead, the chairman of the board asked Mr. Eisen at the White House \nCounsel's office to look into it. According to Mr. Eisen, he conducted \n``an extensive review'' which then formed the basis for the President's \ndecision to remove Walpin from office. However, our investigation finds \nno evidence that Mr. Eisen's review consisted of anything more than \nsimply asking the CNCS management to describe their complaints about \nMr. Walpin. Unlike the congressional review, Mr. Eisen did not \ninterview each of the board members present at the May 20 meeting. He \nalso did not interview the other Office of Inspector General employee \nwho was present with Mr. Walpin during that board meeting where they \nsaid he was disoriented. Instead, Eisen merely collected from the \nagency details about various routine disagreements with the inspector \ngeneral.\n  Now, get this. None of the evidence the agency provided to the White \nHouse related to Mr. Walpin's mental capacity to serve, even though \nthat was the question that supposedly prompted the review in the first \nplace. Mr. Eisen accepted the agency's version of those disagreements \nwithout even giving the inspector general a chance to respond.\n  Obviously, any agency is going to have some clashes with an inspector \ngeneral, at least if that office operates as a truly independent and \naggressive watchdog. Mr. Eisen did not provide Mr. Walpin or anyone \nelse in the Office of Inspector General an opportunity to reply or give \ntheir side of the story. Mr. Eisen took action based upon incomplete \ninformation provided only by agency officials who had adversarial \nrelationships with that inspector general.\n  He told Congress the May 20 incident was the reason for removing the \ninspector general. But Mr. Eisen failed to give Inspector General \nWalpin or anyone close to him a chance to tell his side of the story. \nTo put it as simply as possible: That is just not fair.\n  On June 17, 2009, I wrote to White House counsel Gregory Craig \nlisting 12 specific direct questions that Eisen refused to answer that \nday. Question No. 4 was this: Which witnesses were interviewed in the \ncourse of Mr. Eisen's review?\n  This question followed a more general question about what Mr. Eisen \ndid in the course of his review. His answer to that prior more general \nquestion included the claim that he conducted witness interviews of the \nboard members. However, he refused to specify which witnesses or how \nmany witnesses he interviewed. Then he resorted to talking points \nrather than answering specific questions.\n  He replied along these lines: No. 1, we did an extensive review; No. \n2, I am not going to get into the details; and, No. 3, all of the board \nmembers agreed, including the Republican board members.\n  Mr. Eisen clearly led the staff to believe that the President's \ndecision was based in part on the unanimous agreement of the board that \nthe inspector general should go. That was false. The account of Eisen's \ninterview is based on memories of both House and Senate staff present \nat that time. Also present was a career law enforcement agent from the \nexecutive branch on temporary detail to my oversight and investigations \nstaff whose recollections confirm this account as well.\n  In short, Mr. Eisen's lack of candor and cooperation cannot be \nmistaken for a misunderstanding or a miscommunication. There was no \nmiscommunication. Attempts to remove an IG must be evaluated with \nstrict scrutiny. When administration officials are asked to provide \ninformation to Congress, I expect to rely on those officials to provide \nthe unvarnished truth. Evidence that a witness may have misled Congress \nis extremely serious.\n  Just last month, Mr. Eisen finally admitted his earlier statements \nwere not true. He sent me a letter, and I ask unanimous consent to have \nit printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                November 20, 2011.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: Thanks very much for meeting with \n     me. I know how busy you are and I very much appreciate you \n     and your staff taking the time to talk about my service as \n     Ambassador to the Czech Republic. I also appreciate the \n     opportunity to discuss your concerns about my interactions \n     with staff relating to the removal of Gerald Walpin as the \n     Inspector General of the Corporation for National Community \n     Service (CNCS).\n       With respect to the Walpin matter, you have asked me to \n     clarify certain steps that were taken by the Administration \n     prior to my June 10, 2009 phone call with Mr. Walpin about \n     the President's decision to remove him from office. On May \n     20, 2009, the Chair of the CNCS Board, Alan Solomont, \n     notified the White House that the Board had serious concerns \n     about Mr. Walpin's performance. I personally spoke with Mr. \n     Solomont and obtained his independent recollection of the \n     events of the May 20 Board meeting. To be clear, at that \n     time, CNCS Board Members did not express to the White House, \n     verbally or otherwise, unanimous support for the removal of \n     Mr. Walpin. I believe that, on or about June 8 or 9, 2009, \n     White House personnel also communicated with a Republican \n     Board member, Vice-Chair Goldsmith. I do not recall any other \n     conversations with Board members prior to the removal.\n       Thanks again for seeing me and for allowing me to convey my \n     apology in connection with my June 17, 2009 meeting with \n     Congressional staff. It is now my understanding that I \n     answered a few of the questions inaccurately, although at the \n     time I thought they were accurate. Of course, it was not my \n     intent to mislead staff in any way, but to the extent that I \n     was unclear in my responses, or that my declining to answer \n     questions created confusion, I regret it and I sincerely \n     apologize. I have tremendous respect for the role that you \n     and your staff have played in\n\n[[Page S8478]]\n\n     supporting the Inspector General community. I look forward to \n     working with you in the future on items of mutual interest.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                  Norman L. Eisen.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. He sent me a letter on November 20 admitting his \nanswers were ``inaccurate.'' He also acknowledged in a meeting with me \nthat the key factual findings in the staff report were correct. He said \nhe did not intentionally provide false information, and he has \napologized.\n  I am sure he sincerely regrets the way he handled the questions, \nespecially since it has led to the difficulty in his confirmation \nprocess and probably, if we had had that letter as we asked for late \nlast year, he would have been confirmed at that particular time.\n  Now after my meeting with him this year, I accepted his apology about \nthe false or ``inaccurate'' statements. I agreed to proceed to the \nnomination with a 60-vote margin required for confirmation. The \nmajority leader did not agree with that, so he decided to invoke \ncloture instead.\n  I will oppose cloture because I am still opposed to the nomination. \nMy opposition was always based on more than one or two false \nstatements. Lack of candor is broader than whether a particular \nstatement is technically true. It includes his failure to be \nforthcoming and responsive to those questions that were asked on June \n17, 2009. His evasiveness caused House and Senate staff to spend much \nmore time and resources uncovering the truth.\n  If he had just answered a few simple factual questions, that would \nnot have been necessary. For example, in relation to the 1-hour \nultimatum, he refused to answer specific questions about his June 10, \n2009, conversation with Mr. Walpin. He would only say that he disagreed \nwith certain aspects of Mr. Walpin's account without specifying which \naspects.\n  Word games and evasiveness of that sort are incompatible with being a \ncandid and forthcoming witness and ought to be incompatible with a \nperson representing the United States as an ambassador. My reasons for \nopposing his nomination also include all of the other circumstances \nsurrounding the way Mr. Eisen handled Mr. Walpin's removal.\n  Mr. Eisen's attempt to force the inspector general to resign with a \n1-hour ultimatum would have amounted to a constructive removal. It \nwould have evaded the congressional notice requirement if he had been \nsuccessful. However, Inspector General Walpin refused to resign and \neven filed lawsuits to try to keep his position. He did not win his \nlawsuit because ultimately the White House did comply with the \ntechnical requirements of the 30-day notice provision.\n  After the controversy erupted, the inspector general was placed on \nadministrative leave until 30 days after the second more detailed \nnotice to Congress.\n  That is why Walpin lost his lawsuit, but that does not change the \nnature and the fact that Norm Eisen attempted to evade the statute.\n  He tried to force a quiet resignation and thus remove the inspector \ngeneral from office without the 30-day notice to Congress the law \nrequires.\n  Because Inspector General Walpin did not yield to the pressure, no \ncourt had a chance to rule on whether that would be appropriate.\n  I am also opposed to this nomination because of the way the White \nHouse decided to avoid these issues last year with a recess \nappointment. Senate confirmation, under the advice and consent clause, \nis one of the strongest checks on executive branch power.\n  Recess appointments are meant to fill vacancies that arise during a \nlong recess, not to bypass the confirmation process. This vacancy arose \non January 20, 2009. Yet the President waited 18 months before making \nan appointment.\n  There had already been a lot of controversy over Mr. Eisen's actions \nat the time of his appointment. The White House should have known there \nwould be issues with his confirmation. Rather than listening to my \nconcerns, the White House decided to bypass Congress. President Obama \nrewarded Mr. Eisen by using a recess appointment to install him as \nActing U.S. Ambassador to the Czech Republic.\n  Mr. Eisen had several opportunities to address my concerns last year. \nHe was scheduled to meet with my staff on December 16, 2010, at 11:30 \na.m., and at approximately 11:15 a.m., the White House postponed the \nmeeting until 2:15 p.m. At approximately 2 p.m., the meeting was \ncanceled by the White House Office of Legislative Affairs without \nfurther explanation.\n  By calling off a face-to-face meeting in favor of a recess \nappointment, the White House sent the message that the President is not \ninterested in hearing the concerns of Republican Members of Congress.\n  Once he had his recess appointment, Mr. Eisen did not seek to meet \nwith me or my staff again until that appointment was about to expire at \nthe end of this year. Only then did he apologize and admit that the \nstatements in his staff interview were not accurate. Remember, our \nPresident, at the time of his inauguration, made a commitment to be the \nmost transparent of any administration in our history.\n  In summary, Mr. Eisen took action on behalf of the President that ran \nafoul of the Inspector General Reform Act. Mr. Eisen only listened to \nthe agency's complaints about the inspector general rather than \nconducting a fair, thorough, and responsible investigation, and then he \nmisled congressional investigators about his review and about the true \nbasis of the President's decision to fire the inspector general. He \nadmitted in this letter to me that he provided inaccurate information \nbut claimed it was unintentional.\n  This is the second time in the last 2 months an official from the \nObama administration has done that. The Deputy Attorney General just \nwithdrew a letter sent to me on Operation Fast and Furious earlier this \nyear because of its ``inaccuracies.''\n  I am afraid there is a pattern developing with this administration \nabout not leveling with Congress in its constitutional responsibility \nof oversight. When we ask for information from the executive branch, we \nexpect honest, forthcoming, and truthful answers. We can disagree on \npolicy; we are all entitled to our opinion, but we are not entitled to \nour own facts. Getting the facts straight should not be akin to pulling \nteeth. We need to send a signal that congressional oversight matters \nand there are consequences in misleading Congress.\n  It should come as no surprise to anybody that doing our \nconstitutional job of oversight is very important to this Senate. I \nknow Ambassador Eisen recognizes that. I got that very clearly from him \nin our last meeting in October.\n  I don't like interference by people in either a Republican or \nDemocratic administration who don't cooperate with my investigations, \nand I will bet every Senator will say that. Therefore, for the reasons \nI just gave, I ask my colleagues to oppose cloture and oppose this \nnomination.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of the time on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, momentarily, I am going to yield time to \nthe Senator from New Jersey.\n  Before I do that, I wish to say very quickly--and I am not going to \nmake all my comments right now--to my colleague from Iowa, first of \nall, I have great respect for his diligent approach to these issues. He \nhas been tremendously receptive to a continuing dialog. I express my \ngratitude to him for that. When asked, he met with Ambassador Eisen, \nand he certainly listened to the facts as they were presented by others \nwho have a different point of view.\n  Obviously, every Senator here always does draw their own conclusions. \nFirst, I thank Senator Grassley for his willingness to agree to have \nthese votes that we will have today and to move forward with some \nresolution with respect to this nomination.\n  I understand he has chosen to oppose the nominee. I simply say to \nhim, and I think to others, sometimes in these processes, sometimes in \nthe questions for the record, as we call them, where people submit \nwritten questions, and even in the interviews, there are \nmiscommunications, misinterpretations, and misstatements that are not \nintentional and not meant to somehow mislead or deceive somebody.\n  I simply say to the Senator that I know he has met with Ambassador \nEisen and we have now heard why he\n\n[[Page S8479]]\n\nintends to vote no. I am convinced several different individuals and \nentities have thoroughly investigated and examined the removal of \nInspector General Walpin, and they have found there was no wrongdoing. \nThe Foreign Relations Committee looked into it in conjunction with the \nconsideration of this nomination, and the Homeland Security Committee \nexamined this issue. It was, in fact, litigated in Federal district \ncourt and before the DC Circuit Court. None of these entities--not \none--found that either the President somehow acted wrongly or illegally \nor inappropriately in connection with the removal of Mr. Walpin from \nthe office.\n\n  To the contrary, the U.S. district court specifically rejected Mr. \nWalpin's claims that he was improperly removed from this position, and \nthey dismissed his lawsuit.\n  Our friends, Senator Lieberman and Senator Collins, both of whom \nenjoy strong reputations for integrity within the Senate, stated their \nbelief, as ranking and chair of the Homeland Security Committee, that \nthe President met the letter and spirit of the Inspector General Reform \nAct.\n  I do believe there was some miscommunication. I have talked to the \nSenator from Iowa about it. I think it was unfortunate, and I wish it \nhad been cleared up earlier. I believe it was genuinely a \nmiscommunication, not an intentional act, and I appreciate the fact \nthat Mr. Eisen has apologized to Senator Grassley for his sense of that \nmiscommunication--the difference between review and removal and a sense \nof what may have happened in the course of that.\n  I also appreciate Senator Grassley's willingness to look beyond that \nand to enforce his principles, as he is privileged to do as an \nindividual Senator, but also to allow the Senate to try to do its work \ntoday.\n  I will say a few words about Mr. Eisen and the job he is doing. He is \ndoing an outstanding job in Prague on our behalf.\n  First, the Senator from New Jersey is here to speak about a different \nnominee. I will yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for yielding. I \nhave come to the floor to address the nomination of an extraordinary \nwoman--a qualified, talented Latina--to be the U.S. Ambassador to El \nSalvador.\n  Unfortunately, some of my Republican colleagues have made Ambassador \nMari Carmen Aponte a target of inside-the-beltway politics, where the \npolitical points gained from bringing down an administration's nominee \nsupersedes the value gained from having a superior ambassador, \npromoting and guarding American interests at a critical time.\n  Born in Puerto Rico, Ambassador Aponte became the executive director \nof the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration in 2001. She has \nserved as a director at the National Council of LaRaza and the Puerto \nRican Legal Defense and Education Fund. She has presided over the \nHispanic Bar Association of the District of Columbia and the Hispanic \nNational Bar Association. She has excelled in her field, and she has \nwon the respect of her colleagues and the diplomatic community.\n  Let's look at the record. Nearly 2 years ago, I chaired the \nnomination hearing for Ambassador Aponte to serve as President Obama's \nAmbassador in San Salvador. At that time, one of my Republican \ncolleagues objected to her nomination because he was not given access \nto her FBI file to review information about a personal relationship \nAmbassador Aponte had with a Cuban national some 20 years ago.\n  Pursuant to precedent, one Democrat and one Republican reviewed that \nfile. I was the Democrat. There was nothing in the file to substantiate \nthe concerns raised by my colleagues.\n  On this issue, I take a backseat to no one when it comes to promoting \ndemocracy in Cuba and opposing the Castro regime or anybody who \nsympathizes with such a despotic regime. I certainly would never, for a \nmoment, let down my guard when it comes to that regime.\n  I can assure every colleague on both sides of the aisle that if I had \nany concern that Ambassador Aponte would let her guard down or had any \nquestionable relationship with a Cuban national or if there was any \nrelationship of the Castro regime in her background, I would not be \nsupporting her today.\n  This is a respected American diplomat who has been on the job and has \nserved this Nation with distinction. In the 15 months since Ambassador \nAponte was sworn in as U.S. Ambassador to El Salvador during a recess \nappointment, she has impressed the diplomatic establishment with her \nprofessionalism and won the respect of parties both right and left in \nEl Salvador. She has won the respect of civilian and military forces. \nShe has won the respect of the public and private sector. She has won \neveryone's support and fostered a strong U.S.-Salvadoran bilateral \nrelationship that culminated with President Obama announcing El \nSalvador as only one of four countries in the world, and the only \ncountry in Latin America, chosen to participate in the Partnership for \nGrowth Initiative.\n  Most important, Ambassador Aponte has been an advocate for American \nnational security and democratic values. As a result of her advocacy, \nEl Salvador is again a key ally in Central America, and its troops are \nthe only ones from a Latin American country fighting alongside American \ntroops in both Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Ambassador Aponte has consistently fought efforts by Cuba and \nVenezuela to gain influence in Central America. As a result of her \nnegotiating skills, the United States and El Salvador will open a new \njoint electronic monitoring center--jointly funded, by the way--that \nwill be an invaluable tool in fighting transnational crime.\n  This is a record of success. It is a record of honor. It is a record \nof diplomatic and political distinction. It is the record of a \ndedicated, qualified, experienced, and engaged American diplomat--a 15-\nmonth record that brought our nations together and pursued our \ninterests. What more could we ask? What more should we ask?\n  Having said that, because of my strong belief that Ambassador Aponte \nis fully and uniquely qualified for this post, during the last several \nmonths, I worked with the distinguished chairman, Senator Kerry, to \nfind a way--despite committee precedent--to allow an additional \nRepublican on the Foreign Relations Committee to review the \nAmbassador's FBI file. As a result, not one but two Republicans--my \ncolleague and friend from Florida, Mr. Rubio, and the Senator from \nSouth Carolina, Mr. DeMint--were able to review her file. Since the \nconcern had been not having access to the file, we presumed that once \nthey were reviewed, they would lift their objections and allow a vote \non her nomination. Why? Because there is nothing in that file that \nwould indicate otherwise. But we were wrong. It wasn't about the file. \nThat appeared to just be a delay tactic. The opposition to Ms. Aponte's \nnomination turned out to be about one thing and one thing only; that \nis, politics. Our good-faith effort to provide full access to \ninformation and address concerns about Ms. Aponte was summarily \ndismissed.\n\n  At her nomination hearing in November, Republican members of the \ncommittee raised a new concern--an editorial penned by Ambassador \nAponte on tolerance and nonviolence during Gay Pride Month in June. \nRepublicans decried it as disregarding Salvadoran culture and \nquestioned her motives for writing the editorial, despite the fact that \nthis editorial was the result of a cable edict to all embassies from \nthe State Department urging missions to write editorials during these \nevents.\n  The true irony of this trumped-up allegation is that the editorial, \nwhich Republicans assert ``stirred controversy and was rebuked \nthroughout Latin America,'' mirrored a May 2010 decree by Salvadoran \nPresident Funes prohibiting discrimination by the Government of El \nSalvador based on sexual orientation.\n  So let's be honest, there is no question about Ambassador Aponte's \nqualifications or performance on the job or about whether an editorial \non tolerance is grounds for sacking an ambassador. This is just another \nRepublican dog and pony show to undermine the President's policy \nobjectives and attack a qualified Democratic nominee to an essential \npost.\n  When the facts, when the files--when there was nothing that \ncorroborated\n\n[[Page S8480]]\n\nthe vicious allegations about Ms. Aponte's past, those on the other \nside argued that her editorial on the elimination of prejudice was the \nbasis for their opposition. When they learned that the Government of El \nSalvador itself supports this view, Republicans again changed their \ntune. Four weeks after her November 29 nomination hearing on the eve of \nthe Foreign Relations Committee business meeting, these Members decided \nthey wanted to attack from a different angle. They called for a new \nclassified hearing to vet her nomination, to permit questions to FBI \nand diplomatic security investigators about whether they had been \nsubjected to political interference for determining that Ambassador \nAponte was eligible for a security clearance.\n  I find it pretty appalling that Members of the Chamber would \nessentially suggest without evidence that professional FBI and \ndiplomatic security members would bend to political pressure or that \nany administration would apply such pressure, risking U.S. national \nsecurity, on behalf of any person. Those Members knew that the content \nand timing of their request would make it impossible to fulfill. To his \ncredit, the chairman of the committee, Senator Kerry, over the last \nseveral weeks has nonetheless sought to resolve the situation. In fact, \nthere has been an offer made to Senator DeMint to go over the whole \nessence of the background of the diplomatic security clearance.\n  The shifting basis of the opposition to Ambassador Aponte reveals, to \nme at least, that the motive for this operation is pure partisan \npolitics, driven by pure partisan interest, fueled by a pure partisan \ndesire to derail an administration nominee for the sake of derailment \nalone, without any regard for the consequences for American foreign \npolicy or for the Nation.\n  I have seen this Ambassador. She has succeeded beyond anybody's \nwildest expectations in a country that has dramatically turned the \ncourse of events in a way we want to see it. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport Ambassador Aponte's nomination. I urge them to put partisan \npolitics aside, recognize the benefits to America's security and \nforeign policy interests that her tenure has delivered, and allow \nAmbassador Aponte to continue serving our Nation.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I yield back to the chairman any \ntime I may not have consumed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition to \nthe nomination of Mari Carmen Aponte to be Ambassador to El Salvador. \nHer confirmation has been unanimously opposed twice by all Republicans \non the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and for good reason.\n  Before I discuss Ms. Aponte, I would like to clarify some facts about \nthe nomination process. Several Democrats have voiced complaints \nrecently about Senate Republicans' supposed obstruction when it comes \nto President Obama's nominees, but most of his nominees have not even \nbeen contested. In fact, since Obama became President, the Senate has \nconfirmed 1,198 of his nominees. Only a small fraction of these \nnominees have been so controversial that they have been blocked by the \nSenate.\n  As a Member of the Senate, I take the Senate's constitutional duty to \nprovide advice and consent to the President regarding his nominees \nseriously. While the overwhelming majority of nominees are easily \nconfirmed, some do rise to such a level that further debate and \nscrutiny are required by the Senate. Ms. Aponte is one of these \nnominees.\n  This is not the first time the Senate has considered confirming Ms. \nAponte for an ambassadorship. She was first nominated by former \nPresident Clinton in 1998 to be the Ambassador to the Dominican \nRepublic. At the time, Senator Jesse Helms, who was chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee, learned of possible background issues and \nconcerns by investigators relating to Ms. Aponte's ties to Cuban \nintelligence. Primarily, the question centered around the 12-year \nromantic relationship she had with a man who was targeted as part of an \nFBI counterintelligence investigation and allegedly worked for Cuba's \nspy agency. A high-ranking Cuban defector claimed that Cuban \nintelligence tried to recruit Ms. Aponte to be a spy for the Cuban \nGovernment. Rather than discuss her past relationship, Ms. Aponte \nwithdrew her nomination, and it was filled by someone else.\n  Eventually, Ms. Aponte was given a top security clearance by the \nState Department despite what some have described as serious objections \nfrom career officials.\n  When President Obama nominated Ms. Aponte in March of 2010 to be \nAmbassador to El Salvador, Republicans asked for more information to \naddress the allegations that had previously surfaced--namely, \ninformation about the scope of the 1998 investigation, including an \nupdate to that file; second, information about the Cuban defector who \nwas handled by the CIA who publicly alleged that Cuban intelligence had \nattempted to recruit Ms. Aponte through her longtime live-in boyfriend; \nand third, information about the FBI's counterintelligence \ninvestigation that led to Ms. Aponte's refusal to take a lie detector \ntest in 1994, as requested by the FBI. Serious questions, honest \nquestions.\n  Instead of allowing Senators to access that information and alleviate \nour concerns, President Obama went around the Senate and granted Ms. \nAponte a recess appointment in August of 2010. For nearly a year and a \nhalf, Republicans have been continually denied access to Ms. Aponte's \nfull FBI record and other information, as the Obama administration has \nrebuffed our requests related to Ms. Aponte's past.\n  Shortly after Ms. Aponte was first nominated by President Obama, I, \nalong with four other members of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee, wrote a letter to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton asking \nfor her assistance in obtaining this information. That same month, all \neight Republican members of the committee wrote to Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee chairman John Kerry stating that committee members \nhad not received requested information needed to fully vet the nominee.\n\n  Let me remind everyone that we never received that information. Ms. \nAponte was recess-appointed by the Obama administration later that \nsummer. We have continued our efforts to work with the administration \nto get access to this information. Chairman Kerry was able to convince \nthe White House to allow me to see a summary of the diplomatic security \nbackground investigation; however, that summary did not address the \nfundamental questions that have arisen, and that summary left me with \nmore questions than answers.\n  Committee Republicans wrote another letter to Chairman Kerry about \nour concerns last month. In the letter, we said:\n\n       We recognize the need to balance highly sensitive materials \n     during the confirmation process. However, we believe that in \n     this particular case, the scope of the background review was \n     not appropriately complete.\n\n  We went on to say:\n\n       The background summary that was provided was based on an \n     updated investigation, but it did not encompass numerous \n     allegations that the initial background investigation in 1998 \n     was tainted by political interference. News reports and other \n     sources alleged that Ms. Aponte received security clearance \n     despite objections from career officials due to outside \n     pressure. However, these allegations and the circumstances \n     surrounding them were not part of the current background \n     investigation. Without additional information, Senators have \n     no way of determining the validity of media stories and \n     rumors that have been circulating about this nominee's past.\n\n  We also asked for a closed hearing due to these lingering issues. We \nwrote:\n\n       We believe that the circumstances warrant additional \n     committee review in the form of a closed hearing. A closed \n     hearing would allow Senators to review and discuss the \n     classified and sensitive data relevant to the nomination and \n     discuss the unresolved issues with investigators and relevant \n     intelligence community officials. As the issue involved both \n     a high-ranking Cuban defector and FBI counterintelligence \n     investigations, a closed hearing would be the most beneficial \n     format available to the committee to rectify the deficiency \n     of information provided.\n\n  Senator Kerry declined to hold a closed briefing and wrote a letter \nback stating:\n\n       In my view the process we have followed with regard to Ms. \n     Aponte's nomination has afforded committee members ample time \n     and opportunity to consider her nomination and secure answers \n     to any relevant questions.\n\n  He also said:\n\n\n[[Page S8481]]\n\n\n       We should all be in a position now to debate Ms. Aponte's \n     nomination on its merits.\n\n  Senator Kerry then offered to work with my office further to get \nanswers from the administration. I believe he did work in good faith \nwith our office, but in the end the White House once again denied our \nrequests for information.\n  While I would agree with Senator Kerry that there has been ample time \nspent on Ms. Aponte's nomination, we still lack critical information. \nThe Senate cannot in good faith confirm a nominee who has repeatedly \nrefused to answer simple necessary questions related to her past.\n  In addition to questions about her past, Ms. Aponte's current \njudgment is also in question. In her recess-appointed capacity as \nAmbassador to El Salvador, Ms. Aponte has inflamed tensions in the very \ncountry where she should be improving diplomatic relations. Her \ndecision to publish an opinion piece hostile to the culture of El \nSalvadorans presents even more doubts about her fitness for the job. \nThis op-ed upset a large number of community and pro-life groups in El \nSalvador who were insulted by Ms. Aponte's rhetoric.\n  A coalition of more than three dozen groups has since written the \nSenate asking its Members to oppose Ms. Aponte's confirmation. I quote \nfrom their letter, in which they wrote:\n\n       We respectfully request that Ms. Aponte be removed from \n     post as soon as possible so that El Salvador may enjoy the \n     benefits of having a person as a government representative of \n     your noble country.\n\n  Meanwhile, Republicans on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee are \nstill trying to get access to information about Ms. Aponte's past. Two \ndays ago, the White House again denied Senators the right to be briefed \nor review information relevant to this nomination.\n  Senators should not be forced to vote on a nominee without a complete \nunderstanding of her background. I urge you to join us in voting \nagainst cloture.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of the Republican time. How \nmuch time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten seconds.\n  Mr. DeMINT. That is pretty good timing.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield back.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend from Massachusetts, and I rise, Mr. \nPresident, to speak in support of the nomination of Norm Eisen to be \nAmbassador to the Czech Republic.\n  I know Norm in a very personal capacity, so I feel very strongly \nabout this nomination. Since I was fortunate to be elected to the \nSenate and came to Washington in the late 1980s, I joined a synagogue \nin Georgetown, and Norm Eisen and his wife and children are members of \nthat synagogue, so I have gotten to know them in a totally \nnonpolitical, nondiplomatic way. Based on that, I start with a real \nappreciation of this fine, honorable, public-spirited man.\n  He happened to have gone to law school with President Obama. I think \nas a result of that the President knew him and asked him to be the \nethics counsel in the White House in the first years of the \nadministration. I think anybody you talk to, or most anybody you talk \nto, about his performance in that job would say he did an excellent \njob. He was demanding ethically and intellectually. His honor and his \nquest to have the government and those who serve in government act in \nan honorable way is very high.\n  When there was a vacancy in the position of Ambassador to the Czech \nRepublic, President Obama asked Norm Eisen if he would serve. And the \nPresident did something that really had a lot of meaning to it. Apart \nfrom Norman's quite considerable resume as a private attorney, being \nsuccessful and highly regarded and very effective, Norm Eisen is the \nchild of survivors of the Holocaust. His mother was actually born in \nthe Czech Republic. So what a remarkable moment for President Obama to \nask him to return to the country from which his family was essentially \nchased--and some worse--in the position as Ambassador of the greatest \ncountry in the world, the superpower of the United States of America.\n  We now have a record of his performance in that position. There was a \nproblem with the nomination before, raised by Senator Grassley at that \ntime, and so he was a recess appointment. But now he has been there, \nand he has done an extraordinary job. I know from conversations with \npeople in Prague that he is very highly regarded by the leadership of \nthe Czech Republic. An extraordinary, bipartisan group of foreign \npolicy experts has also endorsed his confirmation.\n  It would actually be extremely disruptive if we did not confirm Norm \nEisen in terms of our relations--diplomatic, economic, security \nrelations--with the Czech Republic, which are so important.\n  So I think if you were considering this nomination and put the \nvarious arguments on the scales of justice, on one side you have a \nrecord of public service, of honor, of great family values, of \nintellectual excellence, of belief in public service, of a great record \nnow in the time he has been in Prague as our Ambassador. On the other \nside, you have a question about how Norman, while he was in the White \nHouse as ethics counsel, handled the case of this one individual \ninspector general at the Corporation for National and Community \nService.\n  I have been over this in great detail. In our Governmental Affairs \npart of the Homeland Securities Committee, we oversee the IGs. Senator \nCollins and I have gone over this. And with respect to Senator \nGrassley, who has been very thorough and fair about this and is \nprobably the leading protector and defender of the IGs in the Senate, \nin the matter that bothers him, there was a misunderstanding. There was \nnot, in my opinion, after looking at this very thoroughly, an \nintentional act of deceit. There was a misunderstanding, and Ambassador \nEisen has now apologized for that misunderstanding of stating \nunintentionally an inaccuracy.\n  So on one side of the scales of justice, you have all these \nextraordinary positives and on the other a question raised about this \none case he handled, which Senator Grassley and others working for him \nsay was deceitful. Ambassador Eisen says it was a misunderstanding, for \nwhich he apologizes.\n  To me, it is not only in the interest of the United States but also \nin the interest of fairness and justice--with which we like to believe \nwe conduct our proceedings here--that the Senate today cross party \nlines and confirm the nomination of Norm Eisen to be Ambassador to the \nCzech Republic.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I stand in support of Norman L. Eisen's \nappointment to be Ambassador to the Czech Republic. It is with great \nconfidence in Ambassador Eisen's skill, qualifications, and record that \nI support this appointment. Ambassador Eisen will greatly advance U.S.-\nCzech relations and directly benefit American diplomatic and business \ninterests, possibly helping to create 9,000 jobs in the Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania and elsewhere in America.\n  Ambassador Eisen was first nominated to be Ambassador to the Czech \nRepublic on June 29, 2010. He was given a recess appointment on \nDecember 29, 2010 and has served with distinction as Ambassador in \nPrague since that time.\n  Ambassador Eisen is highly qualified and suited for this post. He \nspeaks Czech, knows and respects Czech culture, and understands the \ncountry's history in a deeply personal way. His mother was born in the \nformer Czechoslovakia and survived Auschwitz. The State Department \nnotes that the Ambassador resides in the former Nazi General Staff \nHeadquarters, where he and his family now celebrate the Sabbath in the \nsame room where Nazis dined 70 years ago ``a powerful Czech-American \nmessage about the triumph of good.''\n  Accompanying his strong multicultural qualifications is Ambassador \nEisen's quintessentially American personal history. He was the first in \nhis family to graduate from high school, college, and law school--all \nwith honors. He had a long and successful practice as a private \nattorney at a major D.C. law firm; founded a government watchdog group, \nand served in the White House for two years--2009-10--as Special \nAssistant and Special Counsel to the President. This history prepared\n\n[[Page S8482]]\n\nNorm Eisen to be a successful ambassador representing American \ninterests, culture, and values abroad.\n  Ambassador Eisen's track record as Ambassador to the Czech Republic \nspeaks for itself. Since assuming his post, Ambassador Eisen has \nensured the U.S. can look to the Czech Republic as a partner troop-\ncontributing nation in Afghanistan, opponent of human rights violations \nby Iran, and an ally in the European Union and at the United Nations on \nimportant issues such as Israel.\n  Due to Ambassador Eisen's efforts, the defense relationship between \nthe U.S. and the Czech Republic is at an historic high point. He has \nbeen an eloquent advocate in urging Prague to retain the 600 soldiers \nit has sent to Afghanistan, making it one of our most supportive NATO \nallies. The National Review notes that during Ambassador Eisen's \ntenure, ``defense ties with the Czech Republic have broadened and \ndeepened.''\n  Energy and technology developments have also strengthened the \nrelationship between our two nations during Ambassador Eisen's tenure. \nHe assisted the Czech government to develop a Center for Civilian \nNuclear Safety in Prague that would build on efforts to ensure the \nsafety of radiological materials. Of special importance to \nPennsylvanians, Ambassador Eisen has worked in support of \nWestinghouse's efforts to provide civilian nuclear reactors in the \nCzech Republic. Westinghouse employs over 6,000 Western Pennsylvanians \nand over 9,000 Americans in other areas of the country.\n  A successful Westinghouse bid in the Czech Republic would create an \nestimated 9,000 direct and indirect high-paying U.S. jobs over the next \n5 years. These jobs will be not only in western Pennsylvania, but also \nin States employing hundreds of high-tech nuclear energy industry \nworkers, such as Connecticut, Minnesota, New Hampshire, South Carolina, \nand Utah.\n  The American Chamber of Commerce has noted that Ambassador Eisen's \n``presence in the country has been and will be essential to our common \nefforts to advance the interests of U.S. business'' and has \n``invigorated our community and . . . expanded their export \npossibilities, which should add much needed jobs in the U.S. \nmanufacturing sector.''\n  In addition to defense, energy, and business developments, Ambassador \nEisen has championed causes important to both Americans and Czechs. \nHaving founded a watchdog group and worked on ethics and government \nreform in the White House, Ambassador Eisen is strongly qualified to \nhelp the Czech Republic address corruption. He helped launch the first \never ``World Forum on Governance'' in Prague, at which 100 Czech, U.S., \nand international anti-corruption champions met to develop innovative \nnew solutions. The head of Transparency International in the Czech \nRepublic has said that ``Ambassador Eisen's efforts have contributed to \nprogress in fighting corruption and his continued presence in Prague is \nvital to help maintain that trend.''\n  Ambassador Eisen has earned the respect and trust of Czech leaders \nand senior officials. In the words of Defense Minister Alexandr Vondra, \nwho formerly served as the Czech Ambassador to the U.S.: ``Norm Eisen \nis one of the most energetic, optimistic ambassadors I have ever seen. \nThe bilateral U.S.-Czech relationship needs him.''\n  It is clear that Norm Eisen has excelled at the duties entrusted to \nhim as the U.S. Ambassador to the Czech Republic, and I fully support \nhis appointment.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Senator. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nNew Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I rise also to speak in support of the confirmation of \nNorm Eisen to be U.S. Ambassador to the Czech Republic.\n  In the year since his recess appointment to this position by \nPresident Obama, Ambassador Eisen has proven to be a strong advocate \nfor the United States. He has brought a renewed focus to our defense \nrelations with the Czech Republic, resulting in an expansion of our \nbilateral and NATO military cooperation, and the Czech Republic has \nincreased its troop contribution in Afghanistan and strongly supported \ninternational efforts on Iran and the U.S. policy on Israel with the EU \nand the United Nations during his tenure.\n  As Chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European \nAffairs, I had the privilege of chairing both of Ambassador Eisen's \nnomination hearings. Throughout the nomination process, he has \ndemonstrated a strong understanding of the complexities of our \nrelationship with the Czech Republic, a drive to fully represent \nAmerican interests and values, and a special humility in having the \nopportunity to represent the United States.\n  I would hope that all of our colleagues in the Senate this evening \nwill join us in supporting Norm Eisen to be the Ambassador to the Czech \nRepublic.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Hampshire very \nmuch. I know she cut her time a little bit because we are getting \ntoward the end of these comments with respect to the nominees and to \nthe vote.\n  Likewise, I haven't said anything about either nominee, and I want to \nsay a couple words about each, if I can, and I want to specifically \nanswer a couple points made by the Senator from South Carolina with \nrespect to Mari Aponte.\n  First, with respect to Norm Eisen. He has been an extraordinarily \neffective Ambassador for the United States in terms of our relationship \nwith the Czech Republic and he has, by everybody's measure, deepened \nthat partnership on key national security interests, and he has been a \nkey supporter of American economic interests.\n  He has aggressively backed the Westinghouse Company's pursuit of a \n$27 billion contract to construct civilian nuclear reactors in the \nCzech Republic, and that would mean thousands of jobs here in the \nUnited States. The Chamber of Commerce has called him one of the most \neffective ambassadors to hold this post. He has assisted the Czech \nGovernment with its plans to develop a center for nuclear safety in \nPrague, and he has been an eloquent advocate of urging Prague to retain \nthe 600 soldiers they have sent from the Czech Republic to Afghanistan, \nmaking it one of our most supportive NATO allies. He has supported the \nCzech Government's efforts to pool defense resources with neighbors, \nand he has supported and enhanced the Czech efforts to establish a NATO \nCenter of Excellence for helicopters.\n  Finally, he has enthusiastically supported the Czech leadership's \nefforts to promote the stabilization and democratization of six states \nbetween the EU and Russia--Ukraine, Georgia, Belarus, Armenia, Moldova, \nand Azerbaijan.\n  I think that in every respect Ambassador Eisen has earned the respect \nof the Senate. He understands the culture of the Czech Republic. He \nspeaks the language, which is a critical asset for our ambassadors in \nany country in any part of world. And as was mentioned by the Senator \nfrom Connecticut, he is the son of a Holocaust survivor from the former \nCzechoslovakia and, believe me, he understands the history of that part \nof the world and that country in a very personal way.\n  I might also comment that the country's leaders trust him. National \nReview this week said that his efforts have been publicly recognized by \ninnumerable Czech officials, including the leading transatlanticists: \nPrime Minister Petr Necas, Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, and \nDefense Minister Sasha Vondra.\n  I hope our colleagues today will recognize that he is exactly the \nright person we need in Prague at this time.\n  Now let me speak, if I may, to Ambassador Aponte.\n  I would hate to see the Senate take this good person and make her a \npart of the political back and forth that has consumed this city and to \ndeny her the right to the full appointment as ambassador, given the \noutstanding job she has done in that capacity.\n  Let's talk about the accomplishments, rather than talk about \nsomething from 1990 that, frankly, has been vetted several times not \njust by the committees in her appointments but by the professionals in \nthe national security establishment of the United States who have three \ntimes--not once but three times--given her national security clearances \nat the highest level.\n  It seems to me we should recognize that she has done a spectacular \njob of\n\n[[Page S8483]]\n\nnegotiating an agreement with the Salvadoran Government to open a new \njointly funded electronic monitoring center to fight transnational \ncrime. She has helped secure the deployment of Salvadoran troops to \nAfghanistan--the only country in South America and Latin America to be \ndoing so, and I think that is no small accomplishment. It is clear she \nhas gained the respect of the Salvadoran Government.\n  The Foreign Relations Committee has received many letters in support \nof her nomination, including one signed by eight former foreign \nministers and 18 members of the Salvadoran Congress.\n  We heard the Senator from South Carolina a few moments ago say that \nhe wanted somehow to get additional information. I think the Senator \nfrom South Carolina knows I have bent over backward to try to help \nprovide that information.\n  The first time she was nominated, two members of our committee were \npermitted to look at the FBI report, and we designated Senator Menendez \nand Senator Barrasso. They looked at it, and there was nothing in it \nthat struck either of them as restraining people from being able to \nvote for her.\n  Then she was a recess appointment, because Senator DeMint at that \ntime objected to the nomination. And subsequently, with this nomination \nnow, we were again appointing two people to see the FBI record. On this \noccasion we bent the rules, and both Senator Rubio and Senator DeMint \nwere allowed to look at the FBI record.\n\n  Subsequent to that we went through a process of trying to schedule \nthe nomination. Senator Lugar and I had agreed we would try to do so. \nSo Senator DeMint reviewed the background file on November 3; Senator \nRubio reviewed it on November 7. Her nomination hearing was held on \nNovember 8, and her nomination was put on the agenda for the November \n15 committee business meeting. The day of that business meeting--not \nbefore it--the day of the meeting, I received a request that her \nnomination be held over until the next business meeting. I honored that \nrequest and, indeed, we held it over. That same day I sent a letter to \nthe members of the Foreign Relations Committee saying that the next \nbusiness meeting would be rescheduled for 2 weeks later, which was the \nTuesday after Thanksgiving, November 29.\n  Then late in the Thanksgiving recess, I received a letter asking that \nit be deferred indefinitely. The stated reason was to permit the \ncommittee to hold a closed-door hearing in which we could examine \nwhether the FBI properly conducted its investigation relating to Ms. \nAponte--not for her nomination now, not for her nomination a few months \nago or last year, but looking into what the FBI did or didn't do in the \n1990s.\n  I understand that everybody is busy. We all have a lot to do around \nhere. But to wait until the 11th hour to ask for a hearing of that sort \nis, frankly, puzzling. And carrying out an investigation of the FBI is \nno small matter. To suggest that on the several occasions she has \nreceived a top secret clearance somehow the FBI or the CIA or some \nother entity in our intelligence community bent under political \npressure is insulting to them. And believe me, if that were true, we \nwould have been reading about it on the front pages of the Washington \nPost or New York Times or all the papers a long time ago.\n  Let me recap. The background file was reviewed on November 3. No \nrequest for a closed hearing. Not during the November 8 nomination \nhearing was there a request for a closed hearing. Not in the written \nrequest on November 15 for a holdover was there a request for a closed \nhearing. And even after the Foreign Relations Committee voted out this \nnomination, I bent over backward to try to help Senator DeMint be able \nto get the answers to his questions, and the White House said they \nwould make available to him a briefing at the time of his choosing. \nThat request was never responded to.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter from \nthe White House Director of Legislative Affairs.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 9, 2011.\n     Hon. John F. Kerry,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Kerry: I write to update you on our efforts \n     to provide background information to members of the Senate \n     Foreign Relations Committee in connection with their review \n     of the nomination of Mari Carmen Aponte to be Ambassador to \n     El Salvador. Ms. Aponte was originally nominated for this \n     post in December 2009, and later recess appointed in August \n     2010. She was re-nominated to this position in February 2011.\n       Before detailing our most recent efforts to provide \n     information to the Committee, we believe it is useful to \n     describe our standard practice in this area and detail the \n     substantial steps that have been taken to date. As you know, \n     it has been the practice, for many years and through previous \n     administrations, to balance between protecting highly \n     sensitive materials and accommodating a legitimate need to \n     access relevant information about pending nominees. In this \n     case, we have pushed that balance far in the direction of \n     disclosure to several Committee members.\n       It is the standard practice of the White House to make \n     background investigations of nominees before your Committee \n     available, upon request, for review by the Chair and Ranking \n     Member, or their designees, only. Former Counsel to the \n     President, Robert F. Bauer, explained the basis for this \n     longstanding practice in a March 17, 2010 letter to Senator \n     and Committee Ranking Member Lugar, ``[o]ver many years and \n     multiple Administrations, this policy has successfully struck \n     the appropriate balance between protecting the \n     confidentiality of highly sensitive materials and \n     accommodating the Senate's legitimate need to access relevant \n     information about pending nominees.''\n       In 2010, when Ms. Aponte's nomination was first under \n     consideration, both you and Senator Lugar designated other \n     members of the Committee--Senators Menendez and Barrasso--to \n     review Ms. Aponte's background investigation in advance of \n     her confirmation hearing. The White House provided those \n     briefings in March 2010. At that time, Senator DeMint made \n     his first request to be briefed on the background \n     investigation despite standard practice limiting that review \n     to only two members of the Committee. Accordingly, Mr. Bauer \n     denied the request.\n       Earlier this year, as the Committee considered Ms. Aponte's \n     nomination for the second time, the Committee made the \n     unusual request to have the background investigations made \n     available for re-inspection. The White House in good faith \n     accommodated this request. Senator Lugar designated his \n     review to Senator Rubio, and you allowed Senator Menendez to \n     designate your review to Senator DeMint. The White House \n     provided the briefing to Senator DeMint on November 3, and to \n     Senator Rubio on November 7. Despite this briefing, during \n     the November 29 Committee Business Meeting, Senator DeMint \n     stated that he still had questions regarding Ms. Aponte's \n     background investigation. In a further display of good faith, \n     you committed to working with the Administration to address \n     Senator DeMint's concerns.\n       To this end, the White House has worked in close \n     coordination with the State Department to arrange an \n     additional briefing for Senator DeMint. The proposed briefing \n     would have been conducted by Under Secretary Pat Kennedy, \n     Assistant Secretary of Diplomatic Security Eric Boswell, and \n     Donald Reid, who is Senior Coordinator for Security \n     Infrastructure at the Bureau of Diplomatic Security. These \n     three career State Department officials share the ultimate \n     responsibility for conducting background investigations of \n     candidates for Ambassadorial positions and issuing security \n     clearances for such officials. Senator DeMint has to date \n     declined this proposed briefing.\n       We are confident that the extraordinary steps that we have \n     taken in this case have afforded Committee members the \n     ability to thoroughly evaluate Ms. Aponte's nomination. Yet \n     every accommodation has been met with a new demand. We are \n     not prepared to make further briefings beyond what has \n     already occurred and been offered. We appreciate your \n     continued work on the timely consideration and confirmation \n     of Administration nominees. Please let me know if I can \n     provide additional information.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                          Robert L. Nabors II,\n\n                                    Assistant to the President and\n                    Director of the Office of Legislative Affairs.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, fair is fair around here. I do not think \nthis nominee ought to be the victim of a prolonged delay process. She \nhas done the job well. She deserves to be sent back. I hope colleagues \nwill not filibuster her nomination today.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There will now be 2 minutes of debate prior to \nthe next vote.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, Mari Carmen Aponte is an excellently \nqualified Latina who is being politically discriminated against despite \na record of accomplishment for the United States in El Salvador, which \nis universally recognized as extraordinary, from getting Salvadoran \ntroops to fight alongside us--the only Latin American country to do \nso--to creating a new monitoring center to fight transnational crime. \nTo suggest that the FBI and diplomatic security would give her not one \nbut two top secret clearances that were not merited is the ultimate \ninsult to those agencies. It is simply wrong to use alleged nameless, \nfaceless accusers to falsely impugn her reputation.\n  I urge my colleagues to allow an up-or-down vote on her nomination \nand to vote for cloture so we can get to that vote to let this \nqualified Latina continue to work on behalf of the United States and El \nSalvador as she has successfully done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, all of us regret when there is a situation \nwhere one of us has to oppose a nomination of a President, and 1,198 \nnominations have gone through without being contested. But this is one \nthat rises to the level of concern.\n  Republicans have been asking questions about this nominee for \nmonths--in fact, much longer than that--going back to why she refused \nto take a lie detector test, why she withdrew her name when she was \nfirst nominated for ambassador under Clinton, and why the files have \nnot been properly updated. We have asked the White House for private \nmeetings with the FBI and CIA to give us updated knowledge of what \nhappened in this circumstance so we can make a good decision. But there \nwas never an offer to do that. We had offers of low-level folks to come \ntalk only to me, not to Republicans on the committee. But there are \nenough questions here for honest answers, and we have not gotten them.\n  I encourage my colleagues to vote against this nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KERRY. Do we have any time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No time remains.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Under the previous order, pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays \nbefore the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will \nstate.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of Rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close the debate on the nomination \n     of Mari Carmen Aponte, of the District of Columbia, to be \n     Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the United \n     States of America to the Republic of El Salvador.\n         Harry Reid, John F.

Mr. President, I come to the floor to discuss and \npass the Risk-Based Security Screening for Members of the Armed Forces \nAct.\n  How many times have you been at an airport screening line, you are \ngetting ready to go through the machines that are going to determine \nyou are safe to travel and standing right there in the line is a man or \nwoman in their military fighting gear--their camouflage and their \ncombat boots--and they are having to take off their combat boots, many \ntimes in their 2-week R period between their stints in Afghanistan or \nIraq, and you think: Oh, my gosh. It is unbelievable that our military \npeople--who are putting their lives on the line, who are sacrificing so \nmuch--are having to go through a procedure that does not have a \ncommonsense feel about it.\n  Last week, Senator Rockefeller, Senator Burr, and I introduced S. \n1954, the Risk-Based Security Screening for Members of the Armed Forces \nAct. The bill was a modification of the House companion bill that was \nrecently passed by Representative Cravaack from Minnesota in a \nunanimous decision by the House.\n  It requires the TSA, the Transportation Security Agency, to create a \nsystem to speed members of our uniformed services through airport \nsecurity.\n  I would also like to thank Senators Lieberman and Collins for their \ninput on this piece of legislation. We have all worked hard to move \nthis bill through quickly, and it is the House bill we will be taking \nup very shortly with the modifications I have mentioned.\n  The bill establishes a timeline for the Transportation Security \nAdministration and the Department of Defense together to develop and \nimplement a program to establish expedited security screening \nprocedures for military personnel and their families.\n  I think we can all agree our military men and women make sacrifices \nfor our Nation every day. The least we can do is try to make their \nlives a little easier when they travel around the country they defend.\n  I think they have earned the right to at least go to the head of the \nline or have some kind of trusted passenger status.\n  Our Armed Forces are comprised of over 1.4 million brave men and \nwomen. They are stationed at more than 6,000 military bases worldwide. \nFor all the hardships they endure, I think they deserve to be at the \nfront of the line in some kind of procedure that expedites their \nsecurity clearance.\n  Airports, airlines, and TSA recognize this issue, and they want to \nreduce the delays. Currently, TSA uses the same screening protocols for \nall passengers.\n  The TSA has indicated that it would like to improve the process and \nto move forward to risk-based screening procedures. They certainly have \nmy support and I know that of many Members, if not an overwhelming \nmajority in Congress, to do that.\n  Mr. Pistole, the head of the Transportation Security Administration, \nhas testified before our Commerce Committee about the risk-based \nscreening procedures they are trying to put in place that will give \nthem a better opportunity to target people who are more at risk or more \nunder suspicion, while letting frequent flyers and people in the \nmilitary go through on an expedited basis.\n  I would say the first identifiable group to get risk-based screening \nprocesses should be those who are fighting this war, those with boots \non the ground. Members of our military and their families traveling on \norders and in uniform should benefit from these new rules. In a time of \nlimited resources, the establishment of procedures to expedite the \nscreening of a pool of travelers who are most certainly our trusted \ntravelers would better allow the TSA to focus their attention on areas \nof real threats.\n  Earlier this year, the House passed Congressman Cravaack's bill \nunanimously, just a couple of weeks ago. I hope our quick and unanimous \naction will allow the House to quickly reconsider the modified measure \nand get the bill signed into law as soon as possible.\n  As we are going into this traveling season--we have been through \nThanksgiving, and we are now approaching Christmas. The bill is not \ngoing to be implemented by this season. They cannot do it in 2 weeks. \nBut surely by the next holiday season, our trusted travelers, the \nmembers of our military and their families, will be able to have this \nexpedited procedure. I hope that as they are traveling in this year's \nrush through the processes to get home to their loved ones, they will \nknow we are working on something that will make their lives easier and \nexpedite their travels while they are home on leave from fighting the \nwar that is protecting our freedoms and our way of life.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Commerce \nbe discharged from further consideration of H.R. 1801 and the Senate \nproceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1801) to amend title 49, United States Code, \n     to provide for expedited security screenings for members of \n     the Armed Forces.\n\n  Without objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment at the desk be agreed to, and I urge passage of the bill, as \namended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1458), in the nature of a substitute, was agreed \nto, as follows:\n\n                (Purpose: In the nature of a substitute)\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, 10 years ago this month--10 years \nago actually tomorrow, I believe--the People's Republic of China \nofficially joined the World Trade Organization. American businesses, we \nwere told, would gain new access to Chinese markets through the removal \nof trade barriers, through increased transparency, through more \nstringent protection of intellectual property rights.\n  China promised to follow the rule of law, to reform its legal system, \nand, in turn, would gain new access to global markets. At the time of \njoining the World Trade Organization, China made a number of promises. \nChinese leaders pledged to reduce trade barriers and open markets. They \npromised to increase transparency, protect intellectual property \nrights, and reform their legal system.\n  Supporters of the People's Republic of China, including a strong \nmajority, unfortunately, of Members of this body and a much thinner \nmajority in the House of Representatives--other supporters of the \nPeople's Republic of China were most of America's, almost all of \nAmerica's largest corporate CEOs--argued that the WTO membership would \nbring human rights and freedom and the rule of law to China.\n  Now 10 years later we see a very different picture, a picture of a \nnumber of Members of the House in those days and some Members of the \nSenate and some opponents to allowing China into the World Trade \nOrganization. We have seen something very different. American workers \nhave seen millions of jobs shipped to China. Factories in places such \nas Youngstown and Charleston and Huntington and Dayton have moved to \nWuhan and Shenzhen and Shanghai, with final products sold back to the \nUnited States.\n  Think about this. The business plan of a number of American \ncorporations is to shut down production in Mansfield, OH, and in \nZanesville, OH, and move that production to Beijing, China, set up \ncompanies there, and ship products back to the United States. To my \nknowledge, never in history has there been a country where such a huge \nnumber of companies have set up that business plan. Think about that--\nshut down production in the country where you are located, lay off \nworkers who have made you a successful company, hurt a community by \nclosing down that plant, doing terrible damage to the schools, to the \npolice departments, to the city services and all of that, and move your \nproduction to another country because you can work there more cheaply \nand sell products back to the United States. To my knowledge--and I \ncould be mistaken about this, but nobody has ever shown me otherwise--\nto my knowledge, never in world history has that been the business plan \nfor so many companies.\n  American manufacturers that stay here have been undermined by a flood \nof cheap Chinese imports priced artificially low.\n  When a large corporation moves to China, so often that corporation's \nsupply chain--the tool and die shop, tool and die maker, a machine \nshop--a small manufacturer that makes components and that sells to the \nlarger company does not have the wherewithal to follow it to China, so \nthey lose one of their biggest customers.\n  Those American manufacturers that stay here have been undermined by a \nflood of cheap Chinese imports priced artificially low. Some of those \nChinese imports came from American companies that moved overseas to \nChina.\n  Chinese citizens so often face poor work conditions, continual human \nrights violations. The country's sole Nobel Peace Prize winner is \nlanguishing in prison.\n  The big winners? The big winners are the multinational corporations \nhere that have outsourced jobs, and the other big winner is the Chinese \nCommunist Government and the apparatchiks they have enriched. Think \nabout that. The big winners in this China trade policy are large \nAmerican corporations that have outsourced jobs to China and the \nChinese Communist Party, which apparently seems to be their allies in \nthis, and the people in the Chinese Communist Party, the high-ranking \napparatchiks.\n  So while American companies that stay here and American workers are \nfollowing World Trade Organization rules intended to provide a common \nset of laws to ensure a level playing field for global trade, the \nChinese are gaming the system. It is clear that China does not live up \nto its promises, does not live up to the unrealistic expectations of \nits supporters.\n  Far from becoming freer, the Chinese people are burdened with limited \nrights to basic freedoms of speech, religion, and assembly. I can't \ncount the number of CEOs whom I saw walk the Halls--I was in the House \nof Representatives--of Congress and say: You know, if we pass PNTR, we \nare going to see freedom, all of this capitalism in China. All of these \njobs in China are going to bring freedom--freedom of speech, freedom of \nreligion, freedom of assembly in China.\n  No, it has enriched the country of China, to be sure. It has \nespecially enriched the Communist Party, enriched the People's \nLiberation Army, enriched some of the capitalists in China in this \nCommunist Party system. And it is getting worse. From the harsh \ncrackdown on human rights lawyers and activists after the Arab Spring \nin the Middle East, to the brutal policies in Tibet that have led to a \nrecent wave of self-immolations--imagine the depth of\n\n[[Page S8487]]\n\nfeeling and passion and hopelessness and anger at an oppressive \ngovernment that people who have such strong feelings would actually set \nthemselves on fire in protest. From the crackdown on human rights \nlawyers, to the brutal policies in Tibet, the Chinese Community Party \nshows no sign of easing its grip on the Chinese people. Not only did \ntheir membership--their joining the WTO--not bring freedom and \ndemocracy to China, it did not bring fair trade either.\n  China has flouted WTO rules. China has gamed the system to its \nadvantage. While China has chosen to comply with some WTO rules, \noverall the list of China's WTO violations is a long one: rampant \nintellectual property theft, massive subsidies for China's exports, \nhoarding of rare earths and other raw materials. China has refused to \ncommit to the WTO's Agreement on Government Procurement.\n  I have stood here, as you have seen, Mr. President, in your time in \nthe Senate, arguing for ``Made in America'' language so that when \ntaxpayer dollars are spent buying products, those products should be \nmade in America, paid for by U.S. taxpayers. I have heard conservative \nWashington politicians defending China, for all intents and purposes, \nsaying: No, that would create a trade war, even though China will not \nsign on to an agreement on government procurement, which is exactly \nwhat their ``Made in China'' policy is all about. These violations not \nonly show China's lack of respect for the rule of law, they also cost \nAmerican jobs, and they also tend to stymie our economic growth.\n  American intellectual property-intensive firms alone have lost some \n$50 billion to intellectual property rights violations. Those same \nfirms are reporting that better intellectual property enforcement could \nlead to almost 1 million new jobs. Some of the worst hit companies are \nin my State, struggling to compete against a country that manipulates \nits currency and subsidizes its manufacturers.\n  Given our companies' well-founded fear of retaliation by Chinese \nregulators and companies if they speak up, we in government must give \nvoice to their concerns. Let me explore that for a minute.\n  When we have launched--typically a labor union in the United States \nwill launch a petition for a trade complaint, if you will, alleging \nviolations by China of trade rules. Often the American company where \nthese workers work is unwilling to join that petition. Why? Because \nthey do business in China, and they know China will, in some cases, \nexact some kind of revenge against them. So our companies are not \nwilling to stand up to the Chinese because they know what the Chinese \nwill do when they are doing business in China. So it is up to us, as \nthese companies' representatives, as these workers' representatives, as \nthese community representatives, to stand up.\n  Probably the most damaging of China's violations is its continual \nmanipulation of its currency. By deliberately holding down the value of \nits currency to boost exports, China is not only violating WTO \ncommitments, they have built the largest trading surplus in history to \nthe detriment of other leading trading partners.\n  The Senate fought back this fall by passing the Currency Exchange \nRate Oversight Reform Act. I authored this legislation with a \nbipartisan group of Senators--Senator Snowe from Maine, a Republican; \nSenator Schumer from New York, a Democrat; Senator Graham of South \nCarolina, a Republican; Senator Sessions of Alabama, a Republican; \nSenator Stabenow of Michigan, a Democrat; Senator Casey of \nPennsylvania, a Democrat, and several others. This bill is the largest \nbipartisan bill that passed the Senate this year. It passed with 63 \nvotes--joined, in fact, by the junior Senator from my State. Senator \nPortman, former Trade Representative in the Bush administration, voted \nfor this bill. This bill would crack down on China currency \nmanipulation and provide an opportunity for Republicans and Democrats \nto come together to put American jobs and American workers first.\n  They said it represented the largest bipartisan jobs bill passed this \nsession of Congress.\n  Currency manipulation provides an unfair subsidy to Chinese exports--\nof up to 40 percent, according to most economists. Almost all \neconomists agree it is at least 25 percent. C. Fred Bergsten, an \neconomist with the Peterson Institute for International Economics, who \nis fairly conservative, has asserted that China's intervention in \ncurrency markets and other subsidies they have provided makes up the \nmost protectionist policy of any major country since World War II.\n  American politicians and CEOs are always afraid of standing up to the \nChinese. They say we will look protectionist or that it looks as though \nwe are starting a trade war. When Fred Bergsten, a mainstream \neconomist, says that what China does is the most protectionist policy \nof any country since World War II, it is time we stood up and forced \nthem to play fair. That is not a trade war. That comes from China. They \nhave been waging a trade war against the United States for 10 years. \nThat is why we have seen our budget deficit grow from double figures a \ndecade ago to more than a half billion dollars a day, day in and day \nout, 7 days a week.\n  Additionally, American manufacturers seeking to sell products to \nChina--our Nation's fastest growing export market--are hit with the \nsame percentage in what amounts to an unfair tariff. If a company in \nBrunswick, OH, wants to sell products in China, they are hit with a 25-\npercent or larger currency tax and currency tariff. So the product \ncosts 25 percent more, at least. When a Chinese company wants to sell a \nproduct in Brunswick, competing with that company, they get a 25-\npercent bonus or advantage. That is hardly a way to practice fair \ntrade.\n  A report released this fall estimates that our trade deficit with \nChina, exacerbated by Chinese currency manipulation, has caused the \nloss of more than 2.8 million American jobs in the past 10 years--with \ntwo-thirds of the lost jobs in the manufacturing industry. The \nPresiding Officer, when he goes to Altoona, Bethlehem, or if he comes \nto Dayton or Toledo, sees the kind of damage this trade policy has done \nto American manufacturing. All of our problems in manufacturing are not \nbecause of our relationship with China and because they have gamed the \nsystem, but millions of jobs here have been lost and undermined because \nof China's gaming the system.\n  The first President Bush said a billion dollar trade deficit or \nsurplus is equivalent to 13,000 jobs. So when we have a greater than \n$200 billion persistent year-in and year-out trade deficit with China, \nthat means we sell $200 billion worth of fewer goods to them than they \nsell to us. Do the math. It is 13,000 jobs per billion dollar budget \ndeficit.\n  Addressing currency manipulation through the trade remedies included \nin our bill, cosponsored by Senators Graham, Snowe, Schumer, Sessions, \nHagan, Casey, and others, would provide immediate relief to American \njob creators. A report released earlier this year showed that \naddressing currency manipulation would support the creation and \nretention of more than 2 million American jobs, without requiring any \ngovernment spending. That is why this is such an important jobs bill, \nbecause it is not spending any taxpayer dollars, it is just saying \nlevel the playing field for our companies and our workers dealing with \nChina.\n  After years of China gaining benefits of WTO membership without \nadhering to its rules--and they promised they would under the rule of \nlaw 10 years ago this week when they joined the WTO--after years of \nthem getting membership and getting the benefits of WTO membership, \nwithout agreeing to its rules, it is time for Congress and the \nadministration to act in our Nation's interest. The Congress should \npass a bill and the President should sign the bill.\n  American workers and American manufacturers can compete with anyone. \nBut they cannot compete on a playing field that is far from level as \nlong as we continue to let China do what it wants without \nrepercussions.\n  Over the last 10 years, China has sought to sidestep and reshape the \nWTO to benefit China at our expense. That is not competing, that is \ncheating. We must act while we still have a chance.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S8488]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/12/senate-section/article/S8488-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8488]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n            RECOGNIZING NATIONAL NURSES WEEK MAY 6-12, 2011\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN.

JERRY LOLLEY\n\n Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, today I recognize \nthe public service of a veterans service officer from South Dakota who \nis retiring after nearly 40 years of dedicated military and public \nservice to veterans and their families.\n  Jerry Lolley has served as Meade County veterans service officer \nsince 1992. Jerry's wife Harriet, known as ``Granny,'' and children \nGrant and Lara have always supported Jerry while he has provided \ntireless service to thousands of veterans seeking assistance with \nbenefit claims, medals requests, records searches, payment issues, and \nhealth care issues. He has always been a valuable source of needed \ninformation for the families of veterans as well.\n  Military service and an understanding of the needs and issues of our \nmilitary service personnel and veterans is deeply rooted with Jerry. \nAfter spending 2 years at South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, \nhe served in the U.S. Air Force from 1968 to 1988 and retired as an E-\n7, providing dedicated service as an aircraft mechanic. His father \nserved in General Patton's Army in World War II.\n  But Jerry's service extends also to the numerous issues impacting \nveterans and their families. He has been a constant advocate for \nveterans on Federal, State, and local issues of importance. He monitors \nFederal legislative issues and has shared valuable insight with me and \nmy staff regarding potential impacts of legislation or VA agency \ndecisions. He has always put the veteran first and foremost in his \nefforts, especially when it comes to improving health care resources, \naccess, and level of care for veterans. He has also provided valuable \ninsight on educational, spousal, dependent, and burial benefits.\n  During the Persian Gulf war, Operation Enduring Freedom, and \nOperation Iraqi Freedom, Jerry has been diligent in providing returning \nsoldiers with important information about deadlines involving access to \nhealth care services, assisting soldiers with applications for various \nbenefits, and providing general information to assist in their return \nhome.\n  My staff and I have always valued Jerry's advocacy for veterans. He \nis rarely short on opinions on important matters and is quick to offer \nwell-targeted questions toward agency officials to learn the basis for \ndecisions and actions on various issues and even takes great care to \nrequest background information to verify or dispel the occasional rumor \nor misconception that may surface within the veterans community. His \nsteadfast dedication to veterans has made him a great public servant \nand his service will be greatly missed.\n  I wish Jerry and his family all the best in his retirement, and it is \nmy hope that he can find other options to continue serving veterans in \nthe future. I congratulate him on his military service and his great \npublic service career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/12/senate-section/article/S8488-5", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8488-S8489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECOGNIZING CONCORDIA PUBLISHING HOUSE\n\n Mrs. McCASKILL.

A bill to prevent, deter, and eliminate illegal, unreported, \nand unregulated fishing through port State measures; to the Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Pirate \nFishing Elimination Act, a bill to implement the international \nAgreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter, and Eliminate \nIllegal, Unreported and Unregulated, IUU, Fishing as adopted by the \nUnited Nations Food and Agriculture Organization in November of 2009. \nThe agreement is the first binding global instrument focused \nspecifically on combating IUU, also known as pirate fishing, and the \nUnited States was a primary participant in its negotiation and was one \nof its first signatories.\n  Pirate fishing is a global problem that threatens healthy ocean \necosystems and sustainable fisheries both here and abroad. It is \nestimated that annual lost revenues from pirate fishing activities may \nbe as much as $23 billion worldwide and that as much as 40 percent of \nthe total catch for some fish stocks is caught illegally. The impacts \nof these activities are felt throughout the fishery supply chain, from \nthe fisherman through the consumer, and affect food security and socio-\neconomic stability in many parts of the world. This includes the United \nStates where our own sustainable domestic fisheries may be undermined \nthrough unfair competition with illegally caught international product.\n  The Pirate Fishing Elimination Act, and the underlying international \nagreement, would combat this threat by establishing an inspection \nregime that would raise global standards for access to seafood markets \nto levels similar to those that we set here in the U.S. It would also \nexplicitly prohibit known pirate fishing vessels from entering our \nports and from introducing their tainted goods to our healthy seafood \nsupply chain. As the world's third largest seafood importer, our \nactions can make a real difference by dramatically increasing the risks \nand costs associated with pirate fishing. I urge my colleagues to join \nme in supporting this crucial legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/12/senate-section/article/S8491-2", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1458.
