Mr. President, I trust that the Acting President pro \ntempore and all of our staff, everyone in this great Capitol complex, \nhad a safe and happy holiday. I hope everyone is well rested because we \nhave a difficult work period ahead of us. We have much to do over the \nnext few weeks with the Hanukkah and Christmas holiday quickly looming \nahead.\n  This week we need to finish the work on the Defense authorization \nbill and even more. This month we will also handle a number of \nnominations and extend unemployment insurance for Americans still \nstruggling to find work during these difficult times, and we have more \nappropriations work to do.\n  The continuing resolution to fund the government expires on December \n16. We must not neglect the responsibility to continue our work to put\n\n[[Page S7884]]\n\nAmericans back to work. So we will take up additional pieces of \nPresident Obama's American Jobs Act.\n  This week we will introduce legislation that would give the economy a \nboost by putting money back in the pockets of middle-class workers and \nsmall businesses by extending and expanding the popular payroll tax \ncut. More than 120 million families took home an extra $120 billion \nthis year thanks to this payroll tax cut we championed. The average \nfamily held on to more than $935 of their hard-earned dollars this \nyear. We need to assure those families they can rely on that tax cut \nnext year as well. This legislation does more than just protect the tax \ncuts Americans already count on; it deepens and expands that tax relief \nas well.\n  Next year, 120 million American families will keep an average of \n$1,500 because of this legislation. That means they will have more \nmoney to spend on essentials such as gas and food and buy things that \nwill help spur economic growth in their communities.\n  Businesses will also benefit from this tax cut. Ninety-eight percent \nof American businesses will see their payroll taxes cut in half on \ntheir first $5 million of wages that they pay.\n  In Nevada, 50,000 businesses will benefit from this tax cut and many \nbusinesses will save tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars. So \nthis legislation will help families and businesses while spurring \nhiring and giving the economy a boost. It will be fully paid for with \nthe small 3.25-percent surtax on income over $1 million. So a person \nwho makes $1 million a year won't pay an extra penny. Someone who makes \n$1.1 million--that is an extra $100,000--will pay $3,250 more than they \nwould have originally.\n  At a time when many working families are still struggling, we cannot \nafford not to extend and expand this important payroll tax cut. So I \nwas disappointed to hear from some of my Republican colleagues, \nspecifically the junior Senator from Arizona, who have already come out \nin opposition to this tax cut. I think it is fair to say that all \nRepublicans have not, but my friend from Arizona did. This is wrong.\n  Those who loudly claim to care about keeping taxes low, too often it \nseems they only care about keeping taxes low for the richest of the \nrich. The same Republicans who today oppose a payroll tax cut for \nhundreds of millions of businesses and families last week jettisoned \nthe hopes of a large-scale deficit reduction deal in the supercommittee \nbecause they insisted on massive, permanent tax giveaways for the rich. \nCutting taxes for the middle-class families and businesses should be an \narea where Republicans and Democrats can find common ground, as we have \nin the past.\n  The opposition by Republicans is because this tax cut has President \nObama's fingerprints on it. It was his idea. Republicans will not \nsupport it even though they know it is good policy for American \nfamilies and businesses. Let's hope that is not the case for all of my \nfriends.\n\n  Let's examine the effects of their purely political opposition to a \ncommonsense tax cut. If Republicans block passage of this legislation, \nthey will take money out of the pockets of American families. That is \nclear. For a family making $50,000 a year, this proposal we talked \nabout would not only preserve an existing $935 tax break, it would put \nan additional $565 a year in the family coffers. If the Republicans get \ntheir way, that family will actually see its tax increase by $1,000.\n  If Republicans block this legislation, 120 million American families \nand 98 percent of American businesses will not get the tax cut next \nyear. Instead, 120 million families and millions of businesses will be \nhit with a tax increase. Those numbers are startling. They are \nshocking. But the potential impact on the larger economy is downright \nscary.\n  Economist Mark Zandi of Moody's said the economy will likely plunge \nback into a full-blown recession--erasing the economic progress we have \nmade--if we don't extend that cut.\n  It is clear neither our fragile middle class nor our fragile economic \nrecovery can afford the kind of setback a failure to extend and expand \nthese would bring. Republicans say we cannot afford to raise these \ntaxes. If they choose to oppose this payroll tax cut, we will know what \nthey meant to say was: We cannot afford to raise taxes on the rich. In \nfact, more clearly, we cannot afford to raise taxes on the rich, but we \nare happy to raise taxes on the middle class.\n  Mr. President, please announce the business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/28/senate-section/article/S7884-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7884-S7898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2012\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Republican \nleader be recognized to offer his statement as if during leader time, \nthat there be no parliamentary efforts on his behalf at this time, and \nthat when he finishes his leader statement, I have the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                            WORKING TOGETHER\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, first I wish to welcome everybody back. \nI hope everyone had a nice Thanksgiving.\n  Shortly before we all left last week, we got some disappointing news \nwhen the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction announced it was \nunable to reach the kind of bipartisan agreement many of us had been \nhoping for. As I said then, this was a major disappointment to those of \nus who had hoped the joint committee would ultimately agree to the \nkinds of serious entitlement reforms and job-creating tax reforms that \nall of us know would have been a big help in getting our fiscal house \nin order and in jolting this economy back to life. Such an agreement \nwould have also sent a clear message to the American people and to the \nworld that despite our many differences, lawmakers here are capable of \ncoming together and making the kinds of very tough decisions about our \nNation's economic future that continue to elude lawmakers in Europe.\n  I know for a fact that Republicans wanted this committee to deliver, \nand the good news is that we will still see $1.2 trillion in deficit \nreduction. But, frankly, it is hard to escape the conclusion that some \nin the White House and even some Democrats here in the Senate were \nrooting for failure and doing what they could to ensure that failure \noccurred. I mean, what else are we supposed to think when the \nDemocrats' top political strategist here in the Senate goes on national \ntelevision and predicts failure 2 weeks ahead of the deadline and then \ncomes right out and says--yesterday--that he thinks the outcome he \npredicted is good politically for the President? This stuff isn't \nrocket science, but it is a big mistake. It might seem like a good \npolitical strategy to some, but it is bad for the country.\n  That is why I am continuing my call today for the Democrats who \ncontrol the Senate to work with us on jobs legislation that can \nactually pass here in the Senate and that can get us beyond the \npermanent campaign by actually getting something done by working \ntogether. For the past several weeks, I have implored the Democratic \nmajority here in the Senate to work with us on a number of job-creating \nbills that have already attracted strong bipartisan support over in the \nHouse. It seems to me that if the two parties share control of power in \nWashington, we should spend our time and our energies identifying job-\ncreating measures the two parties do agree on and make them law.\n  It is no secret that many people at the White House and a number of \nDemocrats here in the Senate would still rather spend their time \ndesigning legislation to fail in the hopes of trying to frame up next \nyear's election. But with all due respect to the political strategists \nover at the White House, I think most Americans would rather we took an \nentirely different approach. That is why I think we should put aside \nthe massive stimulus bills along with the permanent tax hikes Democrats \nare calling for in order to pay for them. In fact, I think it is safe \nto say that any attempt to pass another temporary stimulus funded by a \npermanent tax hike on the very people we are counting on to create the \nprivate sector jobs we need in this country is purely political and not \nintended to do a thing to\n\n[[Page S7887]]\n\nhelp the economy since we already know it is likely to fail with \nbipartisan opposition.\n  Let's focus instead on the kinds of targeted bipartisan bills the \nPresident quietly agreed to last month: the 3-percent withholding bill, \nchampioned by Senator Scott Brown, and the veterans hiring bill. As I \nhave pointed out again and again, the House has been busy all year \npassing bipartisan jobs bills just like these that we can rally around \nin a sign of unity and common concern for the millions of Americans who \nare looking for jobs. There is no reason we shouldn't focus on passing \nthese bills rather than using the Senate floor as the stage for \nsymbolic show votes that we know won't lead to anything except more \ntension and political acrimony. We should do what we were sent here to \ndo, and that means more bill signings and fewer bus tours.\n  At the moment, the Senate business is the Defense authorization bill, \nand there is a lot of work that needs to be done. We have a lot of \namendments pending on this important legislation. Members on both sides \nwould like to see these amendments taken up and voted on. So let's stay \non this legislation and focus on doing it right. Let's show we can \nactually legislate around here. Once we are finished, I am hoping we \nwill be able to find a bipartisan path to resolve the other issues \nbefore us before the end of the year.\n  Americans are growing tired of the same old political shouting \nmatches and political brinkmanship that has marked this Democratic-led \nSenate over the past few years. They are tired of careening from one \ncrisis to another, holding their breath in the hopes that the two \nparties will put their differences aside and work something out at the \neleventh hour, only to be disappointed when Democrats decide they would \nprefer to have a political issue to run on rather than solutions to \nvote on.\n  At last count, House Republicans had passed 22 jobs bills which were \ndesigned not only to incentivize the private sector to create jobs but \nwhich were also designed to attract strong bipartisan support. In other \nwords, they have been designing legislation to actually pass. They have \nbeen legislating with an eye toward making a difference instead of \nsimply making a point. What I am saying is let's follow their lead. \nLet's come together and pass more bipartisan jobs bills and show the \nAmerican people we are not going to settle for the easy way out. The \neconomic crisis we face is much too serious for more of the same.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate be in a period of \ndebate only on the DOD authorization bill until 5 p.m. today.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I see that Senator Webb is on the floor. I \nknow he is going to be making some remarks in a few moments. I would \nurge other colleagues of ours to do the same. We are in a period now \nwhere debate is in order on any of the amendments, whether they are \npending or not pending or whether they have been filed and not been \nmade pending. This is an opportunity which is going to end, hopefully, \non Wednesday morning when we vote cloture.\n  We must get this bill passed. It is critically important to our men \nand women in uniform. They deserve to have a defense authorization bill \npassed. So I would urge colleagues who have amendments they have filed \nto come to the floor this afternoon to debate their amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I rise as the chairman of the Subcommittee \non Personnel of the Armed Services Committee to speak on our bill. I \nwould like to begin my comments on this national defense authorization \nby saying what a privilege and an honor it has been to work with \nChairman Levin and Senator McCain.\n  I say this as someone who spent 4 years as a committee counsel in \nanother era and then another 5 years in the Pentagon, 4 of them as \nAssistant Secretary of Defense, and Secretary of the Navy working with \nthe Congress, and finally as a Member of the Senate. I believe Chairman \nLevin is the epitome of what a chairman, a full committee chairman of \nthe Senate should be.\n  I have known Senator McCain for many years. As one would expect, we \nhave not agreed on some political issues. But I have also enormous \nregard for Senator McCain as well. I would like to also thank members \nof the Personnel Subcommittee, especially the ranking member, Senator \nGraham, for the work they have done in preparing this legislation. I \nwould also like to thank our staff: Gary Leeling, John Clark, and Brie \nFahrer for all of the hard work they have done in order to bring this \nbill forward.\n  Members of the Personnel Subcommittee, as well as our colleagues on \nthe full committee, have worked together in a collaborative way to \nimprove the quality of life of our men and women in uniform and of \ntheir families. Senator Graham and I share the goal of doing everything \nwe can to address the needs of our active duty, National Guard, and \nReserve members, DOD civilian personnel, and their family members. They \nhave answered every call and met every mission asked of them with \nselfless service.\n  The Personnel Subcommittee provisions in this bill are a result of a \nbipartisan team effort. The bill includes many provisions important to \nthe quality of life for our service members and their families. I would \nlike to highlight just a few:\n  The bill authorizes $174.6 billion for military personnel and health \ncare, $5.1 billion more than what Congress authorized last year, and \n$480 million under the President's budget request;\n  the bill authorizes an across-the-board military pay raise of 1.6 \npercent, which matches the annual increase in the Economic Cost Index. \nI understand that all of America is suffering in these economic times, \nand the Federal workforce is currently under a pay freeze. However, \nthis pay raise for our service members reflects their unique conditions \nof service and special sacrifices on behalf of the Nation during the \nprolonged combat operations of the past 10 years;\n  the bill reauthorizes more than 30 types of bonuses and special pays \naimed at encouraging recruiting and retention of the highest caliber \nindividual;\n  the bill authorizes fiscal year 2012 active-duty end strength of \n562,000 for the Army; 325,700 for the Navy; 202,100 for the Marine \nCorps; and 332,800 for the Air Force;\n  the bill authorizes a total of $30 million for supplemental impact \naid, including $25 million for heavily impacted schools, and $5 million \nfor schools with military children with severe disabilities;\n  the bill authorizes service secretaries to mobilize Reserve component \nunits and personnel for preplanned and budgeted missions to enhance the \nuse of the operational Reserve;\n  the bill requires the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs, to develop a comprehensive policy on the \nretention of and access to evidence and records relating to sexual \nassaults involving service members;\n  the bill prohibits the denial of reenlistment of a service member who \nhas been determined by a Physical Evaluation Board, PEB, to be fit for \nduty but who is subsequently determined to be unsuitable for continued \nmilitary service for conditions considered by the PEB;\n  the bill also includes important provisions that will help the \nDepartment achieve cost savings and realize efficiencies in its \nmilitary personnel and health care accounts, including:\n  reducing the overall active-duty end strength by almost 10,000, and \nauthorizing force management tools to facilitate further force \nreductions planned over the next several years;\n  consolidating and reforming the existing statutory framework related \nto travel and transportation allowances for services members, their \nfamilies, and other authorized travelers to achieve efficiencies and \nsavings in the travel area;\n  requiring hostile fire pay and imminent danger pay be prorated based \non the number of days spent in a qualifying area; and\n  requiring that beneficiaries newly enrolled in the Uniformed Services \nFamily Health Plan transition to TRICARE for Life when they become \neligible for Medicare, the same as all other military retirees.\n\n[[Page S7888]]\n\n  Finally, I wish to highlight what I consider to be the moral contract \nwe have with the men and women of the military who volunteer to wear \nthe cloth of our Nation in military service.\n  While the department properly insists on providing the highest \nquality health care, an imperative reflected in the provisions of this \nbill, we are also mindful of sharply rising health costs. As the \nSecretary of Defense testified earlier this year, there has been a \nnearly three-fold increase, 276.3 percent, in Defense health care costs \nover the last decade, from $19 billion in 2001 to $52.5 billion in the \nPresident's budget request this year.\n  A number of factors have driven this increase, including several \nimportant enhancements to the TRICARE program and other initiatives \nspecifically focused on meeting the medical and health-care needs of a \nforce that has been subjected to the unrelenting strain of 10 years of \ncombat operations.\n  It is important to note, however, that such cost increases are not \nunique to the Department of Defense. Similar cost growth has also \noccurred in civilian health care programs during the same period. \nAccording to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, total U.S. \nhealth expenditures from 2000 to 2009 have increased by 181 percent, \nfrom $1.37 trillion in 2000 to $2.48 trillion in 2009.\n  My colleagues on the subcommittee and full committee considered this \nissue very carefully during our mark-up of this bill. I believe we have \nstruck a reasonable and appropriate balance. This bill does not \nprohibit the pharmacy copayment changes, for example, or TRICARE Prime \nenrollment fees proposed by the administration, but it does limit \nannual increases in the Prime enrollment fee to the cost of living \nincrease in retired pay, beginning in fiscal year 2013.\n  Looking ahead, I believe the Department of Defense can reduce its \nhealth care costs in a number of ways, including more efficient \noperations. Those options should be explored carefully before \ncontemplating major changes to today's program for the sake of so-\ncalled budget efficiencies if we are to maintain our moral contract \nwith our service members.\n  I know that many of my colleagues plan to offer a number of \namendments to this bill, and I look forward to working with them to \nmake this bill even better.\n  Congress has passed a defense authorization bill for 49 consecutive \nyears. I urge my colleagues to make it 50 and pass this important \nlegislation as quickly as possible.\n  I point out that we have done the best job we can do in terms of \nbringing a bill to the floor that will take care of the needs of the \nmen and women who serve in our military and the national security needs \nof our Nation. I know we are going to go into a period pretty soon \nwhere we are going to be going through the defense budget as well as \nthe other areas of the expenditures of this country.\n  I just hope people will keep in mind, as we start making comparisons \nwith military service versus civilian service, that military service is \nunique in this country in more ways than sometimes we recognize. I \nremember when I first came to the Senate hearing the report of the \nDole-Shalala Commission on Military Compensation. There was a great \ndeal of comparison with respect to how they develop compensation \nanalysis in the civilian sector.\n  Something we have to remember when we look at the areas of the U.S. \nmilitary, particularly on the manpower personnel side, is a person \ncannot pick their job. Many people come in because they want to spend a \nportion of their lives serving their country. They cannot decide, if \nthey do not like who they are working for, that they want to leave. \nThey cannot quit their job. They cannot decide they do not want to be \ntransferred if they are being sent to a place they do not want to go. \nBy the way, they might get shot at, blown up, or killed.\n  This is a unique environment. We tend to forget this when budget cuts \ncome or when the hostilities fade away, that we have an obligation to \nbe the lifetime stewards of the people who have stepped forward and put \nthemselves on the line on behalf of our country.\n  There are provisions in this authorization bill that relate \nparticularly to our basing system in Asia. I have spent a good part of \nmy life working on these issues. I would like to say right at the \noutset that I strongly advocate a strategy-driven review of all of our \nbases around the world. I think we need to do a zero sum analysis based \non our strategy as to which bases we should keep in operation and which \nones perhaps we should not. But there is a unique situation that exists \nat the moment in terms of the vital interests we have as the key \nbalancing force in Asia, and we have been working on this.\n  We have developed--the chairman, Senator McCain, and myself have \nworked very hard to develop language in this legislation that would \ncall for an independent review of the basing proposals that have been \non the table in Korea and Okinawa and Guam. Particularly, with the \nsituation on Okinawa, this has become an issue that is larger than \nsimply American military bases in Japan. The inability of our two \ngovernments to have come up with a workable solution to the basing \nsystem on Okinawa has created one of the most difficult domestic \npolitical situations inside Japan today. This has been going on for 15 \nyears. There have been 15 years of uncertainty. We need to move forward \nin a timely manner. It cannot be kicked down the road any longer.\n  We have a formula inside this authorization bill which will allow \nindependent eyes to come in and do an analysis of where these bases \nneed to go, sort of a step away from the turf protection one often sees \namong the military services inside the Pentagon. There is also going to \nbe considered, possibly as early as later today, an amendment that will \nallow the Chief of the National Guard Bureau to become a full member of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n  I oppose this amendment. I am going to take some time to explain \nthis. I realize this is a moving train. I think we have 70 cosponsors \non this amendment. But I have offered a second-degree amendment which \nwould basically say let's take a timeout. Let's get another look. Let's \nlook at the potential implications of putting the Chief of the National \nGuard Bureau as a full member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n  I say this as someone who has, as all of us, a tremendous regard for \nwhat the National Guard has been doing not only over the past 10 years \nbut through the course of our entire history. One tends to forget, \nbecause of the lack of the use of the National Guard during the Vietnam \nwar, that our history has been marked by instances of the National \nGuard stepping forward to serve during war. They were the preponderance \nof our military forces in World War I and World War II once \nmobilization was declared. They sent 100,000 people into Korea.\n  Again, I say this as someone who spent 3 years as the principal \nadviser to the Secretary of Defense and Guard and Reserve programs when \nCap Weinberger was Secretary of Defense. I was the First Assistant \nSecretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs.\n  The National Guard is a unique composite. To put the Chief of the \nNational Guard Bureau as a full member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in \nmy view and in the view of all of the Joint Chiefs and the Secretary of \nDefense, would be confusing. In the words of Secretary Panetta, it \n``would not improve upon this advisory function or advance the \nstatutory purpose, rather it would introduce inconsistencies among the \nJCS members and potentially negatively affect the formulation of an \nintegrated joint force by fostering the impression that the National \nGuard is a separate service.''\n  All of the Joint Chiefs agree on this position. In fact, the hearing \nwe had on this issue was the only hearing in modern memory where all of \nthe Joint Chiefs showed up to state their views.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters from the Joint Chiefs, from the \nSecretary of Defense, and from two of the three Service Secretaries be \nprinted in the Record stating that opposition.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         The Secretary of Defense,\n\n\n                                             Defense Pentagon,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 15, 2011.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your request for the \n     Department's views on S.\n\n[[Page S7889]]\n\n     1025, the ``National Guard Empowerment and State-National \n     Defense Integration Act of 2011.'' I share the view of the \n     many supporters of this bill that our citizen soldiers and \n     airmen play a critical role both at home and abroad. Although \n     I support further strengthening our National Guard, I do not \n     agree with the approach taken by this bill to accomplish that \n     laudable goal.\n       Section 2 of the bill grants the Chief of the National \n     Guard Bureau membership on the Joint Chiefs of Staff. I \n     oppose this change. The Chief of the National Guard Bureau \n     currently serves as a valuable advisor to me on the National \n     Guard's non-federalized homeland defense mission and to the \n     Secretaries and Chiefs of Staff of the Army and Air Force on \n     all National Guard activities. Making the Chief of the \n     National Guard Bureau a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff \n     (JCS) would not improve upon this advisory function or \n     advance the statutory purpose of the JCS. Rather, it would \n     introduce inconsistencies among the JCS members and \n     potentially negatively affect the formation of an integrated \n     Joint Force by fostering the impression that the National \n     Guard is a separate service.\n       There are some aspects of the bill that the Department does \n     support. In an effort to further improve the National Guard \n     Bureau's effectiveness, for example, the Department would \n     support establishing a Vice Chief of the National Guard \n     Bureau, to serve in the grade of lieutenant general.\n       The Department has prepared a detailed letter outlining \n     additional concerns with the legislation which is being sent \n     to you separately.\n           Sincerely,\n     Leon E. Panetta.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                       Department of the Army,\n\n                                  Washington DC, November 7, 2011.\n     Hon. Jim Webb,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Personnel, Committee on Armed \n         Services, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your November 2, 2011 \n     letter requesting our views on the ``National Guard \n     Empowerment and State--National Defense Integration Act of \n     2011.'' We oppose including the Chief of the National Guard \n     Bureau as a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n       Our Army is the strength of the Nation because of its \n     unity, versatility, and depth as the Total Army. It is \n     absolutely vital that we maintain One Army in today's \n     uncertain and complex strategic environment. We learned this \n     lesson in the aftermath of the Vietnam War, and together with \n     the All-Volunteer Force, the Total Army continues to serve \n     our Nation extremely well during challenging times. With this \n     context, coupled with 35 years of lessons, we have several \n     reasons for opposing the CNGB as a member of the JCS.\n       First, representing only two (Army National Guard and Air \n     Force National Guard) of seven Reserve Components at the \n     Joint Chiefs of Staff level creates circumstances that will \n     contribute to confusion and imbalance for the United States \n     Army Reserve, the United States Air Force Reserve, the United \n     States Marine Corps Reserve, the United States Navy Reserve \n     and the United States Coast Guard Reserve (which are all \n     adequately represented by their Military Departments), and \n     challenges interoperability. Seating the Chief of the \n     National Guard Bureau at the Joint Chiefs of Staff could also \n     result in over-representation of Army and Air Force concerns.\n       We realize you are very familiar with the 2006-2007 debate \n     before the Commission on the National Guard and Reserve on \n     making the Chief of the National Guard Bureau a member of the \n     Joint Chiefs of Staff. We firmly believe the Commission's \n     findings still hold true today: this change ``. . . would run \n     counter to intra- and inter-service integration and would \n     reverse progress toward jointness and interoperability. . . \n     .''\n       Second, we feel that the proposed legislation will \n     complicate the central and enduring principle of civilian \n     control of our nation's military. It is important that the \n     Secretary of the Army and the Chief of Staff of the Army have \n     clear authorities and responsibilities to ensure effective \n     and efficient employment of the force. Adding the Chief of \n     the National Guard Bureau as a full voting member of the \n     Joint Chiefs of Staff will confuse the lines of authority \n     currently in place.\n       Third, this legislation could effectively be creating a de \n     facto separate domestic military Service by elevating the \n     Chief of the National Guard Bureau to a level equal to the \n     Chiefs of Staff of the other Services. This could lead to \n     potentially divided views on global force management, \n     funding, modernization, RDT, training, doctrine and \n     operational concepts. Currently, any competing priorities are \n     effectively resolved within the Army with a clear chain of \n     command, ensuring holistic and efficient management of our \n     forces.\n       The integration of the Regular Army, Army National Guard, \n     and Army Reserve has proven--during the past decade of \n     conflict and natural disasters--to be unbeatable on the \n     battlefield and irreplaceable in relief efforts at home and \n     abroad. Now, more than in any time in our history, we are \n     truly One Army. We could not have experienced our incredible \n     operational successes without unity of command within our \n     Army formations and complete unity of effort with our joint, \n     civil, interagency and multinational partners.\n       Finally, as we move forward, our Army needs to remain \n     unified. Maintaining our National Guard and Reserve as \n     critical Army components is essential while facing times of \n     global uncertainty. The Reserve Component forces will \n     continue to play a critical role in our national security \n     strategy and the advice of the Chief of the National Guard \n     Bureau and Chief of the Army Reserve will always be--as they \n     always have been--extremely valuable and essential within the \n     context of a Total Army in a balanced Joint Portfolio. The \n     Army leadership remains committed to the strength of our \n     Army, which is and will remain the strength of our Nation.\n       We appreciate your time and thoughtful consideration of \n     this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n     Raymond T. Odierno,\n       General, United States Army, Chief of Staff.\n     John M. McHugh,\n       Secretary of the Army.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           Department of the Navy,\n\n\n                                    Chief of Naval Operations,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 3, 2011.\n     Hon. James Webb,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Personnel, Committee on Armed \n         Forces, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for the opportunity to comment \n     on the matter of including the Chief of the National Guard \n     Bureau as a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS); we \n     recommend against this initiative. JCS membership would \n     violate the principle of unity of command, run counter to \n     integrating the Joint force as laid out in the Goldwater-\n     Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986, and \n     would potentially confuse best military advice, as well as, \n     create an inequity in advocacy.\n       Making the CNGB a member of the JCS would complicate unity \n     of command for both the Army and the Air Force. The Chiefs of \n     Staff of the United States Army and the UnitedStates Air \n     Force should be held singularly accountable to the Executive \n     and Legislative Branches of Government for the readiness and \n     combat effectiveness of their respective service, and for the \n     welfare of the men, women, and families in their respective \n     services. Making the CNGB a member of the JCS would create \n     unhealthy ambiguity in the responsibility for leading the men \n     and women of the National Guard. After ten years of war, the \n     Guard and Reserve are more fully integrated with our active \n     component than ever before. Making the CNGB a member of the \n     JCS is unnecessary. This recommendation is consistent with \n     the Commission on the National Guard and Reserves Second \n     Report to Congress that the CNGB should not be a member of \n     the JCS.\n       Unlike the service chiefs, the CNGB does not represent a \n     branch of service nor is the CNGB responsible for organizing, \n     manning, training and equipping the National Guard to the \n     extent of the service chiefs. On matters relating to \n     federalized forces of the National Guard of the United States \n     and its subcomponents; the Army National Guard of the United \n     States and the Air National Guard of the United States, the \n     Chief of Staff of the Army and the Chief of Staff of the Air \n     Force are the appropriate advocates to render best military \n     advice as members of the JCS.\n       Moreover, making the CNGB a member of the JCS is \n     inconsistent with the status of the Army and Air National \n     Guard as reserve components of the Army and Air Force. \n     Additionally, JCS membership would create an inequity between \n     the National Guard and its Army, Marine Corps, Navy and Air \n     Force Reserve counterparts.\n       We concur with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff \n     that the CNGB's advisory roles under 10 USC 1050(c) are \n     essential and sufficient. The CNGB serves as the principal \n     advisor to the Secretary of Defense, through the Chairman of \n     the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on matters involvingnon-\n     federalized National Guard forces and on other matters as \n     determined by the Secretary of Defense. In these matters, it \n     is appropriate for the CNGB to participate in JCS \n     deliberations. Additionally, we fully support CNGB \n     participation in JCS deliberations that deal with issues that \n     affect the National Guard and to provide key insight on \n     National Guard concerns.\n       In sum, elevating the CNGB to the JCS risks sending the \n     message that the National Guard is a separate service, which \n     runs contrary to its status as an integral part of the United \n     States Army and United States Air Force.\n       Your longstanding support of the men and women of the Naval \n     service is greatly appreciated.\n           Sincerely,\n     J. W. Greenert,\n       Chief of Naval Operations.\n     James F. Amos\n       Commandant of the Marine Corps.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          United States Air Force,\n\n\n                               The Secretary of the Air Force,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 2, 2011.\n     Hon. Jim Webb,\n     Chairman, Personnel Subcommittee, Committee on Armed \n         Services, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Webb: Thank you for the opportunity to share \n     our views concerning the legislative proposal to make the \n     Chief of the National Guard Bureau a member of the Joint \n     Chiefs of Staff (JCS).\n       Over many decades, the U.S. Air Force has made great \n     strides integrating the active\n\n[[Page S7890]]\n\n     and reserve components, creating the world's most lethal air \n     force. We admire, value and rely upon the contributions our \n     reserve components make daily as a part of our total force. \n     We can assure you that the Air National Guard has a seat at \n     the table and its voice is heard.\n       The roles, functions, and reporting relationships for the \n     National Guard Bureau (NGB) are among the most complex in the \n     Department of Defense (DoD). As you know, the NGB is a joint \n     activity of DoD and the Chief of the NGB is a principal \n     advisor to the Secretary of Defense through the Chairman of \n     the Joint Chiefs of Staff on matters involving non-\n     federalized National Guard forces. The Chief of the NGB is \n     under the authority, direction, and control of the Secretary \n     of Defense, but the Secretary normally exercises authority, \n     direction and control through the Secretaries of the Army and \n     the Air Force for matters pertaining to their \n     responsibilities. The Office of the Director, Air National \n     Guard (ANG) is an element of the NGB and supports the Chief \n     of the NGB in his advisory role.\n       The Chief of the NGB is the principal advisor to the \n     Secretaries and Chiefs of Staff of the Army and Air Force for \n     matters pertaining to their Title 10 responsibilities, and he \n     implements the Title 10 organize, train and equip direction \n     of the Secretaries and Chiefs of Staff of the Army and the \n     Air Force as they pertain to the National Guard. The ANG of \n     the United States is a reserve component of the United States \n     Air Force and, together with the Air Force Reserve and the \n     Active Duty components of the Air Force, is a fully \n     integrated element of the total forces that the Secretary and \n     Chief of Staff provide to the Combatant Commanders. As the \n     senior leadership of the Air Force, we are responsible for \n     ensuring ANG requirements for capabilities and functions are \n     fully considered in DoD's Planning, Programming, Budgeting \n     and Execution System and policy making processes. With that, \n     the Director, ANG and his representatives participate without \n     limitation in the corporate Air Force decision making \n     process.\n       One of the continuing challenges we face lies in the dual \n     nature of Title 10 and Title 32 relationships. Specifically, \n     for our Total Force development and employment to remain \n     effective and efficient in all aspects of Air Force \n     operations, unified Title 10 leadership is paramount. As \n     recognized in the congressionally mandated Charter for the \n     National Guard Bureau, the Secretaries of the Army and the \n     Air Force exercise authority, direction, and control over the \n     NGB on matters pertaining to the respective Secretary's \n     responsibilities in law or DoD policy, except as otherwise \n     directed by the Secretary of Defense. This is essential for \n     them to meet their responsibilities to the nation, and to \n     integrate all components of their respective Services. The \n     legislation passed by the House and proposed by the Senate to \n     make the Chief of the NGB a member of the JCS would add \n     further complexity to Title 10 relationships, confusing the \n     lines of authority and representation already in place for \n     Chiefs of Staff of the Army and Air Force to meet their JCS \n     responsibilities.\n       For these reasons, we strongly encourage you not to proceed \n     with designating the Chief of the NGB as a member of the JCS. \n     We believe that the current advisory role established under \n     10 USC 10502 continues to be both important and sufficient \n     for advocacy of the National Guard's non-federal needs and \n     missions. The Chief of the NGB will continue to have a strong \n     voice and is an essential partner for the Secretary of \n     Defense, Service Secretaries, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \n     but he should not be put in a Title 10 position independent \n     of Service leadership.\n       In summary, the Title 10 roles and requirements of the Air \n     National Guard are appropriately addressed in law, in the \n     Charter of the National Guard Bureau, and within the U.S. Air \n     Force. Consistent with the unity of effort embodied in our \n     Total Force approach, military advice in all matters \n     concerning the U.S. Air Force should come from the Chief of \n     Staff. In its Title 10 context, the National Guard Bureau \n     (including its Army and Air elements), is not a separate \n     service and should not be included as such within the \n     statutory membership of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n       We support the proposal to establish a Vice Chief of the \n     National Guard Bureau.\n       Thank you for your valued and continued strong support of \n     the U.S. Air Force. Similar letters have been sent to Senator \n     Levin and Senator McCain.\n           Sincerely,\n     Michael B. Donley,\n       Secretary of the Air Force.\n     Norton A. Schwartz,\n       General, USAF, Chief of Staff.\n\n  Mr. WEBB. The administration also opposes this amendment. Senator \nGraham mentioned during the committee hearing that candidate Obama, at \na National Guard Association convention, expressed his support for this \nidea. But President Obama has yet to offer his support for this idea. \nIn fact, the Secretary of Defense, as I mentioned, has stated his \nstrong opposition. If the President is inclined to support this idea, \nperhaps he should clarify that for us.\n  The Chief of the National Guard Bureau already has extraordinary \naccess at the table. There have been some questions about bringing the \nNational Guard to the table. He has extraordinary access at the table. \nHe, in fact, is the only chief of any department in the Pentagon who \ndoes not have to report to a Service Secretary. He reports to the \nSecretary of Defense right now.\n  The other Reserve components report through Service Secretaries--the \nArmy Reserve, as opposed to the Army Guard; the Air Force Reserve, the \nNavy Reserve, the Marine Corps Reserve, and the Coast Guard Reserve, \nthrough the Coast Guard process.\n  They are all represented at the table in the Joint Chiefs without \nhaving to be members of the Joint Chiefs.\n  I remind my colleagues that what we are proposing here is statutorily \ndoable if this body wishes to do it. But it is going to be \nbureaucratically awkward in the Pentagon if it were to occur. You are \ngoing to put into position on the Joint Chiefs of Staff an individual \nwho is not a service chief.\n  During the committee hearing, Senator Graham and others mentioned an \narticle I had written in 1972 in the Marine Corps Gazette calling for \nthe Commandant of the Marine Corps to become a full member of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff. I am actually quite flattered that someone would \nrecall an article I wrote 39 years ago when I was a 25-year-old Marine \nCorps captain. But the point of the article actually is the reverse of \nwhat we are talking about today. The point of that article was that the \nMarine Corps is a separate service--a completely separate service. The \nMarine Corps wears a separate uniform than the Navy. The Marine Corps \nwas being represented on the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the same way as, \nsay, naval aviation. This is not true with the National Guard. The Air \nNational Guard wears the uniform of the U.S. Air Force. When they are \nmobilized, they are a part of the Air Force. The Army National Guard \nwears the uniform of the U.S. Army. When they are brought into Federal \nservice, they are wearing the same uniform.\n  We made a lot of this when I was Assistant Secretary for Reserve \nAffairs--talking about one Army, one Air Force. You cannot tell the \ndifference when their units are called up and they are put together.\n  So what are we doing when we say there should be a position on the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff for an individual who is not a service chief? \nWhat does that say, for instance--let's think about this--about Special \nOperations Command? The Special Operations Command--a lot of people are \nwriting about it right now because of the activities they have been \ndoing over the past 10 years and the fact that they have pretty well \nquintupled the people on the ground. The Special Operations Command is \nnot a separate service. People are saying and writing that they act as \na separate service, but they are made up of members of the other \nservices. They are put together by the CINC, and they are fed by the \nservice chiefs based on policies developed at the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff.\n  In 1986, going into 1987, when I was Assistant Secretary of Defense, \nthere was a constitutional confrontation that occurred when a lot of \nGovernors in the United States were being pressured by political groups \nthat did not support the policy of the Reagan administration in Central \nAmerica. What they started doing was lobbying the Governors of the \ndifferent States in their role as commander of the militia--the \nNational Guard--saying that the Governors should not be sending \nNational Guard troops, or their militia, into Central America. At one \npoint, Secretary Weinberger turned around to me and said that we have \n40 percent of the National Guard in the United States potentially \nnondeployable to Central America because the Governors in States such \nas California and Ohio said they weren't going to send their National \nGuard troops to Central America. We had a long and divisive argument \nover this. It took place for almost a year.\n  Finally, we worked with Sonny Montgomery, who was ``Mr. National \nGuard'' in the House of Representatives, for whom I had worked years \nbefore. We got a piece of legislation that said the Governors cannot do \nthat; that the Governor, even though he or she is commander of the \nmilitia, cannot stop deployments when the Pentagon decides they should \ndeploy. This went all\n\n[[Page S7891]]\n\nthe way to the Supreme Court. The National Guard lost. We clarified, in \nthat Supreme Court decision, the supremacy of the Army clause of the \nConstitution over the militia clause of the Constitution--basically, \nthat the needs of the Army, the needs of the U.S. military, active-duty \nmilitary, when calling up these units, superseded the desires of a \nGovernor.\n  I would say that that principle still would be in effect today and \nstill should be recognized in the way the National Guard is fed into \nour active-duty Army units and Air Force units when they are being \ndeployed. And they are well represented on the Joint Chiefs of Staff. \nEvery member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff emphasized this, and every \none of them discussed the confusion and the potential inequality among \nother reserve components if this amendment were to succeed.\n  I have enormous respect for Senator Leahy. I consider him to be a \ngreat friend. I know he is not particularly happy with the statement I \nam making right now. I hope people will take a hard look at the \namendment I am offering, which says let's take a timeout and look \nspecifically at the effects that this positioning of a chief of guard \nas a member of the Joint Chiefs would have on the principles of \ncivilian control, accountability, and of someone who is not subject to \nthe oversight of a confirmed secretary of the military department, and \na number of other issues.\n  With that, on the remainder of the bill I express my strong support \nand my respect and admiration for Chairman Levin, Senator McCain, and \nthe other members of the committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I listened to part of what Senator Reid \nhad to say as we opened the Senate today. I was struck by the fact that \nso many people are unemployed and our economy is still barely growing, \nthat there probably is not any firm objection to trying to alleviate \nsome of the pain by continuing a process where we lessen the tax burden \nthrough a decline in the Social Security tax. I don't think that is \ngoing to be the issue with many Senators.\n  The question is, do we do that by raising taxes on other people or by \ngetting rid of waste. I had an interesting phone call today with \nsomebody I trust and have been talking to for 3 years, who actually \npredicted everything that has happened so far. He predicted what is \ngoing to happen in Europe, and he predicted the fact that ultimately \nthere will be default in Europe on government bonds. There is no way \nthey grow themselves out of it or no way we loan them enough money to \nbuy them enough time to get out of it. The only way is to trim their \nspending, which they should have started 2\\1/2\\ or 3 years ago.\n  The same lesson applies to us. I think some things that are factual \nought to be brought up. We had, over this past week, the inability of \nthe committee to come to an agreement on $1.2 trillion. Therefore, \nthere is going to be a sequestration. The interesting thing, on the way \nto the farm, is that when you have the sequestration carried out, there \nwill actually be no decrease in spending in the Federal Government. \nThis is the important thing I want the American people to hear. They \nthink we are cutting spending. Defense will rise 16 percent with \nsequestration; nondefense discretionary will rise 6 percent; Medicare \nwill still rise 71 percent; and net interest will rise 160 percent with \nthe sequestration. So it is dishonest--to put it mildly--to say that we \nare cutting anything in Washington. And there begs the problem.\n\n  The problem is that the political elite in this country are failing \nto make the adjustments we have to make or we are going to end up like \nGreece, Portugal, Spain, Italy, and ultimately France. We have to do \nthat. The sooner we do it the less pain we are going to have. The first \nthing we ought to do is be honest with the American people. Nobody has \ndone anything in Washington yet to cut any spending, because it is \nstill going to rise in discretionary, defense, Medicare, Medicaid, \nSocial Security, and interest. It is still going to rise. So we have to \ngo back to the fundamental problem.\n  What President Obama is proposing costs about $240 billion for next \nyear. I think he would get great support from many of us if he said I \nwant to do this to help people out there, and I want to do it by \ngetting rid of some of the waste, fraud, abuse, and duplication we \nhave. I would be the first to help him. But that is not what is going \nto be proposed. Instead of playing the political game, why don't we \nsolve the problem?\n  We had a GAO report that came out in March that showed massive \nduplication throughout the Federal Government--massive. My estimate is \nclose to $200 billion a year. That is not theirs, that is mine. But at \na minimum, $100 billion a year could be saved by consolidating programs \nand eliminating duplication. We have not done anything or made any \nattempt to do that. Senator Warner and I offered an amendment to \neliminate $5 billion of it. The bill it was riding on was withdrawn. We \nhaven't had an opportunity in all the bills that came before to offer \nan amendment to eliminate duplication. Before we ask anybody to pay \nmore taxes to offset the taxes we are going to decrease for the \nbusinesses under $50 million, and for the decline in the payment of \nSocial Security tax of 3.1 percent for business and 2 percent for the \nindividual, we ought to get our house in order first. We are doing \nexactly what the European countries refuse to do.\n  Now we hear over the weekend that we are about to participate, \nthrough the IMF, in socializing the debt of Europe, of which we are \nrequired, through the IMF, to absorb 26 percent of the cost. We are not \ngoing to let that happen, because what we are going to do is exactly \nthe same thing we are doing in the cities--delaying the onset of the \ntime to make the hard choices.\n  Here is the growth curve on this chart. In the red is sequestration. \nThe blue line is without sequestration. Spending is still going up. We \nare going to be at a $5.4 trillion annual budget in 2021, 9 years from \nnow. No spending has been cut. We need to quit lying to the American \npeople about what we are doing. A 9-percent approval rating is well \nearned as long as we are dishonest with the American people about what \nwe are actually doing. They understand the problem. We are broke.\n  If you don't think that is the case, look at this chart. Medicare is \nbroke, no question about it. Medicaid is broke. The census is broke. \nFannie and Freddie are broke. Now FHA has 0.2 percent of the capital \nthey need when they have a minimum statutory requirement of 3 percent. \nFHA is broke. Social Security is broke. There is $2.6 trillion in the \ntrust fund. We put $105 billion from the Treasury in to offset what we \ndid last year. Now we are going to pay for it twice because there was \nno decrease in the IOU. For that $105 billion, our children and \ngrandchildren will pay back $210 billion. With the new program, they \nare going to pay back $280 billion. The U.S. Post Office is dead broke. \nWe won't even pass a bill that allows it to be fixed. We just delay the \ntime of its demise. Cash for Clunkers was broke. The highway trust fund \nwas broke. We are passing bills for the highway trust fund, which is \n$13 billion short. We don't know where the money will come from because \nthe trust fund is broke. Government-run health care--we don't know, but \nit is likely to be broke before it starts.\n  How do we solve the problem?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield on the issue of the post office?\n  Mr. COBURN. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Isn't it kind of a symptom of the disease we suffer from \nhere where we would not even agree to legislation that cuts mail \ndelivery from 6 days to 5 days, which is the recommendation of the \nPostmaster General?\n  Mr. COBURN. Yes, and the recommendation of the President of the \nUnited States. What about duplication? Is there not someplace we can \nfind the $240 billion that President Obama wants to put into the \neconomy for helping those of the middle and lower income levels make it \nthrough this tough time? Sure there is.\n  We have 100-plus surface transportation programs that can be \nconsolidated into about 20 programs. We have\n\n[[Page S7892]]\n\n82 Federal teacher quality programs. Not one has the metric on it, and \nwe don't know if they work. Economic development programs--we have 88. \nTransportation assistance programs, outside surface transportation--we \nhave 80 of those. We have 56 financial literacy programs. We have 47 \njob-training programs, at $18 billion a year. All but three of those \noverlap one another, and not one has a metric to say it works. \nHomelessness prevention and assistance--there are 20 separate programs. \nThere is nothing wrong with that goal, but why do we need 20? Food for \nthe hungry--we have 18 different programs. Couldn't we do that through \none Federal program? Why do we need to have 18? Disaster response and \npreparedness in FEMA has 17 different programs.\n\n  We have taken a ``stupid'' pill, and now we sit bankrupt. We are \nphysically bankrupt--fiscally and physically bankrupt at this moment, \nexcept we just haven't recognized it, and what is happening in Europe \nis going to happen to us in less than a year. The price we pay for our \nbond interest is going to go up. The price differential between a \nGerman and Italian bond in the last 10 days has risen 270 basis \npoints--a spread of 270. Germany couldn't even sell all its bonds \nFriday.\n  What is happening? It is a lack of confidence. So we have to restore \nconfidence, and the way we do that is by actually paying for the good \nwe need to do by putting forth commonsense solutions for elimination of \nprograms that are duplicative.\n  I will finish with just a couple other points, just some ideas.\n  If you started now, you could put the 2020 census online and save $2 \nbillion. If we increased the paperless transactions at the Treasury \nDepartment, we could save $1 billion. These are per year, by the way--\nper year. We need to gradually increase fees for GSE securities. \nPresident Obama has started that, but it needs to be accelerated. Move \nthe core functions of the Election Assistance Commission to the FEC. \nThat is $161 million. We could consolidate that. We could do some \ncommonsense things. We could combine the SEC and the CFTC and save $2.8 \nbillion. We could move the SBA disaster loans to FEMA. You have to go \nthrough FEMA anyway before you ever qualify for one, so why not let \nthem do it? Why do we have two separate programs? Why do you have to go \nthrough two doors? It would be like getting your license where you \nbought the car, but then you had to go somewhere else to get it, and \nthen you had to go somewhere else. We could eliminate that. The \nNational Drug Intelligence Center--it doesn't do anything. It is an \nearmark we have spent $488 million on in the last 10 years. It does \nnothing of concrete value to anybody in the intelligence network, but \nit is an earmark gone crazy.\n  So what do we do? Well, we put together a shopping list that could be \nused. You don't have to agree with any of this, but over the next 10 \nyears, if you just agreed with one-third of it, you could find the \nthird and save $3.3 trillion. That is $85 billion more--if we just did \none-tenth of it this year--than what the President would like to do \nwith this jobs stimulus program.\n  None of this is hard. There certainly can be some debate over what we \nfund and don't fund in defense, but most of it is common sense. Will \npeople squeal? Yes. Everybody is going to have to squeal if we are to \nget out of the problem we have in this country.\n  I will conclude with this: I think we ought to continue, until our \neconomy is back on keel, with a Social Security tax cut, but I think \nthe only way we should do that is by eliminating some of the $350 \nbillion a year of waste, of duplication, and of fraud in the Federal \nGovernment. And if we can't do that, we shouldn't be here. None of us \nshould be here.\n  The fact that the politics of the next election is crippling this \ncountry says we deserve the 9-percent rating the American people are \ngiving us. All we have to do is change that. What we have to do is grow \na backbone, stand, and say no to people. We have to say it to everyone. \nWe have to do this. It is for our future and for our kids' future. And \nthese are the things that are least painful.\n  Here is what happens if we don't. The very people we say we don't \nwant to harm by eliminating the multitude of duplication in all these \nprograms, eliminating all this waste, all these feel-good things that \npart of the time accomplish good things, are the very people who are \ngoing to suffer significantly more because of our inaction.\n  It is time for us to act. It is time for us to do what is necessary \nto put our country back in the right direction and on a healthy diet of \nfiscal prudence, smart tax policy, and get out of the rut we are in. \nThat requires leadership--and not just by the President but by all of \nus.\n  It means you have to take some hits. When I put ``Back in Black'' \nout, I got some terribly nasty letters from all sorts of people. I \nunderstand. They are getting something, and some of that is put at \nrisk, so therefore you can't represent them. But everybody is going to \nhave to give, and if everybody doesn't give, we won't have a country \nleft. That is what is coming--default. We are broke now; we just are \nnot in the reality of it. But what is coming is default of American \nbonds if we do not act now. It can't wait 2 years. It can't wait for \nthe next Presidential election. We have to do it now.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, here is where we are: With the current UC \nthat we are operating under, debate is in order this afternoon, and we \nare urging that our colleagues who have amendments pending to come and \ndebate those amendments. This is an opportunity for them to do so, and \nthis opportunity is not going to last for very long because we have to \nget this bill passed.\n  So I would urge--and I know my good friend from Arizona would join \nme--colleagues who have amendments, whether they are pending or not, we \nare not going to be able to have any additional amendments added to the \npending list by unanimous consent because we already have something \nlike 100 pending amendments. It is just more than we are going to be \nable to handle to add any more, and it may be more than we could handle \nto deal with the ones that are already pending.\n  But I urge colleagues--otherwise, tomorrow we are going to be hearing \nfrom colleagues: Gee whiz, we want to offer our amendment or we want to \ndebate that amendment, and there won't be time before that cloture vote \non Wednesday--we are not going to have more than this week for this \nbill. We have been informed by the majority leader he wants to finish \nthis bill by Thursday.\n  So I strongly urge our colleagues to come and use this opportunity to \ndebate their amendments. It will increase the chances that we will be \nable to get to their amendments for a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a \ncolloquy with the distinguished chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Isn't it true, I would ask the chairman, that we went on \nthis bill last Thursday and that we spent a good part of Thursday on \nthis legislation? Then on Friday, you and I and a few others came in on \nFriday and had further debate and discussion of amendments; and then we \ncame in, I believe, around 1:00 today and enjoined, in fact pleaded, \nwith our colleagues to come and discuss their amendments they have \npending? I understand there are over 100 amendments pending. So it does \nring a bit hollow if some of our colleagues may say they didn't have \ntime to debate the amendments that are pending.\n  So I would say to my colleagues, I believe--and have stated \nendlessly--this piece of legislation, which has to do with the Nation's \nsecurity, which has been passed by the Congress of the United States \nfor over 50 years now, for over a half century, without interruption, \nthat we are doing a disservice to the men and women in the military if \nwe don't debate these amendments, if we don't discuss the important \nissues of national security that are embodied in this legislation.\n\n[[Page S7893]]\n\n  So I would ask my friend, the distinguished chairman, after these \nthousands of hours of work, and now on our fourth day of consideration \nof this bill, that maybe it might be appropriate for us to take \nmeasures to expedite the process. Again, I urge our colleagues who have \npending amendments to come down and debate and discuss them so that we \ncan line up votes because there are so many pending amendments it is \ngoing to require a significant number of votes as well.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I surely concur with my colleague that we have been here \nnow--I think this is the fourth day. The days last week which the \nSenator referred to are different than my own memory. I think they were \nearlier in the week than the Senator referred to. But, nonetheless, the \npoint is the same. I believe we were here either Tuesday or Wednesday, \nbut there were 2 days before we left for Thanksgiving that we were \nhere. The Senator's point is well taken.\n  The floor was open to debate. People offered amendments. They had an \nopportunity to make them pending. Now we have a huge number of those \namendments pending, and now it is time to start disposing of \namendments. Unless our colleagues come to the floor to do that, we are \nnot going to be able to get through this bill, and the leader will not \ncontinue debate or allow us to continue to debate this bill beyond \nThursday. We know that is the case because we know how much pending \nlegislation there is that the majority leader needs to get through.\n  So I can only, again, join the Senator from Arizona in a joint plea \nthat our colleagues who have amendments come and debate those \namendments. Hopefully, we can get to votes on those amendments even yet \ntoday after the vote on the judge at 5:30 or so.\n  Mr. McCAIN. So my colleagues should not object to short time \nagreements for debate, final debate before we vote on some of these \namendments.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I hope, when the time comes, colleagues who come to the \nfloor understand that unless they agree to short time agreements, there \nis no way we will be able to get this bill done even if their \namendments pass. It will not do anyone any good to have long debate on \namendments when people finally come to debate those amendments, even if \nthe amendments pass, because there will not be an opportunity to get \nthe bill itself passed. That is very true.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Delaware, Mr. Coons--the Presiding Officer--be added as a \ncosponsor of Senate amendment No. 1155 to the pending bill, S. 1867.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Mr. President, for cosponsoring the \namendment.\n  Earlier today the chairman and the ranking minority member of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee came to the Senate floor and asked for \nMembers to come forth with their amendments. I want to speak on my \namendments as well as the underlying bill. But I want to begin by \ncommending Senator Levin and Senator McCain for their superior work on \nthis very important piece of legislation.\n  For this reason I rise in support of the fiscal year 2012 National \nDefense Authorization Act. This bill represents a bipartisan commitment \nto ensuring that our brave men and women in uniform have the support \nthey require to execute our Nation's military strategy and to defend \nfreedom around the globe. The legislation will improve the operation of \nthe Department of Defense, it will strengthen congressional oversight \nof the Department, and it makes fiscally responsible but very difficult \nchoices in order to meet this year's budget caps. As a member of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, I urge all of my colleagues to support \nthis important bill.\n  I am particularly pleased that this bill fully authorizes the Navy's \nbudget request for shipbuilding. While shipbuilding accounts for fewer \nthan $1 out of every $10 of the Navy's budget, it is a critical \ncomponent to the strength of our national defense.\n  The Chief of Naval Operations has testified that a fleet of 400 ships \nwould actually be required to meet the unconstrained demands of the \ncombatant commanders. Due to budget constraints, however, the Navy aims \nfor a fleet that equals 313 ships in the future, but today the Navy has \nonly 285 ships. The DDG-1000 program, the DDG-51 restart, the Virginia \nClass submarine, and other ships in the shipbuilding budget will help \nto close the troubling gap between the requirements of the combatant \ncommanders and the number of ships the Navy actually has.\n  I am particularly proud that the skilled workers of Bath Iron Works \nin my State are playing such a critical role in building the ships our \nNavy requires. Bath's excellent performance of delivering ships on time \nand on budget or under budget to the Navy continues. This year BIW \ndelivered the USS Spruance to the Navy where the destroyer will serve \nin the Pacific fleet. In addition, BIW has completed more than 60 \npercent of the construction of the very first DDG-1000. This is a \ndestroyer for which the Navy laid the keel for the ship 2 weeks ago.\n  So, Mr. President, consider the fact that 60 percent of the \nconstruction had been completed before the keel laying ceremony; this \nis a feat which is all that much more impressive when we consider that \nthe rework rate for ship construction--and this ship is the first in \nits class of ships--has been less than 1 percent. That is an \nextraordinary record and a tribute to the high-quality work performed \nby the men and women of Bath Iron Works.\n  Last week the President made clear that the United States will not \nshrink from its role in Southeast Asia and the Pacific, two regions \nwhere forward presence and persistence depend on the ships of the U.S. \nNavy. At a time when the Chinese fleet is larger than our own and is \nexpanding, now is certainly the time to reinvigorate rather than weaken \nour shipbuilding industrial base to build ships that are capable of \noperating in anti-access and area-denial environments.\n  In recent weeks Secretary of Defense Panetta has warned about the \nnegative effect of sequestration on the fragile shipbuilding industrial \nbase and his concern that under this procedure, which would involve \nautomatic cuts that disproportionately fall on the Department of \nDefense, the Navy could shrink to the smallest force since 1915. \nUnfortunately, the Navy fleet is already the smallest that it has been \nsince 1916 despite the escalating threats that we face.\n  So I want to thank Chairman Levin, Ranking Minority Member McCain, \nand the chairman and ranking member of the Seapower Subcommittee as \nwell for recognizing the importance of fully authorizing the \nPresident's request for shipbuilding.\n  This legislation also includes important acquisition reforms to \nensure that taxpayers receive the best value for every dollar \nauthorized in this bill. One provision requires the military services \nto determine if they can save money by performing service-life \nextension programs for nontactical vehicles and equipment rather than \npurchasing new gear.\n  The committee report also seeks to save taxpayer dollars by directing \nthe Air Force to evaluate the annual fuel costs that would be incurred \nat each candidate base before the Air Force decides where to assign new \naircraft, such as the KC-46A tanker.\n  In addition to providing better value to the taxpayer, the government \nprocurement process should be fair, open, and entirely free from \npolitics. I would hope that is the goal on which every Member of the \nSenate could agree. Last spring, however, the administration was \nconsidering a draft Executive order requiring Federal agencies and \ndepartments to collect information about campaign contributions and \npolitical expenditures of bidders before awarding any Federal contract. \nI would suggest to my colleagues that is the antithesis of sound \nprocurement practices.\n  For the administration to even consider a change that would inject \npolitics into the procurement process goes\n\n[[Page S7894]]\n\nin entirely the wrong direction. Such a move would create the \nperception that political support or opposition is somehow a \nconsideration in selecting the winners and losers among businesses \nvying for Federal contracts.\n  To ensure that contracts are kept out of the procurement process, an \namendment that I offered with Senators Portman and Brown was adopted by \nthe committee with the wholehearted support of the chairman and ranking \nmember, and I would note that it was adopted without opposition. Our \namendment specifically prohibits the Department of Defense from \ncollecting information about political contributions made by companies \nseeking to conduct business with the Federal Government.\n  Think what a terrible position that would put contracting officers \nin. Right now they are just collecting information about the ability of \na contractor--or a would-be contractor--to perform on the contract, \ninformation about the price they are bidding, and information about \npast performance. What kind of signal would it send to contracting \nofficers if all of a sudden they are required to collect information \nabout political contributions and expenditures? That would muddy the \nprocurement process. It would imply that somehow political \ncontributions are supposed to be considered in the contract award \nprocess when exactly the opposite must be the case.\n  Another area of particular concern to me is ensuring that our service \nmen and women receive the health care they deserve, particularly as it \nrelates to mental and behavioral health. While the rate of Active-Duty \nsuicides did drop last year, it is very sad to know that almost twice \nas many Guard members and reservists committed suicide in 2010 compared \nto 2009. This is a tragedy that the chiefs of the military services, \nthe Secretary of Defense, and the members of our committee are taking \nvery seriously. We don't know enough about the factors why, but we do \nknow that we need to provide better access to counseling and other \nservices to our service men and women, to our reservists, to our Guard \nmembers, and to our veterans.\n  Unfortunately, the Department of Defense has had limited ability to \nallow its own civilian and contracted mental health professionals in \none State to provide care to a patient in a different State. That is \nthe result of complicated State licensing laws with which I am very \nfamiliar, having overseen the licensing of mental health professionals \nfor 5 years in my career.\n  The result is that many in our military, particularly Guard members \nand Reserve members who live in rural areas where there is a shortage \nanyway of mental health professionals, must travel long distances to \naccess care.\n  So the result is that, in many cases, they simply don't access care \nat all and don't receive the care, the counseling, or the assistance \nthey need and deserve.\n  This bill includes the provision included at the request of Senator \nBegich, Senator Brown, and myself to expand access to mental health \ncare providers for those individuals who have served. This provision--\nour amendment--will allow mental health care professionals who have \nbeen qualified by the Department of Defense to serve members of the \nArmed Forces and our veterans using ``telehealth''--a capability the \nArmy in particular has sought and believes would be very useful so \nservices can be provided via videoconference, for example, to members \nwho may be far away from the actual mental health professional.\n\n  The bill also includes provisions to increase protections for \nservicemembers who are victims of sexual assault. One in six women will \nbe a victim of a sexual assault in her lifetime. Yet in the military, \nthat terrible statistic is even higher--much higher, I regret to say. \nAs many as one in three women leaving military service report they have \nexperienced some form of sexual trauma.\n  The provisions that were included in the bill at the request of all \nthe women of the Senate Armed Services Committee as well as Senators \nBrown and Begich were based upon legislation Senator Kerry and I \nintroduced to implement some of the overdue recommendations of the 2009 \nDefense Task Force on Sexual Assault in the Military Services.\n  Of the 91 recommendations made by this task force, only 26 have been \nfully implemented by the Pentagon as of May--only 26 of the 91 \nrecommendations. There are a couple of these recommendations that are \nparticularly important and have been included in the bill. These \nrecommendations include providing victims with access to legal counsel \nand ensuring that each military unit has an adequate number of \ntrained--and I emphasize the word ``trained''--victim advocates and \nsexual assault response coordinators.\n  The bill also requires the Department of Defense and the VA to \nimplement a comprehensive process to preserve medical records and \nevidence related to sexual assaults. This has been a real problem. This \nprocess will protect victims' access to VA benefits and will help \nsupport the prosecution of their offenders. Finally, in this area, the \nbill modifies the Uniform Code of Military Justice as requested by the \nJudge Advocate Generals to improve the likelihood of prosecution of \nsexual offenders in the military.\n  While this bill does much to provide for our servicemembers and \nimprove the processes of the Department of Defense, I believe we can \nfurther strengthen this bill, and I have offered three amendments with \nthat goal in mind. First, I have introduced amendment No. 1180 with \nSenators Shaheen and Casey to address the serious threat posed to the \nAmerican people by the missing portable anti-aircraft missiles from \nLibya. Our amendment requires an urgent intelligence assessment of the \nthreat these missiles pose to the American people and our allies and it \nrequires the President to develop and implement a comprehensive \nstrategy to mitigate this threat.\n  Former Libyan Dictator Colonel Qadhafi acquired more than 18,000 of \nthese portable anti-aircraft missiles--one of the largest stockpiles in \nthe world. Make no mistake, no one has an accurate accounting of where \nall these missiles have gone or where they are now. While the \nadministration has sent teams to inspect and disable these missiles, \nwhere they know they exist, there is no comprehensive strategy in place \ndespite very disturbing reports of Libyan militias refusing to disarm \nthemselves and of terrorist groups seeking these weapons.\n  Recently, Senator McCain and I had the opportunity at the World \nEconomic Forum in Jordan to meet with the then-Acting Prime Minister of \nthe Libyan Transitional National Council, and we asked him specifically \nabout the issue of the Libyan militias all over the country. He was \nvery forthright in saying he had been unable to bring them under a \nuniform control--a real issue. Unfortunately, he decided he needed to \nresign, in part due to that issue. The United States simply must make \nan accounting for these dangerous weapons that can be aimed to take \ndown a commercial aircraft. This must be a priority in Libya and \nthroughout the region. I appreciate the support Chairman Levin and \nSenator McCain have expressed for this amendment as well as the helpful \nsuggestions from Senator Kerry, Senator Lugar, and the Senate Select \nIntelligence Committee.\n  I have also offered an amendment No. 1155 to allow physical and \noccupational therapists to enroll in the Armed Forces Health \nProfessionals Scholarship Program. This program provides tuition \nassistance to critical health care professionals in exchange for \nservice as a commissioned medical officer.\n  Unfortunately, while the need for physical therapists has grown \nduring the last 10 years of war, neither the Department of Defense nor \nthe military services have conducted a separate analysis of the current \nor future DOD workforce requirements for occupational and physical \ntherapists, even though such an analysis was required by last year's \nDefense authorization bill.\n  My amendment would allow the military services to extend the same \nkind of educational benefits to physical and occupational therapists \nthat are already afforded to physicians, dentists, physician \nassistants, and even veterinarians.\n  Physical and occupational therapists at the military's major medical \ncenters serve approximately 600 wounded warriors every day on their \nroad to recovery. More than 32,000 servicemembers have been wounded in \nIraq and Afghanistan, including many who have suffered very serious \ninjuries and have\n\n[[Page S7895]]\n\nhad to have amputations, for example. Those injuries require \nsignificant physical therapy.\n  The idea for this amendment came directly from a visit I had with a \nwounded marine from Maine at Bethesda earlier this month. He was \nseverely wounded by an IED in Afghanistan. He lost part of one leg and \nhis other leg has a lot of shrapnel wounds. Both of his arms were \nwounded, and he has a traumatic brain injury as well. In short, he has \nvery serious wounds that are going to require a very lengthy recovery \nperiod. But he has recently been moved into wonderful accommodations--\nhis own apartment at Bethesda. His spirits are amazingly strong and \nupbeat.\n  But when I asked him if he had any concerns, he said while he praised \nthe care he was receiving, there was a severe shortage of physical \ntherapists and other trained clinical personnel to help him in what is \ngoing to be a very long recovery. He is expected to be at Bethesda for \nanother 9 months. It troubles me that he believes there are not a \nsufficient number of physical therapists to help him and the other \nwounded warriors who are hospitalized at Bethesda.\n  While the Department of Defense reports that overall it does not face \na shortage in these professions, both the Air Force and the Navy report \nshortages in physical therapists, physical therapy technicians, and \noccupational therapists. One out of every four physical therapist \npositions in the Active-Duty Navy is currently unfilled. So including \nthese medical professions in this existing educational program would \nhelp meet this need.\n  I wish to point out, we are not authorizing additional or new \nfunding. However, this is an important insurance policy against a \nshortfall of these medical professionals that will help the Navy and \nthe Air Force fill vacancies. After all, it is these talented and \ncommitted professionals who are helping our wounded warriors return to \nliving full and independent lives.\n  Finally, I have offered amendment No. 1158, a bipartisan amendment \nwith Senators Begich, Manchin, and Chambliss, regarding the prohibition \non the transfer of U.S.-held detainees to a country that has a \nconfirmed case of a released individual who has returned to the fight. \nThis is so needed.\n  I note this provision was permanent in the detainee amendment that \nwas offered by our chairman and ranking member that was adopted \noverwhelmingly by the Senate Armed Services Committee during our June \nmarkup. Nevertheless, this provision was reduced to a temporary 1-year \nrestriction in the current version of the bill in response to concerns \nfrom the administration.\n  I wish to point out that my amendment would only make permanent the \nprohibition on the transfer of American-held detainees to a country \nthat has a confirmed case of recidivism. It does not change any of the \nother transfer provisions in section 1033 of the bill.\n  Let me make clear that I support the hard work Chairman Levin and \nSenator McCain have done to craft a permanent detainee policy that has \na great deal of support on a bipartisan basis. While there may be \ngenuine disagreement regarding other aspects of the detainee policy \nprovided for in this bill, the amendment I put forth permanently \nestablishing the commonsense policy that we will not return detainees \nto countries where they are returning to the battlefield should not be \nan issue that divides this body. In spite of the spirited and lengthy \ndebate in committee on detainee policy, this particular provision in my \namendment was not the subject of controversy.\n  Let me give a little more background on why it is necessary. In \nSeptember, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper testified \nthat the recidivism rate of transferred Guantanamo detainees continues \nto increase. Twenty-seven percent of transferred detainees--released \nfrom Guantanamo to another country is what I am talking about--up from \n25 percent last year, are believed to have rejoined the fight, rejoined \nthe cause of terrorism.\n  Of the 599 detainees who have been released from Guantanamo, there \nare 161 individuals confirmed or suspected of re-engaging in terrorist \nor insurgent activities. Half of those cases have been confirmed by the \nintelligence community, which is an increase of 5 percent of confirmed \ncases from March 2009 to October 2010. I believe it is likely, as \nfurther intelligence is developed, that the rest will be confirmed--\nthose suspected cases are likely to be confirmed as well.\n  Former detainees who were previously mid-level enemy combatants are \nnot simply returning to be another fighter armed with a rifle, although \nthat, too, is clearly unacceptable. According to Michael Vickers, the \nUnder Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, former detainees are \nadvancing in the leadership ranks of al-Qaida and its affiliates.\n  For example, Said al-Shihri was released from Guantanamo in 2007 to \nSaudi Arabia. He participated in a so-called rehabilitation program but \nthen traveled to Yemen. Within 2 years of his transfer, he was involved \nin planning an attack on the U.S. Embassy in Yemen in September of \n2009. He also became a deputy in al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, the \nterrorist group responsible for the attempted Christmas Day bombing in \n2009 and the attempted package bombs last year. In fact, AQAP is \nconsidered by most intelligence analysts as the entity posing the most \ndanger to our homeland.\n  There are other cases as well. There is a case where one of the \ndetainees who was released to Afghanistan in 2007 told American \nofficials, prior to his transfer:\n\n       I [just] want to go back home and join my family and work \n     in my land and help my family.\n\n  Instead, after Abdullah Ghulam Rasoul was released by the Afghan \nGovernment in 2008, he went back to fighting. Press reports indicate \nthis former detainee was promoted as a top deputy in the Taliban and \nput in charge of operations against U.S. and Afghan forces in southern \nAfghanistan in 2009. In fact, Newsweek reported that roadside bomb \nteams under his direction have caused more than half of NATO's 160 \ndeaths in Afghanistan in the first 5 months of this year.\n  Muhammad al-Awfi was also released from Guantanamo to Saudi Arabia in \n2007. After leaving a rehabilitation program in 2008, he too fled to \nYemen. Not long after, he appeared in a video announcing the formation \nof AQAP. There are other examples as well--example after example after \nexample--of detainees who have been released from Guantanamo and who \nhave returned to the fight.\n  We need a permanent provision to deal with the recidivism threat. As \nhopeful as I am that the national defense authorization bill will be \npassed each and every year--and there is a great record of the Armed \nServices Committee in that regard--there is no guarantee that \nlegislation will be passed by the Congress and signed into law by the \nPresident. In fact, we are already 3 months into this fiscal year, and \nwe are weeks from having a Defense authorization bill signed into law, \ndespite the heroic efforts of the leaders of the Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  Ten years after these wars began, it is clear when we transfer \ndetainees to some countries they may well rejoin the fight against our \ncountry and our allies. It is time for Congress to establish a \npermanent policy in the Defense authorization bill that we will not \ntransfer detainees to countries where there have been confirmed cases \nof released detainees returning to the fight. I urge my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle to do exactly that by supporting this \nbipartisan amendment.\n  Finally, the people of Maine have a proud history of contributing to \nthe defense of our country. Members of the Maine National Guard have \nserved in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as Active-Duty soldiers, \nmarines, airmen, and sailors from our State. The Air Guard unit in \nBangor continues to perform critical refueling missions for aircraft \nheaded overseas, as it has done since 9/11/2001. Many of the sailors \nwho are deployed serve on 1 of the 101 ships currently underway that \nwere built at Bath Iron Works or on submarines repaired, overhauled, \nand refueled at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, ME.\n  From the Maine Military Authority and the Defense Finance and \nAccounting Service Center in Limestone to the Pratt & Whitney plant in \nNorth Berwick, ME, from cutting-edge composite and renewable energy \nresearch at the University of Maine to the innovative high-tech firms \nthroughout our State,\n\n[[Page S7896]]\n\nMainers have faithfully supported our national defense with ingenuity, \ninnovation, and superior craftsmanship.\n  The investments authorized in this bill support these efforts in \nMaine and other States throughout the country, and they will continue \nto ensure that our extraordinary military remains the best trained and \nthe best equipped in the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, before the Senator from Maine leaves the \nfloor, I wish to thank her for the extraordinary contribution she makes \nto our committee as well as to the Senate. She and I have worked long \ntogether, and we work extremely well together. We have seen a lot of \nthings that were able to get passed because of people working \ntogether--a lot of measures that can happen because people are willing \nto set aside partisanship--and she has been one of the leaders in \ngetting things done in this body and in the committee. I wish to thank \nher and tell her how grateful a chairman I am for her contribution.\n  We are working hard on the amendments she has offered. They are being \nworked on--last week and this week--and we will have something to \nreport to her, I hope, in the next few hours.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I wish to thank the committee chairman \nfor his extremely generous remarks. It has been a great pleasure to \nserve with him on the Armed Services Committee, and I very much \nappreciate his outstanding leadership.\n  Senator Levin and I actually go way back to when I was a staffer on \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee. I was a staff director of a \nsubcommittee on which he was the ranking member and chairman. It went \nback and forth with Senator Cohen. It has been a great honor and \npleasure to serve as his colleague during these past 15 years. So I \nappreciate his comments.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, if I may add one thing; that is, she has \nalso been my chairman, as well as the ranking member, on the Homeland \nSecurity Committee. So we have an awful lot of history together. I am \nglad she did not mention how many years it is we have been working \ntogether because that dates us a little bit. But we do go back a long \nway and have tremendous confidence in each other, as I do in her.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, am I correct that we are on the Defense \nauthorization bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1072\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, one of the amendments that have been \npending is the Leahy-Graham National Guard empowerment amendment, which \nis amendment No. 1072. I was just discussing with the distinguished \nleaders of the Armed Services Committee, Senators Levin and McCain, the \npossibility of a time to bring that amendment up for a vote. While we \nare in quorum calls anyway, let me talk a little bit about what the \namendment is.\n  Over the past decade, as we all know, the National Guard has \nundergone a profound change--actually, a historic change. Once, it was \na hollow force, considered only a strategic reserve for nightmare \ncontingencies, but the National Guard has become an operational reserve \nthat deploys in regular rotation with the Active-Duty Force. As a \nmatter of policy and reality, Army and Air National Guard troops from \nStates around the country shoulder their load overseas, but they also \ncarry a disproportionate share of the domestic response in disaster \nrelief missions at home, including responding to terrorist events. \nInstitutional support for the National Guard still lags behind its \noperational role.\n  When I have been on battlefields, whether Iraq, Afghanistan, or \nelsewhere, and I have talked to the commanders there, they do not know \nthe difference between, when looking at soldiers about to deploy, which \none is Guard and which one is regular force because they are deploying \ntogether and expected to do the same job. But, unfortunately, today's \nNational Guard is a superb 21st-century force trapped inside the 20th-\ncentury Pentagon bureaucracy.\n  Without raising the profile of the Chief of the National Guard Bureau \nin the supreme military advisory body of the Department of Defense, the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, the United States will miss an opportunity to \ncapitalize on positive changes that began in response to post-9/11 \noperations tempo. So our amendment makes that change, as well as \nseveral others that will enhance the Guard's effectiveness.\n  I may sound parochial, but I think of immediately after 9/11. We had \narmed F-16s flying guard over New York City around the clock, day after \nday. They were from the Vermont Air National Guard, and they maintained \ntheir readiness 7 days a week, 24 hours a day, protecting us because we \ndid not know what else might come. Well, I think just about every \nSenator here could talk about similar types of work the Guard from his \nor her State has done.\n  Now, in this period of flatlining or even declining Pentagon budgets, \nthe Department of Defense has to increase the role of the National \nGuard as an element of the overall force mix. Without the Chief of the \nNational Guard Bureau on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, among the other \nchanges made by this amendment, the unique experience of nearly half a \nmillion members of the National Guard will continue to be largely \nunknown, and their voices, their interests, and their concerns have \ngone mostly unheard. So the change is not only necessary, it is \nactually a decade overdue.\n  This amendment is not just out of the blue. It has 70 cosponsors. \nMore than two-thirds of the Senate support it. It is an overwhelmingly \nbipartisan majority of Senators. It goes across the political spectrum, \nand it goes across the States of this Nation. It demonstrates that the \nprovisions contained in this amendment, all of which empower the \nNational Guard, should be included in this year's National Defense \nAuthorization Act.\n  As I have said, I have been overseas. I know the distinguished \nPresiding Officer has. Most of us here have. We have watched our troops \noperate, and you cannot tell which troops are in the Guard and which \nare Active Duty. Certainly when they are out facing the enemy and \nputting their lives on the line, there is not a sign that says: Shoot \nat this one because they are Active but not this one because they are \nin the Guard. They are all facing the same dangers.\n  They stand and work side by side. We have to reflect our reality \ninside the Pentagon as well as outside of it on the battlefield.\n  I urge all of my colleagues, cosponsors and nonsponsors alike, to \njoin me in making sure the Guard finally has a voice commensurate with \nits operational role.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I rise today to speak \nbriefly about the fiscal year 2012 National Defense Authorization Act.\n  As a member of the Committee on Armed Services and as the ranking \nmember of the Subcommittee on Airland, I can say that it is one of the \nmost, if not the most, bipartisan committees in the Senate. As I have \nsaid many times before, we are Americans first, and it is fitting that \nthe Senate still works that way when it comes to providing the tools \nand resources for our men and women serving in uniform. We recently \nproved it when we passed the tax credit for unemployed veterans, \nsomething I was proud to sponsor, and was also proud to be at the White \nHouse for the signing ceremony a little over 1 week ago.\n\n[[Page S7897]]\n\n  I am proud of this bill as well, which represents a year's worth of \nhard work and devotion by Senators Levin and McCain, and all the \ncommittee members and their staffs, for their dedication to putting out \na topnotch bill. I want to also thank Senator Lieberman, chairman of \nthe Airland Subcommittee, for his committed leadership and effort on \nbehalf of our military and military families. I have been honored to \nwork with him and his staff throughout the year.\n  I believe we have developed thoughtful and informed provisions in our \nsubcommittee mark which will authorize funding for our military's most \ncrucial capabilities and resources. Our decisions were informed by a \nseries of hearings that addressed several critical issues facing our \nair and ground forces, including force structure, modernization of \nground forces, tactical aviation, and specifically the F-35 Joint \nStrike Fighter Program. In the end, I believe we achieved our goal of \nexecuting the Secretary of Defense's vision to enhance our Nation's \ncapability to fight the wars we are in today and to address scenarios \nwe are most likely to face in the future. We are hedging against other \nrisks and contingencies also.\n  I am also very proud that this bill includes an important provision \nbased on legislation I introduced with Senator Kelly Ayotte last \nFebruary, which is the No Contracting With the Enemy Act.\n  I had an opportunity to go in a codel to Pakistan-Afghanistan and met \nwith a lot of the leaders over there, then-General Petraeus and others, \nand had an opportunity to go back as a soldier recently still serving. \nSpeaking with General Allen and a lot of contracting generals, this by \nfar is the most important piece of legislation we can file when it \ncomes to dealing with funding. After speaking with General Petraeus, \nGeneral Allen, and all the generals in charge of contracting, I was \nshocked that we are actually unable to sever contracts once we \ndetermine, through the new way of paying of cash versus electronic \ntransfers, that we are actually in some instances contracting with the \nenemy which in turn is using those funds against our soldiers. We have \nheard many stories of those funds falling into Taliban hands and other \ninsurgents' hands and used against us. And that, quite frankly, is \nunacceptable. Can you imagine that our own troops would be forced to \ncontinue giving money to the enemy because they are unable to terminate \na contract? That makes absolutely no sense. So I was very thankful that \nthe committee chairs and ranking members recognized that this is a \ncritical part of the warfighting effort. As you can imagine, others I \nnoted have found it to be unacceptable as well. So I want to thank \nSenator Ayotte for her leadership. Obviously we can fight this \ndisgusting practice and give our troops the power to void any contracts \nwhen it is discovered that the contract benefits enemies of the United \nStates. As General Petraeus stated last year: If money is ammunition, \nwe need to make sure it gets into the right hands. And I couldn't agree \nwith that statement more.\n  The committee had to make some tough decisions in light of the very \nreal fiscal realities we are facing today. It is no secret that our \nmilitary is already shouldering a burden unlike in years past, not only \nat home but also abroad. In today's fiscal environment in which it is \nvery tough to get any dollars, our men and women in uniform stood up \nand stand up and have identified efficiencies and savings, and they \nshould be commended, and so I want to do that right now. I want to say \nthat any consideration of future cuts that place our Nation's \nmilitary's readiness in jeopardy should receive very serious scrutiny.\n  Lastly, I want to say that when the time comes, I look forward to \nsupporting and debating the amendment offered by the Senators from \nSouth Carolina and Vermont, Graham and Leahy, along with almost 70 \nother Senators who support this amendment. This would give the Chief of \nthe National Guard Bureau a seat at the table of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff. This could not be more overdue. I think we can all agree that \nover the past decade the National Guard has experienced momentous \nchange in the way it fights, in the way it trains, and in the way it \nequips itself, serving alongside their brothers and sisters in arms, \nand they deserve the same respect with the Joint Chiefs. As a result, \nthe Guard today is much different than the Guard I grew up with when I \njoined back in 1979. No longer is the Guard considered a strategic \nreserve used to address limited and unforeseen emergencies. Rather, \ntoday's Guard serves alongside its active-duty counterparts in Iraq, \nAfghanistan, Haiti, and many other strategic locations throughout the \nworld. It serves as the tip of the spear for homeland defense response \nand disaster relief. They are fighting in many areas overseas, and they \nare coming home with devastating injuries just like everybody else. \nTheir families are going through the trauma just like everybody else. \nThey fought and died in the war on terror, and they represent thousands \nof American communities across this great country. I look forward to \nsupporting this amendment when it comes forth.\n  That said, now that the bill is before the full Senate, I hope we \nwill have an opportunity to conduct meaningful debate, not shutting off \ndebate, not doing cloture before it is time, but allowing us to work as \nwe did recently when we passed the 3-percent withholding, a bill I \nsponsored, and also the HIRE a Hero Veterans Act, which I also \nsponsored. Those passed overwhelmingly without any dissenting votes.\n  I, like my colleagues, have offered several amendments which I feel \nare relevant to protecting and providing the tools and resources for \nour men and women who are serving. I look forward to working with the \nchairman and ranking member to have them considered appropriately.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1072\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Leahy-\nGraham amendment which hopefully we will vote on here soon.\n  The amendment is pretty simple. It says the Congress has decided, in \nits wisdom, to make the Chief of the National Guard Bureau a member of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n  In 1947, we reorganized our Defense Department and created the modern \nDepartment of Defense and the Joint Chiefs, with a chairman, which \nwould provide military advice to the Commander in Chief, the President \nof the United States. The Chairman is the person responsible for \nadvising the President, but the Joint Chiefs are made up of the Army, \nNavy, Air Force, and Marine Corps. With this legislation, the Chief of \nthe National Guard Bureau will become a member--nothing more, nothing \nless. It doesn't provide any power to the Chief of the National Guard \nBureau in terms of commanding troops. It doesn't interfere in the \nrelationship between the active forces, the Guard, or the Reserves. It \nsimply states that now is the time for the National Guard, the citizen \nsoldier, to have a voice on the Joint Chiefs.\n  The reason I believe it is important is after 9/11, everything about \nthe National Guard and our country's needs has changed. The National \nGuard is the front-line soldier/airman when it comes to natural \ndisasters. When our homeland is hit by natural disaster, they can be \ncalled up federally or at the State level they provide assistance to \nour citizens. We have seen the effects of natural disasters. There can \nbe a lot of loss of life and property. That is a unique duty. In the \nlast hurricane that came through in the Northeast, the Chief of the \nNational Guard Bureau said that no one from the White House called him, \nother than a mid-level operative, and he never interacted with the \nJoint Chiefs at all about the needs and capability of the Guard.\n\n  General Dempsey, the new Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, has invited \nGeneral McKinley, the Chief of the National Guard Bureau, to be an ad \nhoc member. That is great. But I asked him, if he somehow fell out of \nfavor, could you kick him out of the room, and the answer is, Yes.\n  I think Congress needs to make a decision about the role of the \ncitizen soldier. If you believe, as I do, that they are indispensable \non fighting the war on terror, they have some leading missions when it \ncomes to homeland security post-9/11, their voice needs to be heard. \nThe active-duty forces need to have the Chief of the National Guard \nBureau in that room advising them\n\n[[Page S7898]]\n\nabout the capability and readiness of the National Guard, their dual-\nstatus capabilities, what they can do at the State level and the \nFederal level.\n  I guess I can boil it down to this. To me, it was a national shame \nand disgrace to deploy National Guard troops after 9/11 without \nadequate body armor or equipment, and this will make it very hard for \nthat to happen again because the Chief of the National Guard Bureau \nwill be in the room with his counterparts talking about the needs of \nthis force. Hopefully, the coordination and collaboration through this \nnew change will allow the force to be ready, deployable, and we will \nnever go back to that time period in our history where the Guard and \nReserve were called up without adequate equipment, body armor, ready to \ngo to war. This is a change that I think makes sense post-9/11. It \ndoesn't interfere with the day-to-day operations of the military. It \ndoesn't confer any power on the National Guard they don't already have. \nIt is just one more voice at the table at a time when I think that \nvoice needs to be heard. The world has changed. Our Nation's defense \nneeds have changed post-9/11.\n  We have 67 cosponsors, and I am very proud of the fact that this is \none of the most bipartisan pieces of legislation I have ever been \ninvolved with. Senator Leahy has been a great partner, my cochairman of \nthe Guard caucus, and I look forward to having the vote.\n  Senators McCain and Levin have done a great job managing this bill. \nIf you have amendments, please work with these two gentlemen. We don't \nwant this Congress to go down in history as being the first Congress in \n51 years that could not pass a Defense authorization bill. We have \nenough things going against us already as a Congress. We don't want to \nadd that to the list. So Senator Leahy and myself are willing to do \nthis by voice vote, whatever the body wishes.\n  Senator Reed, my good friend from Rhode Island, has a second-degree \namendment that basically takes our legislation and defeats the purpose \nof it. Senator Webb has a second-degree amendment that would substitute \na membership and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs with a reporting \nrequirement that, quite frankly, misses the mark. Both are fine men.\n  Senator Webb argued years ago that the Marine Corps needs to be a \nmember of the Joint Chiefs, and everybody thought the Navy would have \ntwo votes and they fought passionately against it, and it has worked \nout pretty well. So all the problems with making the Marine Corps a \nmember of the Joint Chiefs haven't panned out. Goldwater-Nichols was \nfought by everybody except the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs when it was \nfirst introduced. So change comes hard to the Pentagon.\n  This is a change that I think makes common sense. I would say, after \n9/11, our citizen soldiers deserve this recognition. This would be a \ngreat step forward in making sure they are integrated and they never go \nto war again unless they are prepared to go. Having that voice day in \nand day out in the tank I think will do everybody a lot of good. So I \nhope we can vote on this soon. I appreciate Senators McCain and Levin's \nleadership on this bill. I think we have a good bill for our men and \nwomen in uniform, and I look forward to bringing this to the floor for \na vote.\n  To my colleagues who want to amend the bill, I appreciate the \ndifferences that we have but I think the time has come for the National \nGuard to be a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, with a full voice \nand ability to be heard as they have never been heard before. The \nreason they need to be heard unlike any other time is that we depend on \nthem unlike any other time, except maybe the first engagement. When you \nlook at who has been around the longest, the first shot fired in \ncreating this Nation was fired by the citizen soldier. Two hundred-\nsomething years later, let's make sure that they are integrated into \nour defense infrastructure at the highest levels, because their voice \nneeds to be heard.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/28/senate-section/article/S7898-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7898-S7902]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF CHRISTOPHER DRONEY TO BE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR \n                           THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Christopher Droney, of \nConnecticut, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Second Circuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 30 \nminutes for debate equally divided and controlled in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today we in the Senate will confirm \nJudge Christopher Droney to be U.S. Circuit Judge, Second Circuit. This \nwill be the fifth nominee of President Obama to be confirmed to this \ncircuit, the Second Circuit. In just 3 years, President Obama has \nmatched the number of President Bush's nominees confirmed to the Second \nCircuit over his entire 8 years in office.\n  With this vote, the Senate will have confirmed 57 article III \njudicial nominees during this Congress. This is a great accomplishment \nconsidering only six sessions of Congress in the last 30 years have \nconfirmed more judicial nominees. In total, over 71 percent of \nPresident Obama's judicial nominees have been confirmed.\n  The seat to which Judge Droney is nominated has been deemed to be a \njudicial emergency. This will be the 31st judicial emergency nominee to \nbe confirmed this year. This seat became vacant in July 2009 when Judge \nCalabresi took senior status. The President first nominated Judge \nChatigny to this vacancy. Judge Chatigny is a sitting U.S. district \njudge in Connecticut. However, after reviewing his record the Senate \ndetermined that Judge Chatigny should not be elevated, and his \nnomination was returned to the White House at the end of the 111th \nCongress. The President did not renominate Judge Chatigny and instead \nsent us the nomination of the person we are considering today, Judge \nDroney.\n  I raise this bit of history to remind the Senate and those who watch \nour proceedings of the importance of the role of advice and consent by \nthe Senate, necessary for someone to become a judge. We in the Senate \nand historically are not here to simply rubberstamp the President's \nnominees. Even as we give the President's nominees a thorough review, \nwe are doing so in a very reasonable timeframe. During President Bush's \nadministration, circuit nominees were forced to wait on average 247 \ndays for a hearing. President Obama's circuit court nominees have had \ntheir hearings on average in just 66 days. The same can be said of \nPresident Bush's district court nominees, who waited 120 days compared \nto only 79 days for President Obama's district court nominees.\n  In addition, we have reported nominees in a more timely manner. \nCircuit court nominees have been reported on average in just 113 days \ncompared to 369 days for President Bush's nominees. President Obama's \ndistrict court nominees have been reported in just 128 days compared to \n148 days for President Bush's nominees.\n  Furthermore, for those who still contend that President Bush's \nnominees are being treated unfairly, let me point out that we have \nreported a higher percentage of judicial nominees to the full Senate \ncompared to this point in President Bush's Presidency. Seventy-six \npercent of President Obama's judicial nominees have been reported to \ndate. At this point in President Bush's Presidency only 71 percent were \nreported.\n  Having set the record straight on the work and progress of this \ncommittee, I will tell my colleagues why they should vote for Judge \nDroney to be a circuit judge for the Second Circuit.\n  Upon graduation from the University of Connecticut School of Law, and \nthat was in 1979, Judge Droney joined the Hartford firm of Day, Berry & \nHoward and was responsible for civil matters such as personal injury \ndefense, product liability, antitrust and corporate disputes. In 1981, \nJudge Droney joined the law department of Aetna Life & Casualty for a \nbrief period, working on investment matters.\n\n[[Page S7899]]\n\n  Following his time at Aetna, he joined the private law firm of \nBudkley & Santos, which specialized in complex civil and criminal trial \nwork. In 1984, Judge Droney joined the Hartford law firm of Reid and \nReige. He became a stockholder and officer in 1987 and was a member of \nthe firm's trial department for 9 years.\n  As U.S. attorney for the District of Connecticut from 1993 to 1997, \nJudge Droney personally tried two cases, including the prosecution of \nthe leadership of the Ku Klux Klan in Connecticut, and argued three \nappeals in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.\n  President Clinton nominated Judge Droney to be U.S. district judge \nfor the District of Connecticut June 5, 1997. The Senate voted 100 to 0 \nto confirm his nomination on September 11, 1997. As a U.S. district \njudge, he has presided over approximately 3,600 cases and over \napproximately 60 trials. All in all, Judge Droney's legal career \nincludes 14 years in private practice litigation, 4 years as U.S. \nattorney, and 14 years as a Federal judge.\n  The American Bar Association Standing Committee on the Federal \nJudiciary has rated Judge Droney with a unanimous ``well qualified'' \nrating. I ask my colleagues to support the nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator \nfrom Iowa. I appreciate his help in getting the Droney nomination \nmoving forward. I do appreciate his help moving these forward.\n  Today, I am especially pleased that the Senate will have the \nopportunity to vote on the nomination of Judge Christopher Droney of \nConnecticut to fill a longstanding vacancy on the Second Circuit, which \nhandles appeals from Federal courts in Vermont, Connecticut and New \nYork. Senator Blumenthal deserves special praise for his efforts to \nmove this nomination through the Committee process. Both Senator \nBlumenthal and Senator\nLieberman support this nomination.\n  I thank the majority leader for securing a vote on this nomination. I \nhave been urging a vote on this consensus nominee for weeks; his \nnomination has been stalled and has been repeatedly skipped over for no \ngood reason. Despite the long standing judicial emergency, Senate \nRepublicans have refused until now to consent to take up Judge Droney's \nnomination, delaying the Senate from considering it for more than 4 \nmonths.\n  Judge Droney will fill a judicial emergency vacancy on the Second \nCircuit, a vacancy that has existed for well over 2 years. The \nRepublican members of the Judiciary Committee opposed President Obama's \nfirst nominee to fill this vacancy and effectively ended the nomination \nof Judge Bob Chatigny when they voted against him on a party-line basis \nlast year and insisted that his nomination be returned to the President \nwithout Senate confirmation. I regret that because I know Judge \nChatigny to be an outstanding Federal district court judge and am sure \nhe would have been an outstanding circuit judge, as well. That \nopposition was not only unfair to Judge Chatigny, but it served to \nperpetuate this vacancy for an additional year.\n  Judge Droney's nomination was considered at a hearing of the \nJudiciary Committee in June and then reported unanimously by the \nCommittee to the Senate in July. It has been needlessly stalled since \nthen, despite the fact that all Republican, as well as all Democratic, \nmembers of the Committee support this nomination. Now that the \nRepublican leadership is finally allowing consideration of this \nnomination after a needless, additional 4-month delay, I am certain the \nSenate will act to confirm Judge Droney.\n  Judge Droney is an experienced jurist with nearly 15 years of \nexperience as a Federal judge in the District of Connecticut, a court \nto which he was confirmed by the Senate in 1997. He has handled \nthousands of cases, and has frequently sat by designation on the \ncircuit court to which he is nominated. Prior to joining the Federal \nbench, Judge Droney was the U.S. Attorney for the District of \nConnecticut, where he helped the office achieve over 150 gang-related \nconvictions and received national recognition for his efforts to \nsupport community crime-prevention programs. He spent 14 years as a \nlitigator in private practice, and was mayor of West Hartford, \nConnecticut. Judge Droney received the highest possible rating from the \nAmerican Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary, \nunanimously ``well qualified.'' As I have already noted, he is \nsupported by both his home State Senators.\n  While we will vote tonight on Judge Droney's nomination, I am \ndisappointed that the Senate Republican leadership would not agree to a \nvote on the other 22 judicial nominees waiting for final Senate action. \nAll of the judicial nominees on the Senate calendar are qualified and \nhave the support of their home State Senators. They include other \njudicial emergency vacancies. One of those and one on which I have been \nurging immediate action would be filled by a vote on the nomination of \nMorgan Christen of Alaska. She is nominated to fill one of the many \nvacancies on the Ninth Circuit. Her nomination, too, was reported \nunanimously and has the support of her home state Senators--one a \nRepublican, the other a Democrat. The almost 2 months that action on \nher nomination has been delayed is inexcusable and damaging.\n  We continue to hear from chief judges about the overburdened courts \nin their districts and circuits. Most recently, we heard from Chief \nJudge Audrey Collins of the Central District of California and Chief \nJudge Anne Conway of the Middle District of Florida. In a recent letter \nto Senate leaders, Bill Robinson, the president of the American Bar \nAssociation, warned of the detrimental effect of excessive vacancies \nand high caseloads. Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy, Chief Justice \nRoberts, the Attorney General and the White House counsel have also \nwarned of the serious problems created by persistent judicial \nvacancies. This is an issue affecting millions of hardworking Americans \nwho are denied justice when their cases are delayed by overburdened \ncourts.\n  Despite the high number of vacancies that has persisted throughout \nPresident Obama's term, some Republican Senators have tried to excuse \ntheir delay in taking up nominations by suggesting that the Senate is \ndoing better than we did during the first 3 years of President Bush's \nadministration. That is simply not true. It is wrong to suggest that \nthe Senate has achieved better results than we did in 2001 through \n2003.\n  As I have pointed out, in the 17 months I chaired the Judiciary \nCommittee in 2001 and 2002, the Senate confirmed 100 of President \nBush's Federal circuit and district court nominees. By contrast, after \nthe first 2 years of President Obama's administration, the Senate was \nallowed to proceed to confirm only 60 of his Federal circuit and \ndistrict court nominees. This lack of progress led to the longest \nperiod of historically high vacancies in the last 35 years.\n  The 58 circuit and district court nominations we have confirmed thus \nfar this year is still behind the 68 we confirmed in the third year of \nPresident George W. Bush's first term. What makes the claim of progress \neven more misleading is that of the nominations confirmed this year, 17 \ncould have and should have been confirmed when they were reported by \nthe Judiciary Committee last year. Instead, it took us until June of \nthis year to consider and finally confirm those nominees. Even \nincluding these nominees on this year's total, the Senate's progress \nthis year barely cracks the top 10 years for confirmed nominees in the \nlast 35 years.\n  The truth is that the actions of the Senate Republican leadership in \nstalling judicial nominations during President Obama's first 2 years \nled to confirmation of fewer judges, leading to high vacancy numbers \nacross the country. The Republican leadership allowed the Senate to \nconfirm only 47 circuit and district court nominations last year and \nset the modern record for fewest nominations confirmed with only 13 the \nyear before--a total of 60 nominees confirmed in President Obama's \nfirst two years in office--leading to judicial vacancies that stood at \n97 at the start of this year. In stark contrast, at the start of \nPresident Bush's third year, 2003, judicial vacancies stood at only 60 \nbecause the Senate had confirmed 72 of\n\n[[Page S7900]]\n\nhis circuit and district court nominations the year before, and 28 in \nhis first year in office, a total of 100 in the 17 months prior to 2003 \nwith a Democratic majority.\n  The 100 circuit and district court nominations we confirmed in \nPresident Bush's first 2 years leading to a vacancy total of 60 at the \nbeginning of his third year is almost a complete reverse of the 60 the \nSenate was allowed to confirm in President Obama's first 2 years, \nleading to nearly 100 vacancies at the start of 2011. Yet, even \nfollowing those years of real progress, in 2003 we proceeded to confirm \nmore judicial nominations than there were vacancies at the start of \nthat year, and reduced vacancies even further.\n  By the end of President Bush's first term, the Senate had confirmed \n205 district and circuit nominees. So far, the Senate has confirmed \nonly 118 of President Obama's district and circuit nominees. To make \nreal progress this year, the Senate needs to consider the other 22 \njudicial nominations pending on the Senate calendar and the 4 \nadditional judicial nominees who can be reported by the Judiciary \nCommittee in December after participating in our hearings in November. \nSenate action on those 26 nominees before adjournment would go a long \nway to help resolve the longstanding judicial vacancies that are \ndelaying justice for so many Americans in our Federal courts across the \ncountry.\n  With less than 4 weeks left before Senate adjourns for the year, we \nneed to consider at least 7 judges every week in order to begin to \ncatch up and erase the backlog that has developed from the delays in \nthe consideration of consensus nominees caused by the Senate Republican \nleadership.\n  We should not end another year with the Senate Republican leadership \nrefusing to give final consideration to qualified judicial nominees and \ninsisting that those nominations be returned to the President to begin \nthe process all over again. Such delaying tactics are a disservice to \nthe American people. The Senate should fulfill its constitutional duty \nand ensure the ability of our Federal courts to provide justice to \nAmericans around the country.\n\n\n                         Violence Against Women\n\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that on Wednesday, Senator Crapo and I \nwill introduce the bipartisan Violence Against Women Reauthorization \nAct of 2011. For almost 18 years, the Violence Against Women Act, VAWA, \nhas been the centerpiece of the Federal Government's commitment to \ncombat domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and \nstalking. I am honored to help lead the effort to see it reauthorized.\n  Since its passage in 1994 no other piece of legislation has done more \nto stop domestic and sexual violence in our communities. The resources \nand training provided by VAWA have changed attitudes toward these \nreprehensible crimes. They have improved the response of law \nenforcement and the justice system. They have provided essential \nservices for victims struggling to rebuild their lives. It is a law \nthat has saved countless lives and it is an example of what we can \naccomplish when we work together.\n  Years ago, when I was a prosecutor in Vermont, I saw firsthand the \ndestruction caused by domestic and sexual violence. Those were the days \nbefore VAWA when too often people dismissed these serious crimes with a \njoke and there were few if any services for victims. I looked around \ndesperately trying to find somewhere to help the victims. There were no \nservices. I had to call people to volunteer. My wife and I oftentimes \npaid for the expenses of taking care of victims.\n  It was the same everywhere around the country. We have come a long \nway since then, but there is much more that we can do. I would love to \nsay there is no more domestic violence, and we do not need this, but we \nknow there are thousands upon thousands of cases that have to be \nresolved.\n  Over the last few years the Judiciary Committee has held several \nhearings on VAWA in anticipation of this reauthorization. We have heard \nfrom people from all over the country. They have told us the same \nthings I hear from service providers, experts and law enforcement \nofficials in Vermont: While we have made great strides in reducing \ndomestic violence and sexual assault, these difficult problems remain. \nThere is more work to be done.\n  The victim services funded by VAWA play a particularly critical role \nin these difficult economic times. The economic pressures of a lost job \nor home can add stress to an already abusive relationship and can make \nit harder for victims to rebuild their lives.\n  At the same time, State budget cuts are resulting in fewer available \nservices. Just this summer, Topeka, KS, took the drastic, almost \nunbelievable step of decriminalizing domestic violence because the city \ndid not have the funds needed to prosecute these cases. In other words, \nno matter how badly someone is beaten or abused or violated, they say: \nSorry we cannot prosecute this case. We cannot afford to.\n  We have to do better than that. How do we tell a battered, bruised \nand beaten victim: Sorry, change the locks on your door or try not to \nstay at home because they usually come back and do it again; but there \nis nothing we can do to help you? I cannot believe this country has \ncome to that.\n  Budgets are tight, but it is unacceptable to turn our backs on these \nvictims. For many, the programs funded by the Violence Against Women \nAct are nothing short of a lifeline. I mean just that, a lifeline, \nbecause it has saved lives.\n  The reauthorization that Senator Crapo and I will introduce on \nWednesday will reflect the ongoing commitment of Congress to end \ndomestic and sexual violence. It seeks to expand the law's focus on \nsexual assault to assure access to services for all victims of domestic \nand sexual violence and to address the crisis of domestic and sexual \nviolence in tribal communities, among other important steps.\n  It also responds to these difficult economic times by consolidating \nprograms, reducing authorization levels, and adding accountability \nmeasures to ensure that Federal funds are used efficiently and \neffectively.\n  The Violence Against Women Act has been successful because it has \nconsistently had strong bipartisan support for nearly two decades. I am \nhonored to work with Senator Crapo to build on that foundation. I hope \nSenators from both parties will vote to quickly pass this critical \nreauthorization to provide safety and security for victims across \nAmerica.\n  All anyone has to do is read the transcripts of some of the hearings \nwe have had on this issue. Where people like the distinguished \nPresiding Officer and myself and others who served in law enforcement \nor served as prosecutors--we know it goes way beyond just statistics. \nThese are people who have been violated, who turn to their country, to \ntheir government for help, for safety. Don't let the Senate say: No. We \nare going to close the door in your face.\n\n  I see the distinguished senior Senator from Connecticut, and I will \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair, and I thank my friend and \ncolleague, the distinguished chair of the Judiciary Committee, for his \nkindness.\n  Mr. President, as the Speaker sometimes says in the House, it is \nreally a high honor and great personal privilege--with the emphasis on \n``personal''--to come to the floor of the Senate to give my strong \nsupport to the nomination of Judge Christopher Droney of West Hartford, \nCT, to serve as U.S. Circuit Judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nSecond Circuit. I say it is a high honor because I have profound \nconfidence based on Judge Droney's service as a private attorney, a \nU.S. attorney, and now for quite a while as a member of the district \ncourt in Connecticut. I have great confidence that he will make an \nexcellent addition to this very important court, the U.S. court for the \nSecond Circuit.\n  I say it is a great personal privilege to be able to speak on behalf \nof his nomination because, as the occupant of the chair, my colleague \nfrom Connecticut, knows well, I have known Chris Droney for a long time \nnow. He and his brother John have been very good friends of mine, great \nsupporters, great sources of counsel, great friends. Both are graduates \nof the College of Holy Cross. The older brother John, who has less of a \njudicial temperament than the younger brother Chris--fortunately, we \nare approving Chris here for the court, not John. But John tells me, \nhaving been to Holy Cross, it is still\n\n[[Page S7901]]\n\npolitically acceptable to note that the graduates of Holy Cross \nconsider themselves Crusaders. Both John and Chris Droney have been \ncrusaders for what is right in the best sense of the word. I value \ntheir personal friendship. We have gone through a lot together, not \njust in politics, but I have seen their families grow.\n  I have gotten to know their families. I know what they are made of. \nWe have gone through the natural lifecycle tragedies of losing parents, \net cetera, together.\n  Chris Droney is a person of real depth and real ability and will make \nan excellent judge. So I stress the personal part because it adds a \ndimension that you and I both, Mr. President, have had the opportunity \nto have, which is, beyond the resume of Chris Droney, which I am going \nto mention in a moment, there is a person here, and he is a person who \nexemplifies what we mean when we talk about a judicial temperament, who \nwe know has a great intellect, tremendous legal acumen, who we know is \nhard-working, and who we know brings common sense to everything he has \ndone.\n  I mentioned John Droney just because they go together as brothers, \nand there is nothing that matters more to John--the older and obviously \nless attractive of the two--than the pride he has in his brother's \nachievements, though John himself, of course, has been a very \nsuccessful and distinguished member of the bar in Connecticut. So let \nme focus on the younger brother, who is the subject of our \nconsideration today.\n  I mentioned that Judge Droney attended the College of Holy Cross in \nMassachusetts, from which he graduated magna cum laude in 1976. He went \non to attend the University of Connecticut Law School, where he was the \nnotes and comments editor on the Law Review, and earned his J.D.--\ndoctor of jurisprudence--in 1979.\n  After graduating from law school, he worked in private practice as a \nlitigation associate handling a range of matters, mostly civil at that \npoint. In 1983, he became a partner at the well-respected law firm of \nReid and Riege in Hartford, where he represented clients in a wide \nrange of civil matters, including commercial disputes, personal injury \nactions, property claims, and intellectual property matters. Judge \nDroney personally tried cases in the Connecticut Superior Court, the \nU.S. district court in Connecticut, and argued appeals in the \nConnecticut Appellate and Supreme Courts and in the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Second Circuit, the court for which he is being \nconsidered today.\n  During this period, Judge Droney, like his brother, was involved in \npublic life in Connecticut and served, in his case, on the town council \nof West Hartford as deputy mayor from 1983 to 1985 and as mayor from \n1985 to 1989.\n  In 1993, President Clinton nominated Chris Droney to be the U.S. \nattorney for the District of Connecticut, where he served with great \ndistinction and affect until 1997. As U.S. attorney, he initiated new \ncooperative law enforcement efforts against gangs, health care fraud, \nand financial fraud, in addition to personally trying some major cases \nin Connecticut and across New England and successfully arguing cases \nbefore the Second Circuit Court of Appeals--again, the court he is \nbeing considered for today in a vote that will occur shortly.\n  Judge Droney was selected by then-Attorney General Janet Reno to \nserve on the Attorney General's Advisory Committee of U.S. Attorneys in \nwhich he was one of 17 U.S. attorneys selected to assist the Department \nof Justice on a range of pressing matters.\n  In 1997, after 4 years as U.S. attorney, Chris Droney was nominated \nto the district court in Connecticut by President Clinton and I might \nsay for the second time was confirmed unanimously by this Senate. Since \nthen, as a district court judge, he has presided over numerous Federal, \ncivil, and criminal trials and has consistently demonstrated sound \njudgment and great legal acumen in his many decisions covering an array \nof complex and sensitive matters. Judge Droney's career speaks to a \nprofound commitment to the rule of law and the credibility of the legal \nsystem.\n  I know there is a tendency to want to find out, is this judge a \nliberal, is he a conservative, is he a conservative? I don't think you \ncan put a label on Judge Droney. Some might say he is a moderate. \nOthers might say he is an Independent. I think he is known as somebody \nwho is fair and will take every case as it comes along and decide it on \nthe merits.\n  So now he has been nominated to serve on the Second Circuit Court of \nAppeals. I want to personally express my thanks first to President \nObama for submitting his nomination for this very esteemed court and \nsecondly to our colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, both of whom \nhave been kind enough to be on the floor and speak on his behalf, \nSenator Leahy, who is chairman of the committee, and Senator Grassley, \nthe ranking member. I was particularly grateful for Senator Grassley's \ncomments about Judge Droney's capabilities. This is a good man who \nbelieves in the law and is tremendously experienced.\n  Incidentally, he sat as a visiting judge on the Second Circuit Court \nof Appeals and has actually written, I believe, five opinions for the \nSecond Circuit Court of Appeals already. So this is somebody who will \nhit the ground running with the support of the Senate this afternoon.\n  I will repeat what I said at the beginning. It is not only a high \nhonor and one that I don't take lightly but also a great personal \nprivilege to urge my colleagues to support the nomination of Judge \nChristopher Droney of Connecticut to be a member of the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Second Circuit.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lieberman). The Chair recognizes the \nSenator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I ask that the order for the quorum call be \nrescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I am honored to follow the senior \nSenator from Connecticut--rising now as the junior Senator from \nConnecticut--for the same purpose: to urge my colleagues to approve \nChristopher Droney as a judge on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. I \nalso would like to join in thanking the chairman and ranking member of \nthe Judiciary Committee for bringing this nomination to the floor.\n  Incidentally, I wish to join in Senator Leahy's very eloquent remarks \non the Violence Against Women Act, which I too will support after it is \nintroduced. The reauthorization is very much needed, particularly at \nthis point in our history, and I thank him for taking the leadership on \nthis issue as on so many.\n  I thank the senior Senator from Connecticut for championing this \nnomination, and I thank our colleague, the majority leader, Harry Reid, \nwho is extraordinarily insightful and sensitive to the importance of \njudicial nominations since he is a lawyer himself--and a very skilled \nand able one--and has supported this nomination.\n  Today is a very meaningful one for me personally, almost a magical \nand very momentous moment to stand in this historic and hallowed place \nand participate in the approval of a man whom I have known for more \nthan 30 years to a position of the utmost importance, a position of \ntrust and responsibility as important as any in this land, and a person \nof supremely well-recognized qualifications and experience for this \nposition. Indeed, his life has been almost a preparation for this \nchapter in his career.\n  I am privileged and honored to have been a colleague and friend and \nprofessional ally of his for more than 30 years. I have known him since \nhis graduation from law school in 1979. We were in litigation together \nin private practice. When I was U.S. attorney for Connecticut and later \nattorney general, we worked together. Indeed, when he was U.S. \nattorney, following my service, we were partners in law enforcement in \na number of cases. I had the direct and immediate experience of seeing \nmany of his prosecutions, his intensity of commitment not just to a \nsuccessful investigation and prosecution but his commitment to doing \njustice, which is the highest calling of a prosecutor--indeed, of any \nlawyer.\n\n[[Page S7902]]\n\n  When he became a judge, I had the honor of appearing before him, \npresenting witnesses, arguing cases, and to have firsthand experience \nagain with the quality of his professional work.\n  I have to admit my office as attorney general did not win every case. \nWe lost some. But whether we won or lost, we emerged from those \nexperiences with an unqualified respect for the quality of his fact-\nfinding, his scholarship and, again, his commitment to doing justice.\n  He has demonstrated as a district court judge the qualities I know he \nwill bring to the court of appeals: extraordinary scholarship and \nintellect, an adherence to precedent, a careful analysis of the law, a \nthoughtfulness and responsiveness in the questions he asks, and an \ninsight into the factual record as well as the truthfulness of \nwitnesses. He has what I consider to be the most important \nqualification for any judge, which is a capacity for growth, for \nlearning and listening. He is, above all, a good listener, a sensitive \nand responsive listener. He has indeed the qualities that are \nexemplified by the man he will be replacing--Guido Calabresi--a judge \nknown to the senior Senator from Connecticut as well as myself; indeed, \na teacher of mine when I was at Yale Law School and I believe very \npossibly of the senior Senator as well--a person of exquisite \nsensitivity and sensibility and common sense. Those are the qualities \nof Christopher Droney: sensibility, sensitivity and common sense, and \nhe shares with Guido Calabresi the grace of writing and sense of \nhistory that are so important to the Court of Appeals for the Second \nCircuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All debate time has expired.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I am proud to join in supporting this nomination. I \nwish him well, and I ask my colleagues to join in approving him when \nthe vote is taken. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the nomination of Judge \nChristopher Droney.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Christopher Droney, of Connecticut, to be United States Circuit \nJudge for the Second Circuit?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

By then we hope to have a unanimous consent agreement that \nwould be universal in nature.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1072\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will not use all my time, by any means. I \nspoke earlier about this. I appreciate the courtesy of the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Arizona.\n  Senator Graham and I, as cochairs of the National Guard Caucus, \nintroduced amendment No. 1072. I spoke earlier this afternoon about it, \nso I will not speak longer on it, except to say the amendment is long \noverdue. The men and women of our Guard deserve the same recognition as \neveryone else in uniform. It is high time we made sure they receive it.\n  Senator Graham has been a close and valued partner in helping us \nbring about this bipartisan piece of legislation. Republicans and \nDemocrats across the political spectrum have cosponsored it.\n  I will close with this. The Senator from Arizona has been in war \nzones probably more than I ever will in my lifetime. The Senator from \nSouth Carolina certainly has been in Iraq and Afghanistan more than \nmost Members of this body. But I think every one of us who has been in \na war zone knows this. We see soldiers going out to face battle. Nobody \nknows whether they are members of the Guard or the regular forces. \nCertainly those who would do harm to our men and women in uniform do \nnot say we will do different harm to members of the Guard or members of \nthe regular forces. I say this because they all put their lives on the \nline. They all go through training. And we could not field the forces \nour Department of Defense is called upon to field without our Guard and \nReserve. So I do hope the Leahy-Graham amendment No. 1072 will pass.\n  I yield to Senator Graham.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I want to thank both Senators McCain and \nLevin for organizing this debate on this amendment in a way that maybe\n\n[[Page S7903]]\n\nwe can get closure on this amendment tonight. Both our ranking member \nand the chairman have been very helpful in pushing an amendment forward \nwhere we have 71 cosponsors.\n  To Senator Leahy, I want to say it has been a real privilege and joy \nworking with you on this. We had 71 Members of the Senate sign onto the \nlegislation, and it is simple. It says the Chief of the National Guard \nBureau will now be a member of the Joint Chiefs. What does that mean in \nthe real world? It means the citizen soldier's voice will be heard at \nthe highest levels of our government.\n  After 1947, we reorganized the Defense Department. It became the \nmodern Defense Department with the Joint Chiefs, where we have \nrepresentatives from the Marine Corps, the Air Force, the Army, and the \nNavy, and now the citizen soldier. Why is that important? After 9/11, \nthe Guard's role in defending this Nation changed substantially. The \nGuard and Reserves--but particularly the Guard, on the front lines of \nhomeland security defense--have dual missions. They are the first to \nanswer a natural disaster that hits America in uniform. They are the \nfront-line troops. They have been integrated into the Army and Air \nForce in a fashion where they were deployed constantly to war zones.\n  The citizen soldier fired the first shot to create this Republic, and \nnow is the time to recognize the role they play post 9/11. The real \nreason we want this is because we want a line of communication that is \nuninterrupted. We want to make sure the Guard and Reserve component, \nbut through the Guard particularly, are recognized as an integral part \nof our national security, State and Federal.\n  The idea is that in the next war a Guard unit from Vermont, South \nCarolina, Connecticut--you name the State--would go to war without body \narmor to keep people safe, without the equipment they need to fight in \nthe war is less likely to happen if we have the Chief of the National \nGuard Bureau in the tank with his colleagues talking about the needs of \nthe National Guard. This doesn't change the legal structure. It doesn't \nprovide command authority to the National Guard Chief. It simply puts \nhim or her in the room, giving voice to the citizen soldier at a time \nwe need it.\n  I cannot thank Senator Leahy enough, and all those at the National \nGuard associations throughout the country, who called their Congressmen \nand their Senators. This bill passed the House, and now it will be \nadopted, hopefully by voice vote.\n  I can tell you in the world in which we live, in the 21st century, \nhaving the guardsman's voice inside the Joint Chiefs is going to make \nus a safer Nation. It is a recognition and honor well deserved, long \noverdue, and I want to thank all my colleagues who have made this \npossible.\n  And to the managers of this bill--the chairman and the ranking \nmember--I want to thank you for accommodating us.\n  To all my colleagues, come down here and work with Senators McCain \nand Levin on your amendments. Because we don't want to be the Congress \nfor the first time in 51 years that failed to pass the Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  With that, I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would join the Senator from South \nCarolina in thanking Senator Levin, the chair of the Armed Services \nCommittee, and Senator McCain, the ranking member, who worked closely \nwith us. But I must say again, my good friend from South Carolina, I \nthink even as late as a week ago, in the meeting we had with the \nSecretary of Defense, talked about this need.\n  We have tried not to show any light between one Republican and one \nDemocrat but to do what was best here. I want to see the Senate get \nback to the days when Republicans and Democrats work together like \nthat. But I thank the distinguished Senators from Michigan and Arizona \nfor their help.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of quorum.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator from South Carolina yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Since, apparently, this amendment will be passed and \nsigned by the President, is the Senator from South Carolina interested \nin being the head of the----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Vermont withdraw his \nrequest for a quorum call?\n  Mr. LEAHY. For debate only.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I don't seek recognition.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I think I know where the Senator was going, and the \nanswer will be no. The Guard has enough challenges without promoting \nme.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the pending McConnell \namendment No. 1084 and the pending Menendez amendment No. 1292 be \nwithdrawn and it be in order for the majority leader or his designee to \ncall up the Menendez-Kirk amendment No. 1414; that notwithstanding \ncloture being invoked, if invoked, that at a time to be determined by \nthe majority leader, after consultation with the Republican leader, and \nprior to the vote on passage of the Defense authorization bill, there \nbe up to 1 hour of debate equally divided in the usual form on the \nMenendez-Kirk amendment; that upon the use or yielding back of that \ntime, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the Menendez-Kirk \namendment; further, that no amendments, motions, or points of order be \nin order to the amendment prior to the vote other than budget points of \norder and the applicable motions to waive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I wish to thank the majority leader for \nworking very hard to see that we could move forward with this \nlegislation and reach an agreement on a very significant issue.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, pursuant to that unanimous consent order \nthat was just entered, I now would call up the Menendez-Kirk amendment \nNo. 1414.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin], for Mr. Menendez and \n     Mr. Kirk, proposes an amendment numbered 1414.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text \nof Amendments.'')\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, that amendment now I guess would return to \nthe position that it has under the unanimous consent agreement that was \njust entered; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment the Senator just called up is \npending at this time. Does the Senator wish to return to the regular \norder?\n  Mr. LEVIN. What is the regular order now that we are going back to \nit?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order is the Senator's amendment \nNo. 1092.\n  Mr. LEVIN. And that is the Levin-McCain amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Correct.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1092\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that we proceed immediately to the \nLeahy-Graham amendment on the National Guard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate on the \namendment,\n\n[[Page S7904]]\n\nwithout objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1072) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we now have an understanding with Senator \nUdall that he would be recognized first tomorrow morning to call up \namendment No. 1107.\n  I ask unanimous consent that when we come in tomorrow morning, \nSenator Udall be recognized after the leaders are recognized to call up \nthat amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. It is my understanding that Senator Udall has also agreed \nto a half hour equally divided--debate, equally divided?\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is my understanding.\n  We will leave that issue for the closing statement, that he be \nrecognized. First, I agree with the Senator from Arizona that we agree \nthere be a half hour equally divided on the amendment. But let's leave \nthe exact wording on that for the closing.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley).

Mr. President, I wish to speak to mark the passing of \nFrederik Meijer, one of Michigan's most distinguished leaders in \nbusiness and philanthropy. Barbara and I were saddened to learn of his \npassing on Friday at the age of 91. It is by no means an overstatement \nto say that Fred Meijer changed the face of our State, and the legacy \nhe leaves will continue to affect us in Michigan and America and beyond \nfor decades hence.\n  Most Michiganians know him best through the business he built, one of \nthe largest family owned companies in the Nation. Fred grew up working \nlong hours in the Greenville, MI, grocery store that his father, an \nimmigrant from Holland, opened in 1934. Over the next three decades the \nbusiness grew until, in 1962, Fred and his father expanded from \ngroceries into general merchandise. They called their new store \n``Thrifty Acres,'' and it led the way to the supercenter retail stores \nthat are now so much a part of the American consumer's daily \nexperience. Today, Grand Rapids-based Meijer, Inc. has more than 200 \nstores across the Midwest, and the company is a major part of the West \nMichigan economy.\n  But Fred Meijer was not content to be just a pioneering entrepreneur. \nAs the company grew, so did his lifelong drive to make the world around \nhim a better place. He was an early and eager supporter of the civil \nrights movement. He was deeply involved in efforts by the Urban League \nto promote education and equal opportunity.\n  One of his many lasting legacies is the Frederik Meijer Gardens & \nSculpture Foundation. Established in 1993, the foundation embodies \nFred's commitment to ensuring that art and beauty are available to \neveryone. The park and gardens that the foundation supports house his \ncollection of sculpture, one of the finest collections anywhere in the \nworld, and places it in surroundings of incredible natural beauty.\n  Beyond the foundation, over the years he made generous gifts to \nsupport recreation and conservation efforts, schools and colleges and \ndozens of other institutions and charitable efforts across the State. \nThere are few residents of our State who have not been touched in some \nway by his generosity. I have seen firsthand that generous and \nindependent spirit, and I shall personally miss him, and personally \nfeel the gap his passing has left in our State.\n  Barbara and I send our condolences to his wife Lena, his partner in \nlife and business and philanthropy; their sons Hank, Doug and Mark; \ntheir seven grandchildren; and the multitude of those who will miss \nFred's immense presence. He will indeed be missed. What a man. What a \nlife. What a force for good in the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/28/senate-section/article/S7904-3", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7904]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                         Corporal Zachary Reiff\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, since the Senate last convened, I have \nlearned of the loss of a brave Iowan who was defending freedom \noverseas. Marine Corporal Zachary Reiff was wounded during combat \noperations in Helmand Province, Afghanistan and later succumbed to his \nwounds. This news has hit the close knit community of Preston, IA very \nhard. My prayers go out to all who knew Zach, particularly his parents \nMarcia and Matt, as well as his brother Kolby and his sister Emily. By \nall accounts, he was active in school, having played football, \nwrestled, and ran track as well as participating in school plays. As \nsuch, there was certainly no shortage of people in the community with \nmemories to share. It is also evident that Zach is well thought of \njudging by the outpouring of good will following the news that he had \nbeen wounded. Zach is described as a caring person. Certainly, the \nbeaming smile in many pictures posted on a Facebook prayer page in his \nhonor makes even those who didn't know him wish that they had.\n  Friends say that Zach was proud to serve his country and liked his \nwork. Zach Reiff is one of those special Americans who throughout our \nhistory have not hesitated to put their life on the line for the Stars \nand Stripes and everything it stands for. Our country is truly blessed \nto have patriots such as Zach Reiff. We owe him more than we can \nexpress and we have an obligation to remember him and his sacrifices in \nthe name of liberty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/28/senate-section/article/S7904-4", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7904-S7905]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CUT ENERGY BILLS AT HOME ACT\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the Cut \nEnergy Bills at Home Act, which Senator Snowe, Senator Bingaman and I \nhave introduced. It has been a pleasure to work again with Senators \nSnowe and Bingaman on an important piece of energy legislation. We have \nwritten this bill in a fully cooperative process, and my colleagues \nhave been especially accommodating of changes requested by California's \nexperts; I thank my colleagues for their efforts.\n  This legislation would put the construction industry back to work by \ncreating a homeowner tax credit for home renovations that increase the \nenergy efficiency of the home by at least 20 percent. The tax credit \nwould increase in size with every 5 percent in additional energy \nefficiency improvement achieved. Homeowners who improved the efficiency \nof their home by more than 50 percent will qualify for a maximum credit \nof $5,000.\n  This legislation helps address the continued high unemployment in the \nconstruction sector while making a long-term investment in America's \nbuilding infrastructure. The construction industry has the highest \nunemployment rate of any sector nationally, according to the Bureau of \nLabor Statistics.\n  The current residential building stock exceeds demand, making a rapid \nrecovery in new housing starts unlikely. According to the Census \nBureau, 14.3 percent of the housing units in the United States in the \nsecond quarter of 2011 were vacant, even as prices continue to drop.\n  Thus the construction industry needs jobs, but artificially \nstimulating construction of new homes would exacerbate a situation of \noversupply and depress home prices further.\n  Our Nation's buildings also need the upgrade. Buildings account for \nabout 40 percent of the U.S. energy appetite, as well as 40 percent of \nits carbon dioxide\n\n[[Page S7905]]\n\nemissions, according to the Department of Energy. However, the \nconsulting firm McKinsey and Company has found that improving building \nenergy efficiency is one of the most cost effective ways to reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions.\n  Since 1974, California has used mandates, regulations and incentives \nto hold its per capita energy consumption essentially constant, while \nenergy use per-person for the United States overall has jumped 50 \npercent.\n  This legislation provides a solution by stimulating the renovation of \nexisting homes.\n  This is a jobs bill that provides incentives to reward energy \nefficient renovations that will create jobs in the construction sector, \navoid increasing the supply of housing beyond demand, decrease energy \nuse and reduce pollution, and expand the market for efficient \ntechnology and products.\n  This bill would create the first tax incentive for energy efficiency \nhome renovation based on the energy performance of the home rather than \nthe cost of the equipment.\n  This concept, which Senator Snowe and I first proposed in 2007 as \npart of the Extend Act, is recommended by most energy efficiency \nexperts.\n  Current policy allow homeowners to claim credits for the purchase of \nenergy efficient insulation, windows, doors, heaters, air conditioners \nand water heaters. This approach is very expensive, largely due to \nclaims filed for windows.\n  By restructuring the credit to apply to whole-home energy renovations \nthat reward energy efficiency performance instead of the cost of \nequipment, this proposal has the potential to increase effectiveness \nwhile substantially lowering costs.\n  The legislation also includes provisions to ensure effectiveness and \nprevent abuse. The work must be done by a contractor who must sign an \naffidavit certifying the work was done and submit photographs of the \nwork. The contractor must use certified, computer-based energy \nefficiency measurement tools. The credit would be limited to \nrenovations of primary residences that do not increase the size of the \nhome, and the credit would be capped at no more than 30 percent of the \ncost of renovation, to prevent homeowners from making large claims for \nrelatively inexpensive renovations. As a tax credit, all claims would \nalso be subject to IRS audits.\n  The bill is supported by the California Energy Commission, the \nAlliance to Save Energy, Efficiency First, the American Council for an \nEnergy Efficient Economy and the Natural Resource Defense Council.\n  By offering incentives for energy efficient renovations, this bill \nhelps create jobs in California's ailing construction sector while at \nthe same time decreasing energy use and pollution.\n  This sort of investment, putting Americans back to work while leaving \nbehind lasting improvements, is the type of legislation on which \nCongress should be spending time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/28/senate-section/article/S7905-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7905]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        REMEMBERING HARRY PACHON\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

He returned to the United \nStates, where he completed high school in Montebello, CA, and earned a \nbachelor's degree and a master's degree in political science from \nCalifornia State University, Los Angeles, and a Ph.D. in government \nfrom Claremont Graduate University.\n  Mr. Pachon dedicated his life to public service and fought tirelessly \nto elevate the role of the Latino community in politics. After serving \nas the chief of staff for Los Angeles Representative Edward R. Roybal, \nHarry became a founding board member and executive director of the \nNational Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials. \nBeginning in 1993, Mr. Pachon became the president of the Tomas Rivera \nPolicy Institute in California. Under his leadership, the institute \nconducted groundbreaking research on key issues facing the Latino \ncommunity, including immigration, education, and political \nparticipation, and brought national attention to the needs of Latinos. \nIn 2003, the institute moved to the University of Southern California, \nwhere Harry was a beloved and respected professor of public policy.\n  I invite all of my colleagues to join me in honoring Harry Pachon and \nextending our deepest condolences to his wife Barbara; his children, \nMarc, Melissa, Nicholas, and Andrew; and his four grandchildren.

It is with \ndeep sorrow that I offer my condolences, to his wife Sharron for the \nloss of her beloved husband, to his two sons: Dan Jr. and Mark, and to \nhis three grandchildren; Jesse, Dana and Danny.\n  A native of St. Louis, MO, Dan grew up in north St. Louis and \nattended Central High School. He began his career after high school as \na truck driver and worked for over 30 years as a driver for several \nlocal companies.\n  Dan assumed leadership in the Teamsters and spent much of his life \nand career working tirelessly to secure the rights of working men and \nwomen. Within Teamsters' Local 600, Dan held several leadership \npositions including business representative, recording secretary and \nPresident. His passion for helping others also led Dan to become \nPresident of Teamsters Joint Council 13 in 2002, representing over \n25,000 Teamster families in Missouri. Dan also held several positions \nin the Missouri Kansas Nebraska Conference of Teamsters. He retired \nfrom both Local 600 and Joint Council 13 in March, 2010.\n  It is with great humility and respect that I honor Dan today. His \ndedicated leadership improved the work experience for many Missourians, \nand under Dan's leadership the Teamsters organized and educated workers \nso they would know their workplace rights and could participate fully \nin our democratic society.\n  Dan touched the lives of many, and improved the quality of life in \nthe community at large. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters has \nlost a friend and an advocate, and I have lost a dear friend, advisor, \nand confidant.\n  Dan was afraid of no one when it came to defending his friends or \nconfronting his adversaries. When I explained to him one time that his \npolitical support of me was going to cause him trouble, he said, \n``Nothing that I can't handle. We are in this together.''\n  Dan will certainly be remembered for his gruff but engaging \npersonality as well as for his many accomplishments. Dan was tough, but \nunder that tough exterior was a huge heart filled with love for his \nfamily, for his community and for his brothers and sisters in labor.\n  Dan's life and commitment to others serve as an inspiration to me and \nto all Missourians. Our State has truly lost a leader and a hero.\n  I extend my deepest sympathies and sincerest condolences to Dan's \nfamily in their time of bereavement, and I invite the Senate to join me \nin honoring the life and accomplishments of this son of \nMissouri.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/28/senate-section/article/S7905-3", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7905-S7907]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     REPORT RELATIVE TO THE ISSUANCE OF AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO TAKE \n  ADDITIONAL STEPS WITH RESPECT TO THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY ORIGINALLY \n  DECLARED ON MARCH 15, 1995 IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 12957 WITH RESPECT TO \n IRAN, RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT OF THE SENATE ON NOVEMBER 21, 2011--\n                                 PM 35\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 \nU.S.C. 1701 et seq.)

To further respond \nto that threat, Executive Order 12959 of May 6, 1995, imposed \ncomprehensive trade and financial sanctions on Iran. Executive Order \n13059 of August 19, 1997, consolidated and clarified the previous \norders.\n  In the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment \nAct of 2010 (Public Law 111-195) (22 U.S.C. 8501 et seq.) (CISADA), \nwhich I signed into law on July 1, 2010, the Congress found that the \nillicit nuclear activities of the Government of Iran, along with its \ndevelopment of unconventional weapons and ballistic missiles and its \nsupport for international terrorism, threaten the security of the \nUnited States. The Congress also found in CISADA that economic \nsanctions imposed pursuant to the provisions of CISADA, the Iran \nSanctions Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-172) (50 U.S.C. 1701 note) (ISA), \nand IEEPA, and other authorities available to the United States to \nprevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons, are necessary to protect \nthe essential security interests of the United States. To take \nadditional steps with respect to the national emergency declared in \nExecutive Order 12957 and to implement section 105(a) of CISADA (22 \nU.S.C. 8514(a)), I issued Executive Order 13553 on September 28, 2010, \nto impose sanctions on officials of the Government of Iran and other \npersons acting on behalf of the Government of Iran determined to be \nresponsible for or complicit in certain serious human rights abuses. To \ntake additional steps with respect to the threat posed by Iran and to \nprovide implementing authority for a number of the sanctions set forth \nin ISA, as amended by, inter alia, CISADA, I issued Executive Order \n13574 on May 23, 2011, to authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to \nimplement certain sanctions imposed pursuant to ISA by the Secretary of \nState.\n  This order expands upon actions taken pursuant to ISA, as amended by, \ninter alia, CISADA. The ISA requires that, absent a waiver, the \nPresident impose at least three of nine possible forms of sanctions on \npersons determined to have made certain investments in Iran's energy \nsector. The CISADA expanded ISA to, inter alia, require the same \ntreatment of persons determined to have provided refined petroleum to \nIran above specified monetary thresholds or have provided certain \ngoods, services, technology, information, or support to Iran related to \nthe importation or development of refined petroleum. This order \nauthorizes the Secretary of State to impose similar sanctions on \npersons determined to have provided certain goods, services, \ntechnology, or support that contributes to either Iran's development of \npetroleum resources or to Iran's production of petrochemicals, two \nsectors that continue to fund Iran's illicit nuclear activities and \nthat could serve as conduits for Iran to obtain proliferation sensitive \ntechnology. Because CISADA has impeded Iran's ability to develop its \ndomestic refining capacity, Iran has tried to compensate by using its \npetrochemical facilities to refine petroleum. These new authorities \nwill allow the United States to target directly Iran's attempts to \nsubvert U.S. sanctions.\n\n  This order authorizes the Secretary of State, in consultation with \nthe Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce, and the \nUnited States Trade Representative, and with the President of the \nExport-Import Bank, the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the \nFederal Reserve System, and other agencies and officials as \nappropriate, to impose sanctions on a person upon determining that the \nperson:\n  --knowingly, on or after the effective date of the order, sells, \nleases, or provides to Iran goods, services, technology, or support \nthat has a fair market value of $1,000,000 or more or that, during a \n12-month period, has an aggregate fair market value of $5,000,000 or \nmore, and that could directly and significantly contribute to the \nmaintenance or enhancement of Iran's ability to develop petroleum \nresources located in Iran;\n  --knowingly, on or after the effective date of this order, sells, \nleases, or provides to Iran goods, services, technology, or support \nthat has a fair market value of $250,000 or more or that, during a 12-\nmonth period, has an aggregate fair market value of $1,000,000 or more, \nand that could directly and significantly contribute to the maintenance \nor expansion of Iran's domestic production of petrochemical products;\n  --is a successor entity to a person that engaged in a provision of \ngoods, services, technology, or support for which sanctions may be \nimposed pursuant to this new order;\n  --owns or controls a person that engaged in provision of goods, \nservices, technology, or support for which sanctions may be imposed \npursuant to this new order and had actual knowledge or should have \nknown that the person engaged in the activities; or\n  --is owned or controlled by, or under common ownership or control \nwith, a person that engaged in the provision of goods, services, \ntechnology, or support for which sanctions may be imposed pursuant to \nthis new order, and knowingly participated in the provision of such \ngoods, services, technology, or support.\nThe following sanctions may be selected for imposition on a person that \nthe Secretary of State determines to meet any of the above criteria:\n  --the Board of Directors of the Export-Import Bank shall deny \napproval of the issuance of any guarantee, insurance, extension of \ncredit, or participation in an extension of credit in connection with \nthe export of any goods or services to the sanctioned person;\n  --agencies shall not issue any specific license or grant any other \nspecific permission or authority under any statute that requires the \nprior review and approval of the United States Government as a \ncondition for the export or reexport of goods or technology to the \nsanctioned person;\n  --with respect to a sanctioned person that is a financial \ninstitution, the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal \nReserve System and the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New \nYork shall take such actions as they deem appropriate, including \ndenying designation, or terminating the continuation of any prior \ndesignation of, the sanctioned person as a primary dealer in United \nStates Government debt instruments; or agencies shall prevent the \nsanctioned person from serving as an agent of the United States \nGovernment or serving as a repository for United States Government \nfunds;\n  --agencies shall not procure, or enter into a contract for the \nprocurement of, any goods or services from the sanctioned person;\n  --the Secretary of the Treasury shall prohibit any United States \nfinancial institution from making loans or providing credits to the \nsanctioned person totaling more than $10,000,000 in any 12-month period \nunless such person is engaged in activities to relieve human suffering \nand the loans or credits are provided for such activities;\n  --the Secretary of the Treasury shall prohibit any transactions in \nforeign exchange that are subject to the jurisdiction of the United \nStates and in which the sanctioned person has any interest;\n  --the Secretary of the Treasury shall prohibit any transfers of \ncredit or payments between financial institutions or by, through, or to \nany financial institution, to the extent that such transfers or \npayments are subject to the jurisdiction of the United States and \ninvolve any interest of the sanctioned person;\n  --the Secretary of the Treasury shall block all property and \ninterests in property that are in the United States, that come within \nthe United States, or that are or come within the possession or control \nof any United States person, including any foreign branch, of the \nsanctioned person, and provide that such property and interests in \nproperty may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or \notherwise dealt in; or\n  --the Secretary of the Treasury shall restrict or prohibit imports of \ngoods, technology, or services, directly or indirectly, into the United \nStates from the sanctioned person.\n  I have delegated to the Secretary of the Treasury the authority, in \nconsultation with the Secretary of State, to take such actions, \nincluding the promulgation of rules and regulations, and\n\n[[Page S7907]]\n\nto employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA as may be \nnecessary to carry out the purposes of section 3 of the order.

DESIGNATION OF THE HAQQANI NETWORK AS A FOREIGN \n                   TERRORIST ORGANIZATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In a September 28, 2011, press briefing White House \n     Press Secretary Jay Carney stated that ``[w]e have said \n     unequivocally that the Haqqani network was responsible\n\n[[Page S7913]]\n\n     for the recent attack on the U.S. embassy in Kabul and on \n     ISAF headquarters in Kabul. And the fact that they are able \n     to operate in Afghanistan because they have a safe haven in \n     Pakistan is a matter of great concern. And we have urged our \n     counterparts in Pakistan to take action and raise with them \n     the importance of doing so''.\n       (2) A report of the Congressional Research Service on \n     relations between the United States and Pakistan states that \n     ``[t]he terrorist network led by Jalaluddin Haqqani and his \n     son Sirajuddin, based in the FATA, is commonly identified as \n     the most dangerous of Afghan insurgent groups battling U.S.-\n     led forces in eastern Afghanistan''.\n       (3) The report further states that, in mid-2011, the \n     Haqqanis undertook several high-visibility attacks in \n     Afghanistan that led to a spike in frustrations being \n     expressed by top United States and Afghanistan officials. \n     First, a late June assault on the Intercontinental Hotel in \n     Kabul by 8 Haqqani gunmen and suicide bombers left 18 people \n     dead. Then, on September 10, a truck bomb attack on a United \n     States military base by Haqqani fighters in the Wardak \n     province injured 77 United States troops and killed 5 \n     Afghans. But it was a September 13 attack on the United \n     States Embassy compound in Kabul that appears to have \n     substantively changed the nature of relations between the \n     United States and Pakistan. The well-planned, well-executed \n     assault sparked a 20-hour-long gun battle and left 16 Afghans \n     dead, 5 police officers and at least 6 children among them.\n       (4) The report further states that ``U.S. and Afghan \n     officials concluded the Embassy attackers were members of the \n     Haqqani network. Days after the raid, Admiral Mullen called \n     on General Kayani to again press for Pakistani military \n     action against Haqqani bases. Apparently unsatisfied with his \n     counterpart's response, Mullen returned to Washington, DC, \n     and began ramping up rhetorical pressure to previously unseen \n     levels, accusing the ISI of using the Haqqanis to conduct a \n     ``proxy war'' in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, Secretary Panetta \n     issued what was taken by many to be an ultimatum to Pakistan \n     when he told reporters that the United States would ``take \n     whatever steps are necessary to protect our forces'' in \n     Afghanistan from future attacks by the Haqqanis.\n       (5) In September 22, 2011, testimony before the Committee \n     on Armed Services of the Senate, Admiral Mullen stated that \n     ``[t]he Haqqani network, for one, acts as a veritable arm of \n     Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency. With ISI \n     support, Haqqani operatives plan and conducted that \n     [September 13] truck bomb attack, as well as the assault on \n     our embassy. We also have credible evidence they were behind \n     the June 28th attack on the Intercontinental Hotel in Kabul \n     and a host of other smaller but effective operations''.\n       (6) In October 27, 2011, testimony before the Committee on \n     Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives, Secretary of \n     State Hillary Clinton stated that ``with respect to the \n     Haqqani Network, it illustrates this point. There was a major \n     military operation that was held in Afghanistan just in the \n     past week that rounded up and eliminated more than 100 \n     Haqqani Network operatives. And we are taking action to \n     target the Haqqani leadership on both sides of the border. \n     We're increasing international efforts to squeeze them \n     operationally and financially. We are already working with \n     the Pakistanis' to target those who are behind a lot of the \n     attacks against Afghans and Americans. And I made it very \n     clear to the Pakistanis that the attack on our embassy was an \n     outrage and the attack on our forward operating base that \n     injured 77 of our soldiers was a similar outrage''.\n       (7) At the same hearing, Secretary of State Clinton further \n     stated that ``[w]ell, Congressman, I think everyone agrees \n     that the Haqqani Network has safe havens inside Pakistan; \n     that those safe havens give them a place to plan and direct \n     operations that kill Afghans and Americans''.\n       (8) On November 1, 2011, the United States Government added \n     Haji Mali Kahn to a list of specially designated global \n     terrorists under Executive Order 13224. The Department of \n     State described Khan as ``a Haqqani Network commander'' who \n     has ``overseen hundreds of fighters, and has instructed his \n     subordinates to conduct terrorist acts.'' ``Mali Khan has \n     provided support and logistics to the Haqqani Network, and \n     has been involved in the planning and execution of attacks in \n     Afghanistan against civilians, coalition forces, and Afghan \n     police,'' the designation continued. In June 2011, ``Mali \n     Khan's deputy provided support to the suicide bombers \n     responsible for the attacks on the Intercontinental Hotel in \n     Kabul, Afghanistan. The attack resulted in the death of 12 \n     people''. Jason Blazakis, the chief of the Terrorist \n     Designations Unit of the Department of State, has also been \n     quoted in several media outlets as stating Khan also has \n     links to al-Qaeda.\n       (9) Five other top Haqqani Network leaders have been placed \n     on the list of specially designated global terrorists under \n     Executive Order 13224 since 2008, and three of them have been \n     so placed in the last year. Sirajuddin Haqqani, the overall \n     leader of the Haqqani Network as well as the leader of the \n     Taliban's Mira shah Regional Military Shura, was designated \n     by the Department of State as a terrorist in March 2008, and \n     in March 2009, the Department of State put out a bounty of \n     $5,000,000 for information leading to his capture. The other \n     four individuals so designated are Nasiruddin Haqqani, Khalil \n     al Rahman Haqqani, Badruddin Haqqani, and Mullah Sangeen \n     Zadran.\n       (10) The Haqqani Network meets the criteria for designation \n     as a foreign terrorist organization in that it is a foreign \n     organization, it engages in and retains the capability and \n     intent to engage in terrorism, and it threatens the security \n     of United States nationals and the national defense, foreign \n     relations, and economic interests of the United States.\n       (b) Designation.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary of Homeland Security shall \n     designate the Haqqani Network as a foreign terrorist \n     organization under section 219 of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1189).\n       (2) Waiver.--The President may waive the requirement in \n     paragraph (1) if the President submits to the appropriate \n     committees of Congress a certification in writing that--\n       (A) the Haqqani Network does not threaten the security of \n     United States nationals and the national defense, foreign \n     relations, and economic interests of the United States; and\n       (B) the waiver is in the national security interests of the \n     United States.\n       (3) Justification.--The certification submitted under \n     paragraph (2) shall include a written justification for the \n     waiver covered by the certification.\n       (4) Appropriate committees of congress defined.--In this \n     section, the term ``appropriate committees of Congress'' \n     means--\n       (A) the Committee on Armed Services, the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations, and the Select Committee on Intelligence \n     of the Senate; and\n       (B) the Committee on Armed Services, the Committee on \n     Foreign Affairs, and the Permanent Select Committee on \n     Intelligence of the House of Representatives.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1345.

The vote \n     on passage of the military compensation bill in the Senate \n     shall be considered to be the vote on passage of the military \n     compensation bill received from the House of Representatives.\n       (3) Vetoes.--If the President vetoes the military \n     compensation bill, debate on a veto message in the Senate \n     under this section shall be 1 hour equally divided between \n     the majority and minority leaders or their designees.\n       (h) Loss of Privilege.--The provisions of this section \n     shall cease to apply to the military compensation bill if the \n     military compensation bill does not pass both Houses before \n     October 1, 2013.\n\n     SEC. 1606.

And the fact that they are able to \n     operate in Afghanistan because they have a safe haven in \n     Pakistan is a matter of great concern. And we have urged our \n     counterparts in Pakistan to take action and raise with them \n     the importance of doing so''.\n       (2) A report of the Congressional Research Service on \n     relations between the United States and Pakistan states that \n     ``[t]he terrorist network led by Jalaluddin Haqqani and his \n     son Sirajuddin, based in the FATA, is commonly identified as \n     the most dangerous of Afghan insurgent groups battling U.S.-\n     led forces in eastern Afghanistan''.\n       (3) The report further states that, in mid-2011, the \n     Haqqanis undertook several high-visibility attacks in \n     Afghanistan that led to a spike in frustrations being \n     expressed by top United States and Afghanistan officials. \n     First, a late June assault on the Intercontinental Hotel in \n     Kabul by 8 Haqqani gunmen and suicide bombers left 18 people \n     dead. Then, on September 10, a truck bomb attack on a United \n     States military base by Haqqani fighters in the Wardak \n     province injured 77 United States troops and killed 5 \n     Afghans. But it was a September 13 attack on the United \n     States Embassy compound in Kabul that appears to have \n     substantively changed the nature of relations between the \n     United States and Pakistan. The well-planned, well-executed \n     assault sparked a 20-hour-long gun battle and left 16 Afghans \n     dead, 5 police officers and at least 6 children among them.\n       (4) The report further states that ``U.S. and Afghan \n     officials concluded the Embassy attackers were members of the \n     Haqqani network. Days after the raid, Admiral Mullen called \n     on General Kayani to again press for Pakistani military \n     action against Haqqani bases. Apparently unsatisfied with his \n     counterpart's response, Mullen returned to Washington, DC, \n     and began ramping up rhetorical pressure to previously unseen \n     levels, accusing the ISI of using the Haqqanis to conduct a \n     ``proxy war'' in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, Secretary Panetta \n     issued what was taken by many to be an ultimatum to Pakistan \n     when he told reporters that the United States would ``take \n     whatever steps are necessary to protect our forces'' in \n     Afghanistan from future attacks by the Haqqanis.\n       (5) In September 22, 2011, testimony before the Committee \n     on Armed Services of the Senate, Admiral Mullen stated that \n     ``[t]he Haqqani network, for one, acts as a veritable arm of \n     Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency. With ISI \n     support, Haqqani operatives plan and conducted that \n     [September 13] truck bomb attack, as well as the assault on \n     our embassy. We also have credible evidence they were behind \n     the June 28th attack on the Intercontinental Hotel in Kabul \n     and a host of other smaller but effective operations''.\n       (6) In October 27, 2011, testimony before the Committee on \n     Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives, Secretary of \n     State Hillary Clinton stated that ``with respect to the \n     Haqqani Network, it illustrates this point. There was a major \n     military operation that was held in Afghanistan just in the \n     past week that rounded up and eliminated more than 100 \n     Haqqani Network operatives. And we are taking action to \n     target the Haqqani leadership on both sides of the border. \n     We're increasing international efforts to squeeze them \n     operationally and financially. We are already working with \n     the Pakistanis' to target those who are behind a lot of the \n     attacks against Afghans and Americans. And I made it very \n     clear to the Pakistanis that the attack on our embassy was an \n     outrage and the attack on our forward operating base that\n\n[[Page S7925]]\n\n     injured 77 of our soldiers was a similar outrage''.\n       (7) At the same hearing, Secretary of State Clinton further \n     stated that ``[w]ell, Congressman, I think everyone agrees \n     that the Haqqani Network has safe havens inside Pakistan; \n     that those safe havens give them a place to plan and direct \n     operations that kill Afghans and Americans''.\n       (8) On November 1, 2011, the United States Government added \n     Haji Mali Kahn to a list of specially designated global \n     terrorists under Executive Order 13224. The Department of \n     State described Khan as ``a Haqqani Network commander'' who \n     has ``overseen hundreds of fighters, and has instructed his \n     subordinates to conduct terrorist acts.'' ``Mali Khan has \n     provided support and logistics to the Haqqani Network, and \n     has been involved in the planning and execution of attacks in \n     Afghanistan against civilians, coalition forces, and Afghan \n     police,'' the designation continued. In June 2011, ``Mali \n     Khan's deputy provided support to the suicide bombers \n     responsible for the attacks on the Intercontinental Hotel in \n     Kabul, Afghanistan. The attack resulted in the death of 12 \n     people''. Jason Blazakis, the chief of the Terrorist \n     Designations Unit of the Department of State, has also been \n     quoted in several media outlets as stating Khan also has \n     links to al-Qaeda.\n       (9) Five other top Haqqani Network leaders have been placed \n     on the list of specially designated global terrorists under \n     Executive Order 13224 since 2008, and three of them have been \n     so placed in the last year. Sirajuddin Haqqani, the overall \n     leader of the Haqqani Network as well as the leader of the \n     Taliban's Mira shah Regional Military Shura, was designated \n     by the Department of State as a terrorist in March 2008, and \n     in March 2009, the Department of State put out a bounty of \n     $5,000,000 for information leading to his capture. The other \n     four individuals so designated are Nasiruddin Haqqani, Khalil \n     al Rahman Haqqani, Badruddin Haqqani, and Mullah Sangeen \n     Zadran.\n       (10) The Haqqani Network meets the criteria for designation \n     as a foreign terrorist organization in that it is a foreign \n     organization, it engages in and retains the capability and \n     intent to engage in terrorism, and it threatens the security \n     of United States nationals and the national defense, foreign \n     relations, and economic interests of the United States.\n       (b) Designation.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 30 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall \n     designate the Haqqani Network as a foreign terrorist \n     organization under section 219 of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1189).\n       (2) Waiver.--The President may waive the requirement in \n     paragraph (1) if the President submits to the appropriate \n     committees of Congress a certification in writing that--\n       (A) the Haqqani Network does not threaten the security of \n     United States nationals and the national defense, foreign \n     relations, and economic interests of the United States; and\n       (B) the waiver is in the national security interests of the \n     United States.\n       (3) Justification.--The certification submitted under \n     paragraph (2) shall include a written justification for the \n     waiver covered by the certification.\n       (4) Appropriate committees of congress defined.--In this \n     section, the term ``appropriate committees of Congress'' \n     means--\n       (A) the Committee on Armed Services, the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations, and the Select Committee on Intelligence \n     of the Senate; and\n       (B) the Committee on Armed Services, the Committee on \n     Foreign Affairs, and the Permanent Select Committee on \n     Intelligence of the House of Representatives.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1388.

IMPOSITION OF SANCTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE \n                   FINANCIAL SECTOR OF IRAN.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On November 21, 2011, the Secretary of the Treasury \n     issued a finding under section 5318A of title 31, United \n     States Code, that identified Iran as a jurisdiction of \n     primary money laundering concern.\n       (2) In that finding, the Financial Crimes Enforcement \n     Network of the Department of the Treasury wrote, ``The \n     Central Bank of Iran, which regulates Iranian banks, has \n     assisted designated Iranian banks by transferring billions of \n     dollars to these banks in 2011. In mid-2011, the CBI \n     transferred several billion dollars to designated banks, \n     including Saderat, Mellat, EDBI and Melli, through a variety \n     of payment schemes. In making these transfers, the CBI \n     attempted to evade sanctions by minimizing the direct \n     involvement of large international banks with both CBI and \n     designated Iranian banks.''.\n       (3) On November 22, 2011, the Under Secretary of the \n     Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, David \n     Cohen, wrote, ``Treasury is calling out the entire Iranian \n     banking sector, including the Central Bank of Iran, as posing \n     terrorist financing, proliferation financing, and money \n     laundering risks for the global financial system.''.\n       (b) Designation of Financial Sector of Iran as of Primary \n     Money Laundering Concern.--The financial sector of Iran, \n     including the Central Bank of Iran, is designated as of \n     primary money laundering concern for purposes of section \n     5318A of title 31, United States Code, because of the threat \n     to government and financial institutions resulting from the \n     illicit activities of the Government of Iran, including its \n     pursuit of nuclear weapons, support for international \n     terrorism, and efforts to deceive responsible financial \n     institutions and evade sanctions.\n       (c) Freezing of Assets of Iranian Financial Institutions.--\n     The President shall, pursuant to the International Emergency \n     Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), block and \n     prohibit all transactions in all property and interests in \n     property of an Iranian financial institution if such property \n     and interests in property are in the United States, come \n     within the United States, or are or come within the \n     possession or control of a United States person.\n       (d) Imposition of Sanctions With Respect to the Central \n     Bank of Iran and Other Iranian Financial Institutions.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as specifically provided in this \n     subsection, beginning on the date that is 60 days after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, the President--\n       (A) shall prohibit the opening or maintaining in the United \n     States of a correspondent account or a payable-through \n     account by a foreign financial institution that the President \n     determines has knowingly conducted or facilitated any \n     significant financial transaction with the Central Bank of \n     Iran or another Iranian financial institution designated by \n     the Secretary of the Treasury for the imposition of sanctions \n     pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act \n     (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.);

and\n       (ii) to prohibit purchases by Iran of--\n\n       (I) military or dual-use technology, including items--\n\n       (aa) in the Annex to the to the Missile Technology Control \n     Regime Guidelines;\n       (bb) in the Annex on Chemicals to the Convention on the \n     Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and \n     Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction, done at \n     Paris January 13, 1993, and entered into force April 29, 1997 \n     (commonly known as the ``Chemical Weapons Convention'');\n       (cc) in Part 1 or 2 of the Nuclear Suppliers Group \n     Guidelines;
