Mr. President, this afternoon we will have a cloture vote \non reauthorization of the Economic Development Administration, a law we \nhave depended on for more than 50 years.\n  This is the fourth jobs bill Democrats have brought to the floor this \nyear. I do hope Republicans will not allow it to be the fourth jobs \nbill to wither on the vine thanks to their obstructionist tactics. This \nis a good piece of legislation with decades of helping American \nbusinesses in economically distressed communities to innovate, grow, \nand to hire.\n  In the last 5 years alone, the Economic Development Administration \nhas created 314,000 jobs and successfully turned every $1 in Federal \ninvestment into $7 in private sector investment. It is good legislation \nthat will create good jobs for Americans who need these jobs. \nUnfortunately, that is not enough to win bipartisan support among \nRepublicans here in the District of Columbia who are more interested in\n\n[[Page S3940]]\n\ndestroying Medicare than creating jobs.\n  The Small Business innovation research bill is a good piece of \nlegislation too. That also died in the Senate last month under a pile \nof unrelated amendments. The bills the Senate passed this year \nreauthorizing the Federal Aviation Administration and reforming \nAmerica's patent system were good legislation also. They would have \ncreated or saved about 480,000 jobs. It made it out of the Senate alive \nbut now languishes in the Republican-controlled House. Will the \nEconomic Development Authority suffer the same fate? I hope not.\n  Here, 24 hours ago, I presented to the American people in the Senate \na myriad of amendments that have been filed in regard to this \nlegislation. A lot have been offered but more filed. I read about 40 of \nthem dealing with different types of endangered species, the lesser \nsand dune reptile, I don't remember what it was, but all kinds of \nnonrelated amendments. Global warming. Post office reform. As I said, \nalmost 100 amendments, and I read 35 or 40 of them here yesterday, \nhaving nothing to do with this legislation. Nothing.\n  I hope we don't have another bill that is blocked, the fourth this \nyear. If they do that, it would be clear they are more interested in \nthis rightwing ideology than creating much-needed employment. Of the \n90-plus amendments, I repeat, only one of which my staff was able to \nfind had any germaneness to the bill, and that is one the chairman of \nthe committee, Senator Boxer, would agree to anyway because it was \noffered by Senator Inhofe.\n  This is an important piece of legislation. This legislation will put \nhundreds of thousands of people to work. So today's vote is again about \npriorities. Americans have been very clear, job creation is their No.1 \npriority, their No. 2 priority, and their No. 3 priority. Democrats \nshare that priority. Republicans obviously don't.\n  We will never stop bringing jobs bills to the floor, and we will \nnever stop fighting the other side's obstructionism to try to get them \npassed. Again, Republicans have a different priority, it appears, and \nthat is ending Medicare. And that is too bad. They have worked hard to \nblock three bills that could have created and saved hundreds of \nthousands of jobs during tough economic times, but they pushed even \nharder for their ideological plan to kill Medicare as we know it.\n  The Republican plan would put insurance company bureaucrats between \nseniors and their doctors. Every senior would pay $6,400 more for \nhealth care in the first year alone. It would force more than 7 million \nseniors to pay more for cancer screenings, wellness checks, and \ntreatments beginning next year.\n  Americans have been clear about this too, very clear. They have \nresoundingly rejected this ideological plan to hurt seniors. \nRepublicans think it is a bad idea. Democrats think it is a bad idea. \nAnd, of course, the Independents think it is a bad idea. All polls show \nthis.\n  Unfortunately, I haven't heard a shred of evidence that my Republican \nfriends here in Congress are getting the message on Medicare that the \nAmerican people have gotten. Today they will have a chance to show the \nAmerican people once again whether they have heard the message on jobs. \nI hope they have, because so much is at stake. And America is watching.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/21/senate-section/article/S3940-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3940]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

This morning, I wish to say a word about the upcoming \nvote on the debt ceiling and the bipartisan negotiation surrounding it, \nto reiterate why we are having these talks and what they ought to \nachieve. But first, a little context.\n  Right now, ratings agencies are threatening to downgrade U.S. debt, \nputting us on red alert that the kind of economic crisis we are seeing \nin parts of Europe could very quickly happen right here.\n  We know that failing to do something significant about our fiscal \nproblems would be a serious drag on jobs and our economy. That is why, \nover the past several weeks, I have come to the floor of the Senate and \nspoken at press conferences, with a now familiar refrain: The time to \nact on significant reforms is right now. And I have been crystal clear \nabout what qualifies as significant.\n  Above all, it means doing something to strengthen and preserve our \nlong-term entitlement programs, so we can actually keep our promises to \nthose who have been paying into these programs for years, and so these \nprograms don't end up consuming every single dollar we take in. \nEntitlements are the biggest drivers of our debt. By definition, they \nhave to be a part of any plan to lower the debt.\n  This is hardly a controversial view. Everyone from the President on \ndown has said that entitlements must be reformed if we have any chance \nat all of reining in our debt and strengthening our long-term fiscal \nhealth.\n  In fact, 3 months ago, 31 Senate Democrats signed a letter to the \nPresident urging him to put together a plan to reduce the deficit, a \nplan they said they hoped would include entitlement changes, 31 members \nof the Democratic conference right here on the other side of the aisle, \nincluding the occupant of the chair.\n  As the occupant of the chair put it recently, ``I think it's \nabsolutely clear that we have to redesign our entitlement programs.''\n  Here is how Senator Durbin put it a few weeks ago: ``We have serious \neconomic problems ahead of us if we don't have some reform in both \nMedicare and Social Security.''\n  This was from former President Bill Clinton after the recent \ncongressional election in New York: ``I don't think that the Democrats \nor the Republicans should conclude from the New York race that no \nchanges can be made in Medicare,'' he said, ``[or] that no changes can \nbe made in Social Security . . . that no changes can be made that will \ndeal with this long-term debt problem.''\n  Here is President Obama's lead negotiator on the debt talks, Vice \nPresident Biden, from last January: ``Everybody talks about we have to \ndo something about Social Security and Medicare, and we do.''\n  Here are the two chairs of the President's debt commission, Erskine \nBowles and Alan Simpson, in a recent op-ed in ``Politico'': ``A \ncredible plan must address the growth of entitlement spending . . .''\n  Here is the President himself, about a month after he took office: \n``To preserve our long-term fiscal health we must . . . address the \ngrowing costs in Medicare and Social Security.''\n  And, as for me, I have been clear on this same point in public and in \nprivate from the moment I stepped out of a meeting with the President \nand other Members of Congress at the White House on May 12.\n  So it is not exactly a groundbreaking observation that if these \ndiscussions are to mean anything they have to involve entitlement \nreform since no one believes we actually get at our fiscal problems \nwithout it. This is what serious people expect and are hoping for out \nof these talks.\n  The moment requires, as I have said for weeks, three things: Real \ncuts in spending over the short term; that is, over the next 2 years--\nnot more spending increases or ``freezes''; real cuts over the medium-\nterm; that is, over the next 10 years with enforceable caps on \nspending; and meaningful reforms to entitlements, which are the major \ndrivers of our debt. That is the definition of a significant package.\n  Some Democrats are insisting that they will only agree to cuts if \nRepublicans agree to raise revenue. That is\n\n[[Page S3941]]\n\nWashington speak for tax hikes and it is absurd.\n  First of all, is there anyone outside of Washington, DC, who really \nthinks that with 14 million people looking for work in this country, \nthe solution is to raise taxes? The last thing you want to do in the \nmiddle of a jobs crisis is raise taxes. Does anyone seriously think \nthat is a good idea? Even the President has said as much. It is just \ncommon sense. Remember, the President signed the extension of current \ntax rates back in December with a similar argument.\n  But even if we weren't in the middle of a jobs crisis, it would be \nfoolish--and completely dishonest. We are in the middle of a debt \ncrisis right now because we spend too much. The solution is to spend \nless.\n  How do we know this?\n  For 30 years beginning in 1971, Federal spending as a percentage of \nthe economy has averaged around 20.8 percent. But after 2 years of out-\nof-control spending by the President and his Democrat allies in \nCongress, government spending is now projected to rise a full 4 \npercentage points above the historical norm.\n  That may not sound like a lot, but 4 percent of a $14 trillion \neconomy is an enormous amount of money. Just as the economy sank, \nDemocrats increased government spending by hundreds of billions of \ndollars. And now they want to make it permanent. That is the reason we \nhave a deficit like we do.\n  Government spending has gone up, and a bad economy has caused revenue \nto go down.\n  That is the reason the debt has gone up 35 percent since the \nPresident took office.\n  Now Democrats want to use that bad economy as an excuse to lock their \nspending levels in place. They want to use it as an excuse to raise \ntaxes, which would only make the economy worse, cause us to lose even \nmore jobs, and make it even harder to create new jobs.\n  So let's just be clear about what is going on here. Right now, \nWashington is borrowing roughly $4 billion every day above what it \ncollects in taxes. And Democrats don't want to admit we have a spending \nproblem?\n  We have a national debt the size of our entire economy and Democrats \nare wondering whether they want to do anything about the biggest \ndrivers of the debt?\n  Look: Democrats can continue to argue among themselves about whether \nto step up and address this crisis they have helped create, but they \ncan't argue about what is causing it or what is needed to address it.\n  Republicans have been crystal clear about where we stand. And \nDemocrats have also been crystal clear about what's needed for these \ntalks to be a success. It is my hope that they consider their own past \nstatements on entitlement reform as we approach the end of these talks.\n  The path to success is clear. Let's not let this opportunity to do \nsomething go to waste.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/21/senate-section/article/S3941-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3941]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to join the Senator from \nMassachusetts, who will shortly submit the product of many hours of \nbipartisan cooperation and negotiation, an authorization for the \nlimited use of military force in Libya. The resolution, as will be \nintroduced by my colleague from Massachusetts, as I mentioned, would \nauthorize the President to employ the U.S. Armed Forces to advance U.S. \nnational security interests in Libya as part of the international \ncoalition that is enforcing U.N. Security Council resolutions in Libya. \nIt would limit this authority to 1 year, which is more than enough time \nto finish the job, and it makes clear that the Senate agrees with the \nPresident that there is no need and no desire to commit U.S. \nconventional ground forces in Libya.\n  I will be the first to admit that this authorization is not perfect \nand it will not make everyone happy. It does not fully make me happy. I \nwould have preferred that this authorization make clear that our \nmilitary mission includes the President's stated policy objective of \nforcing Qadhafi to leave power. I would have preferred that it urge the \nPresident to commit more U.S. strike aircraft to the mission in Libya \nso as to help bring this conflict to a close as soon as possible. And I \nwould have preferred that it call on the President to recognize the \nTransitional National Council as the legitimate voice of the Libyan \npeople so as to free Qadhafi's frozen assets for the Transitional \nNational Council to use on behalf of the Libyan people. I have called \non the administration to do all of these things for some time, and I do \nso now again.\n  That said, this authorization has been a bipartisan effort. My \nRepublican colleagues and I have had to make compromises, just as have \nthe Senator from Massachusetts and his Democratic colleagues. I believe \nthe end result is an authorization that deserves the support of my \ncolleagues in the Senate on both sides of the aisle, and I am confident \nthey will support it.\n  I know the administration has made it clear that it believes it does \nnot need a congressional authorization such as this because it is their \nview that U.S. military operations in Libya do not rise to the level of \nhostility. I believe this assertion will strike most of my colleagues \nand the Americans they represent as a confusing breach of common sense, \nand it seems to be undercut by the very report the administration sent \nto Congress which makes clear that U.S. Armed Forces have been and \npresumably will continue to fly limited strike missions to suppress \nenemy air defenses, to operate armed Predator drones that are attacking \nQadhafi's forces in an effort to protect Libyan civilians, and to \nprovide the overwhelming support for NATO operations, from intelligence \nto aerial refueling. Indeed, we read in today's New York Times that \nsince the April 7 date that the administration claims to have ceased \nhostilities in Libya, U.S. warplanes have struck at Libyan air defenses \non 60 occasions and fired about 30 missiles from unmanned drones.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nat the conclusion of my remarks the article from today's New York Times \nentitled ``Scores of U.S. Strikes in Libya Follow Handoff to Libya.''\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. McCAIN. I certainly agree that actions such as these do not \namount to a full-fledged state of war, and I will certainly grant that \nI am no legal scholar, but I find it hard to swallow that U.S. Armed \nForces dropping bombs and killing enemy personnel in a foreign country \ndoes not amount to a state of hostilities.\n  What is worse, this is just the latest way in which this \nadministration has mishandled its responsibility with regard to \nCongress. The President could have asked to authorize our intervention \nin Libya months ago, and I believe it could have received a strong, \nthough certainly not unanimous, show of support.\n  The administration's disregard for the elected representatives of the \nAmerican people on this matter has been troubling and \ncounterproductive. The unfortunate result of this failure of leadership \nis plain to see in the full-scale revolt against the administration's \nLibya policy that is occurring in the House of Representatives. As I \nspeak now, our colleagues in the House are preparing a measure that \nwould cut off all funding for U.S. military operations in Libya, and \nthey plan to vote on it in the coming days.\n  I know many were opposed to this mission from the beginning, and I \nrespect their convictions. I myself have disagreed and disagreed \nstrongly at\n\n[[Page S3942]]\n\ntimes with aspects of the administration's policy in Libya. But at the \nend of the day, I believe the President did the right thing by \nintervening to stop a looming humanitarian disaster in Libya.\n  Amid all our arguments over prudence, legality, and constitutionality \nof the administration's policy in Libya, we cannot forget the main \npoint: In the midst of the most groundbreaking geopolitical event in \ntwo decades, as peaceful protests for democracy were sweeping the \nMiddle East, with Qadhafi's forces ready to strike at the gates of \nBenghazi and with Arabs and Muslims in Libya and across the region \npleading for the U.S. military to stop the bloodshed, the United States \nand our allies took action and prevented the massacre Qadhafi had \npromised to commit in a city of 700,000 people. By doing so, we began \ncreating conditions that are increasing the pressure on Qadhafi to give \nup power.\n  Yes, the progress toward this goal has been slower than many had \nhoped and the administration is doing less to achieve it than I and \nothers would like, but the bottom line is this: We are succeeding, \nQadhafi is weakening. His military leaders and closest associates are \nabandoning him. NATO is increasing the tempo of its operations and \ndegrading Qadhafi's military capabilities and command and control. The \nTransitional National Council is gaining international recognition and \nsupport and performing more effectively, and though their progress is \nuneven, opposition forces in Libya are making strategic gains on the \nground.\n  We are all entitled to our opinions about Libya policy, but here are \nthe facts. Qadhafi is going to fall. It is just a matter of time. So I \nask my colleagues, is this the time for Congress to turn against this \npolicy? Is this the time to ride to the rescue of a failing tyrant when \nthe writing is on the wall that he will collapse? Is this the time for \nCongress to declare to the world, to Qadhafi and his inner circle, to \nall of the Libyans who are sacrificing to force Qadhafi from power, and \nto our NATO allies who are carrying a far heavier burden in this \nmilitary operation than we are--is this the time for America to tell \nall of these different audiences that our heart is not in this, that we \nhave neither the will nor the capability to see this mission through, \nthat we will abandon our closest friends and allies on a whim? These \nare the questions every Member of Congress needs to think about long \nand hard but especially my Republican colleagues.\n  Many of us remember well the way some of our friends on the other \nside of the aisle savaged President Bush over the Iraq war and how they \nsought to do everything in their power to tie his hands and pull \nAmerica out of that conflict. We were right to condemn that behavior \nthen, and we would be wrong to practice it now ourselves simply because \nthe leader of the opposite party occupies the White House. Someday--I \nhope soon--a Republican will again occupy the White House, and that \nPresident may need to commit U.S. armed forces to hostilities. So if my \nRepublican colleagues are indifferent to how their actions would affect \nthis President, I would urge them to think seriously about how a vote \nto cut off funding for this military operation can come back to haunt a \nfuture President when the shoe is on the other foot.\n  The House of Representatives will have its say on our involvement in \nLibya this week. The Senate has been silent for too long. It is time \nfor the Senate to speak, and when that time comes I believe we will \nfind a strong bipartisan majority in favor of authorizing our current \nmilitary operations in Libya and seeing this mission through to \nsuccess. That is the message Qadhafi needs to hear; it is a message \nQadhafi's opponents, fighting to liberate their nation, need to hear; \nand it is a message America's friends and allies need to hear.\n  So let's debate this authorization, but then let's vote on it as soon \nas possible.\n  I wish to thank my colleague from Massachusetts for his hard work on \nthis resolution. I understand he will be submitting it very soon. I \nhope the majority leader of the Senate will schedule a debate and vote \non this resolution as soon as possible. It is long overdue.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 20, 2011]\n\n        Scores of U.S. Strikes in Libya Followed Handoff to NATO\n\n                  (By Charlie Savage and Thom Shanker)\n\n       Washington.--Since the United States handed control of the \n     air war in Libya to NATO in early April, American warplanes \n     have struck at Libyan air defenses about 60 times, and \n     remotely operated drones have fired missiles at Libyan forces \n     about 30 times, according to military officials.\n       The most recent strike from a piloted United States \n     aircraft was on Saturday, and the most recent strike from an \n     American drone was on Wednesday, the officials said.\n       While the Obama administration has regularly acknowledged \n     that American forces have continued to take part in some of \n     the strike sorties, few details about their scope and \n     frequency have been made public.\n       The unclassified portion of material about Libya that the \n     White House sent to Congress last week, for example, said \n     ``American strikes are limited to the suppression of enemy \n     air defense and occasional strikes by unmanned Predator'' \n     drones, but included no numbers for such strikes.\n       The disclosure of such details could add texture to an \n     unfolding debate about the merits of the Obama \n     administration's legal argument that it does not need \n     Congressional authorization to continue the mission because \n     United States forces are not engaged in ``hostilities'' \n     within the meaning of the War Powers Resolution.\n       Under that 1973 law, presidents must end unauthorized \n     deployments 60 days after notifying Congress that they have \n     introduced American forces into actual or imminent \n     hostilities. That deadline for the Libyan mission appeared to \n     pass on May 20, but the administration contended that the \n     deadline did not apply because the United States' role had \n     not risen to the level of ``hostilities,'' at least since it \n     handed control of the mission over to NATO.\n       In support of that argument, the administration has pointed \n     to a series of factors, noting, for example, that most of the \n     strikes have been carried out by allies, while the United \n     States has primarily been playing ``non-kinetic'' supporting \n     roles like refueling and surveillance. It has also said there \n     is little risk of American casualties because there are no \n     ground troops and Libyan forces have little ability to \n     exchange fire with American aircraft. And it noted that the \n     mission is constrained from escalating by a United Nations \n     Security Council resolution.\n       The special anti-radar missiles used to suppress enemy air \n     defenses are usually carried by piloted aircraft, not drones, \n     and the Pentagon has regularly said that American military \n     aircraft have continued to conduct these missions. Still, \n     officials have been reluctant to release the exact numbers of \n     strikes.\n       Under military doctrine, strikes aimed at suppressing air \n     defenses are typically considered to be defensive actions, \n     not offensive. On the other hand, military doctrine also \n     considers the turning on of air-defense radar in a no-fly \n     zone to be a ``hostile act.'' It is not clear whether any of \n     the Libyan defenses were made targets because they had turned \n     on such radar.\n       The administration's legal position prompted internal \n     controversy. Top lawyers at the Justice Department and the \n     Pentagon argued that the United States' military activities \n     did amount to ``hostilities'' under the War Powers \n     Resolution, but President Obama sided with top lawyers at the \n     State Department and the White House who contended that they \n     did not cross that threshold.\n       On Monday, Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, \n     acknowledged the internal debate, but defended the judgment \n     made by Mr. Obama, noting that the applicability of the War \n     Powers Resolution to deployments has repeatedly prompted \n     debate over the years.\n       The House of Representatives may vote later this week on a \n     proposal to cut off funding for the Libya mission. The \n     proposal is backed by an odd-bedfellows coalition of antiwar \n     liberals and Tea Party Republicans.\n       They are opposed by an equally unusual alignment of \n     Democrats who support the White House and the intervention in \n     Libya, and more hawkish Republicans.\n       On Monday, a group that includes prominent neoconservative \n     figures--including Liz Cheney, Robert Kagan, William Kristol \n     and Paul Wolfowitz--sent Republicans an open letter opposing \n     efforts to cut off funds for the mission.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I see another colleague who is waiting for \ntime. I ask unanimous consent to proceed for such time as I might use, \nbut it won't be much over 10 minutes.\n\n[[Page S3943]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from Arizona for his \nimportant and courageous comments that run counter to the political \ncurrents of the day, some of which have been expressed in the other \nbody and elsewhere. I thank him for thinking about the strategic \ninterests of the country ahead of some of the political interests with \nrespect to the next election.\n  There have been many occasions when this body has behaved very \ndifferently when a President, either Republican or Democrat, has \nengaged American forces in one way or another without authorization \nwithin that 60-day--or even outside of the 60-day--parameter of the War \nPowers Act. The fact is, we have had a number of military actions--\nPanama, Libya in 1986, Grenada in 1983, Iran in 1980, Haiti in 1993, \nthe Persian Gulf in 1987 to 1988, Lebanon in 1982, and then \nsubsequently Kosovo in 1999, Bosnia in 1992, Somalia in 1992--which \ndidn't have this fight about authorization.\n  In fact, only Iraq in 2003, Afghanistan in 2001, and Iraq in 1990 \nwere authorized prior to our engagement. The fact is, four of those I \nmentioned ended before the 60 days had expired, but the others didn't. \nBosnia, Kosovo, and Somalia all went beyond 60 days, and the issue was \nnever raised. So I think it is important for us to put this in context, \nif you will, and to measure some of the realities and the choices we \nface with respect to Libya today.\n  We will shortly this morning--a little later--be submitting this \nresolution. It is a bipartisan resolution. Democrats and Republicans \nare joining together to put in a very limited authorization with \nrespect to our engagement in a support role--not any direct engagement \nbut a support role only--and it is limited to that support role.\n  I am particularly familiar with the debate relating to, and with the \nWar Powers Act itself, over these years because that was a debate that \ntook place specifically in response to the war that Senator McCain and \nI were both a part of--the Vietnam war. The War Powers Act was a direct \nreaction to that war which was at that time the longest war in our \nhistory, until now--Afghanistan--10 years in duration. Over 58,000 \nAmericans lost their lives, and it spanned several administrations, \nincluding Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon. The fact is, as a result of that \nwar in which we never declared war, the Congress wanted to assert its \nappropriate prerogatives with respect to the declaration of war and the \nengagement of American forces. So the War Powers Act was passed.\n  The War Powers Act very specifically created this dynamic where the \nCongress had 60 days to act. The President could deploy troops for a \nperiod of 60 days without their action, and if they hadn't acted, the \ninaction itself would require a President to then withdraw troops. So \nit didn't actually require the Congress to act, but it created this 60-\nday period. The fact is, any Member of Congress during those 60 days \ncould bring a resolution to the floor denying the President the right \nto go forward. Nobody did that in the past 60 days, I am glad to say, \nand we are now beyond those 60 days.\n  It is not without precedent, incidentally, that we have authorized an \naction much later. In fact, I think one action was specifically \nauthorized for about a year, and that was the action in Lebanon. About \na year after they had landed it was authorized. So we are within days \nof that in terms of this discussion.\n  Let me read specifically what the War Powers Act says. It says:\n\n       In the absence of a declaration of war, in any case in \n     which the United States Armed Forces are introduced into \n     hostilities or into situations where imminent involvement in \n     hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances. . . .\n\n  I think the operative words, the critical words, are ``United States \nArmed Forces are introduced into hostilities.''\n  Now, one could argue, as people are--there is an article in the \nWashington Post today, and there are other articles where people are \nsaying: Well, of course we are in hostilities. Hostilities are taking \nplace. Bombs are being dropped. But that is not, in my judgment, even \nthough I support the War Powers Act--and President Obama, incidentally, \nhas supported it here, which is unique from other Presidents--but the \nfact is, just because hostilities are taking place and we are \nsupporting people engaged in those hostilities does not mean we are \nourselves, in fact, introducing troops into hostilities.\n  No American is being shot at. No American troop is on the ground or \ncontemplated being put on the ground. So the mere fact that others are \nengaged in hostilities and we are supporting them I don't believe \nautomatically triggers what was contemplated in the aftermath of the \nVietnam war.\n  Frankly, that is not the principal argument we need to be having. \nWhat we need to be doing is looking at the bigger picture. I don't \nthink any country--the United States, the U.N., or any nation--ought to \nbe drawn lightly into any kind of military intervention. I have always \nargued that. But, in my judgment, there were powerful reasons the \nUnited States should have joined in establishing the no-fly zone over \nLibya and forcing Qadhafi to keep his most potent weapons out of the \nfight.\n  If we slice through the fog of misinformation and weigh the risks and \nthe benefits alongside our values and our interests, which are always \nat stake, I think the justification for the President's involvement, \nfor our country's involvement, and for our supporting it are \ncompelling, and I think they are clear.\n  What is happening in the Middle East right now could be the single \nmost important geostrategic shift since the fall of the Berlin Wall. It \nhas profound implications for U.S. expenditures and for U.S. military \nengagement in other parts of the region. It has significant impact on \nthe threats we will face, on the potential strategic risks for our \ncountry, and for our interests in terms of that region.\n  Absent United Nations-NATO resolve, the promise that the prodemocracy \nmovement holds for transforming the Arab world--the whole Arab world--\nand all it could mean for the United States in terms of hopes for peace \nbetween Israel and Palestine, hopes for a different set of \nrelationships, hopes for restraining Wahabi-ism, hopes for diminishing \nthe levels of religious extremism, hopes for reducing the amount of \nterrorism--all of those things are contained in this awakening, in this \ntransformation people are trying to achieve. It is an effort which I \nand others believe would have been crushed if the hopes of the \nprodemocracy movement were simply ignored and we turned our backs on \nthem.\n  I can't imagine--just think about the consequences. Colonel Qadhafi \nsays: I am going to show no mercy. I am going to go and kill those \ndogs--dogs--who have risen up and expressed their desire to have \nfundamental freedoms and rights. He is going to go into Benghazi and he \nis going to annihilate anybody who is in opposition to him. We already \nsaw him pulling people out of hospital beds. We already saw him \nattacking women--using rape as a tool of war--dishonoring people in the \nMuslim world as a consequence for life. We saw what he was doing.\n  Are we really serious that in the wake of the gulf states, in an \nunprecedented request saying to us: We want your help; in the wake of \nthe Arab League in an unprecedented request asking for U.S. and other \nWestern engagement in their part of the world to stand up for these \nrights, that we would simply say: Too bad, so sad, go about your \nbusiness, we have better things to do?\n  The consequences would have been extraordinary. Remember, President \nClinton said his greatest regret of his Presidency was he didn't engage \nin Rwanda and prevent--which we could have done at very low cost--what \nhappened with the genocide in Rwanda. That is his greatest regret.\n  How many Senators have gone to Israel and gone somewhere else in the \nworld and said to people with respect to the Holocaust: Never again; \nnever again. Do the words only apply to one group of people or do the \nwords have meaning in terms of genocide, in terms of wanton killing of \ninnocent people at the hands of a dictator?\n  So what is the cost to us of this great effort? I believe other \ndictators would have seen the failure to challenge Qadhafi as a \ncomplete license to act with impunity against their people at any other \nplace.\n\n[[Page S3944]]\n\n  The vast majority of the protesters in these countries are simply \ncrying out for the opportunity to live a decent life, get a job, \nprovide for a family, have opportunities, and have rights. I think \nabandoning them would have betrayed not only the people seeking \ndemocratic freedoms, but it would have abandoned the core values of our \ncountry. And I can hear now--I can hear it. Some of the same people now \nwho are complaining about the President being involved would have been \nthe first people at the barricade complaining about why the United \nStates did not stand up for our values and how feckless the President \nwas that he was not willing to stop a dictator from coming at these \ninnocent people. You can hear it. Everybody in the country knows that \nis exactly where we would be.\n  Now, why there and not in Syria? A legitimate question. There are \ndifferent interests and different capacities. The reality is, the Gulf \nStates asked us to come in. The Arab League asked us to come in. And we \nknew whom we were dealing with with respect to the council and the \nplayers. There is a whole set of uncertainties with respect to Syria, \neven today, that distinguish it both in terms of what we can assert and \nwhat we can achieve, and sometimes both in foreign policy and in \ndomestic policy you are limited to what you can achieve and to what is \ndoable in a certain situation.\n  I believe if we had simply turned our backs, as some people are now \narguing we ought to do now, which would be the most reckless thing I \nhave ever heard in my life--at a moment where people are actually \nachieving the goals, where the pressures are mounting, where Qadhafi is \nless able to maneuver, where his forces have been reduced, where many \npeople in our intelligence community and in the NATO intelligence \ncommunity are saying there is progress being made and the vice is \ntightening--that we would suddenly just pull the rug out from under \nthat is extraordinary to me. Snatch--snatch--defeat from the jaws of \nvictory. I believe--I cannot tell you when it might happen, but I am \nabsolutely confident it is going to happen--Qadhafi is finished. Ask \nthe people in the country. Even his own supporters are reacting out of \nfear. And the truth is, the vice is tightening because every day that \ngoes by, the opposition gets stronger; every day that goes by, he has \nless ability to manage the affairs of the country itself.\n  I think if we simply send the message the House of Representatives is \ncontemplating today, it would be a moment of infamy, frankly, with \nrespect to the House and with respect to our interests because it would \nreinforce the all too common misperception on the Arab street that \nAmerica says one thing and does another.\n  We are already spending billions of dollars in the fight against \nextremism in many parts of the world. We did not choose this fight. \nEverybody knows that. It was forced on us, starting with 9/11. To fail \nto see the opportunity of affirming the courageous demand of millions \nof disenfranchised young people who had been the greatest recruits for \nal-Qaida for the extremism, for any of the extremist groups--to not \naffirm their quest now to try to push back against repression and \noppression and to try to open a set of opportunities for themselves for \njobs, for respect, for democracy--I think to turn our backs on that \nwould be ignorant, irresponsible, shortsighted, and dangerous for our \ncountry. It would ignore our real national security interests, and it \nwould help extend the narrative of resentment toward the United States \nand much of the West that is rooted in colonialism and furthered by our \nown invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Remember, the pleas for help did not just come from the Libyan \nrebels. And this is not something we just cooked up here at home with \nsome desire to go get engaged somewhere. It came from the Arab League, \nwhich has never before asked for this kind of assistance. It came from \nthe Gulf States, which have never before said to the West: We need your \nhelp to come intervene.\n  Even at the hand of their own leader, it seems to me that if we had \nsilently accepted the deaths of Muslims, we would have set back our \nrelations for decades. Instead, by responding and giving the popular \nuprising a chance to take power, I think the United States and our \nallies send a message of solidarity with the aspirations of people \neverywhere, and I believe that will be remembered for generations.\n  The particular nature of the madman who was vowing to ``show no \nmercy'' to his own people, to his own fellow Muslims, the particular \nnature of this man, who was going to go after the ``dogs'' who dared to \nchallenge him, and his role in the past, I believe, mandated that we \nrespond. And we responded in a stunningly limited way.\n  I do think our colleagues from New Jersey and New York and other \nStates in New England need to reflect on the fact--they do not really \nneed a reminder, I suspect--that Qadhafi is the man who was behind the \nbombing of Pan Am 103, claiming the lives of 189 Americans.\n  The intervention in Libya, in my judgment, sends a critical signal to \nother leaders in the region that they cannot automatically assume they \ncan simply resort to large-scale violence to put down legitimate \ndemands for reform without any consequences. I think U.N. resolve in \nLibya can have an impact on future calculations. Indeed, I think the \nleaders of Iran need to pay close attention to the resolve that is \nexhibited by the international community, and we need to think about \nthat resolve in the context of our interests in Iran.\n  The resolution we will submit--Senator McCain and myself and other \nSenators--is absolutely not a blank check for the President. Not at \nall. It is a resolution that authorizes limited use of American forces \nin a supporting role. I want to emphasize that. There is only an \nauthorization for a supporting role. It says specifically that the \nSenate does not support the use of ground troops in Libya. The \nPresident has stated that is his policy, but we adopt that policy in \nthis resolution. It authorizes the limited use of American forces for a \nlimited duration, and it would expire 1 year from the time of \nauthorization.\n  This resolution envisions action consistent with the letter the \nPresident sent to congressional leaders on May 20 in which he specified \nthat the U.S. participation in Libya has consisted of nonkinetic \nsupport of the NATO-led operation, including intelligence, logistical \nsupport, and search and rescue missions.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used 20 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I think I asked for such time as I would \nuse, but I will try to tighten it up.\n  The administration informed Congress last week it does not consider \nthe use of U.S. forces to rise to the level of ``hostilities.'' I have \nalready discussed that. I think there is an important constitutional \nquestion here, but it is not a new question. The truth is that \nPresidents--Democratic and Republican--have undertaken limited military \naction. I mentioned each of those instances.\n  I think this debate is healthy, but the words we use about it have \nconsequences. They send a message. And I think none of us should send \nany message to Colonel Qadhafi lightly. The last message any U.S. \nSenator wants to send, in my judgment, is that all he has to do is wait \nus out, all he has to do is wait for the Congress--even as the progress \nis being made and the vice is tightening--because we are divided at \nhome.\n  I believe passage of this resolution would be an important step in \nshowing the country and the rest of the world and particularly showing \nMuammar Qadhafi that the Congress of the United States and the \nPresident of the United States are committed to this critical endeavor. \nI firmly believe the country is on the strongest footing when the \nPresident and the Congress speak with one voice on foreign policy \nmatters. So I hope our colleagues will support this resolution.\n  For 60 years, we have been working to build a cohesive and consistent \nalliance with our partners in NATO. Many times our military and \npolitical leaders have complained that our European allies have not \ncarried their share of the burden; that Americans have paid too high a \nprice in blood and treasure; that we have led while others followed. \nEarlier this month, Secretary Gates warned that the NATO alliance is at \nrisk because of European penny-pinching and distaste for front-line \ncombat. He said the United States was not going to carry the alliance \nas a charity\n\n[[Page S3945]]\n\ncase. Well, here is the alliance leading. Here is the alliance doing \nwhat we have wanted them to do for years. And here, all of a sudden, \nare Members of Congress suggesting it is OK to pull the rug out from \nunder that alliance. I think that would really toll the bell for NATO.\n  I believe we need to see the realities of the strategic interests \nthat are on the table and proceed. Will we stand up for our values and \nour interests at the same time? Will we support the legitimate \naspirations of the Libyan people? I think our own security ultimately \nwill be strengthened immeasurably if we can assist them to transition \nto a democracy. The cost now will be far, far less than the cost in the \nfuture if we lose our resolve now.\n  I thank my colleague for his generous allowance of the extra time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/21/senate-section/article/S3945-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3945-S3946]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, over a year ago now, the President \nsigned into law health care legislation that we are finding is \ncertainly long on promises but short on sound policy. Unfortunately, \nthe legislation did not follow a transparent or thorough process. \nInstead, it was hastily rushed through on a premise that has now become \nfamous, as said by Speaker Pelosi: We have to pass it to see what is in \nit. Now, almost daily, newspapers, constituent mail, and independent \nreports continue to reveal that the law's promises are not reality.\n  Recently, the Columbus Dispatch told the story of a family with a \npreexisting condition. Two years ago, their struggles to find health \ninsurance coverage outraged this administration. In fact, their \nhardship was specifically used as an example of why we needed to get \nthe health care system reformed. Well, party affiliation did not define \nhow we felt about this family. We all empathized and sympathized with \ntheir struggles and recognized the need for basic health insurance \nreforms. But, unfortunately, we did not harness that common ground to \ndevelop sound policy that addresses the very real problems within the \nhealth care system. Instead, a bitterly partisan bill was shoved \nthrough Congress, and now we are stuck with its consequences.\n  So what are the consequences for the family who struggled to get \ninsurance? The article reports that their annual premium has increased \na whopping $12,000. Clearly, one result of the law is soaring premiums. \nPresident Obama promised no fewer than 20 times that he would cut \npremiums by $2,500 for the average family by the end of his term. But, \nunfortunately, this is not an isolated story. This broken promise is \nevident in homes all across this great Nation. Mail from frustrated \nNebraskans continues to flood my office. They question how a health \ncare law that costs so much yet still allows skyrocketing premiums \ncould have ever passed.\n  A single mother from Bellevue, NE, recently found out that her \nfamily's health care premium increased by $700 per year. Her insurance \nprovider explained it was due to mandates in the new health care law.\n  She pleaded with me:\n\n       Please stand up on behalf of single moms like me. We do all \n     we can to hold our world together, give up time with our \n     children to work two jobs . . . and now this! How am I \n     supposed to maintain health insurance for my family?\n\n  Well, I wish I could tell constituents their premiums will not go up, \nas the President promised. I wish I could tell them the new health care \nlaw addressed the rising costs of health care, as the President \npromised it would. Instead, these stories reflect what the experts \npredicted would happen if the law passed. The nonpartisan Congressional \nBudget Office estimated that individual health insurance premiums would \nincrease by an average of $2,100 per family due solely to the new \nmandates included in the law. That puts the gap between Candidate \nObama's promise and President Obama's health care law at an alarming \n$4,600 per family.\n  The administration's own Medicare Actuary expects health care costs \nto increase $311 billion over the next decade under the new law. In \nfact, the Actuary testified that the President's promise that the \nhealth care law would lower costs was ``false, more so than true.''\n  Now, some may say: Mike, just wait until the law is fully \nimplemented. That is when the promises will be fulfilled. But I \ncontinue to get reports on my desk forecasting the negative \nconsequences of this irresponsible and shortsighted piece of \nlegislation.\n  For example, one of the law's major flaws is that about half of its \nnew health insurance coverage is achieved by locking millions of more \npeople on an already-broken Medicaid system.\n  Yet the New England Journal of Medicine recently released a study \nshowing those on Medicaid struggle to find doctors to treat them.\n  The medical journal's research revealed that 66 percent of \nindividuals who mentioned Medicaid's Children Health Insurance Program \nwhen calling to schedule a medical appointment were denied an \nappointment for the child.\n  That is compared to only 11 percent who said they had private \ninsurance.\n  That is right--those on Medicaid's CHIP were six times more likely to \nbe denied treatment.\n  And when Medicaid was accepted, the children had to wait, on average, \n22 days longer than those with private insurance.\n  Researchers blame low Medicaid payments, delays in paying, and \nbureaucratic redtape driving doctors from even accepting these \npatients.\n  As a former Governor, I can tell you that these problems have long \nplagued the Medicaid Program.\n  Yet in 2014 the President's new law dramatically expands Medicaid, \ndumping over 24 million more Americans onto this very broken system. \nHow can the President promise guaranteed coverage for these millions of \nAmericans when this study shows the majority of our most vulnerable \npopulation is denied treatment under the Medicaid system? The bottom \nline is you cannot receive care if you cannot find a doctor to provide \nit. The logic simply does not match the promise.\n  Another recent study by the consulting group McKinsey & Company calls \nanother one of the President's guarantees into question. Their study \nanalyzed the impact of the health care law on employer-sponsored \nbenefits.\n  Prior to the health care law, America's employers were the backbone \nof our Nation's health care system, providing 165 million Americans \nwith health care coverage. The McKinsey study found that 30 percent of \nemployers will definitely or probably stop offering their employees \nhealth care insurance after 2014.\n  During the health care debate, supporters of the law insisted that \nthe law builds on the principle of employer-sponsored coverage.\n  The President even repeatedly promised if you like your plan, you can \nkeep it. But again, this appears to be an empty promise.\n  According to the study--and others that came before it--employees \nwill be stripped of plans that they like and dumped onto the new law's \nhealth care exchanges to fend for themselves.\n  I realize there is some disagreement surrounding this particular \nstudy. But how can we deny this commonsense logic?\n  The more you know about this law, the more you conclude it just does \nnot make sense for employers to offer a health care plan.\n  Beginning in 2014, the health care law mandates that employers with \nmore than 50 workers offer health insurance coverage or pay a penalty \nof $2,000 per worker. And with this mandate comes a slew of other \nrequirements. Suddenly dropping coverage and paying the $2,000 penalty \nbecomes an economic necessity.\n  During the health care debate, I spoke about this on the Senate \nfloor. I and many others warned that the proposed penalties for \nbusinesses would create a perverse incentive. When you do the math, I \nsaid back then this is no penalty at all, compared to the cost of \nprivate insurance.\n  It is a wise business decision if you are worried about the bottom \nline. That is how the law encourages employers to dump their employees \nonto the exchange.\n  A Deloitte consultant told the Associated Press, ``I don't know if \nthe intent was to find an exit strategy for providing benefits, but the \nbill as written provides the mechanism.'' John Deere has responded by \nsaying businesses will look into ``just paying the\n\n[[Page S3946]]\n\nfine.'' Not surprisingly, employers have done their own math. AT \nreported that its $2.4 billion cost of coverage would drop to $600 \nmillion for the penalties. Estimates reveal Caterpillar could save 70 \npercent on health care costs by eliminating coverage and paying the \npenalties. And the list goes on.\n  Prior to its passage, the Congressional Budget Office predicted 7 \npercent of employers would drop insurance coverage due to the health \ncare law. Now studies and business logic are challenging that estimate. \nThis may mean the CBO's projected cost of the health care law may be \nsignificantly too low.\n  That is right--the $2.6 trillion cost estimate for the health care \nlaw could be surprisingly too low. The President promised that this \nbill would lift the burden off the middle class. Not only will they see \ntheir premiums continue to increase due to out-of-control health care \ncosts, but they will foot the cost of the new exchanges.\n  Unfortunately, time is confirming what we have been predicting all \nalong. The case for repeal of the health care law grows stronger every \nday. I will work to overturn these negative consequences. I believe \nAmericans deserve better. They deserve promises that we can keep.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/21/senate-section/article/S3946-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3946]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             MONTANA FLOODS\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I wish to talk a little bit about the \nflooding that is going on in Montana and has been going on for \nbasically better than the last month. The picture I have is that of the \nMusselshell River east of Roundup. The river channel is not in this \narea. In fact, it is on the far side of this river.\n  My guess is--I have not seen this--this picture was taken about 10 \ndays ago. But my guess is, it is still flowing like this and for a \nnumber of reasons I want to address in my speech today.\n  Over the past few months, we have seen severe flooding in Montana \nthat has impacted our homes and businesses. It has devastated farmland \nand ranch land. It has displaced families across our State.\n  The flooding has tested thousands of Montanans and the basic services \nand infrastructure they rely on every day. But when disaster hits \nMontana, we rise to the occasion. When I meet the families and the \ncommunity leaders affected by flooding and when I tour their towns, I \ndo not see resignation or hopelessness. I see resilience. I see our \ntraditions of hard work and working together. I see communities that \nare rebuilding and moving forward, ordinary people and local officials \nworking diligently with local, State, and Federal partners to address \nurgent and ongoing needs they are unable to address alone.\n  Thanks to that spirit of working together, neighbor to neighbor, \nMontana communities are rebuilding and businesses are reopening. We are \nlooking to account for the severe crop damage and livestock loss \nsuffered by Montana's farmers and ranchers, and we are looking for \nresources to make up for the $8.6 million in damages to our State's \ninfrastructure. Sadly, that number is only getting bigger.\n  Montana's resiliency is going to be tested because we are not out of \nit yet--not even close. Given the unusually significant snowpack in the \nRocky Mountains that has yet to melt, our rivers and streams will \ncontinue to swell. The cost to Montana communities and families will \ncontinue to mount, and more and more of them will look to emergency \nassistance to provide timely services and assistance to those most in \nneed, to help them get back on their feet.\n  That is why I am particularly alarmed by the looming shortfall in \nFEMA's Disaster Relief Fund, which the House left dangerously unfunded, \neven amid a string of weather-related disasters across this country \nthat have led us to 45 declared disasters. We are now looking at \nestimates of a $2 to nearly $5 billion shortfall for fiscal year 2012 \nalone.\n  The total need is estimated to be as much as $6.6 billion. Montana is \nstill tallying the damage. The risk of further damage is still very \nhigh. Yet we do not know right now if there will be enough money left \nover to meet the needs this disaster has already created in our State \nof Montana.\n  The House thinks we should pay for past disasters with funding \nallocated for current and future disasters and by cutting assistance to \nfirefighters and other first responders. In Roundup, Billings, and \nelsewhere in Montana, the folks who are rescuing stranded residents in \nboats to take them to get urgent medical care are not from FEMA; they \nare the same men and women who fight to protect our communities every \nday--the cops and firefighters who are part of these communities.\n  Taking away the resources they need will not fly. It is irresponsible \nand unacceptable. I want all my colleagues to understand the importance \nof what we are facing, not just in Montana but across this country. \nThere are 45 declared disasters around the country. It is time to do \nour part for communities all across this country that are facing \nunprecedented disasters from floods, tornadoes, to wildfires.\n  Let's make sure this Nation's emergency responders have what they \nneed to do their jobs. They are doing their part for all of us. Tough \neconomic times have forced us all into some very difficult decisions. \nThere is no doubt about that. But it is critical that we do everything \nwe can on behalf of the communities and families across our Nation who \nare simply looking to pick up the pieces, to rebuild their homes, their \nschools and businesses, and to get back on their feet.\n  When small businesses cannot get back on their feet and when our No. \n1 industry, agriculture, gets a punch during the growing season, our \nentire economy will be impacted in a negative way. Montanans will \ncontinue to be resilient, and they will continue looking out for one \nanother. But there are some burdens that are simply too big for them to \nbear alone. It is time for Congress to stand, do its part, and the \nsooner the better.\n  I look forward to working with Chairman Landrieu and Ranking Member \nCoats on the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee to make sure \nthat no community from Montana or anywhere else in the country is left \nwondering if the government will make good on a commitment to help them \nrebuild.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester).

SIMON TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR \n                         THE DISTRICT OF OREGON\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Michael H. \nSimon, of Oregon, to be United States District Judge for the District \nof Oregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 1 hour \nof debate on the nomination, equally divided in the usual form.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Senate will finally consider the \nnomination of Michael Simon to fill a judicial emergency vacancy on the \nDistrict\n\n[[Page S3947]]\n\nCourt for the District of Oregon. Mr. Simon, the head of litigation at \nthe Portland office of Perkins Coie, is one of the most highly regarded \nlawyers in the country. He spent 5 years as a trial attorney at the \nDepartment of Justice during the Reagan administration, including a \nstint as a Federal prosecutor, and 3 years as a volunteer judge pro tem \non an Oregon county court. Mr. Simon's nomination has had the strong \nsupport of his home State Senators, Senator Wyden and Senator Merkley, \nsince he was nominated nearly a year ago and has twice been reported by \nthe Judiciary Committee with significant bipartisan support. I mention \nthat because, traditionally, someone like this would go through almost \nthe first day after he was reported.\n  I thank the majority leader and the Republican leader for finally \nscheduling this vote. It is most unfortunate that the Republicans \nobjected to considering this nomination when it was reported last year. \nThat meant that we had to spend more time and taxpayer money to \nconsider it a second time in the Judiciary Committee, and the \nnomination had to be reported again earlier this year. It should not \nhave taken more than 4 months since the committee reported Mr. Simon's \nnomination for a second time for the Senate Republican leadership to \nfinally consent to debate and a vote.\n  This is, finally, the last of the judicial nominations reported last \nyear that could and in my view should have been considered then. Now, \nafter 6 months of unnecessary delay, the people of the District of \nOregon may finally see a longstanding judicial vacancy filled by a \nhighly qualified nominee who has always had bipartisan support from the \ndays he was working for the Reagan administration. The Senate may \nfinally be able, 6 months into this year, to start to focus on nominees \nwho had hearings and were considered by the Judiciary Committee this \nyear. There are currently 16 judicial nominees who were reported \nunanimously by the Judiciary Committee over the last several months who \nare still awaiting final Senate consideration and confirmation. They \ninclude nominees with the support of Republican home State Senators and \nnominees for judicial emergency vacancies. These delays mean that \njudicial vacancies around the country remain well above what they \nshould and could be. With current vacancies hovering around 90 and many \nmore upcoming, the Senate is being prevented from solving the vacancies \ncrisis that the Chief Justice, President, Attorney General and judges \naround the country have urged us to end.\n  When we take nominations considered 1 year and then delay them into \nthe next year, it is wrong to say that you are ``moving right along.'' \nI have served with Presidents Ford, Carter, Reagan, the first President \nBush, Clinton, the second President Bush, and now President Obama. \nDuring all that time, whether Democrats or Republicans were in the \nmajority, no President had to put up with these unseemly delays, except \nfor President Obama.\n  The delay in considering this nomination is only the latest \ndemonstration that those on the other side who say the majority leader \ncan simply call up nominations are wrong. Senators know it is not true. \nIf that were true, nominees like Mr. Simon would have been considered \nand voted on last year.\n  Some Senators may seek to avoid responsibility for the Senate's \nhistorically slow pace of confirming judicial nominations and claim \ntheir hands are clean, but they know the Senate is a body that requires \nconsent to avoid extensive delays. They know that if there is no \nconsent, it takes the burdensome requirement of invoking cloture in \norder to end a filibuster and have a vote. Moving forward to address \nthe ongoing judicial vacancy crisis--and it is a crisis--requires \ncooperation. It requires the minority to work together with the \nmajority and set aside partisan differences for the good of the \nAmerican people.\n  Last week, the Senate was able to get consent to confirm the first \ntwo judicial nominees since May 17, even though almost a score of \nqualified nominees has been awaiting final confirmation since that \ndate. In addition to the Simon nomination, there are 19 judicial \nnominations currently pending on the Senate's Executive Calendar. Of \nthose, 16 are, by anyone's definition, consensus nominees. Seven of \nthem were nominated to fill judicial emergency vacancies. Sixteen \nnominees were unanimously approved by every Republican and every \nDemocratic Senator on the Judiciary Committee after thorough review, \nand an additional nominee was reported with only one Senator in \nopposition. All are supported by their home State Senators, Republicans \nand Democrats.\n  These are the kinds of nominees who in past years would have been \nconfirmed within days of being reported to the Senate. Instead, \nextended delays now burden every nomination before the Republican \nleadership finally consents, if it does, to take up nominations. Mr. \nSimon's nomination was first reported with bipartisan support last \nDecember. Three district court nominations reported unanimously by the \nCommittee in early April remain stalled before the Senate, Paul Oetken \nand Paul Engelmayer of New York, and Romana Manglona of the Mariana \nIslands. All of these consensus nominations would easily have been \nconfirmed if the majority leader was not blocked from bringing them up. \nWe should not need to file cloture to vote on these kinds of consensus \nnominees, but that is what has been required by the Senate Republican \nminority. Incidentally, when we have filed for cloture on these \nnominees, for many of them we got a vote and they passed \noverwhelmingly.\n  We should have regular votes on President Obama's highly qualified \nnominees instead of more delays. We should also restore the Senate's \ntradition--a tradition I can speak to as one who has been in the Senate \nfor 37 years--of working to clear the calendar of pending nominations \nbefore a recess. Contrast that traditional practice with what the \nSenate did before the Memorial Day recess, when no judicial nominees \nwere confirmed. With vacancies still totaling more than 90 on Federal \ncourts throughout the country, and with nearly two dozen future \nvacancies on the horizon, there is no time to delay consideration of \nthese nominations. If we were to take positive action just on the \nnominees who received unanimous support in committee, vacancies could \nbe reduced below 80 for the first time since the beginning of President \nObama's administration.\n  With judicial vacancies continuing at crisis levels, affecting the \nability of courts to provide justice to Americans around the country, I \nhave been urging the Senate to vote on the judicial nominations \nreported favorably by the Judiciary Committee and pending on the \nSenate's Executive Calendar. My efforts have not yielded much success \nor sense of urgency. Nor have the statements by the Chief Justice of \nthe United States, the Attorney General of the United States, the \nFederal Bar Association and a number of Federal judges across the \ncountry.\n  Those who delay or prevent the filling of these vacancies must \nunderstand they are delaying and preventing the administration of \njustice. We can pass all the bills we want to protect American \ntaxpayers from fraud and other crimes, but you cannot lock up criminals \nor recover ill-gotten gains if you do not have judges. The mounting \nbacklogs of civil and criminal cases are growing larger.\n  I think of the first 2 years of the last President Bush's term in \noffice. During the 7 months that Republicans had the majority, they did \nnot bother to hold a hearing on President Bush's nominees. But in the \n17 months that the Democrats were in charge, the Democrats held \nhearings and confirmed 100 of his nominees. To their credit, in the \nfollowing 24 months, the Republicans confirmed 105.\n  Ah, for those days.\n  Our ability to make progress regarding nominations has been hampered \nby the creation of what I consider to be misplaced controversy over \nmany nominees' records. As with the long-delayed nomination of Judge \nEdward Chen, the supposed ``controversy'' that has delayed and \nobstructed the nomination of Michael Simon is the result of some \nSenators seeking to impose a partisan litmus test in place of our sworn \nconstitutional duty to offer advice and consent on nominations. That \nMr. Simon filed amicus briefs on behalf of the ACLU and several Jewish \norganizations in cases involving the First Amendment, discrimination \nagainst gay and lesbian individuals, and the rights of religious \nminorities does not\n\n[[Page S3948]]\n\nrender him unfit to be a judge. Our legal system is an adversary \nsystem, predicated upon legal advocacy for both sides. Certainly \ndefending civil liberties is no vice. Since when do we impose a litmus \ntest for nominees that they can never have been legal advocates? If we \nwere to do that, we would have no judges. Almost every nominee who had \nbeen a practicing lawyer would be disqualified by one side or the \nother.\n  I had hoped when 11 Republican Senators joined in voting to end a \nfilibuster against Judge Jack McConnell of Rhode Island that the Senate \nwas moving away from the narrow, partisan attacks on judicial \nnominations that have slowed us from making progress since President \nObama took office. Yet the successful Republican filibuster of the \nnomination of Professor Goodwin Liu to the Ninth Circuit was one of the \nmost disappointing votes I have seen in the U.S. Senate. There were no \n``extraordinary circumstances'' or justification for this partisan \nfilibuster of a good man and brilliant nominee.\n  In the wake of the filibuster, newspapers around the country decried \nthe Senate for denying Professor Liu the up-or-down vote that \nRepublican Senators argued just a few years ago every nominee was \nentitled to have when there was a Republican in the White House. The \nNew York Times editorialized that the standard of ``extraordinary \ncircumstances'' for filibustering nominees ``is meaningless if senators \nare going to define someone like Mr. Liu as a legal extremist.''\n  The editorial continued:\n\n       He is, not surprisingly, a liberal thinker who is \n     nonetheless squarely in the legal mainstream, having even \n     received the support of strong conservatives, including \n     Kenneth Starr and Clint Bolick.\n\n  The New York Times also described the filibuster of Professor Liu as \n``payback'' making it ``harder to fill benches during this \nadministration and many more to come.''\n  The Denver Post wrote in an editorial:\n\n       The Senate filibuster last week of federal appellate court \n     candidate Goodwin Liu wasn't just a defeat for the president \n     who nominated him. It signifies the dissolution of a truce \n     that had been struck years earlier in which senators had \n     generally agreed not to hold hostage qualified judicial \n     candidates from the opposing political party. It is a shame \n     it has come to this.\n\n  The San Francisco Chronicle editorialized:\n\n       Fair-minded people who have looked at Liu's record and \n     determined that he has the intellect and temperament to be a \n     superb appellate judge include prominent conservatives \n     Richard Painter, chief ethics lawyer in the Bush White House, \n     and Whitewater prosecutor Ken Starr. But neither fair play \n     nor intellectual honesty carried the day in the Senate, where \n     Liu's nomination remained bottled up through the efforts of \n     multiple Republicans who had opined (in the Bush years) that \n     it was unconstitutional for senators to deprive a judicial \n     nominee of an up-or-down vote.\n\n  In an editorial entitled, ``Trashing of Court Nominees Must End,'' \nthe Iowa City Press-Citizen wrote:\n\n       What is most disturbing about Thursday's Senate vote is not \n     the fact that the Senate rejected this nominee, but how it \n     was done: by a filibuster. In other words, the Republicans \n     used the Senate rules to prevent a simple up-or-down vote on \n     the Liu nomination.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that copies of these editorials be printed in \nthe Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. The question for me about Mr. Simon is the same question I \nhave asked about Judge Chen, Professor Liu, and every judicial nominee, \nwhether nominated by a Democrat or a Republican President: whether he \nor she will have judicial independence. I don't care what their \npolitics are. I don't care what party they belong to. I don't care who \nthey have represented in the past. All I want to know is: Will they \nhave judicial independence? Do they understand the role of a judge and \nhow that differs from the role of an advocate?\n  The judge has to protect everybody in their courtroom, on both sides. \nThere is no question that Michael Simon is going to have judicial \nindependence. So I hope Senators today will set aside their partisan \nlitmus test and join me in supporting this fine nomination.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the New York Times, May 22, 2011]\n\n                             Breaking Faith\n\n       ``I will not vote to deny a vote to a Democratic \n     president's judicial nominee just because the nominee may \n     have views more liberal than mine.''\n       That was Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, \n     promising in 2003 not to filibuster judicial nominees for \n     reasons of ideology. But on Thursday, Mr. Alexander, along \n     with 41 other Senate Republicans, voted to filibuster one of \n     President Obama's judicial nominees for that very reason--\n     breaking a promise and kindling yet another row over a \n     president's right to appoint like-minded judges.\n       The fight was over Goodwin Liu, a Berkeley law professor \n     nominated by the president for a seat on the Ninth Circuit \n     Court of Appeals. He lost on a vote of 52 to 43, short of the \n     60-vote requirement demanded by Republicans.\n       He became the first Obama nominee to be successfully \n     filibustered, and the only nominee since 2005. That year, a \n     Senate ``Gang of 14'' agreed that such nominees should be \n     allowed an up-or-down majority vote except in extraordinary \n     circumstances.\n       The group was correct in preserving the right to filibuster \n     the most extreme candidates, but the agreement is meaningless \n     if senators are going to define someone like Mr. Liu as a \n     legal extremist. He is, not surprisingly, a liberal thinker \n     who is nonetheless squarely in the legal mainstream, having \n     even received the support of strong conservatives, including \n     Kenneth Starr and Clint Bolick.\n       What, specifically, made him so extraordinary that he was \n     not worthy of an up-or-down vote? The Republican argument \n     against him is laughably thin. ``He believes the Constitution \n     is a fluid, evolving document,'' said Jeff Sessions of \n     Alabama. John Cornyn of Texas falsely accused Mr. Liu of \n     holding the ``ridiculous view that our Constitution somehow \n     guarantees a European-style welfare state.''\n       But other Republicans were more forthcoming about the real \n     reason for the blockade: Mr. Liu dared to criticize Justice \n     Samuel Alito Jr. as harshly conservative before he was \n     confirmed to the Supreme Court. The filibuster apparently was \n     payback, and the Republican eagerness for revenge has broken \n     faith and a clear understanding on the Senate floor. That \n     will make it harder to fill benches during this \n     administration and many more to come.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  [From denverpost.com, May 28, 2011]\n\n              Editorial: So Much for the Gang of 14 Truce\n\n       The Senate filibuster last week of federal appellate court \n     candidate Goodwin Liu wasn't just a defeat for the president \n     who nominated him.\n       It signifies the dissolution of a truce that had been \n     struck years earlier in which senators had generally agreed \n     not to hold hostage qualified judicial candidates from the \n     opposing political party.\n       It is a shame it has come to this.\n       Republicans may be celebrating the defeat of President \n     Obama's nominee, who on Wednesday officially withdrew his \n     nomination to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals; however, \n     it's an action that surely will come back to bite them.\n       Democrats are unlikely to forget. In fact, Senate Judiciary \n     Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., told reporters before the vote \n     that a Liu filibuster would mean Democrats would do the same \n     to the next Republican president's nominees.\n       It would be regrettable if that were to happen. The so-\n     called Gang of 14 had in 2005 joined forces to avert a \n     showdown on judicial candidates nominated by then-President \n     Bush.\n       Seven Republican and seven Democratic senators, cleaving to \n     the ``advise and consent'' role of senators as enumerated in \n     the U.S. Constitution, agreed not to filibuster or block \n     qualified judicial candidates unless ``extraordinary \n     circumstances'' were in play.\n       There was, at the time, little consensus as to what \n     constituted ``extraordinary circumstances'' and assuredly \n     even less agreement now.\n       At the time of the compromise, which then-Sen. Ken Salazar \n     of Colorado took part in crafting, several senators said they \n     would know extraordinary circumstances when they saw them.\n       The Republican filibuster of Liu, a University of \n     California-Berkeley law professor, will set precedents as to \n     how extraordinary circumstances will be defined. (Colorado's \n     U.S. Sens. Michael Bennet and Mark Udall, both Democrats, \n     voted against a filibuster.)\n       Extraordinary circumstances, it seems, will come to mean a \n     candidate who holds views that are ideologically repugnant. \n     That is a dangerous standard.\n       Liu is a liberal and far more so than other prominent \n     judicial nominees President Obama has sent to the Senate for \n     confirmation.\n       We aren't crazy about some of Liu's positions either, but \n     he is qualified for the job. The American Bar Association, \n     which independently evaluates judicial nominees, gave him \n     their highest ranking: unanimously well-qualified.\n       We have long favored an up-or-down vote on judicial \n     candidates, and this is no exception. Elections have \n     consequences, and those\n\n[[Page S3949]]\n\n     include the president getting to choose judicial candidates, \n     even if they are controversial.\n       A return to the so-called judge wars in an effort to block \n     the president's power to fill vacancies on the federal bench \n     ultimately will serve neither party.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    [From SFGate.com, May 20, 2011]\n\n             Shame on GOP Senators Who Blocked Goodwin Liu\n\n       Senate Republicans, dripping with partisanship and \n     hypocrisy, blocked an up-or-down vote Thursday on the \n     nomination of UC Berkeley law Professor Goodwin Liu to the \n     Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco.\n       Their argument that Liu is a leftist ideologue does not \n     hold up to scrutiny. Instead, the continuing filibuster of \n     Liu's nomination carries the distinct scent of political \n     retribution.\n       Fair-minded people who have looked at Liu's record and \n     determined that he has the intellect and temperament to be a \n     superb appellate judge include prominent conservatives \n     Richard Painter, chief ethics lawyer in the Bush White House, \n     and Whitewater prosecutor Ken Starr.\n       But neither fair play nor intellectual honesty carried the \n     day in the Senate, where Liu's nomination remained bottled up \n     through the efforts of multiple Republicans who had opined \n     (in the Bush years) that it was unconstitutional for senators \n     to deprive a judicial nominee of an up-or-down vote. The \n     obstructionists included Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and \n     Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who were among a group of 14 senators \n     who had pledged that they would filibuster a nominee only in \n     ``extraordinary circumstances.''\n       Both McCain and Graham suggested, unconvincingly, that Liu \n     was sufficiently out of the mainstream to merit such extreme \n     action. Graham specifically mentioned Liu's ``outrageous \n     attack'' on Samuel Alito during his Supreme Court \n     confirmation hearings in 2006. But, again, on closer \n     inspection, Liu's point-by-point dissection of Alito's record \n     was meticulously documented with facts.\n       Another undercurrent at play is a GOP fear that the 40-\n     year-old Liu, with his sharp intellect and appealing manner, \n     might be a candidate to become the first Asian American on \n     the Supreme Court. The gamesmanship against this well-\n     qualified nominee is a disgrace to the Senate and a \n     disservice to the judiciary.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From Press--citizen.com, May 23, 2011]\n\n                  Trashing of Court Nominees Must End\n\n       The judicial confirmation wars just got a fresh supply of \n     ammunition. The U.S. Senate on Thursday failed to muster the \n     votes needed to move forward on the confirmation of a nominee \n     for a federal judgeship.\n       That almost certainly ended the Obama administration's two-\n     year struggle to win confirmation for Goodwin Liu to the 9th \n     Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals.\n       The rejection also shattered any hope that partisan battles \n     over confirmations might finally end. Democrats outraged over \n     this loss will no doubt remember this and look for an \n     opportunity for payback. This has been the story since 1987, \n     when Senate Democrats led the effort to defeat Robert Bork, \n     Ronald Reagan's nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court. Since \n     then, both parties have been guilty of trashing the potential \n     judicial careers of clearly fit nominees: Republicans \n     skewering Democratic presidents' nominees; Democrats \n     returning the favor for Republican presidents.\n       Sadly, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-LA, played a role in \n     defeating the Liu nomination. This is especially \n     disappointing since, as the ranking Republican on the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee--which vets judicial nominees--Grassley \n     could have helped set a new tone on confirmations. He has \n     done just the opposite.\n       Grassley has consistently opposed Liu's confirmation \n     because, he has said, the professor and associate dean at the \n     University of California-Berkley Law School is has made \n     numerous controversial statements in his writings and \n     speeches that express an ``activist judicial philosophy'' and \n     because has no prior judicial experience. In a prepared \n     statement, Grassley said ``Liu holds a view of the \n     Constitution that can only be described as an activist \n     judicial philosophy'' and if appointed to the court, ``he \n     will bring a personal agenda and political ideology into the \n     courtroom.''\n       That is one opinion, and Grassley is certainly entitled to \n     it. Others--including several conservative Republican \n     lawyers, including former Whitewater prosecutor Kenneth Starr \n     and two former lawyers in the Bush administration--disagree. \n     Liu was given a unanimous ``well qualified'' endorsement from \n     the American Bar Association, and his resume bristles with \n     sterling academic and professional credentials. Liu would \n     have been the first Asian-American judge on the 9th Circuit \n     Court.\n       What is most disturbing about Thursday's Senate vote is not \n     the fact that the Senate rejected this nominee, but how it \n     was done: by a filibuster. In other words, the Republicans \n     used the Senate rules to prevent a simple up-or-down vote on \n     the Liu nomination. The effort to end the filibuster fell \n     eight votes short of the 60 needed. But had the 52 senators \n     who voted for cloture voted for confirmation, Liu would be \n     headed for the bench.\n       This is the very same tactic Republicans (including \n     Grassley) rightly condemned when Democrats filibustered to \n     block Republican nominees. They said that all presidential \n     nominees deserve an up-or-down vote, and they were right \n     then.\n       How soon they forget.\n       Alas, Democrats who are outraged by Thursday's move will \n     not forget, and this mindless back-and-forth battle over \n     judges will continue, probably forever. It is a sad day for \n     the courts, for bipartisanship in the Senate and for the \n     nation.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Today, the Senate will consider the nomination of \nMichael Simon, nominated to be a U.S. district judge for the District \nof Oregon. This nominee was reported out of Judiciary Committee with \nfour votes in opposition. I am one of those who opposed the nominee and \nwould like to detail my reasons for doing so.\n  Mr. Simon received his B.A. summa cum laude from the University of \nCalifornia, Los Angeles, in 1978, and J.D. cum laude from Harvard Law \nSchool in 1981. He began his legal career as a trial attorney with the \nAntitrust Division of the Justice Department.\n  In 1985, he spent 6 months as special assistant U.S. attorney for the \nEastern District of Virginia and argued one appeal before the Fourth \nCircuit. Mr. Simon joined a large law firm as an associate in 1986. \nSince 1990, he has been a partner and the head of litigation for the \nfirm's Portland office.\n  Throughout his career, Mr. Simon has advocated on behalf of the \nAmerican Civil Liberties Union of Oregon as a pro bono attorney. But \nhis involvement in the ACLU goes beyond mere representation of a \nclient. Mr. Simon has been a member of the ACLU of Oregon since 1986. \nHe is an active member of their Lawyers' Committee and served as a \nboard member from 1997 to the year 2004, the vice president for \nlegislation 1997 to 1998, and vice president for litigation from 2000 \nto 2004.\n  I recognize that judicial nominees should not be evaluated solely on \nclient lists or memberships, that would be very unfair. However, these \nare relevant bits of information about a nominee.\n  Listen to the words of one of my Democratic colleagues, who inferred \nthat the ACLU is beyond a moderate and mainstream approach. This was \nstated during the debate on judges nominated by President Bush:\n\n       If you look at the records of these judges and you put \n     scales, left to right, 10 being the most liberal and 1 being \n     the most conservative, these judges are ``ones'', to be \n     charitable. When Bill Clinton nominated judges, he nominated \n     mainly sixes and sevens, people who tended to be a little \n     more liberal, but were moderate and mainstream--very few \n     legal aid lawyers or ACLU charter members, much more \n     prosecutors and partners in law firms.\n\n  My colleague recognized that ACLU lawyers were beyond moderate and \nmainstream. I would complete his analysis and rank this organization as \nvery liberal.\n  In Mr. Simon's case, there has been concern about whether or not he \nshares the far out views of the ACUL. On this question, Mr. Simon \nrefuses to provide a clear answer. At his hearing he stated that ``we \ndo not necessarily agree with all of the positions taken by the \nAmerican Civil Liberties Union.'' When asked in follow-up questions to \ndescribe the legal or policy position with which he disagrees, he \nargued that his advice to the ACLU was confidential and subject to the \nattorney-client privilege. In a second round of questions, committee \nmembers clarified they were not asking about advice to a client, but \npolicy positions with which he disagreed. This was met with ``I am not \nat liberty to describe the legal or policy positions advocated by the \nACLU with which I disagree.''\n  The ACLU does hold very liberal views, and Mr. Simon has been the \nvoice for those views. For example, Mr. Simon wrote a letter to the \nTillamook County Courthouse in Oregon expressing the ACLU's concern \nwith religious Christmas signs and decorations. The letter encouraged \nthe county to repeal its resolution that deemed the county a ``Merry \nChristmas County.''\n  On issue after issue, Mr. Simon refused to disassociate himself from \nlegal and policy positions held by the ACLU, that are far outside the \nmainstream. This includes the legalization of drugs, the \nunconstitutionality of the death penalty, the unconstitutionality of \nthe Pledge of Allegiance, the ACLU's opposition to tax exemptions for \nchurches and extreme views regarding separation of church and state.\n\n[[Page S3950]]\n\n  Mr. Simon's views on the war on terrorism and a liberal view on civil \nliberties are troubling to me. In a speech in 2007, Mr. Simon argued \nthat Americans' civil liberties have been threatened because of \nmeasures undertaken following 9/11. In his speech, he said that ``our \nthinking would be clearer and our solutions more effective if we stop \nthinking about--and stop calling--terrorism a `war' or a `crime,' '' \nand argued that calling military action against terrorism a ``war'' \n``implies that a military conquest is the best tool for this fight'' \nand that terminology ``may limit more creative and even more successful \ntechniques to promote and protect our security.''\n  Perhaps Mr. Simon agrees with the Attorney General who, in a recent \nspeech, asserted that ``our most effective terror-fighting weapon'' is \nour article III [civil] court system. I certainly disagree with that \nassertion, and I think most national security experts, our military, \nand most Americans would disagree as well.\n  Mr. Simon appears to approach constitutional theory with an activist \nslant. In remarks before a conference sponsored by the Oregon Lawyers \nChapter of the American Constitution Society on May 23, 2007, Mr. Simon \nstated:\n\n       There is also support for the conclusion that the Founders \n     did not believe that their intentions and understanding \n     should bind future generations. That may be the only real \n     `original intent' of the Founders.\n\n  That quotation makes me wonder, if the Constitution wasn't going to \nhave any hold on future generations, why did the drafters spend so much \ntime during that summer of 1787--and even longer periods of time--\ngetting the Constitution adopted. That seems to be the implication of \nwhat he says there.\n  It is no surprise, then, that Mr. Simon has a hostile view of \nreligion in the public square. He continued in those remarks, ``There \nis also support for the proposition that the concept of `separation of \nchurch and state' was an `unfolding and evolving' idea at the time of \nthe Founders. . . .''\n  Mr. Simon appears to demand an absolute wall of separation between \nchurch and state, as opposed to the U.S. Government promoting a \nspecific religion. He has argued against religious displays on public \nland, against religious visitors to schools, against a coach praying \nwith his football players. I assume that means even if you're praying \nthat they don't get injured. Mr. Simon has argued that it is \nunconstitutional under the establishment clause to teach intelligent \ndesign in public school science classes.\n  Based on his views regarding the war on terror, his activist approach \nto constitutional interpretation, his hostility to religion in the \npublic square, and his remarks and advocacy of ideas which indicate a \nlegal view that is outside the mainstream, I will oppose this \nnomination. I ask my colleagues to do likewise.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I see my two friends--the two outstanding \nand distinguished Senators from the State of Oregon--and I yield the \nfloor to them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee for his comments and perspective on judicial independence. It \nis extremely important in having a court system that can both be \neffective and reflect the faith of the citizens of this Nation that \nthey have a system of true justice.\n  I rise in support of the nomination of Michael Simon to the post of \nU.S. District Judge for the District Court of Oregon. Quite simply, \nMichael Simon is a man of enormous integrity, intellectual breadth and \ndepth, and good old-fashioned common sense and decency. Michael Simon \nhas earned a reputation as a top lawyer in commercial litigation, \nappellate law, and constitutional law. He is respected nationally. He \nis eminently qualified for this seat.\n  After graduating summa cum laude from UCLA, he attended Harvard Law \nSchool, where he graduated cum laude. He began his legal career in the \nDepartment of Justice's antitrust division, where he served as a trial \nattorney for 5 years. During this time, he also volunteered for and \nserved as a special assistant U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of \nVirginia.\n  Mr. Simon is currently a partner at Perkins Coie in Portland, where \nhe has worked since 1986 and earned a reputation as one of the \nNorthwest's real legal stars. He has engaged in extensive pro bono work \nand has volunteered for many nonprofit organizations. He has served as \nan adjunct faculty member at Lewis & Clark Law School, teaching \nantitrust law, drawing on his earlier life experience. He has also \nserved as a pro tem judge on the Multnomah County Circuit Court.\n  In the courts, Michael has made his name as a staunch defender of \nconsumer protection, antitrust laws, and the first amendment. He has \nfound the time to be deeply involved in his community, displaying a \ncommitment to voluntarism, civic participation, and public service.\n  For years, Michael has been a leader of the Classroom Law Project, a \nnonprofit that prepares youths to become active, engaged and informed \nparticipants in our democratic society. Serving as president, and then \nas a board member, he has helped bring a love of civics and democracy \nto thousands of public school students across Oregon.\n  In addition to his service in government and civic organizations, Mr. \nSimon has been an active member of the Jewish community in Portland. He \nis a familiar and beloved face at his temple, Beth Israel, and has \nserved on the boards of the American Jewish Committee and the Jewish \nFederation of Greater Portland.\n  In short, Michael Simon exemplifies the traits that every Federal \ndistrict judge should possess--a brilliant legal mind and a heart \ndedicated to service, fairness, and community.\n  The U.S. District Court of Oregon has historically had a reputation \nas a place of efficient and fair courts led by outstanding professional \njurists. I know Michael Simon will uphold this tradition. He will be an \noutstanding judge who will continue the district's tradition of \nfairness and commitment to public service, and he will fill a critical \nvacancy in this district.\n  Michael Simon is an excellent nominee, and I urge all my colleagues \nto reflect on his record and his capacity in multiple dimensions \nthroughout his life that brings a seasoned judgment and the \nindependence of mind to the judicial system. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport his nomination.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, Senator Merkley has said it very well this \nmorning. I had a chance to speak about Michael Simon yesterday, and I \nwant to make a few additional remarks this morning.\n  After the retirement of Senator Hatfield, whom we all know is still \nbeloved by many here in the Senate, I have had a chance to work with \nour former colleague Senator Gordon Smith and now with Senator Merkley \nto send to both Republican and Democratic Presidents some outstanding \nmen and women for their consideration for the District Court in Oregon. \nToday, Senator Merkley and I send to the Senate for its consideration \nanother outstanding individual--someone who is going to take his place \nwith the other leaders who have been named to the district court of \nOregon.\n  Michael Simon is one of those persons who, when you look at what kind \nof jurist you want to have, meets all the essential tests. He is a \nthoughtful man, he is a fair man, and he is an individual who always \nwants to have all the facts in front of him before he makes a reasoned \njudgment. When I look at his background--and Senator Merkley has laid \nout several of the areas that were special and that we are especially \nproud of, his work in the private sector at Perkins Coie--I come \nparticularly to his work in consumer protection and the antitrust \nfield, because it highlights the kind of person Michael Simon is.\n  He made one of his most notable contributions to strengthening \nconsumer protection law working on behalf of the Department of Justice \non the case of the United States v. American Airlines, and he \nsuccessfully argued then for extending the reach of the Sherman Act to \ninclude monopolization and attempted monopolization.\n  This is not a partisan issue. This is the kind of issue that helps \nall Americans--all Americans, regardless of their political philosophy \nor party they belong--to benefit from the fruits of a more competitive \nAmerican marketplace.\n\n[[Page S3951]]\n\n  Michael Simon's work in that area benefits each and every one of us \nevery single day.\n  Second, as I talked about yesterday, and Senator Merkley has \ndescribed eloquently this morning, we are very proud of Michael Simon's \nchampioning work as a volunteer. I can tell you, that it seems as \nthough virtually every good cause that comes across my desk at home \nseems to have Michael Simon's name on it urging that Oregonians \nparticipate and volunteer their time.\n  We are especially proud of his work on behalf of children. His work \nwith the Classroom Law Project, his work at the Waverly Children's \nHome, where he was past head of the board of directors, these kinds of \npositions are ones where you make a difference. These kinds of \npositions give Mr. Simon a chance to teach not just right and wrong to \nyoung people but a chance to give them the kind of background about the \nrule of law and the rights and responsibilities we want to instill in \nour children. That is why we are very proud to bring to the attention \nof the Senate his work with Oregon's youngsters.\n  Finally, I want to stress the immediacy of the need for the Senate to \nconfirm Michael Simon today. This seat has been vacant for 664 days. It \nis just 1 of 36 judicial emergencies. As it stands, there are nearly 90 \nFederal court vacancies, some of which have been empty for more than 3 \nyears. Judicial emergencies are not just some sort of Washington phrase \nto throw around on the floor of the Senate. They are actually an \nemergency defined by the Chief Justice of the United States, John \nRoberts. And to earn this designation, filings must exceed 600 per \njudge in district courts and 700 per judge in circuit courts.\n  Justice delayed is justice denied. Until the Senate begins to move \nexpeditiously to fill these vacancies, justice will continue to be \ndenied to thousands of Americans who deserve due process.\n  Both Senator Merkley and I are very grateful to Senator Leahy and \nSenator Grassley, the majority leader Senator Reid, and the minority \nleader Mr. McConnell for their work to bring this nomination to the \nfloor.\n  I hope colleagues who have questions about Michael Simon will come to \nSenator Merkley and myself. We will stay on the floor and be available \nto colleagues to answer any questions.\n  But this is a good and decent man who possesses all of the requisite \nqualities we would like in a jurist, whether it is his work in the \nprivate sector, whether it is his pioneering work in the field of \nextending the reach of the Sherman Act to deal with monopolies. This is \na person who will reflect great credit on the District Court of Oregon \nand on the legal system of our country.\n  I hope all our colleagues will support Michael Simon today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n\n\n                           Panetta Nomination\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise to support the nomination of \nLeon Panetta to be the 23rd Secretary of Defense. Director Panetta has \na long history of government and private sector service and experience, \nincluding service in the U.S. Army.\n  Director Panetta served ably for eight terms as a member of the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives, rising to be chairman of the House Budget \nCommittee. He left that position to be President Clinton's Director of \nthe Office of Management and Budget and later served 2\\1/2\\ years as \nPresident Clinton's Chief of Staff, which is where I got to know him \nwell. He then spent 10 years codirecting a foundation with his wife \nthat seeks to instill in young men and women the virtues and values of \npublic service. Knowing Director Panetta, this comes as no surprise. In \nFebruary 2009, he became the 19th Director of the Central Intelligence \nAgency, and it is in this capacity where I have had the opportunity to \nwork very closely with him over the last several years and consider him \na close friend.\n  Director Panetta has been an outstanding leader of the Central \nIntelligence Agency, and it is bittersweet to see him leave. Director \nPanetta is a true leader in every sense of the word. He understands how \nCapitol Hill works since he served in Congress for 16 years. He has \nalways shown the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, which is the \ncommittee that oversees his organization, the right kind of deference \nand responded to our questions and concerns promptly and directly.\n  Although he leaves the CIA, he is not leaving the administration and \nI am quite pleased that I will continue to have the opportunity to work \nwith him as Secretary of Defense. I think he has the right \nqualifications for his new job. He understands budgets, and in this \ntime of economic austerity we need someone with that knowledge and his \nability to understand and manage the resources of a huge organization \nsuch as the Department of Defense.\n  In his current capacity as Director of the CIA, he has also worked \nand built strong partnerships with the Department of Defense, having \nbeen involved in the planning and execution of numerous joint \noperations, including of course the most recent operation against Osama \nbin Laden. He will continue this strong partnership in his new \nposition, and I know he will continue to ensure that these two \norganizations work closely together and cooperate successfully in the \ninterest of our national security and for the safety of our country.\n  Director Panetta has a very challenging job ahead of him. The United \nStates is involved in three major military operations overseas, as well \nas countless smaller ones. Budgets are extremely tight, and they are \nonly going to get tighter. However, no country has the global interests \nand global responsibilities that the United States has, and for that \nreason we need a military that can protect those interests and carry \nout those responsibilities. Director Panetta will need to decide how we \ndo that and will also help decide what, if anything, the United States \ncan and needs to stop doing.\n  He will also need to take responsibility for shaping our military to \nbe prepared for the future. For the last decade, our military has \nnecessarily been focused on fighting and winning the conflicts we are \nin; namely, Iraq and Afghanistan. We continue to meet that challenge, \nand I am very optimistic that we, with the Afghan people, will prevail \nagainst insurgents in Afghanistan, just as we prevailed with the Iraqi \npeople against insurgents in Iraq. However, we can't take our eyes off \nthe future. As a nation, we have a very poor record of predicting where \nour next conflict will come from.\n  I have heard it said that when Secretary McNamara had his \nconfirmation hearing to be Secretary of Defense in 1961, no one asked \nhim a question about a country called Vietnam. And when Secretary \nRumsfeld had his confirmation hearing in 2001, no one asked him about \nAfghanistan. But, in both cases, those were the issues that would \ndominate their tenure as Secretary of Defense.\n  If I might say, Director Panetta, if a new global hot spot dominates \nyour tenure as Secretary of Defense, there is a good chance that it \nwill be one that no one asked you about at your confirmation hearing.\n  For this reason, our Armed Forces need to be prepared to fight \nconflicts that are unlike our current ones. We cannot, and should not, \nassume that the next war will be like the current one. We need to be \nprepared for both high-end and low-end conflict. We need to be prepared \nnot just so that we can fight and win these conflicts but so we can \ndeter potential adversaries and not have to fight in the first place.\n  I know Leon Panetta realizes that, and I know he will continue to be \ncommitted to ensuring our military is as prepared as possible to meet \nwhatever challenges may come our country's way. That will not be easy, \nand it will take a man of his ability to do this successfully and in a \nway that takes into account our current fiscal situation. However, I \nbelieve the President has chosen the right man for the job.\n  I support Leon Panetta's nomination to be the next Secretary of \nDefense, and I encourage my colleagues to support that nomination as \nwell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, let me first say I thought the statement \nfrom the distinguished Senator from Georgia was spot on, and I \nparticularly appreciated his point that when we confirm Leon Panetta to \nhead Defense, no one can possibly predict what kind of challenges he \nwill face there. But this is the kind of person who, because of ability \nand background, is up to any kind\n\n[[Page S3952]]\n\nof challenges that are thrown to him. So I want to associate myself \nwith my colleague from Georgia.\n  Mr. President, I would suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to yield back the \nremainder of the time and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient \nsecond.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Michael H. Simon, of Oregon, to be United States District Judge for \nthe District of Oregon?

PANETTA TO BE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of the following nomination, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Leon E. Panetta, of \nCalifornia, to be Secretary of Defense.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nhours of debate, equally divided, between the two leaders or their \ndesignees.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I understand there is a time agreement on \nthis nomination; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct--2 hours of debate, \nequally divided.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield myself 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. President, the nomination of Leon Panetta to be Secretary of \nDefense is a wise and a solid nomination. Director Panetta has given \ndecades of dedicated public service to this Nation, and we should all \nbe grateful he is once again willing to answer the call and take the \nhelm at the Department of Defense. We are also grateful to his wife \nSylvia for her significant sacrifices over the last 50 years in \nsupporting Leon Panetta's efforts in the public and private sectors.\n  When Mr. Panetta appeared before the Armed Services Committee at his \nnomination hearing, all of our Members commented invariably in the same \nway--reflecting the view that we are grateful Mr. Panetta is willing to \ntake on this position. He is going to bring a reassuring level of \ncontinuity and in-depth experience. He has been a critical member of \nPresident Obama's national security team during his tenure as Director \nof the Central Intelligence Agency. The Department of Defense will need \nDirector Panetta's skill and his wisdom to navigate the extraordinarily \ncomplex set of challenges in the years ahead.\n  Foremost among those demands are the demands on our Armed Forces, and \nthese are exemplified by the ongoing wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. \nBetween those two conflicts, we continue to have approximately 150,000 \ntroops deployed. The U.S. military is also providing support to NATO \noperations to protect the Libyan people. In addition, even after the \nextraordinary raid that killed Osama bin Laden, we face potential \nterrorist threats against us and against our allies which emanate from \nPakistan, Yemen, Somalia, and other places.\n  The risk of a terrorist organization getting their hands on and \ndetonating an improvised nuclear device or other weapon of mass \ndestruction remains one of the gravest possible threats to the United \nStates. To counter that threat, the Defense Department is working with \nthe Departments of State, Energy, Homeland Security, and other U.S. \nGovernment agencies to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons, \nfissile materials, and dangerous technologies. As Secretary of Defense, \nDirector Panetta's leadership in this area will be of vital importance. \nHere again, it is that experience as Director of the CIA which will be \nso invaluable.\n  In the coming weeks, President Obama and his advisers will face a \nnumber of key national security decisions. While the drawdown of U.S. \nforces in Iraq remains on track, there have been recent signs of \ninstability in that country. As a result, it is possible that Iraq's \npolitical leadership may ask for some kind of continuing U.S. military \npresence beyond the December 31 withdrawal deadline which was agreed to \nby President Bush and Prime Minister Maliki in the 2008 Security \nAgreement.\n  Another key decision point is looming in Afghanistan regarding \nreductions in U.S. forces starting next month. President Obama said the \nother day:\n\n       It's now time for us to recognize that we have accomplished \n     a big chunk of our mission and that it's time for Afghans to \n     take more responsibility.\n\n  The President also said a few months ago that the reductions starting \nnext month will be ``significant.'' Hopefully, they will be. Director \nPanetta, while not assigning a specific number, agreed they need to be \nsignificant. A significant reduction in our troop level this year would \nsend a critical signal to Afghan leaders that we mean it when we say \nour commitment is not open-ended and that they need to be urgently \nfocused on preparing Afghanistan's security forces to assume security \nresponsibility for all of Afghanistan. The more that Afghan security \nforces do that, the better the chances of success because the Taliban's \nbiggest nightmare is facing a large, effective Afghan Army--an army \nwhich is already respected by the Afghan people, but now, hopefully--\nand soon--in control of Afghanistan's security.\n  Another major issue facing the Department is the stress that 10 years \nof unbroken war has placed on our Armed Forces. Over the last decade, \nmany of our service men and women have been away from their families \nand homes for multiple tours. Not only is our force stressed, so are \nour military families. We owe them our best efforts to reduce the \nnumber of deployments and increase the time between deployments.\n  The next Secretary of Defense will have to struggle with the \ncompeting demands on our forces while Washington struggles with an \nextremely challenging fiscal environment. The\n\n[[Page S3953]]\n\nDefense budget will not and should not be exempt from cuts. But \nCongress, working with the next Secretary of Defense, will need to \nscrub each Defense program and expenditure and make the tough choices \nand tradeoffs between our war fighters' requirements today and \npreparations for the threats of tomorrow.\n  Last week, the Armed Services Committee marked up the fiscal year \n2012 National Defense Authorization Act. The committee cut about $6 \nbillion from the President's budget request. However, the President has \ndecided to reduce the national security budgets for the next 12 years \nby $400 billion. What we don't know is how much of that $400 billion he \nwill recommend to come from the Defense budget and how much from the \nintelligence and homeland security budgets or how much is recommended \nto be in the first of that 12-year period--fiscal year 2012.\n  The Nation is fortunate that Director Panetta's compelling record of \nachievement and experience is well suited to the demands of the \nposition of the Secretary of Defense. Mr. Panetta is the right person \nto help our military through the fiscal challenges that confront this \nNation. His service as President Clinton's Director of the Office of \nManagement and Budget is invaluable because he understands the budget \nprocess and because he shaped the decisions that helped achieve the \nbudget surpluses of the late 1990s.\n  Leon Panetta has repeatedly demonstrated an ability to reach across \nparty lines and work in a bipartisan spirit since entering public \nservice 45 years ago. He worked on the staff of the Republican whip in \nthe Senate and headed the Office of Civil Rights in the Nixon \nadministration. He later won election to the House of Representatives \nas a Democrat, where he served 16 years, earning the respect of his \npeers and becoming the chairman of the House Budget Committee.\n  Throughout his time in public service, Leon Panetta has been guided \nby a clear moral compass. He has said:\n\n       In politics there has to be a line beyond which you don't \n     go--the line that marks the difference between right and \n     wrong, what your conscience tells you is right. Too often \n     people don't know where the line is. My family, how I was \n     raised, my education, all reinforced my being able to see \n     that line.\n\n  Leon Panetta has been intimately involved in the most pressing \nnational security issues of our time. During his tenure as Director of \nthe Central Intelligence Agency, President Obama turned to Director \nPanetta to personally oversee the manhunt for Osama bin Laden and the \nawe-inspiring operation that brought an end to al-Qaida's murderous \nleader and provided a measure of relief to the families and friends who \nhave suffered since September 11, 2001. The raid on the bin Laden \ncompound epitomizes the way in which the CIA and the Defense Department \nare finally working together to support each other in counterterrorism \noperations, and Director Panetta deserves credit for this close \ncoordination.\n  Before concluding, I wish to pass along my gratitude and deep \nadmiration for the man who is stepping down as head of the Department \nof Defense, Secretary Robert Gates. Secretary Gates has provided \nextraordinary service to this country, spanning the administrations of \neight Presidents. Four and a half years ago, he left the comfort and \nrewards of private life, following a long career in government, to once \nagain serve the critical post of President Bush's Secretary of Defense \nat one of the most difficult times in recent history. Throughout his \ntenure, across the Bush and Obama administrations, Secretary Gates' \nleadership, judgment, and candor have earned him the trust and respect \nof all who have worked with him.\n  Secretary Gates has combined vision and thoughtfulness with \ntoughness, clarity and courageous decisionmaking. Secretary Gates \nestablished a direct and open relationship with Congress and with our \nSenate Armed Services Committee in particular. As chairman of that \ncommittee, I will always be personally grateful for that.\n  Secretary Gates' tenure as Secretary of Defense will be judged by \nhistory to have been truly exceptional. So our next Secretary of \nDefense will have enormous responsibilities but also big shoes to fill. \nI am confident Leon Panetta is the right person to take on that \nchallenge, and I urge our colleagues to support this nomination.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, I suggest the absence of a quorum, \nand I ask unanimous consent that any time consumed during the quorum \ncall be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of President \nObama's nominee to serve as our 23rd Secretary of Defense, Mr. Leon \nPanetta. These are big shoes to fill. Secretary Gates has had a \nremarkable term as Secretary and a remarkable career in public service. \nIn addition, the challenges our military faces in this economic climate \nare significant. We must have a serious discussion about crafting a \nsustainable way forward.\n  I sat down with Director Panetta earlier this month to discuss these \nchallenges. I can say with certainty, Leon Panetta is up to the test. \nHe has the experience and wisdom required, and I look forward to \nworking with him once the Senate gives its advice and consent to his \nnomination.\n  I have known Leon Panetta for a long time. We served together in the \nHouse of Representatives, and we worked together in government for many \nyears. He has an amazing history of public service to America. We \nserved together on the House Budget Committee when we were both \nCongressmen in the early 1990s, and he chaired that committee. He \nunderstands budgets and the challenges they present.\n  As Director of the Office of Management and Budget, he took that \nskill to the executive branch; and as Chief of Staff to President \nWilliam Jefferson Clinton, he crafted the proposal which brought us to \nbalance in our budget as a nation.\n  It is hard to imagine it was only 10 years ago that we had a balanced \nFederal budget. In fact, we were generating a surplus, putting that \nmoney into the Social Security trust fund to make it stronger. Ten \nyears later, mired deep in debt, it is hard to imagine that happened, \nbut it did, and Leon Panetta was a big part of that occurrence.\n  He advised President George W. Bush on how to bring a close to the \nIraq war in a responsible way. For the last 2 years he has had an \nawesome responsibility as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.\n  Thanks to the President's strategic focus and Director Panetta's \nextraordinary leadership, Special Forces and CIA operatives were able \nto locate and capture Osama bin Laden last month in Pakistan. These are \nprecisely the skills and experiences we need at the table at this \nmoment.\n  I know Leon Panetta as more than just a fellow colleague in the House \nand a person who shared some time in public service when I did. I know \nhim as a person. I know his family. I know what he thinks. I know his \nvalues. I have to tell you, President Obama and America are fortunate \nto have a person of this quality who is willing to give even more of \nhis life in public service. He could have stayed out in Monterey, CA, \nhis home area, and no hardship assignment, but he chose not to. He came \nto Washington to head up the Central Intelligence Agency and now has \naccepted this invitation to head up the Department of Defense. There is \nno question in my mind that he will bring to it an extraordinary skill \nlevel and amazing values.\n  Director Panetta and I have talked a little bit about some subjects, \nand one near and dear to my heart, the DREAM Act. The DREAM Act is \nlegislation I introduced almost 10 years ago allowing immigrant \nstudents who have no country an opportunity to contribute to America. \nThese young people came to the United States with their parents when \nthey were just kids and infants. They have lived here all their lives. \nAll they want is a chance to prove how much they love this country. The \nbill I introduced said there are two ways they should be allowed to do \nit: No. 1, to complete at least 2 years of college, to have, obviously, \na high school diploma and good background; but another, to serve in our \nNation's military.\n\n[[Page S3954]]\n\n  I have been proud to have the support of Secretary of Defense Gates \nin this effort, and I look forward to the same support from the next, \nSecretary Panetta. The DREAM Act would strengthen our military and \nstrengthen our Nation, and I am sure, as General Colin Powell has said, \n``Immigration is what's keeping this country's lifeblood moving \nforward.'' These young people can help us move forward as a nation to \nbe safer and create more opportunity.\n  We have a number of challenges ahead. Our men and women are fighting \nwars in Iraq, Afghanistan, and now Libya. Servicemembers and their \nfamilies have borne an incredible burden of sacrifice in these \nconflicts over the last decade. As a nation, we are spending tens of \nbillions of dollars a month to sustain them in their efforts.\n  At the same time, public support for these undertakings will not last \nforever. The current situation needs to change, and the President is \nabout to make an announcement when it comes to our troop levels in \nAfghanistan. We have to craft a way forward and deal honestly and \nresponsibly with what is possibly one of our most challenging \nsituations in Afghanistan. I believe it has to begin with a substantial \nredeployment of U.S. troops back to America from Afghanistan.\n  Last week I joined Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon and 24 of my \ncolleagues in a letter to the President expressing these concerns. I \ntrust the President and incoming Secretary of Defense and Congress can \nfind a responsible path forward. We need to take a hard look at every \naspect of our Federal budget, including our Department of Defense, to \nsustain our men and women in uniform but not to waste money on \nprivatization, on contractors, and on runaway contracts.\n  As Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mullen has \ncommented that our greatest national security threat is our ballooning \ndeficit. Of course, we need to protect our country, but we need to do \nit in a fiscally responsible manner. Even as we address the path \nforward in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya, even as we trim the spending \nin the defense budget, we will not back away from our commitment to the \nmen and women in uniform. I know Leon shares that statement.\n  I support Leon Panetta as our next Secretary of Defense because now \nmore than ever we need his steady hand, his leadership, to tackle these \nchallenges in budgets, in management, and in the critical conflicts we \nare engaged in around the world. I congratulate President Obama for \nselecting Leon Panetta for this awesome responsibility, and I look \nforward to working with him on these issues and others in the years to \ncome.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor the nomination of Leon Panetta as the next Secretary of Defense. \nDirector Panetta comes to this job at an extraordinarily challenging \ntime for the Department of Defense and for our Nation. Among the many \nissues he will confront, Mr. Panetta will oversee the completion of our \ndirect military operations in Iraq, the beginning of the transition of \nour forces out of Afghanistan, the enhancement of our cyber defenses, \nand the reduction of our defense budget.\n  I have known Leon Panetta for many years, and I know he is \nparticularly well suited to address all of these challenges. He is a \nman of great intellect, of great decency, and great determination.\n  At the end of this year, for example, in compliance with the Status \nof Forces Agreement, we will complete the withdrawal of our forces from \nIraq and hand over primary responsibility for our ongoing relationship \nwith Iraq to the Department of State. It remains to be seen whether the \nIraqi Government will ask us to extend our military presence past \nDecember 31. But for now, we are thoroughly and determinately preparing \nour troops to leave. Having served as a member of the Iraq Study Group, \nMr. Panetta certainly understands the importance of this transition and \nwill carry it out.\n  As the next Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta will also continue to \nfocus our efforts on fighting terrorism in Afghanistan and Pakistan. We \nare facing a critical turning point in our operations. This week, we \nexpect President Obama to announce his plan to begin reducing our force \nlevels in Afghanistan this summer, a commitment he made in his speech \nat West Point in 2009.\n  Along with the reduction in forces we must sustain the security gains \nthat we have accomplished during the past year and further build the \ncapacity of the Afghan forces so they are able to take full \nresponsibility for their own security. Mr. Panetta understands how \nimportant it is for all of our agencies to work together in this effort \nand all security missions; that using military force may be our primary \nweapon of securing areas but enduring success comes from coordination \namong the intelligence and law enforcement communities, from effective \ndiplomacy, and from assistance programs administered by the Department \nof State and the USAID.\n  The conditions on the ground in Afghanistan are directly related to \nour ability to successfully attack the terrorist networks that are \noperating along the border in Pakistan. In his current position as \nDirector of the CIA, Mr. Panetta has reinvigorated these efforts, most \nnotably with the successful raid on Osama bin Laden. Indeed, I believe \nwhen history looks back, outside of the critical and ultimate decision \nby the President of the United States, one of the most important roles \nplayed in this effort to prepare the way for those courageous SEALs was \nthe steady leadership of Leon Panetta at the Central Intelligence \nAgency. He understands the complexities of our relationship with \nPakistan and, indeed, throughout the world. This expertise will be \ncritical as we move forward, and critical for our next Secretary of \nDefense.\n  He will also lead the Department of Defense in preparing for the \nemerging threats to our national security, such as attacks to our cyber \ninfrastructure. Indeed, every branch of government is working to define \nthe roles various organizations will play in protecting people, \ninfrastructure, and information within cyberspace.\n  During his confirmation hearings before the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, I discussed with Director Panetta the strategy the \nDepartment of Defense would employ in confronting the potential of a \ncyber attack against the United States. He responded in no uncertain \nterms. His words:\n\n       I have often said that there is a strong likelihood that \n     the next Pearl Harbor that we confront could very well be a \n     cyberattack that cripples our power system, our grid, our \n     security systems, our financial systems, our governmental \n     systems. This is a real possibility in today's world. And as \n     a result, I think we have to aggressively be able to counter \n     that.\n\n  Indeed, Mr. Panetta understands the future as well as the present, \nand he will bring his experience as well as his vision to bear on the \nemerging challenges that face the United States.\n  Perhaps most challenging of all, Leon Panetta will lead the \nDepartment at a time of great fiscal constraints. As our Nation \ncontinues to find a path forward to rebound from the economic \nchallenges of the last few years, there is an ever-growing pressure to \nreduce the size of the defense budget, which has nearly doubled over \nthe past 10 years. But we must be careful to do so in a way that \nremoves unsustainable costs without losing vital capability.\n  As a result of the high operational tempo and the duration of \nmultiple overseas operations, all of our services are facing serious \nreset and recapitalization needs. Serious decisions will have to be \nmade to ensure that we have the right systems in place to meet the \nthreats we face, all at a price level that we can afford.\n  Having served as the House Budget Committee chairman, and as the \nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget, there is no one who \nhas more knowledge, more experience, more sense of the details than \nLeon Panetta, and I believe he is the most well qualified individual to \ntackle the huge budgetary issues that are facing the Department of \nDefense.\n  Leon will have an extraordinary role to play, particularly in the \nwake of the extraordinary service of Secretary of Defense Robert Gates. \nI can't think of anyone I respect or admire more. I can't think of \nanyone who has served this country with more distinction,\n\n[[Page S3955]]\n\nwho has served with more selfless dedication to the Nation, and \nfundamentally who has made his decisions knowing full well that at the \nend of the day young Americans in the uniform of the United States will \ncarry out his orders.\n  Bob Gates has done a superb job. But I have every confidence that \nLeon Panetta will continue to carry on, will continue to meet those \nstandards, will continue to lead the Department of Defense with \ndistinction, with dedication and great loyalty, just as Secretary Gates \nhas done, and ultimately we will know that at the end of all the \ndecisions emanating from the Pentagon there is a young American willing \nand able and ready to serve, to support this Nation and defend it.\n  With that, I rise to express my great support for Secretary-designee \nPanetta and wish him well in all of his endeavors and pledge to work \nwith him closely.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, first of all, I rise in total support of \nMr. Leon Panetta as the new Secretary of Defense. He is an outstanding \npublic servant who has served in many capacities and he has been a \ntremendous leader in every role he has held.\n\n\n                    The Debt Ceiling and Afghanistan\n\n  With that being said, I rise to speak on our war in Afghanistan. Very \nsoon our Nation, this esteemed body, and particularly the President of \nthe United States will address two of the greatest challenges our \nNation currently faces. The first is Afghanistan.\n  The second issue is raising the debt ceiling and confronting our \nNation's unsustainable spending and debt. To the average American, \nAfghanistan and raising our debt ceiling may seem unrelated, but they \nare, in fact, directly related. They are directly related to the hard \nfiscal and strategic choices our Nation must make if we are to remain \nsafe and secure in the coming decades.\n  With respect to raising the debt ceiling, the budget realities we \nface are both striking and frightening. While some may choose to ignore \nthis threat, mere words cannot give weight to the fiscal peril our \nNation now faces. Only numbers can.\n  Since 1992, we have raised the debt ceiling 16 times. In 1992, our \nnational debt stood at $4.1 trillion. Between 2002 and today, our \nnational debt rose from $5.9 trillion to over $14.3 trillion. Now for \nthe first time in our Nation's history, our yearly budget deficits may \nexceed $1 trillion for 4 years in a row. At the current pace of deficit \nspending, CRS projects our national debt will exceed $23.1 trillion by \n2021.\n  In order to pay for the financial hole we have dug, the Congressional \nBudget Office projects that net interest payments will increase \nfourfold over the next 10 years, from $197 billion in fiscal year 2011 \nto $792 billion in fiscal year 2021. To put that number into \nperspective, one decade from today, interest payments on our $23.1 \ntrillion debt will exceed the amount we currently spend on education, \nenergy, and national defense combined. Numbers of this size are not \nonly unimaginable, they will prove catastrophic for our Nation's \nfuture.\n  The fiscal peril we face reminds me of the words a former Senator \nsaid on this floor in declaring why he chose in 2006 to vote against \nraising the debt ceiling when our national debt stood at that time at \n$8.18 trillion. He said:\n\n       The rising debt is a hidden domestic enemy, robbing our \n     cities and States of the critical investments and \n     infrastructure like bridges, ports, and levees; robbing our \n     families and our children of critical investments in \n     education and health care reform; robbing our seniors of the \n     retirement and health security they counted on. Every dollar \n     we pay in interest is a dollar that is not going to \n     investment in America's priorities.\n\n  That former Senator was President Barack Obama.\n  While his perspective on these words may ring differently today, I \nbelieve they accurately capture the difficult choices we face today. \nThe choice is this: Will we rebuild America's future?\n  Today, with our Nation facing a stagnant economy and a death spiral \nof debt, we can no longer have it all--or pretend we can. We must \nchoose what as a nation we can and cannot afford to do. Our risky debt \nwill not only undermine our economic security, it also threatens our \nnational security. As ADM Michael Mullen said:\n\n       I believe that our debt is the greatest threat to our \n     national security. If we as a country do not address our \n     fiscal imbalances in the near-term, our national power will \n     erode, and the costs to our ability to maintain and sustain \n     influences could be great.\n\n  We can no longer in good conscience cut services and programs at \nhome, raise taxes, or--this is very important--lift the debt ceiling in \norder to fund nation building in Afghanistan.\n  Ten years ago, when our mission in Afghanistan began, it was a just \nand rightful mission to seek out and destroy those responsible for the \nterrorist attacks on 9/11 and the deaths of thousands of innocent \nAmericans. We overthrew the Taliban government to provide a safe haven \nto al-Qaida. We have hunted down and killed Osama bin Laden as well as \nmost of the senior members of this terrorist group. Today, in \nAfghanistan, in a nation of 30 million people, intelligence estimates \nsuggest there are only between 50 and 100 al-Qaida terrorists harbored \nthere. Because of the incredible work of our military men and women, \nthe mission of destroying al-Qaida in Afghanistan by all accounts has \nbeen a success. But the real truth is, after 10 years, our current \nmission in Afghanistan has become less about destroying al-Qaida and \nmore about building a country where, frankly, one has never existed.\n  In February, I saw firsthand the significant challenges our brave \ntroops face as they pursue this nation building mission. During the \ntrip I heard from Ambassador Eikenberry and General Petraeus. I visited \nHelmand Province and Kandahar. I met with local tribal leaders and \nPresident Karzai of Afghanistan. What I heard from many officials and \ndiplomats was that progress could be just around the corner but only if \nwe give it more time and more money. I heard we must stay to counter \nthe threat of al-Qaida but then was told that only a handful of al-\nQaida members existed in Afghanistan. I was told that governance was \nimproving, but that corruption was so rampant that billions--yes, \nbillions--of dollars were lost to corrupt officials who seemed more \ninterested in improving their own lives than the lives of their own \npeople. I was told we need a sizable force to diffuse the threat posed \nby the Taliban but that estimating the size of the enemy was difficult. \nStill, everyone acknowledges that their force is a fraction of the \nnumber of troops we have there now. I was told that because of rampant \ncorruption and theft, the very cost of moving our supplies was \nindirectly funding the very enemy we face.\n  I was told that China--yes, China--could reap billions by extracting \nresources from Afghanistan, but guess what. They are not contributing \nanything to the cost of security. I was told that after years of \nspending billions training a new Afghanistan military and police force, \nit could be years longer before they could fully defend their nation \nand their people, and even then it would demand billions more in \nfunding from us. I was also told we were building schools, roads, and \ninfrastructure as well as providing billions in aid for small \nbusinesses and job creation so Afghanistan could become more self-\nsufficient. But today, 97 percent of the Afghan economy is based on \nforeign aid, and that is after 10 long years. I have been told again \nand again that American aid is critical to rebuilding Afghanistan but \nthat local projects built with American tax dollars could not be \nbranded as American-funded projects out of fear of reprisals. I was \ntold the people of Afghanistan truly want us there but was then told in \na meeting with President Karzai that it was time for America to leave.\n  The American people have been hearing all of these arguments and the \nsad facts for nearly a decade. Now, after 10 years, I had truly hoped \nprogress in Afghanistan would be clear and the Afghan people would be \nunited and their government and leaders would be one defined by \nhonesty, integrity, and a shared determination to build a better state. \nBut the real truth is impossible to ignore. After 10 years, we face the \nchoice of whether we will continue to spend tens of billions of tax \ndollars and lose precious American lives not on\n\n[[Page S3956]]\n\nfighting and killing al-Qaida terrorists in Afghanistan but policing \nand building a state where the leaders seem indifferent to the \ndifficulties of their people and their people seem indifferent at best, \nif not hostile, to our presence.\n  Tomorrow, President Obama will present to the American people his \nlatest review on the war in Afghanistan and whether our mission will \nchange. As is already clear, some in this esteemed body will argue for \nthe President to stay the course and others will suggest a very \ndifferent course. The question the President faces--and we all face--\nis quite simple: Will we choose to rebuild America or Afghanistan? In \nlight of our Nation's fiscal perils, we cannot do both.\n\n  I believe if we are being honest with the American people about the \ndepth of fiscal challenges we face at home, it is impossible to defend \nthe mission in Afghanistan in which we are rebuilding schools, training \npolice, teaching people to read--in other words, building a country--\neven at the expense of our own.\n  Neither the President nor any Senator can divorce the difficult \ndecisions we must now make on Afghanistan from the equally difficult \ndecisions we must now make on cutting domestic spending in order to \nraise the debt ceiling.\n  While the truth is the war on terrorism must be fought and it must be \nwon, that war is not in Afghanistan. Yet, with every passing month, we \nare choosing to spend billions we can't afford to fight a war against \nan enemy that is no longer there.\n  Since the day I was sworn in, I have heard from countless of my \nfellow West Virginians who ask, How is it possible we are willing to \nspend hundreds of billions of dollars in Afghanistan while we face \nmountains of debt and spending cuts here at home? How is it possible we \nwill choose to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to build \nAfghanistan when our children, our seniors, our veterans, the poor, and \nthe middle class are being asked to bear the brunt of massive spending \ncuts?\n  I have carefully thought over these questions over these many months, \nand after hearing from my constituents, seeing Afghanistan again with \nmy own eyes, listening to our soldiers on the ground, hearing from \ndozens of diplomats, foreign policy experts, and the military leaders \nover these many months, as well as confronting the truth about the \nfiscal and economic peril our Nation faces in the coming years, I \nbelieve it is time for President Obama to begin a substantial and \nresponsible reduction in our military presence in Afghanistan. I \nbelieve it is time for us to rebuild America, not Afghanistan.\n  That is why I strongly agreed with Senators Merkley and Lee, and the \nwords of 27 of my Republican and Democratic colleagues, who made it \nclear in a letter they sent to the President last Thursday that:\n\n       . . . we must accelerate the transfer responsibility for \n     Afghanistan's development to the Afghan people and their \n     government. We should maintain our capacity to eliminate any \n     new terrorist threats, continue to train the Afghan National \n     Security Forces, and maintain our diplomatic and humanitarian \n     efforts. However, these objectives do not require the \n     presence of over 100,000 American troops engaged in intensive \n     combat operations.\n\n  I believe it is time for us to compel the elected leaders of \nAfghanistan and its people to take responsibility for the destiny of \ntheir nation so we can ensure the destiny of ours. In that spirit, I \nhave sent President Obama a letter calling on him to pursue significant \nreductions and end the scope of our current mission in Afghanistan well \nbefore 2014. I believe any further mission in Afghanistan should, as my \nSenate colleagues suggested in their letter, focus primarily on \nresponding to any resurgent terrorist threat as well as providing \ntargeted training for the Afghan military and police.\n  Throughout this transition period and beyond, I have asked the \nPresident to provide the American taxpayer a monthly accounting, to be \npublished online, of every dollar that will be provided to Afghanistan \ngovernment officials and agencies so as to ensure that no American tax \ndollars are lost to corruption and greed.\n  As for those on the right or the left who believe that leaving \nAfghanistan sooner is irresponsible, I simply ask them: Is 10 years not \nlong enough? I ask them to tell the families of our brave military men \nand women who are on their third and fourth tour of duty, how much \nlonger must they wait to come home. I ask them to look into the eyes of \nany American child and ask them to surrender our Nation's future for \nthe sake of another. I ask all of them to explain to the American \npeople the sanity of spending $485 billion more, on top of the $443 \nbillion we have spent, to build Afghanistan over the next decade at the \nvery same time our Nation drowns in a sea of debt.\n  The time has come to make the difficult decision. Charity begins at \nhome. We can no longer afford to rebuild Afghanistan and America. We \nmust choose, and I choose America.\n\n  As I made clear when I ran for this esteemed office, I would not put \nmy political party before country, but I would do my best to do what is \nright for the people of my beloved State and great Nation. To that end, \nI promised to speak out and take positions, as difficult as they may \nbe, not for the benefit of my next election but that are best for the \nnext generation.\n  It is why I spoke out about the debt, to tell the American people and \nthe people of West Virginia that I would not vote to raise the debt \nceiling without a long-term permanent fix. I did this not because it \nwas popular or easy but because we, as elected leaders of this great \nNation, have a solemn obligation to rebuild our Nation before all \nothers.\n  Our economy, our prosperity, our schools, our children, our veterans, \nour soldiers, our workers, our seniors, our Nation's future must come \nfirst. I, for one, will not look West Virginians in the eye and tell \nthem that in order to raise the debt ceiling, vital programs and \nfunding for Social Security, Medicare, our schools, roads, health care, \nveterans, seniors, and infrastructure will be slashed but we will \ncontinue to spend billions building schools, roads, and infrastructure \nin Afghanistan.\n  The time has come for us to realize the people of Afghanistan have to \nchoose their own destiny. We cannot build it for them. The time has \ncome for us to realize that in this time of fiscal peril, our solemn \nobligation is to build our own Nation, and that by doing so we will \nmake America safer and stronger for generations to come.\n  The words of the great West Virginia statesman Robert C. Byrd ring \neven more true today than in October 2009 when he gave his last floor \nspeech about the war in Afghanistan. Our friend said this:\n\n       During a time of record deficits, some actually continue to \n     suggest that the United States should sink hundreds of \n     billions of borrowed dollars into Afghanistan, effectively \n     turning our backs on our own substantial domestic needs, all \n     the while deferring the costs and deferring the problems for \n     future generations to address. Our national security \n     interests lie in defeating--no, I go further, in destroying \n     al-Qaida. Until we take that and only that mission seriously, \n     we risk adding the United States to the long, long list of \n     nations whose best laid plans have died on the cold, barren, \n     rocky slopes of that far off country, Afghanistan.\n\n  May God bless the brave men and women who serve this Nation and the \nUnited States of America.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of \nLeon Panetta to succeed Robert Gates. But first I feel compelled to \nrespond to the statements by the Senator from West Virginia which \ncharacterize the isolationist, withdrawal, lack of knowledge, of \nhistory attitude that seems to be on the rise in America.\n  In case the Senator from West Virginia forgot it or never knew it, we \nwithdrew from Afghanistan one time. We withdrew from Afghanistan, and \nthe Taliban came, eventually followed by al-Qaida, followed by attacks \non the United States of America.\n  The Senator from West Virginia has expressed his admiration for the \nmen and women who are serving. I hope he would pay attention to the \nfinest military leader who will now be the head of the CIA, General \nPetraeus, whose knowledge and background may exceed that of the Senator \nfrom West Virginia.\n  If we leave Afghanistan in defeat, we will repeat the lessons of \nhistory. It is not our expenditures on Afghanistan that are the reasons \nwe are now experiencing budget difficulties.\n\n[[Page S3957]]\n\n  I am pleased the Senator from West Virginia went to Afghanistan once. \nI would suggest he consult with the people who know best that since \n2009, when the surge began, we have had success on the ground in \nAfghanistan, and we are succeeding.\n  There are enormous challenges ahead of us. But as Secretary Gates has \nsaid: Withdrawal to ``Fortress America''--which is basically the \nmessage of the Senator from West Virginia--will inevitably lead to \nattacks from them on the United States of America. I view the remarks \nof the Senator from West Virginia as at least uninformed about history \nand strategy and the challenges we face from radical Islamic extremism, \nincluding al-Qaida.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to vote in favor of this \nnomination today.\n  Director Panetta has had an extraordinary career of public service. \nHe served in the House of Representatives, representing his California \ndistrict for eight terms. He served in the White House as President \nClinton's Chief of Staff and Director of the Office of Management and \nBudget.\n  Since February 2009 he has been the Director of the Central \nIntelligence Agency, strengthening that agency and forging positive \nrelationships in the interagency process and with the congressional \nintelligence oversight committees. It is my expectation that Director \nPanetta will work closely with GEN David Petraeus, the nominee to \nsucceed him at the CIA, and continue the cooperation and commitment \nthat enabled the finding and elimination of Osama bin Laden.\n  I am certainly hopeful that as Secretary of Defense Director Panetta \nwill successfully lead the effort to find and eliminate Ayman al-\nZawahiri, who we are told has assumed leadership of al-Qaida, and other \nal-Qaida leaders. Zawahiri is a sworn enemy of the United States and \nour way of life and, like bin Laden, must be dealt with in similar \nterms.\n  Before discussing the challenges Mr. Panetta will encounter, I want \nto express my thanks and admiration for the service of Secretary Gates \nas he nears the end of his 4\\1/2\\-year tenure as Secretary of Defense. \nI recall that through much of 2007 and 2008 we heard about Secretary \nGates' countdown wristwatch that displayed the number of days until a \nnew administration would take over in January 2009, and he and his wife \nBecky could finally return to their peaceful lakeside home and \nretirement in Washington State. It is fortunate for the country that \nPresident Obama asked, and Secretary Gates agreed to postpone \nretirement, and that he continued to serve and, presumably, discarded \nthat wristwatch.\n  Secretary Gates testified at his nomination hearing on December 5, \n2006, that he agreed to leave Texas A University and return to \ngovernment out of love for his country, and he and his family have \nprovided one of the greatest examples I have seen of that kind of \npatriotism, answering the call to duty when his talents were most \nneeded. For this, and for innumerable other contributions he has made \nto the men and women of the Armed Forces, he has truly earned a place \nin history as one of America's greatest Secretaries of Defense.\n  In December 2006, at a time when so many Senators were clamoring for \na cut-and-run strategy in Iraq--just as they are calling for a cut-and-\nrun strategy in Afghanistan--Secretary Gates made the following \nstatement at his nomination hearing:\n\n       While I am open to alternative ideas about our future \n     strategy and tactics in Iraq, I feel quite strongly about one \n     point. Developments in Iraq over the next year or two will, I \n     believe, shape the entire Middle East and greatly influence \n     global geopolitics for many years to come. Our course over \n     the next year or two will determine whether the American and \n     Iraqi people, and the next President of the United States, \n     will face a slowly, but steadily improving situation in Iraq \n     and in the region or will face the very real risk, and \n     possible reality, of a regional conflagration. We need to \n     work together to develop a strategy that does not leave Iraq \n     in chaos and that protects our long-term interests in, and \n     hopes for the region.\n\n  Mr. President, you could substitute the word ``Afghanistan'' for \nexactly what Secretary Gates then said in December 2006. Then we had \nthe surge. There were 59 votes against the surge that would have called \nfor withdrawal in the summer of 2007. Some of us knew what was right \nand fought for it, and we have succeeded in Iraq, just as we will fight \nto continue the surge in Afghanistan. We will succeed in Afghanistan, \nand we will come home with honor, and Afghanistan will not deteriorate \nto a cockpit of conflict between regional countries that will then \ncause again the threat of radical Islamic extremism to threaten our \nvery existence--certainly pose threats of attacks on the United States.\n  Secretary Gates was, of course, correct then about Iraq. Today we \nmust add Afghanistan and Libya to his warning about the future \nconsequences of the decisions we make today. In the next few months, \nour country faces decisions related to our national security and \ndefense that will echo for decades to come--decisions that will \ndetermine whether we remain the world's leading global military power, \nable to meet our many commitments worldwide, or whether we will begin \nabandoning that role.\n  One of these decisions that will have perhaps the most impact on this \noutcome is our response to the President's stated goal of cutting $400 \nbillion in national security spending by 2023--on top of the $178 \nbillion in efficiencies and top line reductions that Secretary Gates \nalready has imposed.\n  Secretary Gates and Admiral Mullen have sounded the alarm against \nmisguided and excessive reductions in defense spending that cut into \nthe muscle of our military capabilities. If we get this wrong, it will \nresult in a dramatic drop in U.S. influence and, as Secretary Gates has \nsaid, ``a smaller military able to go fewer places and do fewer \nthings.''\n  Defense spending is not what is sinking this country into fiscal \ncrisis, and if the President and Congress act on that flawed assumption \nthey will create a situation that is truly unaffordable: the decline of \nU.S. military power and influence.\n  It is inevitable there will be cuts to defense spending, and some \nreductions are no doubt necessary to improve the efficiency of the \nDepartment of Defense. But I also remember GEN Edward Meyer, then-Chief \nof Staff of the Army, who warned in 1980 that excessive defense cuts \nover many years had produced a ``hollow army.'' That is not an \nexperience we can or should repeat in the years to come. We must learn \nthe lessons of history.\n  I sincerely hope Director Panetta, upon assuming office, will not \nfocus exclusively on how but on whether the President's proposal should \nbe implemented and will apply his independent judgment in providing \nadvice to the President on the cuts that can be made without damage to \nour national security.\n  Last week, the Committee on Armed Services completed its markup for \nthe Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2012. In a very tough \nfiscal environment, this markup represents an effort to support our \nwarfighters and bolster the readiness of the U.S. military. \nUnfortunately, the committee chose to authorize hundreds of millions of \ndollars in unnecessary and unrequested porkbarrel projects and rejected \nmy efforts to stop the out-of-control cost overruns of the F-35 \nprogram.\n  The Defense authorization bill is an important piece of legislation \nwhile our country continues to be engaged in two wars; therefore, I \nvoted to move the bill out of committee. Nevertheless, I will continue \nmy efforts to fight the egregious and wasteful spending during debate \non the floor of the Senate, and I will urge Director Panetta, once he \nis confirmed, to favorably endorse the proposals I will make to \nproperly use precious national defense dollars.\n  In addition, especially in this budget environment, it will be \nimportant to continue to eliminate weapons programs that are over cost, \nbehind schedule, and not providing improvements in combat power and \ncapabilities. After 10 years of war, we must continue to eliminate \nevery dollar of wasteful spending that siphons resources away from our \nmost vital need: enabling our troops to succeed in combat.\n  One of the key criteria I am looking for in the next Secretary of \nDefense is continuity--the continuation of the wise judgment, policies, \nand decisionmaking that have characterized Secretary Gates' leadership \nof the Department of Defense. As Director of the CIA, Mr. Panetta has \ndemonstrated that he possesses the experience and\n\n[[Page S3958]]\n\nability to ensure that we achieve our objectives in the three conflicts \nin which U.S. forces are now engaged: Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya.\n  In Iraq, the key question now is whether some presence of U.S. forces \nwill remain beyond the end of this year, pending an Iraqi request and \napproval, to support Iraq's continuing needs and our enduring national \ninterests. I believe such a presence is necessary, and I encourage the \nadministration to work closely with the Maliki government to bring \nabout this outcome.\n  In Afghanistan, the main question is the size and scope of the \ndrawdown of forces beginning this July. Here, too, I agree with \nSecretary Gates that any drawdown should be modest so as to maximize \nour ability to lock in the hard-won gains of our troops through the \nnext fighting season. I hope Director Panetta, as the Secretary of \nDefense, will support ``modest'' reductions and take no action that \nwould undermine the hard-won gains in Afghanistan.\n  Finally, we know that there is growing opposition to continuing the \nU.S. involvement in Libya. There has already been one legislative \nattempt to bind the President's authority as Commander-in-Chief, and \nthere will likely be others. In short, the accumulated consequences of \nthe administration's delay, confusion, and lack of meaningful \nconsultation have been a wholesale revolt in Congress against the \nadministration's policy.\n  Although I have disagreed, and disagreed strongly at times, with \naspects of the administration's policy in Libya, I believe the \nPresident did the right thing by intervening to stop a humanitarian \ndisaster in Libya. Amid all of our present arguments about legal and \nconstitutional interpretations, we cannot forget the main point: In the \nmidst of the most groundbreaking geopolitical event in two decades, as \npeaceful protests for democracy were sweeping the Middle East, with \nQadhafi's forces ready to strike Benghazi, and with Arabs and Muslims \nin Libya and across the region pleading for the U.S. military to stop \nthe bloodshed, the United States and our allies took action and \nprevented the massacre that Qadhafi had promised to commit in a city of \n700,000 people. By doing so, we began creating conditions that are \nincreasing the pressure on Qadhafi to give up power.\n  Director Panetta has been nominated to lead our Armed Forces amid \ntheir tenth year of sustained overseas combat. Not surprisingly, this \nhas placed a major strain on our forces and their families. And yet, \nour military is performing better today than at any time in our \nhistory. That is thanks to the thousands of brave young Americans in \nuniform who are writing a new chapter in the history of our great \ncountry. They have shown themselves to be the equals of the greatest \ngenerations before them. And the calling that all of us must answer, in \nour service, is to be equal and forever faithful to the sacrifice of \nthese amazing Americans.\n  I have outlined some of the challenges that lay before Mr. Panetta. I \nhave the highest confidence, however, that he is their equal.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nnomination of Leon Panetta to be the 23rd Secretary of Defense.\n  Mr. Panetta, who currently serves as the Director of the Central \nIntelligence Agency, was nominated by President Obama on April 28. The \nSenate Armed Services Committee held a hearing on his nomination on \nJune 9, and I was honored to introduce him at that hearing. His \nnomination was approved unanimously by the committee on June 14.\n  I would like to speak briefly about Director Panetta's career, and in \nparticular his time at the Central Intelligence Agency.\n  In his 47 years of public service, Director Panetta has held the \npositions of Congressman, chairman of the House Budget Committee, \nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget, chief of staff to the \nWhite House, codirector, with his wife, of the Leon & Sylvia Panetta \nInstitute for Public Policy, which I have had the pleasure of speaking \nbefore, member of the Iraq Study Group, and Director of the CIA.\n  His career and service started in 1964 as a second lieutenant in the \nU.S. Army, and now 47 years later he has come full circle to be \nnominated to lead the Department of Defense and U.S. Armed Forces.\n  In the course of 2 years as Director of the CIA, Mr. Panetta has \nmastered the intelligence field, led the CIA through a very tumultuous \ntime, restored badly damaged relationships with Congress and with the \nDirector of National Intelligence, and carried out President Obama's \npersonal instruction to him to find Osama bin Laden.\n  It has been my pleasure to serve as the chairman of the Senate Select \nCommittee on Intelligence during this time and to be able to work \nclosely with Mr. Panetta.\n  I have no doubt that his past experience and his capabilities prepare \nLeon Panetta to meet the major challenges before the Department of \nDefense.\n  With knowledge of CIA operations and analysis, he will come to the \nPentagon with a thorough understanding of the situation in Afghanistan \nas well as the aggravating factors of our relationship with Pakistan. \nThrough CIA analysis and operations, he is also well aware of the other \ncontingencies around the globe where the U.S. military may be called to \ndeploy.\n  Director Panetta is also well positioned to guide the Department \nthrough the constrained budget environment. The budget cuts to the \nPentagon have already begun, for the first time in 10 years, with the \nappropriations bills now moving through the Congress.\n  The Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, on which I serve, held a \nhearing last week with Secretary Robert Gates and the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, ADM Mike Mullen. Both of them expressed concerns \nthat budget cuts not lead to a ``hollow force'' or deprive the \nDepartment and the Nation of needed capabilities.\n  I am confident that Leon Panetta possesses the credentials and \nexperience to make cuts where needed and where prudent, but that he \nwill do so in a way that keeps the military strong and capable, and in \na way that maintains the cohesion of the Department and its services.\n  Beyond Director Panetta's experience is his leadership style, his \ncharacter, and a deft personal touch. As we all know, personal \nrelationships and the way one approaches things matter a great deal, \nwhether within Cabinet meetings or negotiating with foreign \ncounterparts. Mr. Panetta's approach is effective, and it provides for \na very good working relationship with the Congress.\n  Positions like the Director of the CIA or the Secretary of Defense \nrequire a strong character and a strong moral compass, qualities that \nthis nominee possesses.\n  Let me give you an example. Early in his tenure at the CIA in 2009, \nDirector Panetta was briefed on a number of active and recent \nintelligence programs. One of them, which I can't describe here, was \nparticularly sensitive and provoked questions and concern. Director \nPanetta asked the CIA staff if the congressional intelligence \ncommittees had been briefed on this program. He was told they had not.\n  Mr. Panetta immediately requested an urgent meeting with the \nIntelligence Committee to brief us. He said he found it unacceptable \nthat this program had been withheld from Congress, and terminated it in \nlarge part on that basis.\n  In the 2 years since, he has never declined to answer a question or \nprovide us with his candid views. He has been completely forthright, \nand motivated only by what is best for the CIA, and more importantly, \nthis nation.\n  The Department of Defense is the largest Department in the Federal \nGovernment. As Secretary Gates recently noted, the health care budget \nof the Department of Defense is bigger than the entire budget of the \nCIA. The Secretary of Defense is responsible for thousands of young men \nand women serving in Afghanistan, Iraq, and deployed around the world, \nand bears the burden of every death and casualty we suffer.\n  I agree with Secretary Gates that no other position can fully prepare \nsomeone to be Secretary of Defense. But I believe that Leon Panetta, \nwho has served honorably and successfully in Congress, at the Office of \nManagement and Budget, at the White House, and now the CIA, is uniquely \nqualified to be\n\n[[Page S3959]]\n\nanother outstanding Secretary of Defense in this very challenging time.\n  I urge his confirmation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to enthusiastically support \nthe nomination of Leon Panetta, the current Director of the Central \nIntelligence Agency, to be the 23rd Secretary of Defense.\n  Director Panetta has contributed nearly five decades of public \nservice to our Nation, including as an officer in the U.S. Army, a \ndistinguished Congressman, and most recently as Director of the Central \nIntelligence Agency, a position for which he was confirmed by the \nSenate on February 12, 2009. He and I served together in the House of \nRepresentatives from my first term in 1979 until he departed in 1993 to \nbecome Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Over the past \n2\\1/2\\ years, I have had the opportunity to frequently work with \nDirector Panetta, in my role as a senior member of the Senate Select \nCommittee on Intelligence.\n  Like his predecessor, Dr. Robert Gates--who also served as CIA \nDirector before becoming Secretary of Defense--Director Panetta brings \nto the Pentagon a wealth of experience built over a lifetime of service \nto his Nation and his fellow Americans. Over the past 2\\1/2\\ years, \nDirector Panetta has repaired a damaged relationship between the CIA \nand Congress, an impressive accomplishment, to say the least, and led \nthe agency and the Nation's human intelligence activities at a time \nwhen the Nation waged two wars and contended with such threats as \nIslamic extremism, terrorism, and cyber intrusion and attack.\n  And of course, Director Panetta will forever be remembered as the CIA \nDirector during the May 1, 2011, mission in which U.S. forces once and \nfor all rid the world of public enemy No. 1 and brought justice to the \nevil incarnate that was Osama bin Laden. On that night, the combined \nmight of our Nations military, intelligence, and counterterrorism \nprofessionals sent the unmistakable message to the terrorists of the \nworld that America will prevail in this fight.\n  I deeply appreciate Director Panetta's efforts at the CIA, and \nbelieve he leaves the entire Agency, from the halls of Langley to its \nagents in the farthest reaches of the world, a better and more capable \norganization than it was when he arrived. I am confident that Director \nPanetta's unique experiences within the military, the Congress, and the \nintelligence communities will serve him, the Department of Defense, and \nthe Nation well when he assumes the role of Secretary of Defense.\n  More than 4\\1/2\\ years ago, in December 2006, I rose in support of \nthe nomination of Dr. Gates for the position for which we consider \nDirector Panetta today. At the time, I said that Dr. Gates and the \nNation were facing the imperative of charting a new course and strategy \nin Iraq, rising violence in Afghanistan, global terrorism, the threats \nposed by nuclear states such as North Korea and possibly Iran, and the \nincreasing strains on our military.\n  Director Panetta faces similar challenges today. He must continue to \nhelp shape our role in Iraq, define our strategy for the Nation's \nfuture involvement in Afghanistan, and recapitalize and reconstitute \nthe elements of our military that have been at war for nearly a decade, \nwhile ensuring that the U.S. military is prepared to meet and overcome \nany hurdle on the horizon, whether in North Korea, China, Africa, the \nMiddle East, Eastern Europe, or other, as yet unknowable, places around \nthis globe.\n  At his confirmation hearing before the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee on June 9, Director Panetta said, ``We are no longer in the \nCold War. This is more like the blizzard war--a blizzard of challenges \nthat draws speed and intensity from terrorism, from rapidly developing \ntechnologies, and the rising number of powers on the world stage.''\n  Director Panetta must confront the unpredictable vagaries of this \n``blizzard war'' within perhaps the most arduous budgetary environment \nour Nation has faced since the Great Depression--an environment in \nwhich President Obama has already called for $400 billion in reductions \nto national security spending over the next decade, much of which will \ncome out of Department of Defense budgets.\n  It is hard to imagine how exactly cuts of hundreds of billions of \ndollars to national security budgets can be possible without both \nsignificant tradeoffs and a fundamental retooling of our national \nsecurity strategy. Perhaps more imperative than any other task \nconfronting him, Director Panetta will likely be the individual most \nresponsible for ensuring that our national security strategy is \nappropriate for meeting our global and national security interests, and \nthat our defense budgets are sufficient to meet those challenges.\n  In this era in which distance alone is insufficient to insulate the \nUnited States and our global interests from terrorists and nations that \nwish to do us harm, Director Panetta faces the extraordinary task of \nensuring that our Armed Forces remain able to defeat today's \nconventional and irregular threats, project power and U.S. presence \naround the world, and develop the war fighting capabilities necessary \nfor our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines to prevail in the \nconflicts of the future.\n  If any nominee possesses the defense and budget bona fides required \nfor such times, it is Director Panetta, who has demonstrated his \ncapabilities as Director of the CIA, as former OMB Director, and as the \nformer chair of the House Budget Committee. I believe that he is well \nprepared for the challenges of leading the Department of Defense, and I \nwill vote to confirm Director Panetta as our 23rd Secretary of Defense.\n  On a final note, Secretary Gates will soon take leave from his post \nat the Pentagon, and I believe that he will be remembered for his \nconsummate role in transforming our Nation's military from a force that \nfocused on Cold War operations to one that was capable of defeating \nthreats in Iraq and Afghanistan, while possessing the flexibility \nnecessary to successfully carry out a mission like the one that killed \nbin Laden.\n  As Secretary Gates prepares to depart public life, I would like to \nthank him for the countless sacrifices he has made over a lifetime of \ncontributions to the nation, which includes serving eight Presidents, \nas well as the distinctions of being the only Secretary of Defense in \nU.S. history asked to remain in that office by a newly elected \nPresident, and the only career officer in the CIA's history to rise \nfrom entry-level employee to Director. These two stand-out achievements \nspeak volumes about Secretary Gates' work ethic and love of country. \nOur country and our security have been forever enhanced by his \ndedication to public service, and I wish him well in his future \nendeavors.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I have the utmost respect for the Senator \nfrom Arizona and his commitment to this country and his service to this \ncountry.\n  I can only report what I have seen. I was in Afghanistan twice--as a \nGovernor in 2006, representing the National Guard of West Virginia, and \nI went back in 2010. While there, I saw deterioration. I did not see a \ncountry that had an infrastructure and an economy. I saw corrupt \nleadership and nothing good coming of it.\n  With that, I know that the Senator has had much more experience. I \ncan only speak from common sense and for the people of West Virginia \nabout what they feel. We are a very hawkish State and a patriotic \nState. If 10 years is not enough, how long is enough--I think that is \nthe question being asked--for the sacrifices being asked of them? When \nwe cannot buy water lines and sewer lines or fix roads and repair \nbridges in West Virginia, yet they hear about the billions we are \nspending in a country that doesn't want us there, I think it is time to \nleave.\n  Respectfully, that might be the disagreement we have.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S3960]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of \nLeon Panetta for Secretary of Defense. The President has chosen wisely. \nHe has a terrific national security team in place. General Petraeus has \nbecome the CIA Director. Mr. Donilon has done a great job as National \nSecurity Adviser. In Leon Panetta, the President could not have chosen \nbetter. I am pleased with Ambassador Crocker, Ambassador Eikenberry, \nand General Petraeus did a heck of a job in Afghanistan. Ambassador \nCrocker will be the best we have to offer on that side for the \nmilitary-civilian partnership in Afghanistan.\n  Leon Panetta heading up the Department of Defense is a home-run \nchoice. I have known Leon for quite a while. I want to let the country \nknow I think the President made a very wise decision. Tomorrow night, \nhe is supposed to tell us about Afghanistan.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I wish to add my accolades about Leon \nPanetta. I know him well. We roomed together for 11 years here in \nWashington. He is a strong, smart, honorable, and devout man. He will \nbe a great Secretary of Defense. I thank my colleague for praising him \nand add my accolades.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, that shows you how bipartisan it is going \nto be--Graham and Schumer. That shows you the depth and breadth of Leon \nPanetta--the way people view him here.\n  One of the first decisions he will have to make is what to tell the \nPresident about Afghanistan. I know we are war weary and have been \nthere for 10 years. We didn't just throw a dart at the map when we \ndecided to go there. That is the place the Taliban was controlling, \nthey invited al-Qaida to be their honored guests, and bin Laden had a \nwelcome home in Afghanistan. The rest is history.\n  President Bush understood that the Taliban was a force for evil. They \nallowed bin Laden to come to Afghanistan and plan the 9/11 attacks. \nThey had a choice to make, and they chose poorly. We went in there to \ntake the Taliban down.\n  We have a war in Iraq--and we can debate whether we should have done \nthat. One of the reasons we are still not where we would like to be 10 \nyears later is because a lot of the resources we had in Afghanistan \nwent to Iraq. Now we finally got it right.\n  For the last 17 months, we have had enough troops in Afghanistan to \nmake a difference. To President Obama, that was a hard decision for you \nto make--to add 30,000 additional troops at a time when most people \nsaid: Why are we still there? Can't we come home? But the President \nchose wisely, and 2014 is the transition goal--to transition to Afghan \ncontrol. I think we are well on track.\n  Tomorrow night, the President will tell us about withdrawing troops. \nI believe we can, not because we are tired but because of the success \non the ground. Let me point out some successes that would allow the \nPresident to make a reasoned judgment to withdraw troops. The one thing \nI urge the President to do is never lose sight of why we went there and \nour national security goals in Afghanistan. We will all be judged by \nwhat we leave behind. We want to leave behind the ability of the Afghan \npeople to say no to the Taliban and reject extremism. They have the \nwill, but they don't have the capacity yet. But they are getting there. \nAnytime you have the desire of the people who are oppressed by the \nTaliban and al-Qaida and you can help them help themselves, that makes \nit all safer.\n  Here is what happened since the President sent surge forces in. In \nNovember of 2009, there were two nations and 30 NATO trainers--two \nnations helping train the Afghan security forces from NATO. They had a \ncombined 30 people. You could put them all in a bus. One thing the \nPresident did when he surged American forces in was that he insisted \nNATO step up their game. Here we are today, and we have 1,300 NATO \ntrainers in Afghanistan with 32 countries providing assistance. We have \n49 different countries helping in some form of training.\n  In the last 17 months, we have added 90,000 Afghan Army and police \nforces. So there has been a surge, far beyond the American coalition \nsurge, in Afghan forces. How did that happen? We have better training. \nIn September of 2009, 800 people were joining the Afghan Army per \nmonth. They were losing 2,000 a month. That was a terrible trend. In \nDecember of 2009, because of this new construct we came up with, we \nhave been averaging 6,000 army recruits a month and 3,000 for the \npolice. Today, we have 160,000 in the Afghan National Army and 126,000 \nin the Afghan National Police. By the end of the year, we will have \n305,000 army and police under arms in Afghanistan. And the reason that \nhas happened is because we have changed the way we train the Afghan \nsecurity forces.\n\n  So I hope the President, listening to Leon Panetta, Secretary Gates, \nand Secretary Petraeus, will tell the American people we can start \nbringing forces home beginning this summer because we have been \nsuccessful, and we are not going to do anything to undermine that \nsuccess because it has come at such a heavy price.\n  In reality, ladies and gentlemen, we have been in Afghanistan with \nthe right configuration for about 18 months. The army retention rates \ntoday in the Afghan Army are 69 percent--almost doubled. The literacy \nrate among the Afghan Army and police force is twice that of the \nnational population because we have focused on literacy. It is hard to \nbe a policeman or army officer if you can't read or write. We are \nhelping a people who have been dirt poor, who have been at war for 30 \nyears, and who have been treated very poorly by everybody in the world. \nAt the end of the day, it is in our national security interest to make \nsure the country where the Taliban took over and allowed bin Laden to \ncome in as an honored guest never goes back into the hands of an \nextremist.\n  I am confident Leon Panetta has the wisdom and background, as the CIA \nDirector, as a former Member of Congress, and as a successful \nbusinessperson, to lead the Pentagon at the most challenging time since \nWorld War II.\n  He is taking over from Bob Gates. There is not enough we can say or \ndo for Secretary Gates to thank him. He has had the job for 5 years. \nWhen he came on board, Iraq was a hopeless, lost cause in the minds of \nmany, and he and General Petraeus, Ambassador Crocker, and many \nothers--mainly our troops and coalition forces--took an Iraq that was \non the verge of an abyss and we are now on the verge of a \nrepresentative government that can defend itself and be an ally of the \nUnited States. Having Saddam Hussein replaced by a representative \ngovernment in Iraq aligned with us is priceless. If we could as a \nnation take the place from which we were once attacked and turn it over \nto people who want to go a different way than the Taliban, and they \nhave the ability to fight back and say no, all of us will be safer.\n  I congratulate the President on picking Leon Panetta to be Secretary \nof Defense. I know he has had a lot of hard decisions in the war on \nterror, and one of the biggest decisions he will make is coming up \nmaybe tomorrow night. I want to work with him, Republicans and \nDemocrats together, in making sure our Nation is never attacked again \nfrom Afghanistan. That is possible. We are on the verge of getting that \nright.\n  As we draw down troops, I ask the President to please tell those who \nare left behind still fighting in Afghanistan that he hasn't lost sight \nof the prize. The prize is not just bringing our troops home, the prize \nis to make sure their children never have to go back and fight in the \nfuture. That is the goal--to withdraw from Afghanistan in a way that we \nare safer and that our national security is enhanced. We are on the \nverge of achieving that goal.\n  What Secretary Panetta and others are going to be challenged with as \nwe go forward in the 21st century is going to be substantial. The enemy \nis still alive, even though not well. We have punished the enemy--al-\nQaida and other extremist groups--but they will not give up easily. At \nthe end of the day, the goal is for our country to be safe, and it will \ntake more than killing bin Laden to do that. Killing bin Laden was a \nform of justice long overdue, and it did make us safer, but the \nultimate security in this world lies not with our ability to kill \nindividuals but with our ability to help those who need to fight in \ntheir own backyard and protect\n\n[[Page S3961]]\n\nthemselves from terrorism. That really is security that is sustainable.\n  If we can leave Afghanistan in 2014 in a fashion that they have the \ncapacity to marry up with their will to say no to the Taliban and turn \ntheir country around toward the light and not the darkness, then I say \nwithout any doubt that our country did them right. If we cut this \noperation short because we are tired and weary, we will pay a price. \nOur values are so much better than the enemy's. They have patience and \nbad ideas. We have a lot of good ideas for the future of mankind. The \nquestion is, Do we have the patience to make sure those ideas can \nflourish?\n  This is a long, hard war, fought by a few. We are on the verge of \nsuccess. I could not think of a better person to lead us to a complete \nsuccess, an enduring success, than Leon Panetta. So I look forward, in \na bipartisan fashion, to voting for I think one of the best choices the \nPresident could have made as Secretary of Defense.\n  To Bob Gates, I would say: Whatever you do in retirement, wherever \nyou go, you have my respect, my admiration, and on behalf of the \nAmerican people you will go down in history as one of the steadiest \nhands America could have ever had during challenging times.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, first, let me thank the Senator from \nSouth Carolina for his analysis on Afghanistan as well as his great \nsupport for Leon Panetta and his comments about Bob Gates, which I very \nmuch share and commented about this afternoon in a very similar way.\n  I particularly wish to commend Senator Graham for his analysis of \nwhat has changed in Afghanistan in the last 17 or 18 months, so that \nthe reductions which will be announced tomorrow are not based on \ngetting tired but are being based, I am sure, on the conditions on the \nground or in Afghanistan and on the critical changes which have taken \nplace in Afghanistan.\n  I very much agree with his assessment about the surge in the Afghan \nforces. I was listening to his comments from a monitor, and when I \nheard his analysis about 90,000 additional Afghan forces, he is exactly \nright. The surge has not just been 30,000 of our troops but three times \nas many in terms of Afghan troops. And the importance of that is not \njust the numbers, not just the training, and not just the literacy, \nwhich the Senator pointed out, but also the mentoring and the \npartnering in the field with coalition forces.\n  We have tracked this very carefully, and there has been a significant \nincrease in the number of Afghan units that consistently are in the \nfield partnering with our troops and with other coalition members' \ntroops, and that makes a huge difference too because when the Afghan \npeople see Afghan troops in the lead instead of foreign nations' troops \nin the lead, they understand that, in fact, the Taliban's argument that \nthey are being occupied is a false propaganda argument, and that \nweakens the Taliban tremendously as well.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Yes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. This is the time to have some good bipartisanship.\n  Senator Levin, is it not true--I have to ask you a question--that you \nhave been saying as long as I can remember that the surge that really \nneeds to occur is on the Afghan side?\n  You have focused like a laser in the last couple of years on training \ncapacity. Not only are we producing 90,000 additional Afghan Army and \npolice forces, 97 percent of them now can pass Western shooting \nstandards. Two years ago, that number was less than a third. Of the \nNCOs--noncommissioned officers--graduating from the schools in \nAfghanistan, there is about an 80-percent literacy rate. Two years ago, \nit was less than 50 percent.\n  So what I wish to acknowledge is that Senator Levin has been focusing \non what I think is the ticket home with honor and security: building up \nan Afghan army and police force that can fight the fight without \n100,000 Americans. We are well on the way. If we had not changed our \ntraining program--which the Senator has been focused on for a very long \ntime--we would not have had this success. And General Caldwell is one \nof the unsung heroes of this war.\n  But I couldn't agree more with my colleague from Michigan. The reason \nwe can bring American troops home is because there are more Afghans to \ndo the fighting. And the Senator mentioned that during the surge in \nHelmand, it was a 10-to-1 ratio. For every Afghan, there were 10 \nAmerican forces. It is almost 50-50 today, with a climb to where it \nwill be Afghans in the lead.\n  The final thought is that among the trainers themselves, the goal by \n2013 is to replace NATO trainers with Afghan trainers, and we are well \non our way to having a majority of the training done by Afghans \nthemselves. So if we can get the fighting ratios to 1-to-1 this year \nand improve on that by 2014, we will be able to turn the country over \nto the Afghan security forces. And I think we have a good plan. Let's \njust stick with it.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I want to first of all thank my good friend from South \nCarolina for those comments. He has been very perceptive of the \nimportance of turning this responsibility over to the Afghans as soon \nas possible, and we are clearly on track to do exactly that. It is that \nimprovement in the situation on the ground that will allow, hopefully, \nfor a significant reduction that will be announced tomorrow. That is \nour hope--my hope.\n  But I think the Senator from South Carolina has seen this right from \nthe beginning, that we wanted success and we could have success in \nAfghanistan. Indeed, we see some real evidence of that success in the \nmilitary situation on the ground. If only that could be equivalent to \nthe governance situation, we all would be a lot more comfortable.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. If the Senator will yield for one final thought, the two \nbig impediments to our success in Afghanistan are Pakistan and poor \ngovernance. The reason the Taliban came back is because the governance \nin Afghanistan was poor, not well-accepted by the people, and lack of \nsecurity. We now have better security, and I do see signs of better \ngovernance. And we have to fix the Pakistan side of the equation. On \nthe Afghan side of the border, we are doing about everything we can do \nto build up the Afghan people. We will deal with Pakistan and we will \ndeal with better governance, but none of that is possible without \nbetter security. Now we have a security environment that I think will \nlead to better governance. But don't lose sight of the prize, and that \nis to leave the country in a sustainable manner.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Levin to push the Afghan \nGovernment to do their part and also to engage Pakistan and say: What \nyou are doing in Pakistan is unacceptable. Stop the double-dealing. Get \ninvolved.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I think we know our Presiding Officer, Senator Shaheen, is \nvery much into the issue of putting some real pressure on Pakistan to \nend the Haqqani network's intrusions and excursions into Afghanistan. \nAnd I think we are all together on that essential goal of changing \nPakistani behavior in terms of what they are allowing to occur on their \nsoil, which is that safe haven, particularly for the Haqqanis.\n  I again thank my friend from South Carolina, and I am reminded by \nsomething he said of an earlier visit I made to Afghanistan, by the \nway, with a number of colleagues--I think Senator Reed and one other \nSenator were with me. We were with a bunch of Afghan leaders in a small \ntown. This is what they call their Shura. It just happened that they \nwere having this the day we were visiting. There were maybe 50 or 60, \n70 guys--old guys, all guys--sitting on the ground on a dirt floor. We \nintruded, barged in, and I asked one question.\n  I said: Do you want us here?\n  The answer: We want you to train our army and leave, and then we will \ninvite you back as guests.\n  You can't say it much more succinctly.\n  I thank my colleague.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nproceedings under the quorum call be dispensed with.\n\n[[Page S3962]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We are prepared to yield back the remainder of our time \nand do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Leon E. Panetta, of California, to be Secretary of Defense?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 100, nays 0, as follows:\n\n                       [Rollcall Vote No. 93 Ex.]\n\n                               YEAS--100\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Ayotte\n     Barrasso\n     Baucus\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Bingaman\n     Blumenthal\n     Blunt\n     Boozman\n     Boxer\n     Brown (MA)\n     Brown (OH)\n     Burr\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Chambliss\n     Coats\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Coons\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Durbin\n     Enzi\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Heller\n     Hoeven\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Johnson (SD)\n     Johnson (WI)\n     Kerry\n     Kirk\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Lee\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lugar\n     Manchin\n     McCain\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Moran\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Paul\n     Portman\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Rubio\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shaheen\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Thune\n     Toomey\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Vitter\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wicker\n     Wyden\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will be 10 \nminutes of debate only equally divided between the two leaders or their \ndesignees.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I yield back Republican time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, the one thing that all Members of \nCongress agree we need more of is jobs.\n  Illinois recently published its most recent statewide unemployment \nnumbers and there is no question that the numbers are disappointing. \nFollowing 15 straight months of declining unemployment, unemployment \nrates rose for the first time to 8.9 percent. The only way to decrease \nthe unemployment rate is to ensure robust job growth in all parts of \nthe country. And while Members from different parties often disagree on \nhow to help create jobs, the Economic Development Administration, EDA, \nreauthorization before us today is a great example of bipartisan \nlegislation that can help.\n  On May 1, 1961, President Kennedy signed into law a bill creating the \nprecursor of the Economic Development Agency, the Area Redevelopment \nAdministration, ARA. The ARA was championed by another Illinois Senator \nand the man who gave me my start as an intern in this building, Senator \nPaul Douglas.\n  ARA provided assistance to distressed areas through loans and grants \nfor public facilities; technology and market information; and research \ngrants in order to spur economic growth. Sound familiar? Paul Douglas \nbelieved then, as I believe now, there is a proper role for government \nto play in assisting distressed communities and regions.\n  Now for 50 years, the ARA and then the EDA have helped communities \nidentify the best strategies for creating economic growth and \nleveraging private investment to help create jobs. EDA remains focused \non assisting distressed communities and communities recovering from \ndisasters.\n  And it has been very effective. Every Federal dollar invested in EDA \nprojects attracts $7 additional dollars in private investments in these \ndistressed communities. And even in the midst of this last recession \nand sparse private investments, EDA-funded public/private projects \ncreated an estimated 161,500 jobs in the last 2\\1/2\\ years.\n  In Illinois in 2009 and 2010 alone, EDA funded 52 projects that \nresulted in nearly $70 million in new investments in the State. But \nbeyond just the numbers, I want to give you some real life examples of \nEDA's impact in Illinois communities\n  Under the 2010 EDA Community Trade Adjustment Assistance Program, the \ncity of Galesburg and Knox County identified themselves as \nsignificantly impacted by trade. EDA funded a project that allowed for \nthe creation of the Entrepreneurs Innovate & Go Global Initiative to \nhelp develop entrepreneurs at every level. The grantees are putting \ntogether workshops and training that focuses on entrepreneurship, \ninnovation and globalization. EDA assistance also includes technical\n\n[[Page S3963]]\n\nassistance in commercialization that will ultimately help small \nbusinesses and new entrepreneurs streamline business plans and create \nnew jobs.\n  Under the Recovery Act, EDA helped fund the creation of a micro \nrevolving loan fund for Accion Chicago, a spinoff of an international \nnonprofit organization dedicated to microfinance. ACCION is using the \nproject funds to expand its existing microlending activities in Cook \nCounty and to promote entrepreneurship by providing loan capital and \nfinancial literacy counseling to clients who don't have access to \ntraditional bank credit. The $1,200,000 revolving loan fund is \nprojected to make 120 loans in the initial round of lending--creating \nor saving about 400 jobs.\n  After terrible flooding in 2008 and the subsequent disaster \ndeclaration, EDA was able to award $677,000 in disaster supplemental \nfunding to the city of Princeton. The city of Princeton used these \nfunds to build infrastructure for a 137-acre industrial site, including \nrehabilitation of existing roadway, construction of new roadway, water-\nmain, sewer lines, and city-owned electric and fiber optic cable. This \nproject not only will improve the long-term economic options for the \ncommunity, but is expected to create 500 jobs and induce $50,000,000 in \nprivate investment in the region.\n  The bill on the floor right now would reauthorize EDA to continue \nmaking these necessary investments for an additional 5 years. And it \nwould also improve flexibility and efficiency at the agency. For \nexample, the bill would allow EDA to do more in the most distressed \ncommunities by increasing the cap on the Federal share of projects in \nareas that have very high unemployment rates and very low per capita \nincome. And it would allow communities using EDA's revolving loan fund \nto more easily shift those dollars to the economic development project \nwith the greatest potential to help the region.\n  When Senator Douglas led the effort to create ADA he faced opposition \nfrom none other than Senator Goldwater. Senator Goldwater argued that \ndistressed regions are, and I quote, ``perfectly normal to the economic \ncycle of American enterprise, and not in need of government \nintervention.''\n  While history has proven he is wrong, at least this is a debatable \nargument. At least he was grappling with policy issues actually being \nconsidered. The reality is, if Congress wants to help create jobs and \nbring down the unemployment rate, we need to be able to pass simple \npieces of legislation that will help create jobs with little to no \ncosts. Instead for the second time in 2 months, we find a jobs bills \nfillibustered by amendment.\n  If we can't find a way to work together on bills like EDA \nreauthorization or SBIR/STTR reauthorization, the American public is \njustified in believing that we will do nothing to help create jobs. And \nto borrow a quote from Paul Douglas during his work on ADA, ``The lives \nof too many human beings are at stake to sit by and do nothing . . .''\n  I urge my colleagues to support the legislation and move quickly to \nfinal passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, we have spent many days talking about \nthe importance of the bill before us which would reauthorize the \nEconomic Development Administration. The EDA is a proven success. I \nthink it is instructive that no one on the other side is speaking out \nagainst it. It is amazing to me they do not speak out against it, but I \nhave a feeling we may not get this cloture vote. I hope I am wrong.\n  As I look at ways for us to be bipartisan, there are a couple of \nareas where I think we can come together. One would certainly be \ndeficit reduction. We Democrats know how to do it. We did it under Bill \nClinton, and we are the only party in 50 years to pass a budget that \nactually brought us to a surplus. We can do that with our friends on \nthe other side, and I am glad there are talks going on.\n  The other area is job creation and job preservation. The other side \nsays they want to do it with us. This is a golden opportunity for them \nto join with us. We have seen--and Leader Reid knows this because he \nhas selected various jobs bills to bring to the Senate floor. It was \nnot by chance this bill came. He wanted committee chairmen to say which \nbills had bipartisan support in their committees. We voted this bill \nout nearly unanimously. We had one objection in a time when things are \npretty contentious. Why is it? I will tell you why it is.\n  One of the best ways to tell you is to quote Senator John Cornyn, who \nsaid a $2 million EDA grant for a water tower in Texas will ``pave the \nway for creation of new jobs and business opportunities.'' That says it \nall.\n  We have 27 Republicans who went on the record saying the EDA was a \ngood job creation bill. We know that historically $1 of EDA investment \nattracts $7 in private sector investment. So while this is a $500 \nbillion bill, if you see that it is $7 for each $1, it is into the \nmillions in terms of the job creation that will follow. As a matter of \nfact, we know the jobs created will be between about 250,000 and 1 \nmillion over the life of the bill. One million jobs. All we need is a \ncloture vote.\n  This EDA started in 1965, and it has been supported by Democrats and \nRepublicans. I gave you an example of Senator Cornyn and what he said. \nThese are just some of the people who are supporting us: the Conference \nof Mayors, the Public Works Association--it goes on into all of our \nStates--the University Economic Development Association--why do they \nsupport it? They know this particular program is a spark plug. Put in \n$1 and attract $7 of private sector investment. People get to work \nagain.\n  I am just hopeful that we do not see this bill die today. This is a \nmoment in time we can show that we mean what we say. Senator Crapo said \nthe EDA business grant will help ``keep Idaho firms on the cutting \nedge.''\n  Senator Lugar said EDA funding is ``essential in our efforts to \nimprove the quality of life and the standard of living for Hoosier \nfamilies.''\n  It goes on. Senator Collins has some beautiful statements. Twenty-\nseven of our colleagues, Republicans and Democrats, have always \nsupported this legislation. The last time it was signed into law was by \nGeorge W. Bush, yes, and it passed this Senate unanimously. If this \nbill goes down because our friends on the other side keep wanting to \noffer--they have offered tens of amendments. It is up to about 100 \namendments: one about the prairie chicken, another one about a lizard--\nall fine but do not belong on this bill. This bill is about jobs.\n  I hope our friends will vote with their hearts and will look back on \ntheir press releases. I certainly think if they did that, they would \ncast an ``aye'' vote, and we would pass this bill and do something for \njobs in this Nation.\n  Thank you very much.\n  I yield back my time, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to say a word about a critical \nissue for the State of Vermont and for my State's energy future, and \nthat deals with the Vermont Yankee nuclear powerplant. The Vermont \nYankee nuclear powerplant is one of 23 plants in our country with the \nsame design--General Electric Mark One--as the Fukushima plants that \nhave experienced partial or perhaps full meltdowns in Japan.\n  All of us feel terribly about what has happened in Japan, and our \nhearts go out to that struggling country. But at the same time, in our \nNation, we also have some very disturbing developments regarding \nnuclear power, and I wish to touch this afternoon on two of them.\n  The first is, we have a situation in the State of Vermont in which a \npowerful $14 billion energy company called Entergy is trying to force \nthe people of my State to keep an aging and troubled nuclear reactor \nopen for another 20 years. This is a plant that is 40 years old. They \nwant to keep it open for another 20 years. The Vermont Yankee plant's \noriginal 40-year license expires in March of 2012, and I firmly believe \n40 years is enough. But that is not just my opinion.\n  Vermont, uniquely, thanks in part to an agreement between the State \nand Entergy when it purchased Vermont Yankee in 2002, has asserted its \nauthority through our State legislature to decide whether Vermont \nYankee should operate beyond March of 2012. The Vermont State Senate, \nrepresenting the wishes of the people of our State, voted on a \nbipartisan basis, 26 to 4--26 to 4--not to grant an extension of the \nlicense of that plant. The law is clear that States have the right to \nreject nuclear power for economic reasons, and that is exactly what the \nVermont State Senate did in an overwhelming bipartisan vote.\n  We know Vermont Yankee has had serious problems in the last several \nyears, including a collapse of its cooling towers in 2007 and \nradioactive tritium leaks in 2005 and 2010. The tritium leaks came from \npipes plant officials claimed under oath did not exist.\n  In support of the Vermont legislature's decision, the Vermont \ncongressional delegation has been clear that Entergy should respect \nVermont's laws. In other words, what we are saying--the delegation \nhere--is that Entergy should respect the laws of the State of Vermont \nand what our State senate has done. However, just last week, we learned \nthat Entergy's well-paid corporate lobbyists and lawyers have been \nmeeting in secret with Federal agencies, including the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission staff, pushing the Federal Government to \nintervene in the lawsuit Entergy filed against Vermont. Entergy wants \nthe Federal Government to take up its extreme argument that Vermont's \nright to decide its own energy future is preempted by Federal nuclear \nsafety laws.\n  It so happens that NRC Chairman Greg Jazcko, who is, in my view, a \nfairminded public servant, does not agree with Entergy. He told me last \nweek at a Senate hearing that ``I see nothing that would tell me that \nthere's a preemption issue here.'' He said in a conversation with \nreporters that Vermont had a ``role to play in determining Vermont \nYankee's future'' and that he ``doubted the NRC would do anything to \ninterfere with the state's process.'' I believe the Chairman's position \nis correct. The NRC regulates safety--safety--although some Vermonters \nbelieve they do not do that very well. Nevertheless, it is not the \narbiter of political or legal disputes between a powerful energy \ncompany and the State of Vermont. That is not the business of the NRC.\n  So I was very surprised to learn last week that against the \nChairman's public recommendation, the NRC voted in secret, by a 3-to-2 \nmargin, to tell the Department of Justice to intervene on Entergy's \nbehalf. When I questioned the NRC's Commissioners at a hearing last \nweek, they refused to tell us how they voted. Several of them admitted \nthey had not even read the major 1983 Supreme Court opinion on this \nissue--a case between PG v. California, where the Supreme Court \nsaid--and I quote an important point regarding States rights and \nnuclear energy. This is the quote from the Supreme Court:\n\n       The promotion of nuclear power is not to be accomplished \n     ``at all costs.'' The elaborate licensing and safety \n     provisions and the continued preservation of state regulation \n     in traditional areas belie that. Moreover, Congress has \n     allowed the states to determine--as a matter of economics--\n     whether a nuclear plant vis-a-vis a fossil fuel plant should \n     be built. The decision of California to exercise that \n     authority does not, in itself, constitute a basis for \n     preemption. . . . the legal reality remains that Congress has \n     left sufficient authority in the states to allow the \n     development of nuclear power to be slowed or even stopped for \n     economic reasons.\n\n  That is the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, 1983.\n  I reminded the NRC at that hearing, and do so again today, that this \nlawsuit is none of their business, and their getting involved damages \nthe credibility of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The NRC opted to \nrelicense Vermont Yankee based on safety, and that is where their \nconcern and authority begins and ends. The main point is this: The NRC \ndoes not represent the people of Vermont and has no right to tell us \nwhat kind of energy future we will have. The people of Vermont \nbelieve--and I agree--that our future lies significantly with energy \nefficiency and sustainable energy. Today, I renew my call on the floor \nof the Senate for the Federal Government to stay out of this case. \nEntergy is a $14 billion corporation. They have all kinds of lobbyists \nand they make all kinds of campaign contributions. They don't need the \nhelp of the Federal Government.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANDERS. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am very pleased the Senator took to the floor to speak \nto the American people about what they are going through in his State. \nI am\n\n[[Page S3965]]\n\nnot as familiar with the condition of the nuclear powerplant, so I will \nnot go there. I trust my friend's judgment. There are some serious \nissues raised--a different design of the plant--and the fact that it is \nclose or identical to the design of the plant in Japan that had all the \nissues. Here is the point. I support the Senator. I was proud of the \nway he questioned the issues.\n  I will pose a question to the Senator. Isn't it true that there is a \nlot of talk around Washington about how States rights should be \nprotected?\n  Mr. SANDERS. I tell my good friend from California, day after day, we \nhear from some of our colleagues how they don't trust the Federal \nGovernment and they don't want the Federal Government getting involved \nin the issues impacting their constituents. So the answer to the \nSenator's question is yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Building on that, isn't it true that the NRC--as we have \nlearned by reading their founding documents--is an independent \ncommission; isn't that a fact?\n  Mr. SANDERS. Yes, that is true.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend, given those two points, plus the ones \nmy friend made, it seems untenable that the NRC, which is supposed to \nbe an independent agency, would assert itself into a matter between the \nState of Vermont and a private company. I just say, as chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, how strongly I support what the \nSenator is trying to do, which is to allow his State to, frankly, have \na say over something as important as the economics surrounding energy. \nMy friend knows we work hard in this day and age to make sure America \ncan leap forward and save energy and lead the world and invent \nalternatives.\n  In light of what happened in Japan, this becomes more and more \nimportant. I hope my friend will take heart and know that this chairman \nof the committee stands with him on this battle.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I thank Senator Boxer for her thoughts and the \nextraordinary leadership she is providing on the Environment Committee.\n  I think everyone understands that the function of the NRC is very \nsimple. It is to make sure the 104 nuclear powerplants in this country \nrun as safely as possible. That is their job. Their job is not to tell \nthe State of Vermont or the State of California or the State of \nPennsylvania what future they might want to pursue in terms of energy. \nThey are not supposed to be a proponent of the nuclear industry. That \nis not their job. Their job is to make sure our nuclear plants are \nbeing run safely. So in terms of economics, the people of Vermont or \nany other State in this country have the right to determine what the \nfuture of nuclear powerplants is in their State. What our State is \nsaying is, after 40 years, we want to shut down Vermont Yankee. We want \nto move in a new direction that we think benefits our State. We do not \nwant the Department of Justice to intervene in this case, where Entergy \nis suing Vermont.\n  Let me conclude, while we are on the issue of nuclear power, and \npoint out that the Associated Press recently revealed that 48 out of 65 \nnuclear power sites in this country have leaked radioactive tritium, \nand Vermont Yankee is one of those sites. Thirty-seven facilities had \nleaks at levels that violated Federal drinking water standards, and \nsome leaks have migrated off the sites, contaminating private wells, \nalthough none is yet known to have contaminated public drinking water \nsupplies.\n  These allegations by the Associated Press are extremely disturbing. \nSafety at our nuclear plants should be the most important priority at \nthe NRC, particularly after what we saw happen in Japan. The function \nof the NRC is not to represent the nuclear power industry; it is to \nrepresent the needs of the people of the United States.\n  That is why I will be working as a member of the Environment \nCommittee, which has oversight over the NRC, with our chairperson, \nSenator Barbara Boxer, and others on the committee who are interested \nin this issue, to call for a GAO investigation of the allegations made \nby the Associated Press. We need to determine whether it is true that \nthe NRC is systematically working with the industry to undermine safety \nstandards for aging plants in order to keep them operating.\n  Let me conclude by mentioning that around the world there is growing \nconcern about the dangers of nuclear power, and I think that concern \nhas been heightened by the terrible tragedy in Japan. It is important \nto note that Germany has decided to close all 17 nuclear plants in the \nnext decade and not to build any new ones. They are getting out of the \nnuclear business. Switzerland is also phasing out nuclear power. In \nItaly, just a few weeks ago, 94 percent of the people voted in an \nelection against restarting the nuclear power industry.\n  Here in the United States, some States are moving in the same \ndirection. In addition to Vermont, New York, led by Governor Cuomo, \nwants the Indian Point plant shut down. Massachusetts is supporting \nVermont in its lawsuit to preserve States rights to decide their own \nenergy future, and I believe other States will support us as well.\n  The bottom line--and the law supports this--is that if States such as \nVermont want to move away from aging and troubled nuclear reactors and \nto a sustainable energy future, we have the right to do that. I will \nfight tooth and nail to protect that right.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Senate Republicans, in their \ntypically unanimous way, just blocked this Chamber from even voting on \nthe Economic Development Revitalization Act of 2011.\n  We heard Senator Boxer point out how many Republicans have supported \nthe Economic Development Administration many times in what they did for \neconomic development in their States. We know in Vermont, Pennsylvania, \nand Ohio, how EDA works with small Federal investments, leveraging that \nmoney in the private sector through incubators, in many cases, or \naccelerators or whatever the communities call them, and they do, in \nfact, create jobs. Unfortunately, every Republican in this Chamber \ndecided that wasn't such a good thing--perhaps to deny a political \nvictory to President Obama. What it did was take away another tool to \nget this economy back on course.\n  So many people in this body seem to think it is all about reducing \nthe debt. It is about reducing the debt, but it needs to be largely \nabout creating jobs. There doesn't seem to be that much interest in \nthat on the other side of the aisle.\n  Just last week, I spoke with economic development directors and \ncounty commissioners from the city of Moraine, a suburb of Dayton where \na GM plant closed, and Ashtabula County, my wife's home county in the \nnortheast corner of the State. They explained the importance of EDA \nfunding and how it supports economic growth in their communities.\n  EDA has traditionally been a noncontroversial and bipartisan job-\ncreation bill. It helps broker deals between the public and private \nsectors, which is critical to economic growth and recovery. It is \nparticularly important to economically distressed communities and in \nthese types of economic times.\n  Every $1 of EDA grant funding leverages $7 worth of private \ninvestment. For every $10,000--and this is one study, proven by \nevidence and fact--of EDA investment in business incubators, which \nhelps entrepreneurs start companies, between 50 and 70 jobs are \ncreated. When we put money into the Youngstown incubator or a bit of \nFederal money into LaunchHouse in Shaker Heights--an incubator just \nlaunched, if you will--it creates jobs. It helps entrepreneurs and \nstartup companies create jobs in our communities. Some of these \nbusinesses will fail. A few of them will wildly succeed. Many will hang \non for several years, hiring 5, 10, 20 or maybe hundreds of people.\n  In Ohio, since 2006, more than 40 EDA grants worth $36 million have \nleveraged a total of more than $87 million once private resources were \nmatched.\n  Colleges and universities from Bowling Green in the northwest to Ohio \nUniversity in the southeast, to Miami\n\n[[Page S3966]]\n\nin the southwest, have received EDA funds. So too have port authorities \nin Toledo and Ashtabula--the Presiding Officer's border with Erie--in \nthat part of Ohio and entrepreneurs in Cleveland and Appalachia.\n  If we are going to strengthen our competitiveness, communities will \nneed to equip businesses with the tools they need to survive, and \ncommunities will need to create higher skill, living wage jobs and \nattract private investment.\n  That is what EDA is designed to do; it is the ``front door'' for \ncommunities facing sudden and severe economic distress.\n  When economic disaster hits, communities turn to the government, and \nin so many cases it is EDA that does the job.\n  EDA has helped redevelop the former GM plant in Moraine--several \nthousand GM jobs, Frigidaire jobs. Because of EDA, local partnerships, \nand outside private investments, we expect to see hundreds and \nhundreds, maybe a few thousand jobs in manufacturing in that Moraine \nplant. We have seen EDA help redevelop the DHL plant in Wilmington. \nAshtabula's Plant C received EDA investments to make vital repairs. The \nbill Republicans just blocked us from even voting on would have \nstrengthened a proven job-creating program.\n  How many times do we hear about businesses worried about uncertainty \ncreated in a still recovering economy? This bill would have provided \ncertainty in funding for an established job-creating problem. It would \nhave reduced regulatory burdens to increase flexibility for grantees. \nIt would have encouraged public-private partnerships that we have \nalready seen make a difference across Ohio.\n  I offered two amendments that would have further strengthened EDA. \nOne would have assisted former auto communities when a plant closure or \ndownsizing causes economic distress, such as Wilmington or Moraine.\n  The other would have made more Ohio communities eligible to receive \nfunds for business incubators. Ohio is the home of the National \nBusiness Incubator Association--the trade association for all \nincubators in southeast Ohio and Athens. We have a model for business \nincubators in Toledo, Youngstown, and now Shaker Heights.\n  This amendment would have allowed more Ohio communities to support \nhomegrown entrepreneurship.\n  Republican Senators chose to bog down the EDA bill with other \nunrelated amendments. All of them were unrelated to the task at hand; \nthat is, how do we create jobs? Just yesterday, I was at Cleveland \nState University, where its Veteran Student Success Program goes above \nand beyond in serving our Nation's veterans.\n  Unemployment among young Americans is especially acute and \ndisproportionately affects young veterans, and that is an outrage. \nToday, the unemployment rate for returning servicemembers between 20 \nand 24 is 27 percent--almost 3 times the national unemployment average. \nThat means more than one in four veterans can't find a job to support \nhis or her family, easing the transition to civilian life. When our \neconomy needs their skills, when veterans can get the job done, too \noften veterans are turned away. Cleveland State University has a \nProject SERV Program to ensure servicemembers who return home and into \nthe classroom receive the educational benefits they earned and deserve. \nImagine the difficulty for someone 25 years old, who has done two \ncombat tours in Iraq, who comes back to Cleveland or to Philadelphia or \nanywhere else in this country and tries to integrate into a classroom \nof 18- and 19-year-olds who have seen nothing like the 25-year-old who \nhas been in combat in Iraq or Afghanistan.\n  This Project SERV at Cleveland State has been groundbreaking and is \none of the few in the country--and now at Youngstown State University. \nWhat they are doing is establishing veteran support programs at \ncolleges and universities. It started as an idea at a community \nroundtable I convened at Cleveland State a few years ago. It became law \nin the last Congress, and we have ensured its funding.\n  Yesterday, I met with Clarence Rowe, a staff sergeant in the Marine \nCorps, who is using the veterans resources at CSU to translate his \nmilitary skills to the needs of the civilian job market. But as much as \nCSU and other universities do to assist our veterans, high unemployment \ncontinues to hurt all Americans. Too often, people such as Staff \nSergeant Rowe, who has put years into serving his country, come back \nand, even with developing their job skills in school, they simply can't \nfind jobs.\n  Education, workforce investment, and EDA have long been sound Federal \ninvestments that have helped to create jobs and strengthen our economy. \nIt is a shame Republicans have yet again placed a roadblock on the \npathway toward a strong and more prosperous middle class. We can do \nbetter than that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/21/senate-section/article/S3966-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3966-S3967]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              AFGHANISTAN\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise tonight to speak about our policy in \nAfghanistan. We know the President is about to announce a major \ndecision on the policy. As the President determines the degree and \nscope of the drawdown in Afghanistan, there will be a lot of debate, \nabout troop levels, principally. But while this is an important \ndiscussion, we need to step back and comprehensively focus on overall \nU.S. strategic interests in the region.\n  Over the course of my time in the Senate, some 4\\1/2\\ years now, I \nhave participated in more than 20 Foreign Relations Committee hearings \non Afghanistan and Pakistan. This week we will hear from Secretary \nClinton on the U.S. policy on both Afghanistan and Pakistan. I \npersonally chaired four hearings on U.S. policy in the region, I have \ntraveled to Afghanistan and Pakistan on two occasions, and met with our \nmilitary and civilian leadership as well as senior government officials \nin both countries. I have spoken repeatedly on the Senate floor about \nthe importance of accountability of U.S. military and civilian \nprograms.\n  When it comes to matters of war, the Senate has a special \nresponsibility to ask questions and to hold the executive branch \naccountable no matter what party is in the White House. I have taken \nthis responsibility very seriously and have repeatedly questioned and \nexamined U.S. policy in south Asia.\n  There has been substantial progress in Afghanistan. On the \nbattlefield, the United States coalition and Afghan forces have rolled \nback advances made by the Taliban. We have made measurable, albeit \nfragile, gains on security in key provinces of the country. Al-Qaida, \noperating from Pakistan, has been significantly degraded.\n  There has also been measurable progress in the education and health \nfields. Only 900,000 boys and no girls attended school under the \nTaliban. Today more than 6 million children are in school and a third \nof them are girls. In the field of health, more than 85 percent of \nAfghans now have access to at least some form of health care, up from 9 \npercent in the year 2002.\n  These gains have not come without immeasurable sacrifice on the part \nof our Armed Forces and of course their families. In Pennsylvania we \nhave lost 30 servicemembers killed in action in Operation Enduring \nFreedom since 2001. To date, 461 have been wounded, some of them \ngrievously wounded.\n  In Iraq, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania lost 197 servicemembers \nkilled in action and 1,233 were wounded. These courageous men and women \ngave what many years ago Lincoln called ``the last full measure of \ndevotion'' to their country. We owe them a debt of gratitude. We owe \nthe same debt of gratitude to their families and to all veterans and \ntheir families returning from the battlefield.\n  After this exhaustive review, and based upon measurable gains in \nAfghanistan, I believe the United States can shift from a strategy of \ncounterinsurgency toward an increased focus on counterterrorism. It is \ntime for the United States to lighten its footprint in the country. It \nis also a time to accelerate the shift in responsibility to Afghan \nforces and for a drawdown of a significant number of United States \ntroops from Afghanistan. The capabilities of both al-Qaida and the \nTaliban have been severely degraded.\n\n[[Page S3967]]\n\n  The United States-led development projects have strengthened the \nhealth and education sectors, as I mentioned before. At a time of \neconomic austerity here in the United States, the approximately $120 \nbillion per year pricetag is, for sure, unsustainable. We must take a \nsignificant shift in our strategy.\n  As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Near \nEastern, South, Central Asian Affairs, I am focused on our broader \nnational security interests in both regions. We must focus on extremist \ngroups that have the capability and intent to project terrorism on the \nUnited States homeland and interests around the world. We should \ncontinue to conduct counterterror operations on al-Qaida, Pakistani \nTaliban, and others who seek to strike the United States homeland and \nour interests.\n  Significant challenges, however, do remain and the United States \nshould focus on the following. First, we must redouble our efforts to \ntrain the Afghan security forces. We made substantial progress in \nrecruiting and training, but this needs to be ramped up. In the long \nrun, Afghanistan's ability to deny safe haven to al-Qaida or any \nterrorist organization will depend upon a strong and durable army and \npolice in Afghanistan.\n  Second, much work remains in Pakistan. In Senate hearings and \nmeetings with U.S. and Pakistani officials, I have questioned \nPakistan's full commitment to addressing the extremist threat within \nits borders. For example, Pakistan has done little to stop the flow of \nbomb components across the border into Afghanistan, where they are used \nagainst our troops. Terrorists in Pakistan have the capability to \nstrike internationally, and have done so in recent years.\n  These terrorists are also the central threat to the Pakistani state \nitself, a concern that grows as Pakistan inexplicably expands its \nnuclear arsenal.\n  The Pakistani people have suffered greatly in the struggle against \nthese extremist groups as thousands of civilians and security forces \nhave died. This is precisely why it is so unfortunate that the \nPakistani Government is not fully committed to confronting this threat.\n  I have been very patient with respect to this critical relationship, \nbut I am compelled to speak the truth when the stakes are so high for \nthe American people. The United States troops and the people of \nPakistan both have a lot at stake, in addition to the American people. \nIn my judgment, recent developments are unacceptable and merit a \nserious examination of U.S. aid to Pakistan. The Senate should hold \nhearings so we have a full accounting of Pakistan's efforts to combat \nterrorism.\n  The third area of our focus should be the grave concerns that many of \nus have--and I have for sure--about the future of women and girls in \nAfghanistan. If nothing else, we cannot lose precious ground gained in \nrights for this critical 50 percent of the population--women and girls. \nOver the past 10 years, women have assumed seats in Parliament and \ngirls have returned to school. I mentioned the number earlier. Women's \nrights have become a part of the public dialog at long last.\n  When speaking to a group of Afghan women in May, Secretary of State \nClinton said, ``We will not abandon you, we will stand with you \nalways.''\n  We must as a nation stand by this commitment to the women and girls \nwho live in Afghanistan. Empowered women are the most influential voice \nto dissuade young men from taking up arms in Afghanistan and places \naround the world. These women are the most likely to develop their own \ncommunities as well.\n  Finally and most importantly, it is our moral obligation to protect \nthose who are most vulnerable in Afghanistan.\n  I have significant concerns about governance in Afghanistan. I have \nclosely examined Afghanistan's uneven governance record and have \nserious questions about the viability of the democratic experiment in \nthat country. The foundational act of democracy, elections, has not met \ninternational standards in Afghanistan and has established the basis \nfor an unresponsive government and unresponsive government officials \nand corruption.\n  As the United States draws down its military presence, the \ninternational community must renew its focus on governance in \nAfghanistan and efficient disbursal of U.S. assistance. A recent Senate \nForeign Relations Committee report suggests that we must do a better \njob of accounting for the resources spent on bolstering the Afghan \nGovernment.\n  In conclusion, we have made progress in Afghanistan all these years. \nThe surge in U.S. troops, working with coalition forces and the Afghan \nArmy, has rolled back gains made by the Taliban. Our special forces \nhave killed Osama bin Laden and several other senior al-Qaida leaders. \nThe numbers and capabilities of the Afghan security forces have \nincreased. Women and girls are better off than they were in the year \n2001, and the health sector has improved.\n  Significant challenges remain, but based upon these advances and on \nthe significant costs of our current policy, it is time, after 10 long \nyears, to begin the drawdown process.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/21/senate-section/article/S3967-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3967-S3968]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DR. CONRAD JONES\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to recognize a distinguished \ndoctor and Kentuckian, Dr. Conrad Jones. Dr. Jones has risen to become \none of the most admired and applauded physicians in the Bluegrass \nState, a feat that was recognized at the Murray-Calloway County \nHospital in 2007 when they opened their new women's health facility and \nnamed it the Conrad Jones Women's Pavilion. As Dr. Jones has \ncontributed to the field of women's health for six decades now, it was \na very fitting tribute.\n  When Dr. Jones was born in 1922, there was not yet the MRI, the \nultrasound or the home pregnancy test. Dr. Jones's father, Dr. Cody \nJones, was also a physician, and a young Conrad would accompany him on \nhis rounds as a country doctor. The Jones family had come to Kentucky \nfrom the Carolinas and Tennessee before the Civil War. Conrad's mother \nwas a school teacher who taught in Hazel and at Murray High School.\n  Conrad remembers his father worked long, hard hours. His father would \nhave preferred that Conrad become a farmer instead of a doctor, in \nfact, because a doctor's life was too hard. Luckily for the people of \nKentucky, Conrad did not take that particular piece of advice.\n  Dr. Conrad Jones attended Murray State and then went to medical \nschool at the University of Louisville. After serving his country in \nuniform, he returned to Murray, KY, to work at what was then the new \ncity-county hospital and its obstetrics unit. He helped patients from \nthe immediate area as well as all over Marshall, Graves and Henry \ncounties.\n  Dr. Jones has practiced medicine in Murray so long he can tell you \nthe history of how medicine and medical technology has advanced in the \narea. Dr. Jones certainly keeps up with the technology, and is proud \nthat Murray has what he calls by today's standards state-of-the-art \nfacilities.\n  I wish to commend Dr. Conrad Jones for his many decades of service to \nhis community. The people of Murray, Calloway County and Kentucky are \nlucky to have him. I know my colleagues join me when I say this U.S. \nSenate is grateful to him and his family for all he has contributed to \nmake ours a stronger country.\n  The Murray-Calloway County Chamber of Commerce published a 2008 \nViewbook that contained an illuminating article detailing Dr. Conrad \nJones's life and career. I ask unanimous consent that the article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed, as \nfollows:\n\n  [From the Murray-Calloway County Chamber of Commerce 2008 Viewbook]\n\n               Murray's Conrad Jones: A Life in Medicine\n\n                        (By Robert A. Valentine)\n\n       In February 2007, the Murray-Calloway County Hospital \n     opened a state-of-the-art facility dedicated to women's \n     health. Almost everyone there recognized the appropriate name \n     of the new facility: The Conrad Jones Women's Pavilion. Dr. \n     Conrad Jones, who had already witnessed six decades of \n     progress in women's health, was looking on in a state of \n     near-speechless humility.\n       He was born long before the MRI, the ultrasound or even the \n     home pregnancy test. Most women had yet to vote in their \n     first presidential election, and all but a very, very few \n     babies were born at home. It was a warm October in 1922.\n\n[[Page S3968]]\n\n       ``My father wanted me to be a farmer because a physician's \n     life was hard,'' Dr. Jones told us in an interview in his \n     offices at the Murray Woman's Clinic. He was attracted to the \n     life of the country doctor, despite its perils and long, hard \n     hours. ``Work in the tobacco fields made me know that I \n     didn't want that.''\n       After Murray State, he entered medical school at the \n     University of Louisville. Following that, he went directly \n     into the service. ``There were few specialists there,'' he \n     remembers. ``You did whatever was necessary for the \n     patient.''\n       He returned to Murray after the service. By that time, the \n     new city-county hospital had come into being with an \n     obstetrics unit on the second floor of the northwest wing. \n     ``It was pretty crude by today's standards,'' he remembers, \n     ``But it was probably the best OB unit for several counties \n     around. We did about as many deliveries then as we do now,'' \n     Dr. Jones observed, because many patients came from Marshall, \n     Graves and Henry counties.\n       ``Murray has always been a very progressive community in \n     terms of technology'' he reminded us. ``By today's standards, \n     what we have now is the state-of-the-art. This should serve \n     us well for several years.''\n       We asked Conrad Jones how long he has been in Murray. With \n     a broad smile, he answered, ``Always.'' That makes him the \n     ideal source of information on changes in women's healthcare \n     over the years. We also asked about the most important \n     changes during his career.\n       ``Today there are far more caesarian sections being \n     performed. In the '50s and '60s, if your section rate got \n     above 5 or 6 percent, it was uncommon. Now, we see 23 to 30 \n     percent. Surgery is much safer now, and we have better \n     tracking technology, so you can tell how the fetus is under \n     stress. Fetal monitors were a major step forward by in the \n     late '60s and early '70s.''\n       Modern techniques make it much safer for the mother. \n     ``Anesthesia is also another big change. Not too many years \n     back, the only anesthesia was the `saddle block' (a procedure \n     which cuts off sensation in the pelvic region) or nitrous \n     oxide. Now, the epidural has replaced that.''\n       But the main change is the technology and the facility. The \n     custom of hospital instead of home deliveries has drastically \n     reduced the infant mortality rate. Only two generations ago, \n     maternal and infant mortality was all too common. ``The \n     mothers of today have no idea how dangerous childbirth used \n     to be,'' he recalls with a serious look.\n       And women are presenting more challenges. Today, there are \n     more career or professional women, and more women remain in \n     the workforce longer. ``The age at which women start families \n     is higher, and I don't know what affect that's going to have \n     on the family. But we know that, as a mother ages, there is a \n     greater risk to her and to the child. However, medicine is \n     keeping pace, I think, so it's safer.'' He points with pride \n     to the work of his associates in fertility treatments and in \n     the new outpatient, non-invasive surgeries for incontinence \n     hysterectomies, and non-surgical permanent birth control. \n     ``Fifty years ago, that would have seemed like a miracle,'' \n     he says.\n\n\n                  the role of women in murray medicine\n\n       In the future, he expects to see more women entering \n     medicine, and he welcomes it. ``We had two women in my \n     medical school class of 100; now about half of the classes \n     are women. It's a growing thing, and very important. Most of \n     the pediatricians in Murray are women, and there are two top-\n     notch internists. We have Dr. Deeter and Dr. Burnett in our \n     practice (Murray Woman's Clinic) and three outstanding nurse-\n     practitioners, and that is very important to good, modern \n     family care.''\n       After so many sleepless nights and the constant drive to \n     remain ``current'' in technology and practice, we had to ask \n     if he would still choose medicine as a career if he were \n     starting over, today. ``Most emphatically, yes! The hours are \n     very difficult, but you get so much joy out of helping \n     others. It's a very happy, joyous experience; you are helping \n     people at a vital time in their lives.''\n       And what would he tell someone starting out in medicine \n     today? ``Well,'' he smiled, and leaned over his desk, \n     ``You've got to have a good partner--and that's my wife. She \n     was with me all the way; when I was gone all night, she had \n     to be alone. We couldn't take vacations as other folks might, \n     and maybe we missed a lot of things. She has been a real \n     trooper; without her, I couldn't have done it.''\n       Would he change anything about his career? ``Not a bit,'' \n     he smiled. After all, it has been not merely a career so much \n     as it is a life in medicine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/21/senate-section/article/S3968-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3968]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            FELONY STREAMING\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

Those who willfully infringe copyrights for the purpose \nof commercial advantage or private financial gain deserve to be \npunished like the thieves that they are.\n  But in doing this, we must make sure that the punishment is \nproportionate to the crime. This bill simply copies the penalty \nstructure from the current law that makes larger scale illegal \ndownloading a felony. That law makes ``the reproduction or \ndistribution, including by electronic means''--i.e. downloading--a \nfelony punishable by up to 5 years imprisonment, if it involves: 10 or \nmore copies; with a total retail value of more than $2,500; and within \na 180-day period.\n  This bill just replicates that penalty structure, with the additional \nelement of an alternative ``fair market value'' threshold. It makes \nwillful infringement through ``public performances by electronic \nmeans''--i.e. streaming--also a felony, subject to the same 5-year \nmaximum sentence, if it involves: 10 or more public performances; \nwithin a 180-day period; with either a total retail or economic value \nof more than $2,500; or total fair market value of licenses of more \nthan $5,000.\n  As I stated at the beginning, I have no problem with increased \npunishment for large-scale infringers, whether they infringe through \ndownloads or through streams. The problem, though, with this structure \nis that it treats streaming as being as serious as downloading. But a \ndownload, in my view, is obviously much more serious, because it makes \na permanent copy of the song or movie or show, as opposed to the one-\ntime viewing or listening that streaming creates. This is very likely \nwhy downloading was made a felony to begin with, while streaming \nwasn't. Given that downloading is much more serious and damaging, to \nhave a moral consistency with the downloading penalties, the streaming \nthresholds, at least in quantity, should be much higher.\n  Therefore, I hope to work with the bill's sponsors before this \nlegislation goes to the floor, to craft a more appropriate threshold, \nwhich reflects the differences between downloading and streaming. As \nthe sponsors and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator \nLeahy, have stated, there are other outstanding issues that they are \ncommitted to addressing before this bill comes to the floor, and I hope \nthis concern that I have can be resolved in the same way.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/21/senate-section/article/S3968-2", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3968]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SUMMER LEARNING\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Mr. President, today I recognize Ms. Linda \nRundell, the Bureau of Land Management's New Mexico State director, for \nher exemplary public service and to express my congratulations on her \nupcoming retirement after 32 years.\n  Linda has held many titles during her time with BLM, including range\n\n[[Page S3969]]\n\nconservationist, wildlife biologist, environmental impact statement \nteam leader, program analyst, congressional fellow, and district \nmanager. And her work has taken her to nearly as many parts of our \ncountry, including Alaska, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington, DC.\n  But the majority of her career has kept her in my home State of New \nMexico where she will finish her tenure with BLM as State director for \nNew Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, and Kansas. Since 2002, Linda has overseen \nan annual budget of $250 million and is responsible for 13.4 million \nacres of public lands in New Mexico and nearly 54 million acres of \nFederal and tribal subsurface minerals underlying non-BLM lands in the \nfour States.\n  With a mission of multiple-use management, the BLM is tasked with \nbalancing competing uses of our public land--including oil and gas \ndevelopment, wildlife protection, recreation, grazing, landscape \nconservation, and cultural resource protection--to name just a few. \nAttempting to balance these activities can be a challenging task for \nany land manager. However, Linda's career demonstrates how well she has \npersonified this mission by assisting groups with opposing viewpoints \nto find common ground through collaboration.\n  Restore New Mexico, a program Linda established in 2005, demonstrates \nthe benefits that can be achieved through collaboration. In only about \n6 years the BLM--in partnership with environmental groups, ranchers, \noil and gas companies, and sportsmen--has begun the restoration of 1.5 \nmillion acres of grasslands and woodlands in New Mexico. These efforts \nare reversing decades and even centuries of habitat fragmentation, \nencroachment by invasive species, and the legacy of orphaned oil and \ngas wells across the State. The results have been excellent, and the \npartnerships that have been built between long-time adversaries cannot \nbe understated. With this collaboration as a framework, the long-term \nsuccessful restoration of our public lands is more likely than ever.\n  Linda's impressive record as State director is no doubt a product of \nwhat she learned in the years leading up to it. Her background as a \nwildlife biologist, for example, gave her the foresight to recognize \nthat the BLM had a significant role to play if further population \ndeclines of the lesser prairie chicken were to be averted. Before this \nsmall grouse began gaining headlines in newspapers, Linda knew that a \ncontinued decline of this species would have far-reaching implications. \nFor this reason, she has worked diligently to protect and expand lesser \nprairie chicken habitat in the State.\n  Linda exemplifies the attributes found in effective leaders--honesty, \na strong work ethic, and a willingness to make the right decision even \nwhen it may be difficult. She is highly respected within and outside \nthe agency for her leadership skills and her staff in New Mexico mirror \nthese traits. I appreciate how helpful she and her staff have been \nwhile working with my office in the development of various policy \ninitiatives including conservation measures--many of which have been \nsigned into law--like the Ojito Wilderness, Prehistoric Trackways \nNational Monument, Fort Stanton-Snowy River Cave National Conservation \nArea, and Sabinoso Wilderness.\n  Linda's tenure as BLM State director will leave a lasting legacy that \nhas and will continue to benefit the health of our public land and \nwildlife as well as the economy of our State and Nation. Our Nation is \ngrateful for her service, and I wish her the best on her future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/21/senate-section/article/S3969-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3969]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                   Enrolled Joint Resolutions Signed\n\n  At 12:38 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled joint resolutions:\n\n       S.J.

A bill to support the establishment and operation of \nTeachers Professional Development Institutes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, \nalong with my colleague from Connecticut, Senator Blumenthal, which \nwill strengthen the content knowledge and instructional skills of our \npresent K-12 teacher workforce. Our goal with this legislation, like \nany education legislation I support, is to ultimately raise student \nachievement.\n  The Teachers Professional Development Institutes Act would establish \nup to eight new Teachers Professional Development Institutes throughout \nthe nation each year over the next 5 years based on the successful \nmodel that has been operating at Yale University for over thirty years. \nEvery Teachers Institute would consist of a partnership between an \ninstitution of higher education and the local public school system in \nwhich a significant proportion of the students come from low-income \nhouseholds. These Institutes will strengthen the present teacher \nworkforce by giving each participant an opportunity to gain more \nsophisticated content knowledge and a chance to develop curriculum \nunits with other colleagues that can be directly applied in their \nclassrooms. We know that teachers gain confidence and enthusiasm when \nthey have a deeper understanding of the subject matter that they teach \nand this translates into higher expectations for their students and an \nincrease in student achievement.\n  The Teachers Professional Development Institutes are based on the \nYale-New Haven Teachers Institute model that has been in existence \nsince 1978. For over 30 years, the Institute has offered, five or six \n13 session seminars each year, led by Yale faculty, on topics that \nteachers have selected to enhance their mastery of the subject areas \nthey teach. The subject selection process begins with representatives \nfrom the Institutes soliciting ideas from teachers throughout the \nschool district for topics on which teachers feel they need to have \nadditional preparation, topics that will assist them in preparing \nmaterials they need for their students, or topics that will assist them \nin addressing the standards that the school district requires. As a \nconsensus emerges about desired seminar subjects, the Institute \ndirector identifies university faculty members with the appropriate \nexpertise, interest and desire to lead the seminar. University faculty \nmembers, especially those who have led Institute seminars before, may \nsometimes suggest seminars they would like to lead, and these ideas are \ncirculated by the representatives as well. The final decisions on which \nseminar topics are offered are ultimately\n\n[[Page S3973]]\n\nmade by the teachers who participate. In this way, the offerings are \ndesigned to respond to what teachers believe is needed and useful for \nboth themselves and their students.\n  The cooperative nature of the Institute seminar planning process \nensures its success. Institutes offer seminars and relevant materials \non topics teachers have identified and feel are needed for their own \npreparation, as well as what they know will motivate and engage their \nstudents. Teachers enthusiastically take part in rigorous seminars they \nhave requested, and practice using the materials they have obtained and \ndeveloped. This helps ensure that the experience not only increases \ntheir preparation in the subjects they are assigned to teach, but also \ntheir participation in an Institute seminar gives them immediate hands-\non active learning materials that can be used in the classroom. All of \nthis is a very empowering experience for teachers.\n  The Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute conducted a National \nDemonstration Project from 1999-2002 that showed that similar \nInstitutes could be created rapidly at diverse sites with large \nconcentrations of disadvantaged students. After 2 years of research and \nplanning, and based on the success of that project, the Institute in \n2005 launched the Yale National Initiative to strengthen teaching in \npublic schools, a long-term endeavor to assist with the establishment \nof Teachers Institutes of this specific type in most states. As a \nresult, new Institutes already have been established in Philadelphia, \nPennsylvania, Charlotte, North Carolina, and New Castle County, \nDelaware. Nine other school districts in 6 states, including \nCalifornia, Arizona, Oklahoma, Illinois, Virginia, and Georgia, are \ncurrently participating in the Initiative to learn how to develop a new \nInstitute.\n  The teachers surveyed for the National Demonstration Project reported \nthat student motivation, student interest, and student mastery were \nhigher during the Institute-developed unit than during other work. \nSubsequently, the findings of a 2009 Report on Teachers Institute \nExperiences found that teachers participated out of desires to obtain \ncurricula that suited their needs, increased subject mastery, and \nmotivated students. Mr. President, 96 percent of the teachers rated the \nInstitute seminars as useful, partly due to the reported increase in \nknowledge and in raising expectations for their students.\n  A retrospective study showed that over 5 years, Teachers Institute \nparticipants were almost twice as likely as non-participants to remain \nteaching in the district 5 years later. Research has shown that \nlongevity in a district leads to increased teacher effectiveness.\n  Many agree that teacher quality is the single most important school-\nrelated factor in determining student achievement. High-quality teacher \nprofessional development programs that focus on subject and pedagogy \nknowledge are a proven method for enhancing the effectiveness of a \nteacher in the classroom. A recent review of professional development \nstudies by the Department of Education's Institute of Education \nSciences found that, and I quote ``teachers who receive substantial \nprofessional development, an average of 49 hours in the 9 studies, can \nboost their students' achievement by about twenty-one percentile \npoints.''\n  The Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute model enhances teachers' basic \nwriting, math, and presentation skills. It increases expectations of \nstudent achievement and enthusiasm for teaching while developing skills \nfor motivating students. These are key features that research suggests \nare effective in producing gains in both teacher knowledge and practice \nand student achievement. The Teachers Institutes lead to student \nachievement gains through a proven approach distinguished from both \nconventional professional development offerings of school districts and \nfrom traditional continuing education and outreach programs of colleges \nand universities.\n  Education Secretary Arne Duncan said recently, and I quote, ``the \npractices of high-performing countries show clearly that America in \nparticular has to do much more to elevate the teaching profession, from \nthe recruitment and training of teachers to their evaluation and \nprofessional development.''\n  This is precisely what the Teachers Professional Development \nInstitutes Act strives to accomplish. The need for effective teachers \nwith deep content knowledge is most apparent and urgent in schools and \nschool districts that enroll a high proportion of students from low-\nincome families, exactly the schools and school districts that Teachers \nInstitutes serve.\n  The Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute has already proven to be a \nsuccessful model for teacher professional development as demonstrated \nby the high caliber curriculum unit plans that teacher participants \nhave developed and placed on the web, and by the evaluations that \nsupport the conclusion that virtually all the teacher participants felt \nsubstantially strengthened in their mastery of content knowledge and \ntheir teaching skills. The finding that Institute participants were \nalmost twice as likely as non-participants to remain teaching in high-\nneed schools is especially encouraging. Our proposal would open this \nopportunity to many more teachers in high-need schools throughout the \nnation.\n  I urge my colleagues to act favorably on this measure.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1240\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to prohibit \ntaking\n\n[[Page S3975]]\n\nminors across State lines in circumvention of laws requiring the \ninvolvement of parents in abortion decisions; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, it is an honor to stand alongside Senator \nHatch today as we introduce the Child Interstate Abortion Notification \nAct. This bill, which would help States enforce laws requiring that \nparents be notified before their child has an abortion, is supported by \nmany pro-life groups and organizations. But perhaps most importantly, \nit is supported by a broad majority of parents, who are in a much \nbetter position to help children with tough decisions than virtually \nanyone else.\n  Many States require that a parent be notified before a minor has an \nabortion, while even more require the consent of a parent before a \nphysician can legally perform an abortion. Unfortunately, these laws \nare undermined and circumvented by those simply willing to travel to a \nState without these restrictions.\n  This important legislation would put an end to this practice \npermanently by simply enabling States to enforce their existing laws, \nwhich are designed to protect our children and defend parents' rights. \nWhile this legislation serves that goal, it also promotes a culture of \nlife in our nation that is critical to ensuring we continue to cherish \nand defend the self-evident, fundamental right to life, especially as \nit applies to the unborn.\n  Specifically, this bill has two parts: First, it prohibits the act of \nknowingly taking a minor across State lines with the intent of \nobtaining an abortion if this action evades the parental involvement \nlaw in her home State. Second, it would require abortion providers to \nnotify a parent of an out-of-State minor before performing an abortion.\n  Sadly, many are willing to circumvent State law and shuttle young \ngirls across State lines in order to avoid parental notification laws. \nWith the help of my Senate colleagues, we will put a stop to this and \nensure that parents are aware of profound medical operations involving \ntheir children. With that thought in mind, I ask you to support this \nlegislation to help keep parents informed.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I am proud to stand with my friend \nfrom Florida, Senator Rubio, as he introduces an important piece of \nlegislation, the Child Interstate Abortion Notification Act. This bill, \nwhich today is being introduced in the House by Representative Ileana \nRos-Lehtinen of Florida, is based on the belief that children should \nnot make profound life-changing decisions by themselves and that \nparents are generally in the best and most responsible position to help \nthem.\n  One of the many disturbing ironies in the abortion debate is that \nparental consent is needed for such things as tattoos or school \nfieldtrips but not always for abortions that will end one life and \nchange another forever. Abortion advocates say that abortion should be \ntreated as any other surgical procedure, but many of them oppose \nrequiring the same parental consent for abortion that is required for \nany other procedure.\n  What is worse, there are individuals and organizations out there who \nappear to care more about money an about kids. They are willing to help \nyoung girls get abortions by any means necessary, including taking them \nto other States without the knowledge or consent of their parents. Mind \nyou, those same parents will be responsible for the aftermath, for the \nphysical, emotional, and spiritual consequences of the abortion. If \nparents are to be responsible at the end, they have the right to be \nthere at the beginning.\n  If it were possible, just for a moment, to take the abortion politics \nout of the picture, every parent knows that kids have to develop over \ntime the judgment and maturity to make decisions. No one is more \ncommitted to them, no one has more love for them, no one has more \nresponsibility for them than their parents.\n  This bill has two parts. First, it prohibits taking a minor across \nState lines for an abortion if doing so evades the parental involvement \nlaw in her home State. In the 109th Congress, this portion of our bill \npassed the Senate with 65 bipartisan votes. More than 80 percent of our \nfellow Americans support it. Second, this bill requires abortionists to \nnotify parents of an out-of-State minor before performing an abortion. \nFifty-seven Senators voted for cloture on this combined bill in 2006.\n  I urge my colleagues to read the bill. It does not apply when an \nabortion is necessary to save a girl's life or if the girl is a victim \nof abuse or neglect. Again, please read the bill. It is carefully \ndrafted with the appropriate exceptions and safeguards in order to \nfocus on what unites the vast majority of Americans, that parents \nshould be involved before their child has an abortion. The majority of \nStates have laws requiring parental involvement and, with its \ninterstate component, this bill is a legitimate and constitutional way \nfor Congress to help protect children and support parents.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself and Mr. Manchin):\n  S. 1242. A bill to provide for the treatment of certain hospitals \nunder the Medicare program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I, along with my colleague Senator \nManchin, rise today to introduce the Fair Competition for Hospitals Act \nof 2011, legislation that will level the playing field for a handful of \nhospitals in the Northern Panhandle of West Virginia who are burdened \nby a payment disparity as compared to hospitals in neighboring States \nserving the same patient population. This legislation will adjust the \nwage index determination for these hospitals to make sure they are \ntreated the same as the nearby facilities in other States. It will also \nhelp hospitals in other areas of the country facing a similar \nsituation.\n  Medicare's hospital wage index system was created to reflect the \nvariation in the price of labor across the country. Usually, hospitals \nin different States are located far enough apart that they do not \ncompete for the same patients or workforce, within the same labor \nmarket. However, the geography in the Northern Panhandle of West \nVirginia presents a unique situation; with a geographic area as little \nas 6 miles wide, hospitals in West Virginia are much more akin to \nhospitals in Ohio and Pennsylvania, on either side of the panhandle. \nTherefore, this small group of hospitals is competitively disadvantaged \nbecause of wage index differences across state borders. This \ncompetitive disadvantage is causing these hospitals to struggle under \nthe weight of providing the same care for a lower payment and making it \nmore difficult to continue the high level of care for which they have \nbecome known.\n  These hospitals are vital cornerstones to the people in their \ncommunities. They employ more than 4,000 people and provide health care \nfor tens of thousands more. As an essential part of the community, they \nshould not be significantly disadvantaged by a payment structure that \ndoes not take into account the unique makeup of this area.\n  The solution I am introducing today is budget neutral and fair. It \nwill make sure that these hospitals in my State are treated on a level \nplaying field with their competitors and not disadvantaged by an \neconomically meaningless State border. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HAGAN:\n  S. 1243. A bill to require that certain Federal job training and \ncareer education programs give priority to programs that provide an \nindustry-recognized and nationally portable credential; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to reintroduce a very \nimportant piece of legislation to accelerate job growth across America, \nthe American Manufacturing Efficiency and Retraining Investment \nCollaboration Achievement Works Act, also known as the AMERICA Works \nAct. This bill is part of the solution to the Nation's economic and \nunemployment problem.\n  We all know that American families, as well as the manufacturing \nindustry, have faced difficult times over the last few years. But the \ntruth is that the manufacturing industry will always be a vital part of \nour Nation's economy.\n  The national unemployment rate has stabilized somewhat, but almost 14 \nmillion Americans remain out of work. We still have a long way to go. \nIn my home\n\n[[Page S3976]]\n\nState of North Carolina, unemployment hovers at 9.7 percent, with \nseveral counties facing double-digit unemployment rates. Job creation \nis my number one priority and this legislation is an innovative way to \nget Americans back into the workforce.\n  The United States needs a strong technical workforce. The AMERICA \nWorks Act would encourage national industries, such as biotechnology, \nconstruction, and machinery, to come together and agree on the skill \nsets they most value in prospective employees. Community colleges would \nparticipate, creating the appropriate curricula to meet those needs. \nStudents who complete the programs would receive an industry-recognized \ncredential. Workers who carry these industry-backed credentials would \nbe able to market themselves in any area of the country. Businesses \ncould count on the fact that workers with these credentials have the \nexpertise and skills they are looking for.\n  The AMERICA Works Act would require certain Federal job training and \ncareer development education programs to give priority to programs that \nprovide an industry-recognized and nationally portable credential. This \ncredentialing system starts out with basic competencies that prepare \nindividuals for the workplace. Once basic competencies are completed, \nindividuals can work toward high performance technical competencies and \nthen progress further to highly skilled technical and management \ncompetencies. The credentialing levels are stackable, allowing workers \nflexibility along their career tracks. Stackable credentials provide \nstraightforward paths, with clear entry and exit points, for workers to \nadvance their careers and attain high quality jobs.\n  In North Carolina, we have an advanced manufacturing skills program \nat Forsyth Technical Community College in Winston-Salem. Forsyth Tech \nis participating in the National Association of Manufacturers' \nManufacturing Skills Certification System, which offers credit programs \ntoward nationally recognized, stackable credentials. They have had \nhundreds of students enroll in their programs. Forsyth Tech has already \ncollaborated with state and local businesses to begin the process of \nincorporating their credentials into job descriptions. They believe \nthat introducing graduates with skill certifications into the local \nworkforce will help improve the hiring process, and the nationally \nrecognized credentials will improve employment opportunities.\n  When the President's Jobs Council met earlier this month in North \nCarolina, a leading topic of discussion, and something the President \nhimself mentioned, is the need to improve job training for American \nindustries so that our workers can be competitive in the global \neconomy.\n  The AMERICA Works Act will help job seekers and employers keep \nAmerica competitive in every industry, from textiles to aerospace, \nhigh-tech to biotech, and connect programs like those offered at \nForsyth Tech with employers in the community, region, and across the \nUnited States.\n  As I mentioned before, job creation is my number one priority.

Res. 212\n\n       Whereas, on December 23, 1990, the people of Slovenia voted \n     overwhelmingly in favor of independence from the former \n     Yugoslavia in a national referendum;\n       Whereas, on June 25, 1991, the Republic of Slovenia \n     declared itself as an independent and sovereign nation;\n       Whereas, on December 23, 1991, the parliament of Slovenia \n     adopted a constitution based on the rule of law, respect for \n     human rights, and democratic ideals;\n       Whereas, during its 20 years of independence, Slovenia has \n     been an important United States ally in Central Europe and a \n     strong advocate of democracy, the rule of law, and the merits \n     of an open, free market economy;\n       Whereas the Government of Slovenia has made important \n     contributions to international efforts to promote peace, \n     stability, and development in Southeast Europe, Afghanistan, \n     and elsewhere;\n       Whereas the Government of Slovenia serves as a leader in \n     efforts to remove destructive land mines in parts of \n     Southeast Europe and in other parts of the world;\n       Whereas Slovenia has become an active member of \n     international organizations, including the United Nations, \n     the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the \n     Council of Europe, the World Trade Organization, the European \n     Union, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and the \n     Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development; and\n       Whereas Slovenia has further consolidated its international \n     role through successful chairmanship of the Organization for \n     Security and Cooperation in Europe in 2005, and, as the first \n     new member from Central and Eastern Europe, the presidency of \n     the Council of the European Union in 2008: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Senate hereby--\n       (1) congratulates the people and the Government of the \n     Republic of Slovenia as the country celebrates 20 years of \n     independence on June 25, 2011;\n       (2) commends the people of Slovenia on the significant \n     progress made in the last 20 years;\n       (3) recognizes the important role of the Slovenian \n     community in the United States to promote partnership and \n     cooperation between the two countries; and\n       (4) encourages the Government of the Republic of Slovenia \n     to continue its important work in the transatlantic alliance, \n     and the efforts to further peace, stability, and prosperity \n     in Southeast Europe and elsewhere.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/21/senate-section/article/S3976-2", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3976-S3977]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      SENATE RESOLUTION 213--COMMENDING AND EXPRESSING THANKS TO \n              PROFESSIONALS OF THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY\n\n  Mr. DeMINT (for himself, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Vitter, Ms. Ayotte, Mr. \nBarrasso, Mr. Blunt, Mr. Boozman, Mr. Burr, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Coats, \nMr. Coburn, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Hatch, \nMrs. Hutchison, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Johanns, Mr. Johnson of \nWisconsin, Mr. Kirk, Mr. Lee, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Portman, Mr. Risch, \nMr. Rubio, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Thune, Mr. Wicker, Mr. \nRoberts, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Graham, and Mr. Alexander) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Select Committee on \nIntelligence:\n\n                              S. Res. 213\n\n       Whereas since the attacks on September 11, 2001, the United \n     States intelligence community has gathered critical \n     information that has helped to prevent additional attacks on \n     United States soil;\n       Whereas the Central Intelligence Agency (hereinafter \n     referred to as the ``CIA'') plays a vital role in United \n     States intelligence collection;\n       Whereas the importance of the CIA's work was exemplified by \n     the successful operation against Usama bin Laden;\n       Whereas, as authorized by the President and in accordance \n     with specific legal guidance provided by the Department of \n     Justice, the CIA lawfully detained and interrogated certain \n     high-value suspected terrorists;\n       Whereas information obtained from high-value detainees who \n     had been detained and interrogated by the CIA was essential \n     in determining the organizational structure, key operatives, \n     modus operandi, and other relevant information on al-Qaeda \n     operations;\n       Whereas information obtained from high-value detainees who \n     had been detained and interrogated by the CIA was crucial to \n     tracking down Usama bin Laden;\n       Whereas Michael Hayden, a former Director of the CIA, \n     wrote, ``Let the record show that when I was first briefed in \n     2007 about the brightening prospect of pursuing bin Laden \n     through his courier network, a crucial component of the \n     briefing was information provided by three CIA detainees, all \n     of whom had been subjected to some form of enhanced \n     interrogation. One of the most alerting pieces of evidence \n     was that two of the detainees who had routinely been \n     cooperative and truthful (after they had undergone enhanced \n     techniques) were atypically denying apparent factual data--a \n     maneuver taken as a good sign that the CIA was on to \n     something important. So that there is no ambiguity, let me be \n     doubly clear: It is nearly impossible for me to imagine any \n     operation like the May 2 assault on bin Laden's compound in \n     Abbottabad, Pakistan, that would\n\n[[Page S3977]]\n\n     not have made substantial use of the trove of information \n     derived from CIA detainees, including those on whom enhanced \n     techniques had been used.'';\n       Whereas a May 30, 2005, Department of Justice memo stated, \n     ``In particular, the CIA believes that it would have been \n     unable to obtain critical information from numerous \n     detainees, including KSM [Khalid Sheikh Mohammed] and Abu \n     Zubaydah, without these enhanced techniques. . . . Indeed, \n     before the CIA used enhanced techniques in its interrogation \n     of KSM, KSM resisted giving any answers to questions about \n     future attacks, simply noting, `Soon, you will know.' '';\n       Whereas according to such May 30, 2005, memo, Abu Zubaydah \n     explained the effect of enhanced techniques as, ``Brothers \n     who are captured and interrogated are permitted by Allah to \n     provide information when they believe they have reached the \n     limit of their ability to withhold it in the face of \n     psychological and physical hardships.'';\n       Whereas such May 30, 2005, memo further indicates that \n     after using enhanced interrogation techniques, high-value \n     detainees became cooperative stating, ``since the use of \n     enhanced techniques, `KSM and Abu Zubaydah have been pivotal \n     sources because of their ability and willingness to provide \n     their analysis and speculation about the capabilities, \n     methodologies, and mindsets of terrorists.' '';\n       Whereas mastermind of the attacks of September 11, 2001, \n     Khalid Sheikh Mohammed disclosed to CIA interrogators \n     information about a ``second wave'' plot using an East Asian \n     al-Qaeda group known as Jemmah Islamiyah to hijack and crash \n     an airliner into the Library Tower in Los Angeles;\n       Whereas Khalid Sheikh Mohammed gave CIA interrogators \n     information that led to the capture of Riduan bin Isomuddin, \n     known as Hambali, the leader of the Indonesian terrorist \n     organization Jemaah Islamiyah;\n       Whereas al-Qaeda senior operational planner Abu Zubaydah \n     and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed supplied important intelligence \n     about Abu Musab al-Zarqawi and his terrorist network, aiding \n     United States operations against al-Qaeda in Iraq;\n       Whereas in a May 2011 interview, Leon Panetta, the Director \n     of the CIA, in response to a direct question about enhanced \n     interrogation and the successful bin Laden operation, stated \n     that, ``Obviously there was some valuable information that \n     was derived through those kind of interrogations.'';\n       Whereas, although the President issued an Executive Order \n     in January 2009 that effectively ended the CIA's \n     interrogation and detention program, the Administration has \n     yet to establish clear policies for the detention and \n     interrogation of suspected high-value detainees, particularly \n     those captured overseas by foreign governments;\n       Whereas in 2009, the Attorney General launched a \n     preliminary review into whether Federal laws were violated in \n     connection with the interrogation of specific detainees, even \n     though career prosecutors had previously considered and \n     rejected filing criminal charges in those cases; and\n       Whereas the preliminary review initiated by the Attorney \n     General will determine whether CIA employees involved in the \n     detention and interrogation of terrorists should be \n     prosecuted for alleged violations of Federal law: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commends the professionals of the United States \n     intelligence community for their dedication;\n       (2) expresses thanks to the employees of the Central \n     Intelligence Agency for their selfless service;\n       (3) recognizes that continued investigation of employees of \n     the Central Intelligence Agency for their involvement in a \n     detention and interrogation program that helped to save lives \n     by averting terrorist attacks on the United States is \n     unwarranted and will likely have a chilling effect on the \n     critical work of their colleagues and other United States \n     national security professionals;\n       (4) urges the President and the Attorney General to \n     immediately close the Department of Justice's ongoing \n     investigation, and decline future prosecution, of Central \n     Intelligence Agency employees for actions related to the \n     interrogation of detainees at overseas locations, including \n     the use of enhanced interrogation techniques on detained \n     terrorists at such locations; and\n       (5) urges the President to develop and implement policies \n     allowing for the long-term detention and interrogation by the \n     intelligence community of high-value detainees, including \n     detainees who are captured overseas or are in the custody of \n     foreign countries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/21/senate-section/article/S3977-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3977]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 494.
