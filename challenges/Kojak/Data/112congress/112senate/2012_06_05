Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 410, S. \n3220.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 410, S. 3220, a bill to \n     amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to provide more \n     effective remedies to victims of discrimination in the \n     payment of wages on the basis of sex, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are now on the motion to proceed to the \nPaycheck Fairness Act.\n  Following my remarks and those of the Republican leader, the time \nuntil 12:30 will be equally divided. The majority will control the \nfirst 30 minutes and the Republicans will control the second 30 \nminutes.\n  The Senate will recess from 12:30 until 2:15 p.m. to allow for the \nweekly caucus meetings.\n  I ask unanimous consent the cloture vote on the motion to invoke \ncloture on the motion to proceed to S. 3220 occur at 2:30 p.m. and that \nthe time from 2:15 p.m. until 2:30 p.m. be equally divided between the \ntwo leaders, with the majority controlling the final half.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as I indicated, we are on the Paycheck \nFairness Act, and we will have that cloture vote at 2:30 p.m. today.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, most Americans believe if they get an \neducation, they work hard and play by the rules, they will have a fair \nshot at success. But for millions of American women, no amount of \ntalent or dedication will bring pay equality with their male coworkers. \nIn the minds of many employers, they simply are not equal.\n  American women take home 77 cents for every $1 their male colleagues \nearn for doing the exact same work. That stunning fact holds true \nwhether the woman has a college degree, regardless of how many hours \nshe spends in the office each week or on some manufacturing floor and \nregardless of what job she holds--77 cents applies.\n  But listen to this. If she is an African-American or Hispanic woman, \nthe disparity is even starker. African-American women make 62 cents on \nthe dollar and Hispanic women 54 cents on the dollar compared to White \nmen working the same hours and doing the same jobs. They are not \nworking at different jobs; these are the exact same jobs. If someone is \nHispanic and they are a woman, they get about half as much as a man \ndoing the same job. If they are African American, they get about 62 \ncents compared to every $1 a man makes.\n  While landmark pieces of legislation such as the Equal Pay Act and \nthe Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act have narrowed the pay gap, they have \nnot closed the gap, and that is obvious by the numbers I just announced \nto the Senate. So Congress must do more. This act that is before the \nSenate would give workers stronger tools to combat wage discrimination.\n  One of the tools of retaliation employers have is they fire workers \nif they discuss how much they make with another worker. Our legislation \nwould bar retaliation against workers for discussing salary \ninformation. Why do we\n\n[[Page S3696]]\n\nhave this in the bill? We have this landmark legislation that we had to \npass because the Supreme Court ruled against Lilly Ledbetter.\n\n  Lilly Ledbetter is a woman who worked in Alabama for many years, and \nshe didn't know she was being paid far less than her male counterparts \nwho did the same work. So when she learned of this, she filed a lawsuit \nin the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court said: Sorry, Lilly. You \ndidn't file it in time; the statute of limitations has run, meaning she \nhad to file within a certain period of time.\n  We have many different places in the law where we do not start \ntolling the statute until someone learns something is wrong. For \nexample, we had to go back on medical malpractice cases where people \nwere treated negligently by physicians, but the poor patient didn't \nrealize this until long after. For example, in the State of Nevada, \nthere is a 2-year statute of limitations. So we changed that in most \nplaces in the country, and we need to make sure people understand, in \nthis instance--now that we passed the Lilly Ledbetter legislation--the \ntime doesn't start running until one has learned they are being \ncheated.\n  Our legislation would bar retaliation against workers for discussing \nsalary information, and it would help secure adequate compensation for \nvictims of gender-based pay discrimination. Let's look at the State of \nNevada. Over their lifetimes, Nevada women will earn about $475 million \nless than their male counterparts--almost $500 million.\n  This is not just an issue for women; it is a family issue. Why? \nBecause every year millions of American families are cheated out of \nmoney they could spend on groceries, rent, and gas. Every year wage \ndiscrimination puts almost 400,000 Nevada children at risk.\n  For many families in Nevada and across the country a woman is the \nonly income generator in that family. For many more women that person \nis the primary breadwinner. Yet Republicans have vowed to block this \nlegislation. It is in all the news today. Every headline in the news \ntalks about this bill coming up today and the Republicans are saying \nthey are going to vote against it because it creates too much bookwork.\n  They vowed to block legislation that would even the playing field and \nhelp women provide for their families even though Americans \noverwhelmingly support this legislation. Nine out of ten Americans--\nincluding 81 percent of men and 77 percent of the Republicans--support \npay equity legislation.\n  Once again, the only Republicans who are against our commonsense \nmeasure are the ones who are in Congress in Washington. Even Mitt \nRomney has refused to publicly oppose this legislation. He may oppose \nit, but he is afraid to say anything about it. Why? Because it is \nobvious why. He should show some leadership. In my opinion, Governor \nRomney should tell his fellow Republicans that opposing fair pay for \nall Americans is shameful. Instead, no one knows where he stands, but \nwe know where Democrats stand. Everyone knows. We stand firmly on the \nside of equality for every working woman.\n  Democrats stand with middle-class women who are working to keep their \nfamilies afloat during these difficult times. We stand with young women \npursuing a college education who are hoping to get a good-paying job \nwhen they graduate. We stand with little girls whose mothers taught \nthem there is no limit to their dreams.\n  This evening Americans will see where Republicans stand on this \nissue. It is unfortunate they, once again, favor obstruction over \nequality.\n\n\n                  Recognition of the Republican Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                             Student Loans\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would like to continue to discuss the \nstudent loan issue this morning because the administration's approach \nto this problem is nothing short of surreal.\n  I have in my hand a letter that has been signed by the top four \nRepublicans in Congress: Speaker Boehner, Leader Cantor, minority whip \nJon Kyl, and myself. It lists no fewer than four good-faith bipartisan \nproposals to resolve the issue, all of which are based on offsets the \nPresident has proposed himself in the past.\n  Let me say that again: We have recommended to the President four \noffsets that he, himself, has proposed in the past to achieve what we \nall want to achieve, which is a 1-year extension of the current student \nloan interest rates. We sent this letter to the President 5 days ago. \nYet we have now learned that in spite of the fact they have a proposal \nrecommending that on a bipartisan basis we accept offsets that they \nhave previously recommended, we have now learned the Vice President \nwill have a group of college presidents over to the White House today \nto ``reassert the call for Congress to stop the student loan interest \nrate from doubling.''\n  Congress has acted. We have given the administration four offsets \nthey previously proposed. We are waiting for a response so we can solve \nthis problem. Why doesn't the Vice President simply pick up the phone, \nchoose one of the proposals we laid out in our letter, and then \nannounce at the meeting the problem has been resolved? That way he will \ngive these folks some good news to bring back to their campuses instead \nof just asking them to be props in this elaborate farce the White House \npolitical team cooked up on this issue. It is an elaborate farce. This \ncan be solved very easily with offsets the administration itself has \nrecommended.\n  The only people dragging their feet on this issue are over at the \nWhite House. Republicans in Congress have been crystal clear for weeks. \nWe are ready to resolve the issue to give students the certainty they \nneed about their loan payments. The President may find it politically \nuseful to keep these young people off-balance, but we don't think they \nshould have to wait another day. It is inexcusable for the President to \nallow this impasse to persist. That is why we bent over backward to \nfind a solution, and it is simply disingenuous for the President to \nclaim otherwise, which brings me to larger point.\n  We all realize the President is concerned about his reelection. I \nunderstand he is placing a higher priority on fundraising and trying to \nmake Republicans look bad as he ramps up to November. I get his \nrationale for running a negative campaign. If I were he, I wouldn't \nwant to brag about my record either. I get it. But I would remind him \nhe is still the President, even though the campaign is going on, and \nthat Americans are looking for leadership and the economic problems we \nface will only get worse if he avoids them for 6 more months.\n  So whether it is the student loan issue or the prospect of a massive \ntax hike at the end of the year, Republicans are ready to work with the \nPresident to provide the kind of certainty the American people need \nright now. But it is a two-way street. We will never solve these \nproblems if the President continues to mislead the American people \nabout what Republicans in Congress are willing and eager to do to help.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the letter I \npreviously referred to printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 31, 2012.\n     The President,\n     The White House, Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Earlier this year you asked Congress to \n     extend for another year the reduced interest rate for \n     subsidized Stafford student loans. Last month the House of \n     Representatives passed a bill to do just that and to pay for \n     the cost with a repeal of the Prevention and Public Health \n     Fund created as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable \n     Care Act. Despite the fact that you have previously signed \n     into law legislation reducing this fund by $5 billion to \n     offset the cost of preventing a reduction in Medicare \n     physician payments, your Administration indicated that you \n     would veto a bill that would use additional savings from the \n     fund to offset the cost of extending lower student loan \n     interest rates.\n       More recently. Senate Majority Leader Reid and his \n     conference have put forward a proposal to pay for extending \n     the reduced interest rate by raising taxes on small \n     businesses. As you know, this proposal cannot pass the Senate \n     and is unacceptable to the House of Representatives.\n       We believe our alternative is reasonable and responsible. \n     but in the interest of finding common ground on a way to pay \n     for a one year extension of the current student loan interest \n     rate we are open to other solutions that we have all \n     supported in the past.\n       The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated \n     that a one-year extension will increase the deficit by $5.985 \n     billion over\n\n[[Page S3697]]\n\n     the 2012 to 2017 budget window. We have reviewed your Fiscal \n     Year 2013 budget request. and based on areas of common \n     agreement we believe it is possible to fully offset this cost \n     by 2018 with additional savings in the ten year window and \n     beyond dedicated to much-needed deficit reduction.\n       We have attached two options for fully offsetting the cost \n     of extending the student interest rate reduction. The \n     policies in both options are either policies that you \n     recommended in their entirety or a subset of a policy you \n     recommended. We are prepared to support either option.\n       There is no reason we cannot quickly and in a bipartisan \n     manner enact fiscally responsible legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n     John Boehner,\n     Eric Cantor,\n     Mitch McConnell,\n     Jon Kyl.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Attachment\n\n\n                                option 1\n\n       Student Loan Interest Rate: Extend for one year (July 1, \n     2012 to June 30, 2013) the 3.40 percent interest rate for new \n     subsidized Stafford student loans. (CBO estimates this \n     proposal will increase the deficit by $5.985 billion over the \n     2012 to 2017 period and $5.985 billion over the 2012 to 2022 \n     period.)\n       Increase Federal Employee Retirement Contributions: As part \n     of the Fiscal Year 2013 Budget, the Administration proposes \n     to increase current employee contributions to the Civil \n     Service Retirement System (CSRS) and the Federal Employee \n     Retirement System (FERS) by 0.4% in each of the next three \n     calendar years--2013, 2014, and 2015--for a cumulative \n     increase of 1.2% of pay over current contributions. The House \n     of Representatives has passed a substantially larger increase \n     in contributions (5% over current law levels phased-in over \n     five years for regular CSRS and FERS employees) as part of \n     the Sequester Replacement Reconciliation Act. (CBO estimates \n     that the Administration's proposal would reduce the deficit \n     by $8 billion over the 2012 to 2017 period and $18 billion \n     over the 2012 to 2022 period. Note: This estimate reflects \n     that contribution levels have already been increased for new \n     hires as part of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation \n     Act, Public Law 112 96.)\n\n\n                                Option 2\n\n       Student Loan Interest Rate: Extend for one year (July 1, \n     2012 to June 30, 2013) the 3.40 percent interest rate for new \n     subsidized Stafford student loans. (CBO estimates this \n     proposal will increase the deficit by $5.985 billion over the \n     2012 to 2017 period and $5.985 billion over the 2012 to 2022 \n     period.)\n       Limit Length of In-School Interest Subsidy: As part of the \n     Fiscal Year 2013 Budget, the Administration proposes to limit \n     the duration of borrowers' in-school interest subsidy for \n     subsidized Stafford loans to 150 percent of the normal time \n     required to complete their educational programs. According to \n     the Department of Education, ``The Budget request eliminates \n     the in-school interest subsidy for borrowers who do not \n     complete their program within 150 percent of their program \n     length. Beyond that point, these borrowers no longer receive \n     the interest subsidy for the Subsidized Stafford loans they \n     have taken out, and interest will immediately begin to accrue \n     on these loans. As with the 12 semester Pell limitation \n     enacted this fall, students who attend school half-time would \n     have their benefits adjusted accordingly.'' (CBO estimates \n     that the Administration's proposal would reduce the deficit \n     by $475 million over the 2012 to 2017 period and $1.055 \n     billion over the 2012 to 2022 period.)\n       Revise Medicaid Provider Tax Threshold: Under current law, \n     states may not tax health care providers and return the tax \n     revenues to those same providers through higher Medicaid \n     payment rates or through other offsets and guarantees (known \n     as a ``hold harmless'' arrangement). An exception to this \n     provision is that the federal government will not deem a hold \n     harmless arrangement to exist if the provider taxes collected \n     from given providers are less than 6 percent of the \n     providers' revenues. As part of the Fiscal Year 2013 Budget, \n     the Administration proposes to phase down the Medicaid \n     provider tax threshold to 3.5% from Fiscal Year 2015 to \n     Fiscal Year 2017. The House-passed Sequester Replacement \n     Reconciliation Act would lower the allowable percentage \n     threshold to 5.5 percent starting in 2013. (CBO estimates \n     that the House-passed proposal would reduce the deficit by \n     $4.65 billion over the 2012 to 2017 period and $11.3 billion \n     over the 2012 to 2022 period.)\n       Improve Collection of Pension Information from States and \n     Localities: Both the Administration's Budget Proposal for \n     Fiscal Year 2013 and the House-passed Middle Class Tax Relief \n     and Job Creation Act (December 2011) include a proposal to \n     prevent Social Security overpayments by improving \n     coordination with States and local governments. By requiring \n     State and local government pension payers to identify whether \n     a worker's pension is based on government employment, the \n     Social Security Administration (SSA) can improve enforcement \n     of two benefit offset provisions affecting certain government \n     workers. (CBO estimates that the Administration's proposal \n     would reduce the deficit by $358 million over the 2012 to \n     2017 period and $2 billion over the 2012 to 2022 period.)\n\n\n                              War on Coal\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, hearings on the Environmental \nProtection Agency's regulatory agenda will be held in Kentucky this \nweek. One hearing will be held today in Frankfort and another later \nthis week in Pikeville. Since Congress is in session this week, I will \nnot be able to attend these important hearings in person, but I will \nhave a representative on hand at each hearing, and I wish to express my \nthoughts on the matter on the Senate floor.\n  Similar to most of the country, Kentucky is suffering from very \ndifficult economic times. Far too many Kentuckians are unemployed, and \nthe prospect for future employment remains daunting. That is why it is \nespecially irritating that this administration has blindly followed \nideological policies that eliminate jobs in our communities. The people \nof Kentucky are amongst the hardest working people on the planet, but \nhow can they be expected to compete if our own government is actually \nworking against them?\n\n  Simply put, my constituents are under siege from the Obama \nadministration's regulatory agenda, and the EPA is the worst offender--\nthe very worst.\n  Perhaps the clearest example of this administration's regulatory \nassault is its war on coal. Since being sworn in, President Obama's EPA \nhas set out to circumvent the will of Congress and the American people \nby turning the already cumbersome mine permitting process into a \nbackdoor means of shutting down coal mines. Mr. President, 18,000 \nKentuckians work in coal mining, and nearly 200,000 more, including \nfarmers, realtors, and transportation workers, rely on the coal \nindustry for their jobs. Coal brings in more than $3.5 billion from out \nof State and pays more than $1 billion in direct wages every year. \nAttacking an industry so important to Kentucky will only succeed in \nputting people out of work, impeding future job growth, and increasing \nenergy prices.\n  A former senior EPA official under the Obama administration recently \nsummed up the regulatory philosophy of the Agency with respect to those \nworking in the coal business by saying it wants to ``crucify'' them. \nLet me say that again. This was a regulator, with respect to those \nworking in the coal business, saying it wants to ``crucify'' them. With \nthis radical environmental anticoal agenda, it is no wonder the \nadministration has failed to answer the call of the American people for \ngreater domestic energy production. The real-world impact of their \nfantasy world energy policy is that people are losing their jobs and \nenergy prices will rise even further.\n  It is high time the Obama administration stop treating the Kentucky \ncoal industry as the problem and start recognizing that it has been and \nwill continue to be part of the solution.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nleadership time is reserved.\n  Under the previous order, the time until 12:30 p.m. will be equally \ndivided and controlled by the two leaders or their designees, with the \nmajority controlling the first 30 minutes and the Republicans \ncontrolling the second 30 minutes.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to urge my \ncolleagues to affirmatively and unabashedly vote for cloture on the \nPaycheck Fairness Act that we wish to bring before the Senate. This is \npart of a very long march the women of the United States of America \nhave been walking for a very long time.\n  In 1963 President Lyndon Johnson wanted to create a great society, \nand he envisioned three civil rights acts to right the wrongs of the \npast. One was equal pay--the Equal Pay Act--which would ensure that \nwomen would get equal pay for equal work. The second was the benchmark \nCivil Rights Act, and the third was the Voting Rights Act.\n  Lyndon Johnson picked the Equal Pay Act as his first action because \nhe felt it would be one of the easier ones to pass and to implement. \nLittle did he know that the corporate wrath that was against women in \nthe past would come to that legislation. However, a Democratically \ncontrolled Senate moved that bill and began the long march for civil \nrights. But guess what happened in the ensuing 49 years. On\n\n[[Page S3698]]\n\nJune 10, 1963, President Johnson signed that bill. Forty-nine years \nlater, women still make less than men. Women in the United States of \nAmerica make only 77 cents for every dollar men make doing the same \njob. This is unfair, and it is un-American.\n  Remember from where we have come. Everybody likes to say to us: Oh, \nyou have come a long way. Well, we don't think we have come a long way. \nWe have only gained 18 cents in 49 years. In 1963 we made 59 cents for \nevery dollar men made, and now it is 77 cents. So what does that mean? \nIt means every 5 years we make an advancement of one penny.\n  Oh, no. No more. We are just not going to take it anymore.\n  When I talk to my constituents, they say to me that they are mad as \nhell and they don't want to take it anymore. They go to school, they \nget the job, they do the job, they want to be paid for the job, and we \nagree with them. We want to do it not only with words, but we want to \ndo it with deeds, and we want to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act that \nwould ensure equal pay.\n  Women fight every day for equal pay, and when they do, they are side-\nlined, red-lined, and pink-slipped. Right now in the marketplace, it is \nlegal to fire a woman if she asks about pay, whether she goes to the \npersonnel director or whether she asks the person next to her at the \nwater cooler. Women are often harassed and intimidated for just asking: \nWhat do you make for the work you do? So we are ready to fight for \nwomen to get equal pay, and the best way to do it is to do it right \nhere on the Senate floor.\n  People say to me: Senator Barb, you led the fight on Lilly Ledbetter. \nDidn't that solve all the problems?\n  It solved a big problem. We made a downpayment to keep the courthouse \ndoor open for women who are discriminated against, but it did not close \nthe loopholes that were in the original Civil Rights Act. What Lilly \nLedbetter did was change the statute of limitations to file a lawsuit \nfrom the date of each discriminatory paycheck. Now we need to pass \npaycheck fairness to close the loopholes that allow discrimination to \nhappen in the very first place.\n  What does this bill do? It is actually very simple. If we listened to \nthe rightwing pundits, we would think this is complicated and it is \ngoing to rend asunder the American economy and so on. This is \nfundamental fairness.\n  What does it do? First of all, no longer will employers be able to \nretaliate against workers for sharing information about wages. Remember \nwhat I said earlier: If you ask someone how much they get paid, you can \nget fired. For years, Lilly Ledbetter and those she represents were \nhumiliated and harassed for just asking questions. No longer will women \nbe able to seek only back pay when they are discriminated against; they \nwill also be able to seek punitive damages. No longer will employers be \nable to use almost any reason to justify paying a woman less: Oh, the \nguys do harder jobs; oh, the guys do dangerous jobs; oh, they have a \nbetter education. We are talking about equal pay for equal work that \nrequires the same education. No longer will women be on their own \nbecause we are going to include various education and training \nprograms.\n  As I said, in 1963 we made 59 cents for every dollar men made. Women \nnow make 77 cents compared to every dollar a man makes. That is not \nprogress. The consequences of this are severe.\n  What does this mean? Well, let's take the college graduate, the woman \nwho has had the benefit and privilege of an education. It starts the \nminute she tosses her hat in the air. When she goes for that job, say, \nin information technology or even in some of the innovative economic \nfields, she will be making less. At the rate we are going, by the time \nshe retires there will be a $434,000 income pay gap. This is serious \nbecause it not only affects one's income as one goes through life, but \nit affects one's Social Security and it affects one's pension. It \naffects absolutely everything. The negative impact multiplies. It is \nlike compound interest in reverse. It is compound disinterest. It is \ncompounded unfairness. So these are real grievances. That is why the \nPaycheck Fairness Act will be able to do this.\n\n  When we look at the life of being a woman, we women know that being a \nwoman often means we pay more. We certainly pay more for health \ninsurance than men with the same coverage for the exact same age or \nhealth status. What does that mean? It means women pay estimates of \nthousands of dollars more in medical insurance over their lifetime. We \nare often on the hook for childcare, and there are a variety of things \non which we could elaborate.\n  I believe people should be judged in the workplace for skills and \ncompetence and that once you get the job and you show you can do the \njob, you should be paid to do that job.\n  For my colleagues who argue that 20 cents per hour doesn't matter, \nlet me share some numbers. That means $4,000 less per year for a \nworking family, $434,000 over a lifetime. It means we get paid 23 \npercent less than a man doing the same work who has the same education.\n  The Presiding Officer is a smart guy. He knows that when women go to \nget a mortgage, we don't get a 23-percent discount. When we go to buy \nfood, we don't get a 23-percent discount. When we go to pay our utility \nbills, they don't say: Oh, you are paid less, so we are going to give \nyou a discount. No. We get charged the same, and often more, but we are \npaid less.\n  We are not going to accept being paid less. We are paying attention \nto this problem. We have listened to the voices of the people. This \nisn't just Senator Barb sounding off on her women's rights agenda. My \nwomen's rights agenda is about the economic empowerment of women, so \nthey have a chance in this great country to be able to move ahead.\n  I listened to a constituent in Silver Spring with years of teaching \nexperience, and even in public employment, she was paid less.\n  Then we listened to a trauma surgeon who e-mailed me from Florida--\nhighly educated. She filed suit because she found out that a male \nsurgeon doing the exact same surgery was paid $25,000 more than she \nwas.\n  Another woman e-mailed me from Virginia. She claimed she was told by \nher supervisor that hiring a woman would simply be a liability. You are \ngoing to get pregnant. You are going to miss work. We don't know if we \nwant you here. That is a whole other issue. Then she said: We don't \nneed to pay you that. You don't head up a household, so why should you \nget the same money as some guy who does head up a household?\n  We have faced old prejudices, but we are in a new economy and in a \nnew world. More and more women are in the workplace, we want to be \ntreated with respect, and we want to have equal pay for equal work.\n  Mr. President, I note that my colleague Senator Murray is here. I \nyield her 5 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I wish to start off by giving a true and \nheartfelt thank-you to Senator Mikulski. There is no denying she is \nsuch a strong and steadfast leader on this issue, and we all so \nappreciate it. So I am very proud to come to the Senate floor this \nmorning with her and many others to strongly support the Paycheck \nFairness Act and to urge Republicans to join with us to pass this \ncritical bill.\n  Over the past few months, many of us have stood together to fight \nback against partisan attacks on policies that impact women across \nAmerica. We have not started these fights, but we were not going to \nstand by and watch as others tried to roll back the clock. But every \ntime we stood up to defend women, our friends on the other side of the \naisle would jump right up and say we were creating distractions or \nmanufactured issues. They said we should be focused on the economy, as \nif we were the ones changing the subject and making the partisan \nattacks. Well, we are not going to stop standing up for women and \nfamilies.\n  To those of our colleagues who claim to be so concerned about the \neconomy and the middle class, now is their chance to prove to their \nconstituents that they really mean what they say because the Paycheck \nFairness Act is not just about women and it is not just about fairness, \nit is about the economy. When women are not paid what they deserve, \nmiddle-class families and communities pay the price.\n\n[[Page S3699]]\n\n  In 1963 the Equal Pay Act marked one of the first steps toward \nnarrowing the gap between men and women. In 2009 this Senate took \nanother step by passing the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act to reverse the \nSupreme Court's Ledbetter v. Goodyear case which made it almost \nimpossible for our workers who suffered from discrimination to seek \njustice.\n  Although we have made progress since we passed the Equal Pay Act \nalmost 50 years ago, pay discrimination has not gone away. Women in my \nhome State of Washington still earn 77 cents on the dollar. That is a \npay gap that averages $11,834 in lost earnings each year. That is an \nextra 90 weeks of groceries or 179 tanks of gasoline. To women in \nWashington and to most women across America, that is certainly not a \nmanufactured issue. It is very real.\n\n  This comes at a time when more and more families rely on women's \nwages to put food on the table or stay in their home or build a nest \negg, their retirement, or help pay for their children's education.\n  The importance of women in the workplace has never been as critical \nas today, and this has become even more evident in this tough economy. \nThe fact is that women are now participating in the workforce at higher \nrates than ever before, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. So \nit would seem most appropriate for this Senate to move our country once \nagain toward eliminating pay discrimination and unfairness in the \nworkplace.\n  The Paycheck Fairness Act that we are going to have a vote on today \ntackles pay discrimination head-on, and it should not be a partisan \nissue or only a women's issue. It is good for women, it is good for \nfamilies, and it levels the playing field for businesses in America \nthat are doing the right thing and paying their workers fairly.\n  The Paycheck Fairness Act is good for business too. It recognizes \nemployers for excellence in their pay practices, and it strengthens \nFederal outreach and assistance to all businesses to help them improve \nequal pay practices. It is time to address this issue and finally close \nthe wage gap for our working women and their families.\n  I was very proud to stand with Senator Mikulski and other Members of \nCongress and the President as he signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay \nAct of 2009 to give women who are victims of pay discrimination the \ntools they need to seek justice. But our work is far from complete. We \nare still not yet at the point where our daughters can expect to earn \nthe same amount over their lifetime as our sons. That has to change. \nNow we need to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act as quickly as possible to \nkeep our Nation moving in the right direction.\n  Again, I thank Senator Barbara Mikulski for her tremendous leadership \nand steadfastness on this issue and her hard work to make this a \nreality for every working woman in this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, there will be other Democratic Senators \nspeaking during this time. I thank Senator Murray because she has been \na real champion on this issue. She has been a champion on making sure \nwomen are treated with respect in the workplace and in the U.S. \nmilitary. She has been a particular champion for ensuring that women in \nthe military and women in the VA system get treated with fairness. We \nhave a long way to go. This is 2012, and you would think at times it \nwas 1812. But in 1812 we in Baltimore fought another revolution, and we \nwill fight in 2012. So we thank her for her advocacy and look forward \nto having her vote this afternoon.\n  This is not only a women's issue where the women's rights groups are \npounding the table. We have the support and endorsement of the American \nBar Association. I have a letter which I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record in which the ABA absolutely endorses this \nlegislation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     American Bar Association,\n\n                                        Chicago, IL, May 31, 2012.\n     Re Support S. 797, the Paycheck Fairness Act\n\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the American Bar Association, I \n     am writing to urge you to vote for floor consideration of S. \n     797, the Paycheck Fairness Act. This legislation has the \n     widespread support of women across the country and deserves a \n     full and informed floor debate on its merits. The ABA \n     unequivocally supports S. 797 in its current form and urges \n     its prompt passage.\n       Congress declared that equal pay for equal work was the law \n     of the land when it passed the Equal Pay Act of 1963. But, in \n     the 50 years since its passage, this historic legislation has \n     become outdated and ineffective, and wage discrimination \n     remains a persistent, widespread, and pernicious problem. \n     Women today, regardless of their educational level, their \n     occupation, or their state of residence, still receive \n     unequal pay for equal work, even in jobs such as secretary or \n     nurse that are predominantly held by women.\n       The Paycheck Fairness Act would update key provisions of \n     the Equal Pay Act of 1963 without altering the basic scheme \n     of this historic statute or imposing excessive, novel burdens \n     on employers; indeed, the majority of its proposed changes \n     are borrowed from other civil rights statutes that have \n     proved more effective in eradicating workplace \n     discrimination.\n       In anticipation of floor consideration, we offer the \n     following comments to address what we believe are \n     mischaracterizations and areas of confusion:\n       The provisions of this bill apply equally to men and women \n     who experience sex-based wage discrimination. S. 797 is most \n     often described as a bill that will help working women \n     because women still are the primary victims of sex-based wage \n     discrimination. However, the bill clearly covers both sexes.\n       Enactment of this bill will not make employers liable for \n     any and every wage differential. As with the current Equal \n     Pay Act, the Paycheck Fairness Act provides that an employer \n     is not guilty of wage discrimination if a pay differential is \n     based on seniority, merit, quantity or quality of \n     production, or ``any other factor other than sex.'' The \n     legislation closes an existing loophole by clarifying that \n     the ``factor other than sex'' defense is valid only when \n     it is based on a bona fide factor (like education or \n     training) that is job-related, consistent with business \n     necessity, and where there is no other alternate practice \n     that would serve the same business purpose without \n     producing the wage differential. This standard, adapted \n     from Title VII discrimination cases, is one with which \n     courts already are familiar.\n       Enactment of this bill will not encourage excessive \n     verdicts against employers that will bankrupt businesses and \n     jeopardize the recovery of our economy. In fact, the ABA \n     expects the opposite result. It is true that the bill would \n     strengthen and update the remedies available under the EPA by \n     allowing prevailing plaintiffs to recover compensatory and \n     punitive damages but, as with Title VII cases, the Paycheck \n     Fairness Act would permit an award of punitive damages only \n     upon a showing of malice or reckless indifference by the \n     employer. That is a very high standard to meet and, on top of \n     that, numerous existing limitations in current law that guard \n     against improperly high verdicts assure that compensatory and \n     punitive damages will not unduly burden employers.\n       Enhanced remedies should make businesses more cognizant of \n     their legal obligations and more careful about how they set \n     wages. A renewed commitment by businesses to non-\n     discrimination will help their bottom line by reducing future \n     lawsuits and creating a positive work environment.\n       Furthermore, by helping improve the present and future \n     economic welfare of working women who make up about one-half \n     of the work force and who are the primary breadwinners in \n     more than 12 million families, the Paycheck Fairness Act will \n     foster financial security and a strong economy.\n       Enactment of this bill will not impose unduly burdensome \n     and unnecessary reporting requirements on businesses. Data \n     collection is critical because it provides necessary \n     documentation of existing wage discrimination and enables us \n     to analyze the degree of success that various programs have \n     on eradicating it.\n       The bill contains provisions to safeguard against \n     burdensome regulations by requiring the Equal Employment \n     Opportunity Commission to ``consider factors including the \n     imposition of burdens on the employers, the frequency of \n     required data collection reports . . . and the most effective \n     format for data collection.'' It also directs the Secretary \n     of Labor to engage in research, education, and outreach and \n     to develop technical assistance material to assist small \n     businesses in complying with the requirements of the Act.\n       It is clear that lip service alone to the American ideal of \n     a workplace free from discrimination will not help eradicate \n     gender-based wage discrimination. We urge you to transform \n     rhetoric into action by supporting floor consideration and \n     voting in favor of this much-needed remedial legislation.\n       Please contact Denise A. Cardman, Deputy Director of the \n     Governmental Affairs Office, at \n     denise.cardman@Aamericanbar.org if we can provide additional \n     information or assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                       Wm. T. (Bill) Robinson III,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. The ABA, which we know is a prestigious, distinguished \nrepresentation of the American bar, says that when we passed the \n``equal\n\n[[Page S3700]]\n\npay for equal work'' act, it was landmark. Quoting again from their \nletter:\n\n       But, in the 50 years since its passage, this historic \n     legislation has become outdated and ineffective, and wage \n     discrimination remains a persistent, wide-spread, and \n     pernicious problem.\n\n  In commenting on this bill, the ABA says:\n\n       The Paycheck Fairness Act would update key provisions of \n     the Equal Pay Act of 1963 without altering the basic scheme \n     of this historic statute or imposing excessive, novel burdens \n     on employers.\n\n  Remember, again, this is not Senator Mikulski, this is the ABA saying \nit will not impose excessive or novel burdens on employers. Indeed, \nmost of the proposed changes are borrowed from other civil rights \nstatutes that prove more effective in eradicating workplace \ndiscrimination. This goes to what the ABA says.\n  But now, Mr. President, I would like to yield 6 minutes to the \ndistinguished gentlelady from New Hampshire--a Governor, a Senator, a \nreal advocate who has had to not only be a leader in passing \nlegislation but in implementing it. We welcome her insights and \nadvocacy.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am so pleased to be able to join our \ncolleague and leader on so many issues that affect women and families, \nSenator Mikulski. I am here today to join her and our other colleagues \nwho will be coming to the floor to talk about something that is a real \nmatter of fundamental importance for our country.\n  Workers should have equal access to every opportunity that will help \nthem put food on the table, send their children to school, and save for \nretirement. Unfortunately, here we are in 2012 and still millions of \nAmerican women lose nearly a quarter of their potential earnings to pay \ndiscrimination. Almost 50 years after the landmark Equal Pay Act banned \nwage discrimination based on gender, women in our country continue to \nbe paid just over three-quarters of what their male counterparts \nreceive for performing the exact same work. Every day this wage gap \nexists is a further injustice to current workers, such as my daughters, \nand to future members of the workforce, such as my granddaughters and \nso many other granddaughters of Members of this body.\n  Pay discrimination does not just hurt the employee, it endangers the \nfamilies who depend on these women. One in three working moms is her \nfamily's only source of income. With the money that mother loses to pay \ndiscrimination every year, she could be paying housing and utility \ncosts on her home or she could be feeding her family, with money to \nspare.\n  Back in the early 1980s, I chaired a task force for New Hampshire's \nCommission on the Status of Women looking at women and employment. What \nwe found was discrimination in a whole range of areas, including, of \ncourse, pay discrimination. The conclusion of the report was that kind \nof discrimination against women does not just hurt women who are \naffected, it hurts their families, their children, their husbands, and \nit has a ripple effect throughout our economy.\n  As Governor, I signed a law to prohibit gender-based pay \ndiscrimination in New Hampshire and to require equal pay for equal \nwork. In the year before that law was signed, women in New Hampshire \nmade 69 percent of their male colleagues' wages. Today they make 78 \npercent. When President Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act into law in \n1963, women made less than 60 cents for each $1 earned by men. Today we \nmake 77 cents. So we have made some progress, but clearly we still have \na long way to go and a lot of work to do.\n  I recently heard from a woman named Marie in New Boston, NH, about \nher experience with pay discrimination. She wrote:\n\n       I worked for many years in a male-dominated company where \n     the fresh-out-of-college boys were paid substantially more \n     than I was for the same position.\n\n  She continued to recount that she actually trained these same men to \ndo their jobs, and yet she still was not paid at the same rate.\n  Since the Equal Pay Act was enacted in 1963, the gender gap impacting \nwages has only narrowed by an average of half a cent per year. So at \nthis rate, it is going to take another 45 years for that gap to close \nentirely.\n  The Paycheck Fairness Act would make commonsense updates to the law \nby requiring pay differences to be based on legitimate business \nreasons. It would also protect women whose employers try to shirk their \nresponsibilities by prohibiting employees from discussing their \nsalaries. Finally, this important legislation would create a program to \nstrengthen women and girls' negotiation skills so they can seek \ndirectly the pay they deserve.\n  It is long past time for us to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act. I urge \nall of our colleagues to support this legislation. It is bipartisan. It \nis good for women and their families, and it is good for the country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Now I would like to yield the floor for 7 minutes to our colleague \nfrom California, Senator Boxer. She and I served in the House. We serve \nin the Senate. We have been fighting this for a long time. Mr. \nPresident, I think you will find her words welcome and insightful. Her \npassion and her devotion to women is legendary. I yield 7 minutes to \nSenator Boxer.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Mikulski so much not only \nfor yielding to me but for her extraordinary leadership in the Senate \non so many issues of fairness and justice for women, for families, for \nchildren, and for our seniors. It is really a legendary record that she \nhas amassed, and this is just one more example.\n  I also thank President Obama for his leadership in calling attention \nto this important legislation, the Paycheck Fairness Act.\n  If you were to stop someone on the street and in the simplest terms \nsay: Do you think it is right to pay people differently for the same \njob? Do you think that is right--they have the same experience, the \nsame education, the same qualifications--people would say: No, that is \nnot right. Yet that is what has been happening to America's women, even \nthough we have, since the 1960s, a very important law in place that is \nsupposed to guarantee fair pay to everyone, including women. But women \nearn 77 cents for every $1 earned by a man. When you drill down to \nthose numbers, you find out in a vast number of cases they are doing \nthe same work as the man, making less.\n\n  Of course, Lilly Ledbetter made a very important point about this and \nbecame quite famous with a Supreme Court case where she had been doing \nthe same things as her male counterparts--working in a tire factory, \nbeing a manager, being skilled, being strong, and yet underpaid. When \nshe discovered it, trying to seek justice, she was unable to do so. The \nSenate stepped to the plate, and with Democrats moving forward, we \npassed the Lilly Ledbetter law, which does take care of the statute of \nlimitations. It allows you to take as long as you have to to get to \ncourt to make your case. For Lilly, it was too late, and she never was \nable to recover what she deserved.\n  So now what Senator Mikulski has done with the Paycheck Fairness Act \nis to say we are going to go the next step. We are going to make sure \nthat women have justice in the workplace, that women have rights.\n  Why is this important to families--not just to women but to families? \nIt is because over a lifetime of discrimination that so many women \nface, it is not like here where you are a Senator, you are a Senator, \nyou are a Senator, woman or man, out there it is different. When you \nare discriminated against over a lifetime and are only getting 77 \ncents--and some, by the way, only make 56 cents or 62 cents on the \ndollar--the average wage loss over a working lifetime is over $400,000. \nIf you take a look at what our families could do with $400,000--educate \na child, make sure people get the best of medical care, make sure the \nfamily has enough so they can all take a break together and have a \ndecent vacation or buy a better car--this is an issue that not only \ninvolves women but our families and our economy because, guess what, if \nthat $400,000 during a lifetime was with the family rather than the \ncorporate CEO, who is making millions,\n\n[[Page S3701]]\n\nyou would see the economy stimulated because middle-class families \nspend those dollars.\n  They do not hoard those dollars. So I am going to close by giving a \ncouple of real-life examples. Mr. President, how much time do I have \nremaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 2\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am going to tell you some real stories.\n  A woman from California had an identical advanced degree as her \nhusband. They both landed exact jobs but in different parts of the \ncompany--different worksites. The husband was offered $5,000 more in \nstarting salary. They were shocked. The same resume. The same \nqualifications.\n  Then there was the health care worker in Long Island who discovered \nshe had been earning $10 an hour less than her male colleagues. When \nshe brought it up to her superiors, she was reprimanded for even asking \nabout the rationale behind the wage gap.\n  Senator Mikulski's bill says a person cannot be reprimanded or \npunished because they are trying to find out if they are being paid \nfairly. That is why we have to pass this law. Anyone voting against it \nis taking a stand against women, is taking a stand against fairness, is \ntaking a stand against justice, is taking a stand against our families.\n  Then there was a female employee for a major corporation in Florida \nwho was told when she was hired that to disclose her salary to other \nworkers was grounds for dismissal. Since then she realized her male \ncounterparts made more than she did. But she did not have any written \nproof.\n  Another, a female employee at that company was told because her \nhusband picked her up from work in a nice car that she did not need to \nget a salary increase. One woman retired after 15 years as an award-\nwinning CEO of a public agency. Her male replacement, who had little \nexperience, was hired at a higher salary.\n  After having a child, a California woman was fired from her job at a \nnonprofit. Her replacement, a man with less experience, was given 30 \npercent more in starting salary. We have example after example after \nexample.\n  How the Republican side of the aisle could filibuster this bill is \nbeyond my imagination. I do not know what they are thinking. They will \ngive an excuse. They will come up with some excuse. They will say: Oh, \nit will hurt jobs. It will hurt this and that. It is all made up. It is \nall made up.\n  In this great Nation, when we move toward equality, we all prosper \ntogether. I urge an ``aye'' vote. I thank Senator Mikulski for this \nmoment to be able to support this important bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time for the majority has \nexpired.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, might I ask the parliamentary situation?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is now 30 minutes under the \ncontrol of the Republicans.\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, given that it is an election year, the \nAmerican people are going to hear a lot of highly charged political \nrhetoric over the next few months. They are likely already tired of \nwhat they have heard. The Arkansans I talked with during the last week \nwhile traveling the State certainly have told me that much.\n  They do not want to see the finger-pointing. They want us to fix the \nproblems we face. They are tired of the back-and-forth. They are tired \nof us seeking credit and placing blame. They see an economy in shambles \nand nobody willing to take responsibility.\n  To put it bluntly, they are frustrated. I think we all hear that \nmessage when we go home. I think we can all agree that more can and \nneeds to be done. The jobs report that came out last Friday certainly \nreinforces that. When the President pushed through his massive stimulus \npackage in 2009, he claimed unemployment would be below 6 percent \ntoday.\n  With a national unemployment rate of 8.2 percent, we are not even \nclose to 6 percent, much less below it. To make matters worse, we are \nmoving further away from the mark. This is the 40th straight month \nwhere the unemployment rate has remained above 8 percent, and 12.7 \nmillion Americans are unemployed. Millions more are underemployed. The \neconomic picture is especially troubling for young Americans looking to \nenter the workforce.\n  America has the lowest employment-to-population ratio for young \nadults since 1948. Millions of Americans who are looking for work \ncannot find it. This is unprecedented, it is unacceptable, and it is \nunsustainable.\n  The President met the report with a call for another round of \nstimulus spending. Look, we have tried that. It did not work. More of \nthe same will not work either. More government spending will not solve \nthis problem. Paying for that spending by raising taxes on small \nbusinesses, the people we are counting on to turn our economy around, \nis certainly counterintuitive.\n  When the people we are counting on to spur the recovery tell us the \ncountry is going in the wrong direction, then we should listen. In \nalmost every poll small business owners have responded that the \nuncertainty coming out of Washington is what is preventing them from \nhiring. Quite simply, they fear what the next wave of regulations is \ngoing to be and the proposed taxes, what that will do to their ability \nto grow their business.\n  Small business owners are afraid to invest any capital because they \ndo not know what their taxes will be. They are afraid to hire another \nemployee because they are nervous about what that will do to their \nhealth care costs and afraid to expand until they know how big their \nenergy bill is going to be.\n  Washington has to change course. My colleagues and I have a better \npath to a healthy economy that restores economic security and \nopportunity. Our market-based reforms are focused on creating a \nhealthier environment for businesses to hire and to expand. We want to \ncut through regulations instead of adding more. We want to fix the Tax \nCode to incentivize hiring instead of passing the tab for more wasteful \nspending on to small business.\n  We want to reduce their costs by encouraging the production of \ndomestic sources of energy instead of driving costs up by continuing \nour reliance on other countries for our needs. Three years of trying to \ntax and spend our way out of this problem has not worked. The American \npeople are rightfully frustrated.\n  All we are saying is we tried the President's way and it has not \nworked. Let's try our market-based approach. But here is where we run \ninto the old election-year problem. Ever since the numbers were \nreleased, all the media has been talking about is what the report means \nin terms of the Presidential election. This, in turn, has Washington \ndigging in deeper to its respective trenches. That angle of the story \nmisses the most important part. This is about more than numbers, more \nthan a report, more than a political talking point. It is real people, \nall of whom are looking to Washington for help. It is past time we \nstarted fighting for them instead of for our political futures.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of equal pay for \nequal work. The importance of women in the workplace is clear to every \nAmerican. We all have women in families who have been a proud part of \nthe workforce. For two decades my mother worked hard in a school \ncafeteria. My wife, a substitute teacher, has long been part of \nNevada's workforce. My oldest daughter, in this economy, was fortunate \nenough to get a job after graduating from college just a few years ago. \nMy youngest daughter, 16, recently got a summer job at a local food \nlot. Sixty percent of my Senate staff is female.\n  America is a land of opportunity, and Americans are equally united \nagainst discrimination in any form. If my mother, my wife, or my \ndaughters experienced workplace discrimination based on their gender, I \nwould be the first to come to their defense and ensure any inequities \nwere addressed.\n  Congress passed the Equal Pay Act in 1963 to ensure every individual \nreceived equal pay for equal work regardless of gender. It is a strict \nliability statute that requires evidence of intent to discriminate. If \nthere is evidence of intentional discrimination, appropriate remedies, \nincluding punitive and compensatory damages are available under the \nCivil Rights Act.\n  Let me be clear: Pay discrimination based upon gender is \nunacceptable. Despite the political rhetoric around here, everyone \nagrees on this fact.\n\n[[Page S3702]]\n\n  The question is, Will the Paycheck Fairness Act actually address \nworkplace inequality? The simple answer is no. Unfortunately, the only \nwinners under this legislation would be trial lawyers, giving them a \nwindfall, exposing employers to unlimited punitive damages.\n  This legislation opens the door to frivolous lawsuits which already \ncost our economy billions of dollars every year. Legitimate cases that \ncould be addressed under the current system would be lost in a flood of \nlawsuits initiated by lawyers hoping to win a few large judgments.\n  These lawsuits, if successful, could transfer billions of dollars \nfrom employers to trial lawyers. In an economy already marked by \nuncertainty, this legislation would surely mean lost jobs, limitations \non benefits, and pay cuts. These changes would mean much harder times \nahead for Nevada's unemployed and underemployed, so many of whom are \nwomen.\n  Instead of a trial lawyer bailout, let's address the issue of equal \npay. Instead of holding votes designed for press releases, let's \nactually work to solve our Nation's problems. Congress can strengthen \nthe Equal Pay Act without handing trial lawyers a blank check.\n  The Wall Street Journal today referred to this legislation as ``a \ntrial lawyer doozy just in time for the 2012 election ads.'' It goes on \nto say the bill ought to be called the ``Trial Lawyer Paycheck Act,'' \nsince it is a recipe for a class action boom. The law automatically \nlists women as plaintiffs in class actions when lawyers sue employers, \nthereby requiring female employees to opt out of litigation with which \nthey do not agree.\n  Businesses would be treated as guilty until they are shown to be \ninnocent. You cannot be projobs and antibusiness. This is just another \nexample of the Democrats' war on free enterprise while Americans suffer \nwith joblessness and underemployment.\n  In fact, under this President there are 766,000 more women unemployed \ntoday than when he took office. I truly wish today's discussion was \nabout leveling the playing field, truly ensuring pay equality and \nimproving the economy. But years-old legislation mired in politics will \nnot get us any closer to either ending gender discrimination in the \nworkplace or ensuring that all women who want a job have a job.\n  This proposal could not pass when Democrats controlled both Chambers \nof Congress. Yet here we are today voting on the same measure again and \nagain. Those who are actually victims of workplace discrimination are \nonly getting lipservice from Washington. Like many of my colleagues, I \nworry about this proposal that will only increase litigation and do \nlittle to actually address the problems of pay inequality.\n  Advancements in pay parity have been made, but more needs to be done. \nCongress would better serve the hard-working women of our Nation if we \nfocused on solutions that have actually worked. To this end, I have \nintroduced the End Pay Discrimination Through Information Act. This \nlegislation would protect employees who are trying to determine whether \nthey are experiencing pay discrimination.\n  No one in this body should be so naive to say that pay discrimination \nhas been eradicated. What we need to do is ensure that employees can \nfind the information they need to determine whether they have a \nlegitimate claim against their employer. The End Pay Discrimination \nThrough Information Act provides antiretaliation and whistleblower \nprotections which both sides should be able to agree upon. My \nlegislation is a solution within the existing framework of our legal \nsystem that does not provide a handout to trial lawyers as the \nunderlying bill would do. My bill also recognizes the role of women in \nAmerica's workforce and the fact that an increasing number of U.S. \nhouseholds depend upon the income of working women.\n  My legislation states that ``equal pay for equal work is a principle \nand practice that should be observed by all employers.'' Every day \nworking women are going above and beyond, balancing their \nresponsibilities at home and at work to provide for their families. The \nleast we can do is ensure that employers who intentionally discriminate \non the basis of sex should be held accountable for their wrongdoing.\n  I believe my bill is a reasonable bipartisan step in the right \ndirection. Instead of bringing up legislation that has failed in the \npast and will in the future, this Congress needs to give our Nation the \neconomic certainty needed to create good-paying jobs so hard-working \nwomen across this country will be able to provide for their families \nand achieve the career successes they deserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The Senator from Kansas.\n\n\n                            Medical Research\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, throughout history, medical research has \nbeen responsible for hundreds of groundbreaking discoveries that have \nimproved and saved lives, enabled health care to become more effective \nand efficient, and lowered overall health care costs.\n  May was National Cancer Research Month, and I wish to take a few \nminutes and recognize the importance of medical research and the \ninvaluable contributions made by scientists, doctors, and researchers \nacross the United States who are working not only to overcome cancer \nbut many other devastating diseases.\n  With decades of research, cancer mortality rates have steadily \ndeclined since 1990, and today more than 12 million Americans are \ncancer survivors. In fact, the number of survivors have quadrupled \nsince the mid-1970s, and the overall 5-year survival rate for all \ncancers has improved to more than 65 percent.\n  Decades of research and technological advances have brought us into a \nnew era of medical care for cancer. We can now sequence all the genes \nof a tumor and use that information to determine the biological causes \nof cancer. This greater understanding of the causes of cancer has led \nto advances in prevention, early detection, and treatment that have \nsaved countless lives.\n  Despite significant advances in research over the last few decades, \nmuch work remains to be done. More than 1.5 million Americans are \nexpected to be diagnosed this year with cancer. It is estimated that \none out of every three women and one out of every two men will develop \ncancer during their lifetime. In America, cancer is still the leading \ncause of death.\n  But history demonstrates that with a strong commitment to medical \nresearch, we can change these statistics not only for cancer patients \nbut for many other patients as well. Congress's longstanding bipartisan \nsupport of the National Institutes of Health has been an integral part \nof establishing the United States as a world leader in research and \ninnovation.\n  NIH is the focal point of our Nation's medical research and plays a \ncritical role in laying the groundwork for the private sector to \ndevelop new drugs and treatments for cancer and other diseases.\n  I have seen firsthand how medical research at NIH is being translated \ninto new treatments with a visit to the NIH Clinical Center in \nBethesda, MD, which is the Nation's largest hospital devoted to \nclinical research.\n  The Center is uniquely designed to enable researchers to work \ndirectly alongside a wide range of specialists who deliver the best \npossible care to patients with the most advanced treatments available. \nThis powerful arrangement has led to a long list of revolutionary \nmedical discoveries, including chemotherapy for cancer, the first tests \nto detect AIDS/HIV, and the first treatment of AIDS.\n  Medical research leading to successful discoveries often takes years, \nrequiring the institutional knowledge and intellect of numerous highly \nqualified, committed researchers. Given the vast amount of progress \nmade over the last century and the great potential current research \nholds, we must not waiver on America's commitment to advancing disease \ncures and treatments.\n  If researchers cannot rely on consistent support from Congress, we \nwill squander current progress, stunt America's global competitiveness, \nand lose younger generations of doctors and scientists to alternative \ncareer paths. Our Nation's researchers and scientists must know \nCongress supports their work and will ensure they have the resources \nneeded to carry out their important work.\n  The next century holds great promise for future discoveries. By \ninvesting in\n\n[[Page S3703]]\n\nmedical research, we are investing in our future.\n  In Kansas, the bioscience industry has grown at a faster rate than \nthe national sector since 2001. This growth opens the doors for new \nmedical and technological advancements.\n  Kansas has already become a leader in advancing biomedical and \nbioscience research. One example of this is the University of Kansas \nCancer Center in Kansas City, which has formally applied to the \nNational Cancer Institute to become an NCI-designated cancer center.\n  The National Cancer Institute is a component of NIH, and it is our \nNation's principal agency for cancer research and training. Obtaining \nNCI designation would dramatically enhance the KU Cancer Center's \nability to discover, develop, and deliver innovative treatments to \npatients in our State, improving their quality of life.\n  Currently, there are no NCI-designated centers in Kansas. With that \nNCI designation, KU Cancer Center patients would have access to the \nlatest clinical trials and the most advanced cancer treatments close to \nhome.\n  Because NCI designation is the highest recognition for an academic \ncancer center, KU Cancer Center would also be in a better position to \nrecruit the best and brightest researchers and scientists to develop \ncutting-edge treatments and cures in Kansas.\n  In addition to saving and improving lives, medical research helps \ncreate thousands of jobs and drives economic growth across our country. \nNIH directly supports 350,000 jobs nationwide and indirectly drives \nmore than 6 million jobs across our country.\n  Medical research also lowers costs by advancing treatments to \nchronic, debilitating diseases and improving early detection and \nwellness promotion. During a Senate Appropriations health subcommittee \nhearing last year, I asked NIH Director Francis Collins to explain how \nmedical research at NIH could reduce health care spending. In his \nresponse, Dr. Collins pointed to the potential impact of medical \nresearch on Alzheimer's.\n  Today, annual costs related to Alzheimer's disease are roughly $180 \nbillion, and those numbers are expected to rise to roughly $1 trillion \nby 2050. However, medical research leading to treatments that delay the \nonset of Alzheimer's disease could not only bring a better quality of \nlife to thousands of families but also save billions of dollars.\n  Medical research has changed the lives of millions of Americans and \nhas the potential to impact millions more because the possibilities are \nendless. But in order to plan for the future, scientists and \nresearchers need certainty.\n  Today, Congress faces the difficult task of identifying our \ngovernment's funding priorities, while at the same time righting our \nNation's fiscal course. I will continue to advocate for fiscal \nresponsibility, and I will also prioritize programs that effectively \nserve the American people.\n  Our consistent, sustained support of medical research is essential to \nsaving and improving lives, growing our economy, and maintaining \nAmerica's role as a global leader in medical innovation. This \ncommitment will benefit our children and our country for generations to \ncome. Most important, it will give us what we all desire, which is \nhope.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, how much time remains on the minority \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 50 seconds remaining.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Has all time expired on the minority side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I now yield 5 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Delaware, Mr. Coons. The women of the Senate welcome those men who \nstand with us on this very important battle, and Senator Coons has been \nan outstanding advocate on this and other economic empowerment issues \nrelated to women, such as safety in the workplace and sexual \nharassment.\n  I yield the Senator 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Paycheck \nFairness Act, legislation to ensure the women of this country earn \nequal pay for equal work. I am grateful to Senator Mikulski--and many \nof our cosponsors--for her strong and able leadership on this important \nbill, S. 3220, which we will take up later this afternoon.\n  The principle of equal pay for equal work is a simple, powerful \nprinciple of basic fairness. In this year of 2012, no one should earn \nless for doing the same job just because of their gender. This \nlegislation is an important step forward. It would plug holes and make \ncritical changes in the law that would ensure the promise of equal pay \nthat was first enshrined in our law decades ago.\n  This legislation will deter wage discrimination by closing loopholes \nin the Equal Pay Act and bar retaliation against workers who disclose \ntheir wages to colleagues. Knowledge is power, Mr. President. Women who \ndon't know their male coworkers are earning more for doing the same job \ncan't speak up and demand to be treated fairly.\n  My wife Annie and I are raising three wonderful children, all of whom \nare equally bright and driven and capable. As any parent knows, one of \nthe phrases we hear more than any other from our own children is, \n``That is not fair.'' When we pick out one for more entertainment or \nmore opportunity, for more travel or more close family time, the first \nthing we hear from their siblings is, ``But, Dad, that is just not \nfair.'' As Annie and I raise our wonderful twin boys and our tremendous \nand talented daughter, we try as best we can to be fair. Yet I know my \ndaughter Maggie, like other women and girls all across our country, \nwill earn less than her brothers even if she chooses the exact same \ncareer track. That is just not fair. That is unacceptable. That \nviolates our bedrock belief as a country in equality of opportunity and \nthe American dream that if people work hard, nothing will stand in the \nway of their success.\n  I am hopeful by the time my daughter Maggie enters the workforce we \nwill have reduced or ended the gender pay gap in this country. I \nbelieve by then our Nation's economy will be back to full strength. But \nthe fact is thousands of families across my home State of Delaware, the \nPresiding Officer's home State of West Virginia, and my neighboring \nState of Maryland can't afford to wait for things to get better in the \neconomy and in our legal system. They are struggling right now to pay \ntheir bills every month, and unfair pay discrimination adds to their \nburden.\n  Women in Delaware, on average, earn 81 cents for every dollar paid to \nmen. Over their lifetime that means they will earn nearly $\\1/2\\ \nmillion--or $464,000--less than their male counterparts. Women make up \njust a shade under half of Delaware's workforce, and close to 40 \npercent of married, employed mothers in Delaware are their families' \nprimary wage earners. When women are paid less than men for doing \nexactly the same job, it hurts whole families. Over 135,000 children in \nDelaware live in households that depend on their mothers' earnings.\n  I heard from one of those mothers--Patricia from Dagsboro, DE. She \nwrote to my office urging me to support this legislation. She wrote:\n\n       Without my paycheck, we could not have afforded to pay for \n     the college tuition for two of our children. If I had been \n     paid equally for equal work, experience and education, it is \n     likely neither of them would have had to take out student \n     loans to make ends meet.\n\n  Patricia urged me to support the Paycheck Fairness Act.\n  Mr. President, paycheck fairness has wide-ranging consequences--from \ncovering the cost of higher education to mortgage payments to everyday \nbills and consumer spending. Income earned by women is a key driver, a \nkey contributor to our economy.\n  Some on this floor have attributed the pay gap to differing \npriorities or to the idea that some women choose to work fewer hours in \norder to spend\n\n[[Page S3704]]\n\nmore time with their families or to meet their family care commitment. \nBut the facts simply do not bear out this theory. Women earn less \nstarting the very moment they graduate from school, before they have \nmade any choices about family or worklife balance. That shows us pay \ndiscrimination is real. Study after study has shown it is pervasive \nand, in my view and that of many of my colleagues, it needs to finally \nbe stopped.\n  The gender pay gap persists across all occupations and educational \nlevels. But it is especially hard on minorities and female-headed \nhouseholds, which are much more likely, as a consequence, to be low \nincome. The consequences of the gender pay gap remain even when a woman \nstops working because after a lifetime of lower earnings, the average \nSocial Security benefit for American women under 65 is about $12,000 \ncompared to $16,000 for men of the same age.\n  If I might say, in conclusion, then, Mr. President, there is not a \nMember of this body who would dispute women are just as educated, just \nas trained, just as capable in so many ways as their male colleagues \nacross our whole society and there should be no difference in the \nequality of the pay they receive for that work.\n  I support the Paycheck Fairness Act because it will help women fight \nfor the equal pay they have earned, and I urge my colleagues to do the \nsame.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I wish to yield time to the Senator from \nNorth Carolina, Mrs. Hagan.\n  Senator Hagan is a freshman Senator, but she is certainly not new to \nthis issue. Both in North Carolina's legislative body and in the Senate \nher work has always been for the economic empowerment of women, \nespecially those women who stand every day and do those jobs requiring \nstanding on their feet and at the end of the day have earned less pay \nand will get less in their pensions. As they stand for work, she stands \nfor them on the Senate floor.\n  I yield Senator Hagan 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I certainly want to congratulate Senator \nMikulski for all the hard work she has done, not only on this bill but \non all the bills on which she has worked so hard on behalf of women in \nour country. I applaud her for her efforts.\n  I join with my colleagues to discuss an issue that affects women and \nfamilies across America every day; it is the wage gap. Almost 50 years \nhave passed since the Equal Pay Act was signed into law, and the wage \ngap between men and women remains wide today. It is time to bring the \nwages of women in line with those of their male counterparts.\n  I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the Paycheck Fairness Act. \nYet some question why we need this bill. Well, the numbers make it \npretty clear. Women in the United States earn 77 cents for every dollar \nthat men earn. In North Carolina, it is a little better but not equal. \nWomen earn 81 cents for every dollar earned by men doing the same work, \nthe same job. Over the course of 1 year, women in North Carolina \nexperience nearly $8,000 in lost wages. That is $8,000 from what her \nmale counterparts earn.\n  With that $8,000, a woman could spend for her family an extra $110 a \nweek on groceries for 73 weeks. She could buy another 2,200 gallons of \ngas at $3.60 a gallon. If women were paid the same as men for the same \nwork, these are just a few of the expenses they would be able to afford \nmore easily.\n  The wage gap is not isolated in one industry either. It exists across \nvirtually every sector of our economy. The wage gap exists regardless \nof education level. In many cases, the most educated women are paid \nless for the same work, and it exists regardless of a woman's personal \nchoices, such as becoming a mother. Working mothers should not pay a \npenalty for having children.\n  A group in North Carolina called MomsRising told me in the last few \nmonths they have heard from women across the State--from Wilmington, \nfrom Durham, from Greensboro, and from Raleigh--that once these women \nactually had children, they got overlooked for promotions, overlooked \nfor pay raises, and overlooked for the projects on which they wanted to \nwork. However, this collective group of women are afraid to speak out \nabout their wage discrimination because in this economy they are \nworried about getting fired from the job they need to support their \nfamilies.\n  Yesterday I met with women and small business owners in Charlotte to \ndiscuss the Paycheck Fairness Act. My visit with those fantastic women \nreinforced for me the importance of this bill, the Paycheck Fairness \nAct. One woman brought her young son with her to the event and they \nboth wore T-shirts that each had a number on the front. The mom's shirt \nsaid 94 and the son's shirt said 50. If earnings continue at the slow \npace they are going now, those numbers signify the ages that mom and \nthat son will be when pay equality is achieved in our country. Sadly, \nat the rate we are going, most of us in the Senate will not live to see \nthat day.\n\n  This wage gap has real consequences, not just for women but for their \nchildren too. In North Carolina alone, women head over 500,000 \nhouseholds. The economic security of women and families is put at risk \nwhen they are paid less than men for performing the same jobs. Later \ntoday I will be voting to help close this gap, to help bring the wages \nof women in line with those of their male counterparts. I am hopeful \nthat petty partisan gamesmanship does not get in the way of a \nbipartisan issue that both Democrats and Republicans, men and women, \noverwhelmingly support.\n  In a recent poll, 81 percent of men and 87 percent of women supported \nhaving a law to provide women more tools to get fair pay in the \nworkplace. This poll also showed support for such a law from 77 percent \nof Republicans and 87 percent of Independents and 91 percent of \nDemocrats. With such widespread approval, we should be able to address \nthis issue right away.\n  We need Paycheck Fairness to prohibit employers from retaliating \nagainst employees who discuss salary information with their coworkers. \nWe need Paycheck Fairness to strengthen the legal remedies available \nfor women to ensure they can be compensated for pay discrimination. We \nneed Paycheck Fairness to provide businesses, especially small ones, \nassistance with equal pay practices.\n  On the eve of the anniversary of the Equal Pay Act, we need to close \nthe loopholes that allow pay discrimination to happen. The Paycheck \nFairness Act would do just that by helping women successfully fight for \nfull pay.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. I ask unanimous consent for 30 additional seconds.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I yield the Senator an additional 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Equal pay for equal work to me is just basic common \nsense. I hope this body can come together to address this disparity \nthat exists in North Carolina and around our country.\n  I again thank Senator Mikulski for the work she is doing on behalf of \nthis very important bill that is truly going to make a difference in \nthe lives of women throughout our country, as well as their families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The Senator from Maryland is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, this is time for both Republicans and \nDemocrats to speak. We invite our Republican colleagues to come and \nspeak. Even within the Republican Party, we know there are those who \nagree with us and those who do not. For those who agree, we would love \nto hear their voices. For those who do not, let's have a debate. Let's \ntake a look at what are some of the issues being raised as a criticism \nof the bill. We are ready to talk about it.\n  I have heard some of the most outrageous things on cable TV about why \nwe should not pass this bill. One was accusing us that this will \nundermine small business. Small business has protections under the \nEqual Pay Act. Under the existing law--which this would not change--the \nEqual Pay Act\n\n[[Page S3705]]\n\nalready exempted small businesses that make less than $500,000 in \nannual revenue per year. It keeps the Equal Pay Act exemption intact.\n  We also have the support of the U.S. Women's Chamber of Commerce. \nThis is a chamber of commerce of small business owners. They support \nthis bill. So we do not believe that is a valid argument.\n  There is another argument going around that for some reason if we \npass the Paycheck Fairness Act, somehow or another, we are going to \nlower the wages men make. That is absolutely one of the most \nridiculous, rhetorical, twist-and-turn arguments. It is not factual and \nit is not legal. It is illegal now to remedy wage discrimination by \nreducing wages of other employees. I will quote--it is illegal under \nthe other labor protection laws--and I don't mean labor such as in \nunion, I mean labor such as in workers--it is illegal to remedy wage \ndiscrimination by reducing wages of other employees.\n  The Paycheck Fairness Act doesn't alter any other affirmative defense \navailable to employers. Employers may still pay different wages to male \nor female employees if it is based on seniority or quality of \nproduction. If someone is a guy on an assembly line and he makes more \nhubcaps than women, fine. But we find that is no longer true in the \ninformation age economy.\n  Equal pay, I wish to say again, is not only a women's issue, it is a \nfamily issue. Sometimes we find we are discriminated against by great \nguys at the water cooler who tell us where it is. What people need to \nknow is that right now it is legal to fire someone if they make an \ninquiry about how much they are making and how much their male \ncounterpart is making. It is illegal or they can be subject to all \nkinds of harassment and humiliation.\n  You ought to hear some of the horror stories we hear from women just \nbecause they wanted to know: George, how much are you making?\n  We thank the good men who supported us. They have often been business \nwhistleblowers, where they told us what they are making. They know we \nare working just as hard. We worked as hard to get the education to do \nthe job, we worked that hard on the job, but we continue to have to \nwork hard to get equal pay for equal work.\n  I wish to make it clear once again, this legislation will not result \nin a lower paycheck for men.\n  There is also a bona fide question, which is: Why are we doing \npaycheck fairness? Didn't we solve these issues in Lilly Ledbetter? \nPaycheck fairness was a downpayment on this because it kept the \ncourthouse door open. Paycheck fairness makes it harder to discriminate \nin the first place. Right now, as I said, employers have the ability to \nretaliate against workers who share salary information. Ledbetter did \nnot address this issue. Paycheck fairness does. Women can now, under \nPaycheck Fairness, sue for punitive damages. Lilly Ledbetter did not \naddress this. This would deal with that.\n  There are a variety of things I can elaborate on, but I see one of \nthe real champions for justice, civil rights, and the empowerment--\nespecially the economic empowerment--of women, my colleague from \nMichigan, Senator Stabenow. I yield Senator Stabenow 7 minutes and \nthank her for her longstanding advocacy and work. She has raised her \nvoice for those who often do not have a voice in high places of power.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, first, let me say thank you to the \nchampion. We have just been hearing from the champion, not only in the \nSenate but in the Congress, on so many issues that have led to \nempowerment for women and equality for all people to have a chance to \nsucceed in our economy. Certainly, whether it is preventive health for \nwomen or the Paycheck Fairness Act, I thank Senator Mikulski for \nleading the way and being the person we look to. I am proud to stand \nwith Senator Mikulski on the floor of the Senate.\n  Since our founding, our country has been a destination for those who \nseek equal treatment and equal opportunity. Across the world, America \nis known as the land of opportunity. I am very proud we have that \nlabel. Our hard work and ingenuity built the country, brick by brick, \ncity by city. My home State of Michigan was right in the middle of it--\nbuilding the tools, the vehicles that built our country and that, \nfrankly, built the middle class of our country. Those looking for new \nopportunity, those with entrepreneurial spirit have always been welcome \nhere in America.\n  People still make the journey to this country in search of a better \nlife. We tell the world that everyone has equal opportunity, that if \nthey put in just as much hard work as their neighbor, they will earn a \ndecent living and be able to provide for their family. But that is only \nhalf true. Everyone can work hard, everyone can be successful, but for \nsome reason it is acceptable that women do not need to be paid as much \nas men for the exact same work. This is unacceptable. That is what this \nlegislation is all about.\n  Nationally, women make 77 cents for every $1 a man makes for the \nexact same job. In Michigan, the numbers are even worse. Women make 74 \ncents on every $1 for the exact same job. I received countless letters \nfrom constituents describing how this affects their lives and their \nfamilies' lives. Teresa from Detroit is a single mom with two \ndaughters. One daughter is in college. Teresa tries to help her out as \nmuch as she can, but she gets paid less than her male coworkers for \ndoing the same work so it is tough.\n  Pamela from Romulus, MI, is the sole breadwinner in her house, \nsupporting her husband who is a disabled Vietnam veteran and their \nchildren. She works at a corporation and took over a man's job. Then \nthe company changed the title so they could pay her less.\n  Craig from Lowell wrote in to tell me his story. By the way, this is \na common story in Michigan over the last number of years. He lost his \njob in 2008 because of the recession. His wife had to support their \nentire family of four. The family had to go on food assistance, \nsomething they never thought in their wildest dreams they would have to \ndo because Craig's wife has been working at the same company for 23 \nyears but has not gotten a raise in the last 4 years and makes several \ndollars an hour less than her male counterparts.\n  Melissa from Ann Arbor is the sole breadwinner in a family of four. \nShe figured out if she were paid the same as her male colleagues, she \nwould take home an extra $1,000 a month after taxes. She said that \n$1,000 would make her family more stable and let Melissa and her \nhusband take her children on trips, give them new opportunities, allow \nthem to be enrolled in sports and save for retirement--that extra $1000 \na month.\n  Cheryl from Okemos has had to take a second job just to make as much \nas her male counterparts at her day job, and it has cut down on how \nmuch time she can spend with her family. She has a second job just so \nshe can make as much as her colleagues who work one job--she has two \njobs. The tradeoff for her is as a mom spending less time with her \nfamily. She is able to feed and clothe their children, but she says she \nis missing out on watching them grow up--also a very important value we \ntalk about all the time on the floor of the Senate, in terms of values \nfor families.\n  Linda from South Lyon wrote about her lifetime of being discriminated \nagainst just because she is a woman. Over her career she has \nconsistently made less than men in the same industry with the same job \ndescription. One executive even told her he only hires women because \nthey work harder and he can pay them less. They work harder, but he \nshould not be able to pay them less.\n  Sandra from Marshall has worked as an engineer at the same company \nfor 28 years. She has been rated as one of the company's best \nperformers. Despite this, she has never risen to the level where she \nearns bonuses and a better pension--a level in her company that is \ndominated by men. She has countless people she has hired and trained \nand watched them pass her by. These stories are real.\n\n  Jennifer, from the west side of Michigan, is a university teacher and \nathletic coach. She was the head coach of a varsity women's team and \ntaught six classes. She saw men in the same position make more money \nwhile they taught fewer classes. She watched them receive tenure with \nmaster's degrees while she was required to work toward a Ph.D. to be \neligible for the\n\n[[Page S3706]]\n\nsame tenure. She was denied tenure despite good performance \nevaluations. Yet a male assistant coach at the university was given \ntenure without a Ph.D. because he had a family. These are real stories.\n  This is about families, economic opportunities, and security for \nfamilies. America is known as the land of opportunity, and people still \nmake the journey to our great country in search of a better life. \nEveryone has an equal chance to work hard and everyone can be \nsuccessful, but not everyone gets the same opportunity to be \nsuccessful.\n  Women in Michigan make 74 cents for every dollar a man earns for the \nexact same job. There are so many families in Michigan struggling right \nnow. It should not be harder on them just because the primary \nbreadwinners are women. It is just not right.\n  Middle-class families need economic security, and that is why we need \nthe Paycheck Fairness Act. We have made strides to move forward. This \nis not complicated. It is not rocket science. It is very simple. This \nis about equal pay for equal work. We talk the talk all the time. It is \ntime to walk the walk and to pass this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nIllinois and thank him for his persistent advocacy on this issue. \nSenator Durbin was one of the people in public leadership who said we \nhave to really address this as we approach the 49th anniversary of the \nEqual Pay Act. We thank the Senator for his work, and we thank him for \nhis voice today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me just say to those who are following \nthis debate, if we go to the dictionary and look up the word \n``persistent,'' there will be a picture of Senator Barbara Mikulski of \nMaryland. She has been our leader on so many important issues.\n  The very first bill signed by President Barack Obama--and she \nremembers the day, as I do--we were standing there when he signed the \nLilly Ledbetter law, which protected the principle of equal pay for \nequal work by allowing workers to pursue pay discrimination cases \nbeyond the arbitrary, unreasonable window that had been set up by the \nSupreme Court. When President Obama signed that first bill, his first \nbill as President of the United States, he handed the first pen of that \nsigning to Senator Barbara Mikulski. It was entirely appropriate. No \none has dedicated more of her professional and public life to this \ncause of justice than Senator Mikulski.\n  It is nearly 50 years after the passage of the Equal Pay Act. Now we \nhave to ask ourselves, well, how are things going in America when it \ncomes to equal pay? It turns out that when it comes to the managerial \npositions of women and men, women make 81 cents for every dollar paid \nto a man when they are managers of a business. According to the U.S. \nCensus Bureau, the gap grows larger--77 cents for your daughter as \nopposed to a dollar for your son--when you look at the entire working \npopulation. As the father of a daughter and a son, that is unfair.\n  According to the Joint Economic Committee, on average, women in my \nState of Illinois earn about 78 cents for every dollar paid to a man. \nWhat does that add up to over a lifetime? That adds up to over $480,000 \nin wages that are denied to a woman who is doing exactly the same work \nas a man. That is money that could be used to pay the mortgage, to buy \nthe groceries, to put kids through school, and maybe even fill the gas \ntank. That money is denied to women day after day, week after week, \nmonth after month because of basic discrimination in the workplace.\n  We cannot ignore this gender wage gap. It is too large and, \nunfortunately, shrinking too slowly. The Paycheck Fairness Act--when we \nhave a chance to vote on it--will narrow that pay gap by clarifying \nthat the difference between a man and a woman is not an adequate reason \nto differentiate pay. It also guarantees that women facing \ndiscrimination have access to the same remedies under the law as men \nand, under the law, as are afforded to racial and ethnic groups based \non discrimination.\n  I am afraid to say it--and I hope I am wrong--that this afternoon \nwhen the rollcall is taken, it will be a partisan rollcall. There will \nbe Democrats in favor of ending this discrimination, and virtually all \nRepublicans--and I hope I am wrong about this--are going to vote \nagainst it.\n  Instead, the Republicans want to bring a different bill to the floor. \nI am not going to dwell on it other than to say that I like Senator \nRubio, he is a friend of mine from Florida, but his bill is a very bad \nidea. It is called the RAISE Act. Simply stated, it innocently says \nthat an employer who is party to a collective bargaining agreement with \na union would be allowed to give a unilateral pay raise to selected \nemployees of that employer's choice. Well, who is against a pay raise? \nSo you take a closer look at it. What it does is it allows managers and \nemployers to pick and choose among employees for these pay raises and, \nsadly, without any basis other than their personal decision. I am \nafraid I know where that leads. Unfortunately, it leads to the same \nkind of wage discrimination we see today between men and women. It may \nlead to nepotism. It may lead to kind of favorable treatment for some \nemployees for reasons that have nothing to do with the workplace. This \nsounds so innocent, but it is not.\n  Under current law, unions and employers can agree to link pay \nincreases and bonuses to performance, and that is the way it should be. \nIn fact, many collective bargaining agreements already provide for \nmerit-based pay increases. The Rubio approach is not good news for \nworkers across America. It is no help to women across America facing \nwage discrimination.\n  This is not the first time or the only time we have had these battles \nof gender equity on the floor of the Senate on the question of whether \nwe are going to have basic funding for health care for women across \nAmerica. For over 40 years, we have been committed to title 10, and yet \nwe have faced the elimination of title 10 funding from the Republican \nleadership in the past. In fact, they threatened to shut down the \ngovernment rather than provide this health care that women need. Many \ncan remember a few weeks back on the Senate floor when Senator Blunt of \nMissouri filed an amendment to the Transportation bill allowing any \nemployer or insurance company to deny health insurance for any \nessential or preventive health care service that the employer objected \nto because of his undefined religious or moral convictions. They \ncould--for any reason--deny health coverage to an employee. Well, we \ndefeated the Blunt of Missouri amendment. It was another attempt to try \nto give employers a way to discriminate against employees and, in many \ncases, against the women who work for them.\n\n  We have tried our very best to push through bipartisan legislation, \nsuch as the Violence Against Women Act, which in the past has passed \noverwhelmingly by a voice vote. Have you visited a domestic violence \nshelter? Have you seen a woman who has been a victim of domestic \nviolence? I have. In Champagne, IL, a woman sitting across the table \nfrom me had a baby on her lap and had a big black eye. She had been \npunched in the face by her husband, and she came to the shelter looking \nfor a helping hand. You can't look into the teary-eyed face of a mother \nand think that this is not a good cause and a just cause. Instead, it \nturned out to be a political battle here as to whether we were going to \npass the Violence Against Women Act. We did, and I am glad we did. It \nstalled over in the House of Representatives because they refused to \nmove that forward so we could provide this kind of protection.\n  Time and time again, the basic legislation to protect women, \nfamilies, and children used to be done on a bipartisan basis, used to \nbe done unanimously, with supporters from both sides of the aisle, and \nit has now turned into partisan political bickering. Let's hope that \nwhen it comes to this bill, this question of fairness in the paychecks \nof women and men across America, that maybe I will be just flatout \nwrong. Maybe at 2:30 we are going to see a return to that thrilling era \nin the Senate history when Democrats and Republicans stood together for \nfairness and justice. We will give our colleagues a chance at 2:30.\n\n[[Page S3707]]\n\n  I thank Senator Mikulski for bringing this important and historic \nmatter to the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I now yield 5 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Louisiana, who chairs the Small Business Committee and really \nknows the impact of the economic issues related to the empowerment of \nwomen. She has worked on a bipartisan basis on this issue. Hopefully, \nshe will comment on how this bill will have no negative impact on small \nbusinesses.\n  I yield to Senator Landrieu for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, let me begin by acknowledging the \nleadership of the Senator from Maryland and the other Senators who have \ncome to the floor this morning to speak on behalf of a bill whose time \nhas come and, some might say, a bill whose time has passed. It has been \nalmost 50 years since the original gender equity in the workplace bill \nwas passed, and it has not been modernized in over five decades. So, in \nlarge measure, this is really a bill whose time has come, and we hope \nto make that law happen in the next few weeks. With support from both \nDemocrats and Republicans and by putting common sense and heart and \ncompassion and good business sense, might I say, before political \ntalking points, this, in fact, could be done.\n  The reason this bill is so important is because 50 years ago women \nwere not major breadwinners in families. As the Presiding Officer \nknows, there was tremendous hiring discrimination against women and \nminorities. Happily, that seems to be passing and fading. There are \nwomen now at the highest ranks of corporate America. We have had women \nserving in the highest positions here in Washington, DC, and around our \ncountry. While there still is a gap that can be recognized both in the \nprivate and public sector, the ability for women, with the right \ncredentials and the right background, to get hired is easier today and \nis happening more than ever before.\n  The problem is that when we look at the wage gap, unfortunately, it \nstill persists. With women now in many instances being the major \nbreadwinners in their families, this is really a family issue. It is \npaying some families much less than others based on the fact that there \nis a woman as the breadwinner instead of a man. That is hurting \nfamilies throughout America. It is not fair, and it should not be \ntolerated. That is why this bill, introduced by Senator Mikulski and \ncosponsored by many of us, is important.\n  Wage discrimination is against the law and it has been for 50 years, \nbut the consequences and the actions individuals can take if they feel \nas though they are being discriminated against are, in effect, \ndifferent and not where they need to be. So this law updates the Equal \nPay Act that was passed in 1963 to basically put the final nail in the \ncoffin of wage discrimination.\n  In 1967 women only earned 58 cents to every dollar a man earned in an \nequal--in an exact--position. That was grossly unfair, but it is still \nunfair today that women in the same job are still making only 77 cents \nfor every dollar a man earns. It is not right, and it must be \ncorrected. We can correct it by passing this law that gives people who \nbelieve they are being discriminated against better access to the court \nand, might I say, it also gives businesses that potentially are the \nones being sued--even small companies or large companies--more \nprotections in this bill than other businesses have in similar \ndiscrimination cases. In other words, frivolous lawsuits will not be \nallowed, and if a case is not strong, there is a screen that is tighter \nin this bill than in other pieces of legislation.\n  I realize there is some opposition from the business community that \ncontends that this bill will simply usher in more controversy or more \ncourtroom time. But the fact is that is exactly the way our system was \ncreated. Congress passes laws and enforces equal pay for equal work. If \npeople feel as though they are not being treated fairly under the law, \nthey are supposed to try to modify that behavior out of court, and if \nthey can't, then we ask them--we, in fact, want them--to go to court to \ntry to get it settled. That is the American system. We don't want \npeople to overuse courts or to abuse courts, but we most certainly want \npeople who feel as though they are not being treated fairly under the \nlaw to have access to a court system.\n  Might I say that despite the fact that our court system is regularly \ncriticized, I would much prefer to show up in a court here than in Iraq \nor in Egypt or in Afghanistan or even in some places in Europe or most \ncertainly some countries in Africa. America has a very transparent, \nfairly sophisticated and modern judiciary system, and it really is a \nmodel for the world.\n  Sometimes I think we overlitigate in some areas, but where are these \nwomen supposed to go? What are they supposed to do--have an appointment \nwith their Congressman, show the Congressman their paycheck? No. \nCongressmen don't do that. Judges do. And when they get their day in \ncourt, they can show their pay stubs, and they can then demonstrate \nthat they have been doing the same job as the man next door but they \nhave been getting paid 77 cents on the man's dollar. That is why this \nbill is important.\n  I don't know for the life of me why the chamber of commerce is \nopposed. I think there are a lot of women in the chamber of commerce as \nbusiness owners and as women who used to work for other businesses \nbefore they owned their own. I had hoped they would stand and speak for \nwomen everywhere, that when a woman shows up early in the morning and \nworks until late at night, they deserve to be paid the same as a man \ndoing that exact job.\n  According to the American Bar Association, in the 50 years since its \npassage, the Equal Pay Act has become outdated, ineffective, and wage \ndiscrimination remains persistent, widespread and pernicious.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I ask unanimous consent for 30 more seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. In my home State of Louisiana, wage discrimination \nbased on gender is particularly problematic. According to the Joint \nEconomic Committee Report, women in Louisiana do not earn 77 cents, \nthey earn 69 cents for every $1 paid to men, which is significantly \nless than the national average.\n  At the same time, women make up almost half--48 percent--of the \nLouisiana workforce, and 24 percent of married, employed mothers in \nLouisiana are their family's primary wage earners.\n  This bill is the next step. It is the right step. It is the \ncommonsense step to fight against wage discrimination, and I am proud \nto join my colleague from Baltimore, from the State of Maryland, in \nchampioning this particular bill.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from Maryland and I look forward to \nworking with her and my colleagues to try to get this bill to the \nPresident's desk in the next few weeks. This is an economic development \nissue, as the Senator from Maryland knows.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, before the Senator leaves the floor, \nfirst of all, we thank her for her statement. I wonder if she would \nyield for a question.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes, I will.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. The Senator chairs the Committee on Small Business and \nhas been steadfast and has worked with the ranking member, Senator \nOlympia Snowe. Much has been said on cable TV about how this is going \nto smash and decimate small businesses. Is that true? I come from a \nsmall business family. My father owned a small grocery store. But \ncashiers are cashiers, male or female.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Absolutely. And it is not. That is why I stressed, I \nsay to the Senator from Maryland, that in this bill, which the Senator \nhas so ably\n\n[[Page S3708]]\n\nsponsored and written, the screen to get into court is tighter than in \nother wage discrimination laws on the books. That is for the protection \nof all businesses, small and large, so they are not clobbered with \nfrivolous lawsuits.\n  But as the Presiding Officer knows, many women are employed in small \nbusinesses--I mean between 1 and 5 employees or 1 and 10 employees. \nThey need to be protected in the workplace. Hopefully, we have created \na balance between the owners of the business and their employees, \nwhether they are union or not.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Senator for her comments and clarification.\n  I now yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. \nBlumenthal, a newcomer, but certainly he is one whose experience in \nConnecticut as an attorney general, who has actually had to litigate \nsome of these cases, brings excellent insight to this issue, and we \nwelcome his remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, first, let me join so many of my \ncolleagues in thanking the Senator from Maryland for being such a \nsteadfast and strong champion and a model for me as a newcomer of \nleadership in the Senate. I thank all the women who have spoken today--\nthe women of the Senate--who are, on this issue and so often on other \nissues, our conscience in this body. They are cutting through the \nunfounded--indeed, counterfactual--arguments made against this measure, \nwhich is simply a commonsense fulfillment of the American precept that \npeople who work equally hard and equally well should be paid equally.\n  The question before this body is, are women worth less than men? The \nanswer today and every day should be no. They are worth every bit as \nmuch as men when they work as hard and well, and they should be \nentitled to equal pay for equal work. Yet in too many jobs in \nConnecticut and around the country, women continue to earn \nsubstantially less than men.\n  In Connecticut, the number is 78 cents on the dollar, and that fact \nis unacceptable.\n  This issue goes beyond the women who are affected individually. It is \nabout their families. Because, on average, mothers in Connecticut \ncontribute 40 percent to their family's earnings.\n  Closing the pay gap for women would strengthen the finances of \nfamilies around Connecticut and across the country.\n  This issue is about more than just women and families; it is about \nchildren. The burden of wage discrimination weighs heavily on the \n549,000 Connecticut children in households dependent on the money \nearned by their moms. The victims of this gender pay gap are the \nchildren of families whose mothers are discriminated against.\n  This issue is about the economy. Those women who are denied equal pay \nhave less to spend. If the wage gap were eliminated, working women in \nConnecticut would have additional earnings to purchase 109 more weeks \nof food for the average family, make 7 more months of mortgage payments \nor purchase 3,000 additional gallons of gasoline.\n  I urge my colleagues to be on the right side of history. As Martin \nLuther King, Jr., said: The arc of history is long, but it bends \ntowards justice. Let us do justice today in this measure and pass the \nPaycheck Fairness Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I now yield the floor to Senator Harkin, \nthe chairman of the HELP Committee, which is where this bill \noriginated. We thank him again for all his hard work on this issue and \nothers related to any wage discrimination and standing up for women. I \nyield the chairman of the committee such time as he requires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Mikulski for her \ntremendous leadership on this issue--a lot of issues, quite frankly. \nBut she has focused laser-like attention on this issue for so long, and \nI would hope, when we have this vote at 2:30, we can at least get to \nthe bill and debate the bill and have amendments on the bill. But I am \nafraid our Republican colleagues are not going to let us do that.\n  Again, I applaud the senior Senator from Maryland, Ms. Mikulski, for \nintroducing the Paycheck Fairness Act and fighting so hard for so long \nfor it.\n  Again, to repeat what has been said before--but I think it needs to \nbe repeated time and time again--in 1963, Congress responded to wage \ndisparities between men and women by passing the Equal Pay Act of 1963. \nAt that time, 25 million female workers earned just 60 percent of the \naverage pay for men.\n  Now, nearly half a century after the passage of that landmark law, we \nhave made some progress toward eliminating this gross inequality, but \nit is not enough. There should be no gap. But today, a wage gap \ncontinues to exist within every segment of our economy, at all \neducation levels and in all occupations. So for every $1 a man earns \nnow, a woman earns just 77 cents. That is better than 60 cents, as it \nwas in 1963. But one would think a half a century later we would at \nleast be equivalent. But now it is still just 77 cents.\n  Women's lower wages add up tremendously over a career. Over the \ncourse of a 40-year career, women, on average, earn nearly $400,000 \nless than men. Women with a college degree or more face a career wage \ngap of more than $700,000 over a lifetime of work when compared with \nmen with the same education.\n  The consequences of the gender pay gap are enormous, impacting not \njust women but families as well. In today's economy, women represent \nhalf of all workers and earn an increasing share of family income. Two-\nthirds of mothers are major contributors to family income. In today's \neconomy, when a mother earns less than her male colleagues, it is her \nfamily--her family--that often must sacrifice even the basic \nnecessities, such as purchasing needed pharmaceuticals and putting \nhealthy food on the table. In many cases, women have to work more hours \nto earn the same paycheck as men, reducing time spent with their \nfamily.\n  While many factors influence a worker's earnings--including \noccupation, education, and work experience--there is overwhelming \nevidence that actual gender discrimination accounts for much of the \ndisparity between men's and women's pay. But, unfortunately, our laws \nhave not done enough to prevent this discrimination.\n  While I am pleased that the first piece of legislation President \nObama signed into law was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act--again, that \nwas only a first step; we need to do much more--too many women are \nstill not getting paid equally for doing the exact same job as men. \nThis is illegal, but it happens every day. There are just too many \nloopholes in our existing laws and too many barriers to effective \nenforcement.\n  That is why we need to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act. I thank \nSenator Mikulski for her leadership in advancing this bill. In 2010, we \nhad a hearing on this in our committee, and I was hopeful it would pass \nin the last Congress. But as has happened too often in recent years, \nSenate Republicans filibustered the bill. So understand this: 58 U.S. \nSenators--58; that is more than just a small majority, that is a big \nmajority--voted to support this legislation. But because of Republican \nobstructionism and filibusters, we could not even proceed to debate the \nbill because we had to have 60. We had 58 Senators supporting the bill. \nThat was 2 years ago.\n  Two years later, Republican obstructionism continues. I want the \nAmerican people to understand this. Republicans--the minority party--\nare preventing this Senate from even considering the issue of unequal \nwages and gender discrimination. Let me repeat: Republicans are not \njust preventing this important legislation from receiving an up-or-down \nvote, they are preventing the Senate--supposedly the world's greatest \ndeliberative body--from even debating and considering the bill. \nMillions of women and their families are concerned about the fact that \nthey get paid less than their male colleagues. Nevertheless, \nRepublicans will not even allow a debate on the issue in this body, \ndebate and amendment on the bill.\n  As an aside, I might say another reason why we need filibuster \nreform. This country cannot go on like this. This country cannot go on \nwith gridlock as\n\n[[Page S3709]]\n\nwe have had it in the Senate. We need to reform and do away with the \nfilibuster as it now is being used. We need to do away with it when the \nSenate reconvenes after the election next January.\n  Strengthening our existing laws by passing the Paycheck Fairness Act \nis the next step toward wage equality, but it cannot be the last one. \nWe must also tackle the more subtle discrimination that occurs when we \nsystematically undervalue the work traditionally done by women--I \nrepeat, when we undervalue the work traditionally done by women.\n  The fact is, millions of female-dominated jobs--jobs that are \nequivalent in skills, effort, responsibility, and working conditions to \nsimilar jobs dominated by men--pay significantly less than the male-\ndominated jobs. This is hard to fathom and impossible to justify.\n  Let me point out a couple things. Why is a housekeeper worth less \nthan a janitor? Mr. President, 89 percent of maids are female; 67 \npercent of janitors are male. While the jobs are equivalent, the median \nweekly earnings for a maid is $387; for a janitor, it is $463.\n  Truckdrivers--a job that is 95 percent male--have a median weekly \nearnings of $686. In contrast, a childcare worker--a job that is 95 \npercent female--OK, we got that: truckdrivers are 95 percent male, they \nget $686 a week, median; a childcare worker, 95 percent female, has \nmedian weekly earnings of $400.\n  Why do we value someone who moves products more than we value someone \nwho looks after the safety and well-being of our children? I am not \nhere to say the truckdriver is overpaid; it is to say that jobs we \nconsider ``women's work'' are underpaid.\n  When we connect these things we say: You are right. Jobs we think of \ntraditionally as being women's jobs are totally undervalued in our \nsociety. That is why in every session of Congress since 1996 I have \nintroduced the Fair Pay Act along with Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes \nNorton, which would require employers to require equal pay for \nequivalent jobs--equalize pay for equal jobs. This bill would require \nemployers to provide equal pay for jobs that are equivalent in skill, \neffort, responsibility, and working conditions.\n  Now, one might say: Well, that sounds way out. How can we do that? \nWell, in 1982, the State of Minnesota implemented a pay equity plan for \nits State employees. They found that women were segregated into \nhistorically female-dominated jobs, and these jobs paid 20 percent less \nthan male-dominated jobs. So the State of Minnesota instituted this \nlaw. Pay equity wage adjustments were phased in over 4 years, leading \nto an average pay increase of $200 per month for women in female-\ndominated jobs. The wage gap closed by approximately 9 percent.\n  In 1984, the Republican Governor, Republican Legislature, passed \nsimilar legislation in the State of Iowa: pay equity for equivalent \njobs--equivalent jobs. So this is not unheard of in this country. It is \nunheard of for us to do it at the Federal level covering everybody, but \nsome States have already taken leave--as I said, Minnesota in 1982 and \nIowa in 1984.\n  This bill would require employers to publicly disclose their job \ncategories and pay scales--not individual employees' pay but their \ncategories and pay scales. That way a woman would know whether she \nneeded to negotiate a better deal. Right now women who believe they are \nthe victim of pay discrimination must file a lawsuit and endure a \ndrawn-out legal discovery process to find out whether they make less \nthan the man working beside them. Well, with pay statistics readily \navailable for categories and pay scales, this whole process could be \navoided.\n  I asked Lilly Ledbetter at a hearing once: If the Fair Pay Act, the \none I am talking about now, had been law, would it have obviated your \nwage discrimination case? She said with the information about pay \nscales this bill provides, she would have known she was a victim of \ndiscrimination and could have addressed the problem much sooner, before \nit caused a lifelong drop in her earnings and before she had to go all \nthe way to the Supreme Court to try to make things right.\n  If Republicans allowed us to proceed to the bill, I would offer the \nFair Pay Act as an amendment. Yet I emphasize again, because of the \nRepublican obstructionism, we cannot even debate or amend the bill. We \ncannot even bring it up and amend the bill.\n  Finally, I want to comment on the RAISE Act. My Republican colleagues \nwould have us believe that we can solve the pay gap by allowing \nemployers to give merit-based pay increases above levels negotiated in \na collective bargaining agreement. Well, this is nonsense. The RAISE \nAct has nothing do with women's pay. Rather than seriously discussing \ngender discrimination, the Republicans have tried to change the subject \nby resorting to yet another partisan attack on organized labor--on \nlabor unions.\n  In fact, not only does the RAISE Act do nothing to address the \ndiscrimination faced by women in this country, the RAISE Act would both \nexacerbate the wage gap and lower pay for all workers. Collective \nbargaining agreements raise wages for all workers. The RAISE Act would \nundermine collective bargaining by requiring that all union contracts \ninclude provisions allowing employers to unilaterally grant wage \nincreases to select employees.\n  The primary effect would be to weaken the union's ability to bargain \nfor higher wages for all workers. It would also give employers \nunfettered discretion to dole out pay increases to preferred employees. \nThat is a recipe for more discrimination, not less.\n  I urge my colleagues to stand with Senator Mikulski in support of the \nPaycheck Fairness Act today. It is a simple, commonsense piece of \nlegislation. There is no reason we should not take it up and pass it \nright away. Once we have closed the loopholes and ensured effective \nenforcement of the Equal Pay Act, we must turn our attention to the \nmillions of women, especially low-wage workers, whose work is \nundervalued. Think of childcare workers. Think of the women who are now \ntaking care of our elderly who are living longer but need supportive \ncare in their later years, mostly women. Why is that work being \nundervalued? We must ensure they receive the recognition and fair \ntreatment and fair pay they deserve by passing the Fair Pay Act.\n  In closing, the fight for economic equality is far from over. It \nshould not be over until every working woman in America receives a fair \nday's pay for a fair day's work.\n  As the chair of the HELP Committee, I plan to keep advocating for \nfair pay and focusing on equal wages until we have achieved real \nequality for women across the country. But first things first. It is \ntime for our Republican colleagues to end the filibuster and allow the \nPay Check Fairness Act to come to the floor this afternoon for debate, \namendments, and a final vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, we have an opportunity to take \nanother long overdue step to close the wage gap between men and women. \nEqual pay for equal work should not be a Democratic nor a Republican \nissue but an American issue of basic fairness. It is shameful that \ngender discrimination still exists in our country and more so at a time \nwhen women make an ever-increasing number of heads of households. That \nis why I am proud to join Senator Mikulski as a cosponsor of the \nPaycheck Fairness Act.\n  Vermont has been a leader in the fight of equal pay for equal work. \nAccording to a recent report by the American Association of University \nWomen, the State of Vermont leads the Nation, second only to the \nDistrict of Columbia, in equal pay issues, yet Vermont women still make \njust 84 cents on the dollar compared to their male counterparts. Over a \ndecade ago, the Vermont Legislature passed legislation requiring equal \npay for equal work, barring employers from retaliating against \nemployees for disclosing the amount of their wages, and made it easier \nto file wage discrimination claims. Unfortunately, not all States offer \nthese protections. The Paycheck Fairness Act is a step in the right \ndirection to bring Vermont's inclusive example to the Federal level.\n  The Paycheck Fairness Act sets out a clear path to address the \nsystemic problems that result from pay disparities. It takes critical \nsteps to ensure that employers follow the law; prohibits retaliation \nagainst workers for disclosing their own wage information or for filing \na charge in an Equal Pay\n\n[[Page S3710]]\n\nAct proceeding; strengthens penalties for equal pay violations; adds \nprograms for training, research, technical assistance to help better \nidentify and handle wage disputes; and establishes a national award for \npay equity in the workplace recognizing employers who demonstrate \n``substantial effort to eliminate pay disparities between men and \nwomen.''\n  The Paycheck Fairness Act would also narrow the criteria under which \nan employer can defend pay disparities and enlist the Department of \nLabor to help eliminate gender-based pay gaps. This bill would ensure \nthat American women and their families aren't taking home smaller \npaychecks because of their gender. Another piece of this legislation \nspecifically deals with reforming the procedures and remedies for \nenforcing the law. It would mandate record-keeping and data collection \nfor better enforcement of the law. Under this bill, the Equal \nEmployment Opportunity Commission would be directed to issue \nregulations for the collection of wage data from employers based on \nsex, race, and ethnicity.\n  This legislation would be another in a series of bills seeking to \naddress the harms against working women. The Equal Pay Act was enacted \nin 1963 to protect employees against wage discrimination with respect \nto an individual's race, ethnicity, religion, or sex. It is true that \nwe have closed the wage gap for women versus their male counterparts \nfrom 61 cents on the dollar in 1961 to 77 cents today, according to the \nBureau of Labor Statistics. However, that decreases to 62 cents on the \ndollar for African-American women and just 53 cents on the dollar for \nHispanic-American women. Being 77 percent right is not good enough. The \nefforts to achieve parity for women in the workplace must continue.\n  In 2009, I joined Senator Mikulski and others in introducing the \nLilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Restoration Act. That bill was necessary to \nremedy the Supreme Court's divided decision in Ledbetter v. Goodyear, \nwhich struck a severe blow to the rights of working families across our \ncountry. The Ledbetter decision stripped back 40 years of progress to \neliminate workplace discrimination.\n  In that case, Ms. Ledbetter worked for nearly 20 years as a manager \nat a Goodyear factory in Gadsden, AL. After decades of service, she \nlearned through an anonymous note that her employer had been \ndiscriminating against her for years. She was the only woman among 16 \nemployees at her management level, yet Ms. Ledbetter was paid between \n15 and 40 percent less than all of her male colleagues, including \nseveral who had significantly less seniority. After filing a complaint \nwith the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, a Federal jury found \nthat Ms. Ledbetter was owed almost $225,000 in back pay. However, five \nmembers of the Supreme Court overturned her jury verdict because she \nhad filed her lawsuit more than 180 days after her employer's original \ndiscriminatory act. The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Restoration Act \nrestored victims' ability to file suit for pay discrimination and was \namong the first bills to be signed into law by President Obama. It is \nnot surprising that yesterday the administration announced its strong \nsupport for the Paycheck Fairness Act. Congress should send this \nlegislation to President Obama to be signed into law, without delay.\n  Wage discrimination affects women of every generation and every \nsocioeconomic background. It is not limited to one line of work or \nlevel of education. The Paycheck Fairness Act is a step in securing \nthat equal pay for equal work is more than just a slogan or an ideal \nbut a reality for every American, regardless of gender, race, or any \nother factor that does not evaluate people on the basis of what they \ncan offer and what they can contribute to the workforce. I urge all \nSenators to join in passing the Paycheck Fairness Act to ensure all of \nour daughters and granddaughters and future generations of Americans \nare not subject to the same injustice that has plagued women for \ndecades.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, above my desk in Washington is a copy of \nthe labor contract that was signed by my grandfather, Asakichi Inouye, \nin July 1899. In the agreement, my grandfather would be paid $15 a \nmonth to work at the McBryde Sugar Company on the Island of Kauai. My \ngrandmother, Moyo, would be paid $10 a month. Women like my grandmother \nwere an important part of the workforce for Hawaii's sugar plantations, \nbut they were paid less for doing the same type of work as men and did \nnot receive the same advancement opportunities. While our Nation has \nmade great strides in promoting gender equity since 1899, there is \nstill more to do.\n  According to the Joint Economic Committee, women in Hawaii today earn \n76 cents for every dollar paid to men. Over a 40-year career, a woman \nin Hawaii would earn $433,000 less than her male counterparts. Women \nrepresent 48 percent of my State's workforce and 41 percent of married \nwomen are their families' primary wage earner. Studies have shown that \nthe gender wage gap affects women regardless of their educational level \nor occupational field. Eliminating the wage gap is not only a matter of \nfairness for equal pay for equal work; it is also one of economic \nsecurity for middle-class families.\n  In a challenging economy, men are more likely than women to lose \ntheir jobs. This means that families across the country increasingly \nhave had to rely on a woman's paycheck to make ends meet. For \nvulnerable families hard hit by unemployment, closing the wage gap \nwould help put food on the table or pay the mortgage. Let us also \nremember that the wage gap undermines women's retirement security \nthrough reduced Social Security benefits.\n  S. 3220, the Paycheck Fairness Act, strengthens the foundations of \nthe Equal Pay Act of 1963 and the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009. \nThe Paycheck Fairness Act would provide for stronger enforcement of \nprohibitions against wage discrimination. It would also prohibit \nretaliation against workers who ask about pay practices or disclose \ntheir own pay. In short, the Paycheck Fairness Act would help women \nsuccessfully fight for the equal pay they have earned.\n  In 1963, when Congress passed the Equal Pay Act, women earned 59 \ncents to every dollar earned by men. Today, women earn 77 cents to the \ndollar. At this rate, the wage gap would take more than 40 years to \nclose. Women and their families cannot wait any longer. My vote today \nis not only to recognize and honor the work of women since my \ngrandmother's generation, but it is also a vote for economic justice \nfor future generations of young women like my granddaughter. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting the Paycheck Fairness Act.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to stand in support of \nequal pay for equal work.\n  Forty-nine years ago, the Equal Pay Act was signed into law. Yet, \ngender-based wage discrimination remains a serious problem for women in \nthe U.S. workplace and it has very real implications for their \nfamilies.\n  Today we will vote on legislation that is a matter of basic justice \nand fairness. The Paycheck Fairness Act will update the Equal Pay Act \nby closing loopholes and strengthening incentives to prevent pay \ndiscrimination by employers.\n  Without a doubt, the Equal Pay Act has helped women achieve \nsignificant progress in the workplace. However, the gender pay gap \nremains just as real today as it was almost 50 years ago.\n  It is true: Although women make up about half of today's workforce, \nwomen still earn only about 77 percent of what men earn. That's wrong.\n  Women in the workplace, the women who head households or earn the \nonly paycheck in a family--the women in the trenches of this economy--\nknow this fundamental truth:\n  The gender wage gap exists--it is not a myth.\n  It has implications for families and our economy.\n  It has been with us too long and we have a chance and obligation to \nfix it.\n  I have heard lots of stories about paycheck disparities in \nCalifornia. I know my colleagues have heard similar stories from women \nin their states.\n  In-depth studies reveal the existence of gender pay disparities, \nregardless of age, occupation, education or marital status.\n  According to the National Partnership for Women & Families, the pay \ngap has been narrowing by one-half of a cent every year since 1963.\n\n[[Page S3711]]\n\n  This means, without Congressional action, women will not achieve pay \nparity with men until the year 2056.\n  Let me share a story about a woman from Sylmar, CA who worked at a \nlocal retail store. She wrote me a letter and said:\n\n       I know firsthand about unequal pay for equal jobs. I worked \n     with two male associates, all doing the same job. I was hired \n     at 25 cents more an hour than the two males because I had \n     more job experience.\n       Less than six months later, I learned that one of the males \n     had received a `merit raise' which put his hourly rate higher \n     than mine. He had been absent many times.\n       When I asked for a merit raise, based on no absences, good \n     customer comments and always going above and beyond in my \n     job, I was told by male management: ``You don't deserve a \n     merit raise.''\n\n  The discrimination was obvious.\n  In California, there are 5.3 million children--2.6 million \nhouseholds--wholly or partially dependent on a mother's earnings.\n  According to recent census estimates, in California, the average pay \nfor a woman working full time, year round is $41,302 per year, while \nthe average for a man is $49,453.\n  This means that women are paid 84 cents for every dollar paid to men.\n  Put another way, this amounts to a yearly gap of $8,151 between full-\ntime working men and women in the State.\n  The figures are even worse for women of color. African American women \nearned about 62 cents and Latinas only 57 cents for every $1 earned by \na male.\n  As a group, full-time working women in California lose approximately \n$36 billion each year due to the wage gap.\n  According to the National Partnership for Women and Families, if the \nwage gap were eliminated, a working woman in California would have \nenough money for approximately 62 more weeks of food, four more months \nof mortgage and utilities payments, seven more months of rent, 25 more \nmonths of family health insurance premiums or 1,914 additional gallons \nof gas.\n  Equal pay in not only a women's issue--millions of families rely on a \nwoman's paycheck for its family's earnings.\n  Women are critical to driving this economy. So ensuring equal pay for \nequal work benefits the entire economy.\n  When women earn less than men, fewer dollars are available to go back \ninto the economy as consumer spending.\n  As we emerge from one of the worst recessions in history, the \nPaycheck Fairness Act would ensure that American women and their \nfamilies aren't bringing home smaller paychecks because of \ndiscrimination. Let's pass this commonsense bill and move one step \ncloser to paycheck fairness.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, at a time when families across America are \nstruggling to make ends meet, equal pay for equal work isn't just a \nwomen's issue, it is a family issue. As the father of two daughters, I \nalso see it as a fairness issue. I am an original cosponsor of the \nPaycheck Fairness Act because all of our daughters deserve the right to \nbe compensated and valued fairly. This bill would take strong action to \naddress the gender pay gap by helping women successfully fight for the \nequal pay they earn.\n  This bill would address the pay gap by enhancing enforcement of equal \npay laws. Specifically, it would prohibit retaliation against workers \nwho ask about or discuss wage information, and would provide more \neffective remedies for women subjected to discriminatory pay practices. \nIt also requires the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to collect \npay data to enable better enforcement of laws prohibiting pay \ndiscrimination.\n  Across the Nation, women continue to earn substantially less than men \nfor performing the same work. Women earn only 77 cents for every $1 men \nearn, with women of color at an even greater disadvantage with 64 cents \non the dollar for African-American women and 56 cents for Hispanic \nwomen. As more and more American families rely on women's wages for a \nsignificant portion of their income, the pay gap hurts not only women, \nbut the families that depend on them.\n  Today, in my home State of Massachusetts, women make up 49 percent of \nthe state workforce and 31 percent of married employed mothers in \nMassachusetts are their families' primary wage earners.\n  Unfortunately, women in Massachusetts earn less across all \noccupations and educational levels. Research clearly demonstrates that \nregardless of occupation, education, industry, marital status, and \nother factors, pay for women lags behind their male counterparts. \nWomen's median earnings are less than men's median earnings in almost \nevery major occupation.\n  This burden of wage discrimination weighs heavily on the almost 1 \nmillion Massachusetts children in households dependent on their \nmothers' earnings. As the main breadwinners, women are asked to carry a \ngreater economic load while only earning 81 cents for every $1 paid to \nmen. Over their lifetimes, these Massachusetts women will earn $475,000 \nless than their male counterparts. This pay gap has harmed the families \nof roughly 1,576,000 women in the Massachusetts workforce, especially \nas the workforce participation rate of women has risen. On average, \nmothers in Massachusetts contribute to 37 percent of their family's \nearnings. Closing the gender pay gap would strengthen the finances of \nthese families, and the State economy. If the wage gap is eliminated, \nthese families would have additional earnings to purchase 83 more weeks \nof food or 5 months of mortgage payments or more than 2,500 additional \ngallons of gasoline.\n  I am disappointed and frustrated that the Senate failed to move ahead \non this important legislation due to minority opposition. Republicans \nfilibustered this commonsense legislation that would ensure fair pay \nfor equal work--and then not a single Republican Senator voted in favor \nof moving it forward. It is incomprehensible to me that Members who \nclaim to want to strengthen the economy and provide jobs for everyone \nwould vote to ignore half of our population. Economic security should \nbe for all Americans and legislation ensuring a level playing field \njust makes sense. Eliminating the pay gap will make Massachusetts \nfamilies and families across the Nation more secure.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today the Senate is once again attempting \nto move forward with the Paycheck Fairness Act. This legislation would \nstrengthen and modernize the Equal Pay Act of 1963 by providing new \ntools to combat gender-based wage discrimination. Among other things, \nthis bill would require employers to demonstrate that wage differences \nbetween genders for comparable work are due to business decisions, and \nnot gender. It also would prohibit employers from retaliating against \nemployees who inquire about wage practices or share salary information \nwith their colleagues. And it would strengthen penalties for equal pay \nviolations.\n  Closing the gender pay gap is always an important and worthwhile \ngoal, but this is the case especially in the current tough economic \nclimate where it is increasingly common for women to be the primary or \neven sole bread winner in a family. For example, in Michigan, over a \nthird of families with dependent children rely on a working mother's \nsalary for their primary income. This represents the families of over \nhalf a million children. And here is the important part--while the \naverages have varied, current figures indicate that women still only \nmake 77 cents for every dollar made by their male counterparts.\n  These are prolonged, tough, economic times, and there is no \njustifiable reason for the U.S. Senate not to do everything in its \npower to support policies that can help women in this country support \nthemselves and their families by ensuring they are being paid the same \nwage as their male counterparts for comparable work. This is not just \nan issue of gender equality; it is one of economic equality and \nfairness. It is deeply discouraging for our Republican colleagues to be \nfilibustering this measure.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, when the Senate rejected this legislation 20 \nmonths ago in a bipartisan vote it did so for the right reasons. The \nfact is, discriminatory pay practices are already illegal, and properly \nso. Congress has put two laws on the books to combat such \ndiscrimination--Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Equal \nPay Act of 1963. These are both\n\n[[Page S3712]]\n\ngood laws that have been well-utilized to combat discrimination where \nit exists, and I support full enforcement of those laws. When a female \nor male employee is being paid less simply because of gender it must be \ncorrected and penalized. According to the Equal Employment Opportunity \nCommission, EEOC, employees received more than $150 million through \nsuccessfully-resolved Title VII and EPA discrimination claims last \nyear, the largest amount awarded in 15 years.\n  I am confident that there is no member of this Senate who would \ntolerate paying a woman less for the same work simply because she is a \nwoman. As husbands, fathers and mothers of working women, I believe we \nall recognize the gross inequity of discrimination in pay based on \ngender. But what the majority is trying to push through here today is \nof a very different nature. The so-called Paycheck Fairness Act is \nmisnamed. It should actually be called a Profiteering Trial Lawyers \nBonanza bill. The primary beneficiary of this legislation will be trial \nlawyers. They will be able to bring bigger class action lawsuits \nwithout even getting the consent of plaintiffs, and they will have the \nweapon of ``uncapped damages'' to force employers to settle lawsuits \neven when they know they have done nothing wrong. The litigation \nbonanza this bill would create would extend even to the smallest of \nsmall businesses, only further hampering the lagging economic recovery.\n  With unemployment trending back up to 8.2 percent, this is simply not \na chance we can afford to take. When the Senate last rejected this \nbill, unemployment had been above 8% for 20 months. Now, it has doubled \nto 40 months, and it is trending higher. If we include the significant \nnumbers of people that have simply dropped out of the workforce, the \nunemployment rate is over 14 percent. The United States is in very \ndangerous territory right now. This is not the time to pass this \nharmful legislation.\n  There are a number of other concerning provisions of this bill, such \nas authorizing the government to require reporting of every employer's \nwage data by sex, race and national origin. Had this bill gone through \ncommittee mark up under regular Senate order, we may have been able to \naddress some of these concerns. But this bill, like so many others this \nCongress, has circumvented regular order.\n  The Senate rejected this identical bill on a bipartisan basis 20 \nmonths ago because it will insert the Federal Government into workplace \nmanagement decisions like never before. This intrusion will benefit \ntrial lawyers and harm job growth and employment, which will affect \nboth women and men.\n  Supporters of the bill cite wage data that the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics itself says ``do not control for many factors that can be \nsignificant in explaining earning differences.'' In fact, studies show \nthat if you factor in observable choices such as part-time work, \nseniority and occupational choice, the pay gap stands between 5 to 7 \npercent. Some of these choices are simply personal prerogative, and I \nwould not question the choices that anyone makes with regard to family \nobligations, job security and the quality of fringe benefits such as \nhealth, retirement and childcare. But to a large extent this remaining \ngap is due to occupational choice. It is unfortunate that this Congress \nhas not done more to foster a job growth environment and improve job \ntraining programs like the Workforce Investment Act that could prepare \nmore women to enter higher earning occupational fields. Surely this \nwould be a more reasonable solution than a trial lawyer bonanza sure to \ndisadvantage all employers and depress job growth to the disadvantage \nof all employees.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters of \nopposition to S. 3220. I urge my colleagues to oppose this motion.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     May 24, 2012.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Leaders Reid and McConnell: The undersigned urge you \n     and your colleagues to VOTE NO on cloture on the motion to \n     proceed to the Paycheck Fairness Act (S. 3220). The vote is \n     currently scheduled for June 5. Our organizations represent \n     millions of employers who are committed to ensuring equal \n     employment opportunities for men and women alike. While we \n     have no tolerance for unlawful discrimination, we vigorously \n     oppose S. 3220.\n       The Paycheck Fairness Act would impose unprecedented \n     government control over how employees are paid at even the \n     nation's smallest employers. This flawed legislation could \n     outlaw many legitimate practices that employers currently use \n     to set employee pay rates, even where there is no evidence of \n     intentional discrimination. Common practices that a court \n     could find unlawful under S. 3220 include providing premium \n     pay for professional experience, education, shift \n     differentials or hazardous work, as well as pay differentials \n     based on local labor market rates or an organization's \n     profitability. This level of government intervention in \n     employee compensation is both unprecedented and unwarranted \n     in the United States.\n       The provisions of the Paycheck Fairness Act would harm \n     employers of all sizes, as the bill would apply to employers \n     with as few as two employees. The threat the bill poses to \n     small business is particularly troubling given the draconian \n     penalties found in this legislation, which include unlimited \n     damages regardless of whether a pay discrepancy was \n     unintentional.\n       A number of federal laws already specifically protect \n     employees from pay discrimination, including the Equal Pay \n     Act, the Civil Rights Act and the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay \n     Act. These laws prohibit pay disparities based on gender and \n     provide robust remedies and damages to victims of pay \n     discrimination. As The Washington Post editorial board stated \n     in 2009, adding the Paycheck Fairness Act to these existing \n     laws ``risks tilting the scales too far against employers and \n     would remove, rather than restore, a sense of balance.'' In \n     2010, the Boston Globe wrote ``the measure as a whole is too \n     broad'' and the Chicago Tribune described the bill as \n     ``grossly intrusive.''\n       Once again, we urge all senators to oppose the Paycheck \n     Fairness Act.\n           Sincerely,\n         American Bakers Association, American Bankers \n           Association, American Hotel & Lodging Association, \n           Associated Builders & Contractors, Inc., College and \n           University Professional Association for Human \n           Resources, Food Marketing Institute, HR Policy \n           Association, International Public Management \n           Association for Human Resources, National Association \n           of Manufacturers, National Association of Wholesaler-\n           Distributors, National Council of Chain Restaurants, \n           National Council of Textile Organizations, National \n           Federation of Independent Business, National Public \n           Employer Labor Relations Association, National \n           Restaurant Association, National Retail Federation, \n           National Roofing Contractors Association, Printing \n           Industries of America, Retail Industry Leaders \n           Association, Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council, \n           Society for Human Resource Management, U.S. Chamber of \n           Commerce.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         U.S. Chamber of Commerce,\n\n\n                               Congressional & Public Affairs,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 4, 2012.\n       To The Members of The United States Senate: The U.S. \n     Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest business federation \n     representing the interests of more than three million \n     businesses and organizations of every size, sector, and \n     region, strongly opposes S. 3220, the ``Paycheck Fairness \n     Act.'' The Chamber strongly supports equal employment \n     opportunity and appropriate enforcement of the Equal Pay Act \n     (EPA) and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. However, \n     this bill would, among other things, expand remedies under \n     the EPA to include unlimited punitive and compensatory \n     damages, significantly erode employer defenses for legitimate \n     pay disparities, and imposes invalid tools for enforcement by \n     the Labor Department.\n       The EPA, while allowing recovery for lost back pay, does \n     not provide for compensatory and punitive damages, nor should \n     it. The EPA is a strict liability statute in that there is no \n     requirement that the employer intend to act unlawfully. It \n     strains logic to mandate that damages conceived and designed \n     to punish and deter wrongful conduct should apply to claims \n     of inadvertent, unintentional conduct that has the effect of \n     violating the EPA. If a plaintiff can demonstrate that a wage \n     disparity is due to intentional discrimination, then he or \n     she should bring a claim under Title VII of the Civil Rights \n     Act of 1964, where punitive and compensatory damages (capped \n     at certain levels) are available.\n       S. 3220 would also significantly erode the defenses \n     available to employers under the EPA. For example, the bill \n     would permit plaintiffs to challenge otherwise legitimate \n     employer pay decisions by showing that some other employment \n     practice might achieve the same business purpose without \n     creating the disparity. Further, the employment decision in \n     question must also be proven to be required by ``business \n     necessity.'' These provisions would open up compensation and \n     employment decisions to limitless review by courts and juries \n     and would ultimately lead to an inefficient, cumbersome, and \n     costly salary-setting process. In addition, the bill would \n     modify existing rules concerning collective actions, making \n     it easier for plaintiffs' attorneys to mount class action \n     suits.\n\n[[Page S3713]]\n\n       In addition, the bill would make a number of regulatory \n     changes at the Labor Department related to equal employment \n     opportunity requirements for federal contractors. Re-imposing \n     the flawed Equal Opportunity Survey and requiring use of \n     dubious statistical models for determining whether employers \n     engage in systematic compensation discrimination, would do \n     nothing to combat discrimination and instead would waste both \n     enforcement and employer resources.\n       Litigation in employment discrimination has exploded since \n     the inclusion of compensatory and punitive damages under \n     Title VII, resulting in increased costs associated with \n     attorneys' fees and employment investigations as employers \n     must respond to each charge filed, whether frivolous or not. \n     Further increasing the opportunity for frivolous litigation \n     will only further serve to undermine our nation's civil \n     rights laws.\n       The Chamber strongly opposes S. 3220 and urges you to vote \n     against this legislation. The Chamber may consider including \n     votes on, or in relation to, S. 3220--including on procedural \n     votes and any motion to proceed--in our annual How They Voted \n     scorecard.\n           Sincerely,\n     R. Bruce Josten.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   National Retail Federation,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 31, 2012.\n     Hon. Michael B. Enzi,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Enzi: On behalf of the National Retail \n     Federation, I am writing to urge you to oppose S. 3220, \n     legislation that would greatly increase government \n     involvement in pay decisions in businesses of all sizes and \n     give trial lawyers an incentive to pursue unlimited \n     litigation against American employers. Votes on S. 3220 will \n     be considered a ``key vote'' by the National Retail \n     Federation and the retail industry.\n       Retailers strongly oppose discrimination of all types. Sex \n     discrimination in employment is no exception. Two federal \n     laws protect employees from gender-based pay inequity: Title \n     VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Equal Pay Act of \n     1963. Both laws have broad coverage, prohibit intentional \n     gender-based pay discrimination and impose liability on \n     employers for gender-pay differences, even where there is no \n     evidence of intentional discrimination if the employer fails \n     to justify the pay discrepancies.\n       The pending legislation, S. 3220, would dramatically expand \n     the Equal Pay Act to allow workers who claim they are the \n     victims of gender-based wage discrimination to sue for \n     unlimited compensatory and punitive damages. Moreover, its \n     provisions would allow business owners to be sued if wage \n     differentials exist due to local market rates, revenue \n     production, or profitability. As a result, S. 3220 could \n     effectively block retailers from considering issues such as \n     store location and local economic conditions in setting wage \n     rates.\n       Furthermore, the bill expedites class action lawsuits by \n     requiring employees to ``opt-out'' of the class, effectively \n     using size to force settlements against the Main Street \n     businesses that will become its target. The legislation would \n     also direct the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ( \n     EEOC) to collect employee pay and compensation data from \n     covered employers. Nothing in the bill would prevent this \n     data from being publicly disclosed by the EEOC or made \n     available through a Freedom of Information Act request.\n       Again, the National Retail Federation strongly urges you to \n     oppose S. 3220, and we will consider a vote on this \n     legislation a key vote for the retail industry.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 David French,\n\n                                            Senior Vice President,\n     Government Relations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/05/senate-section/article/S3713-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3713]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the time until 2:30 \nwill be equally divided, with the minority controlling the first half.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we are coming to a very critical vote. \nToday we have the opportunity to address an issue that affects the \nbottom line of nearly every American family. The paychecks that \nAmerican women take home at the end of each week or each month are as \ntied to our economic health as just about anything else. It is what \nhelps sustain local businesses. It is what pays grocery bills at the \nend of the month. It makes mortgage payments. Ultimately, the pay women \nreceive as we continue to make up a larger and larger part of our \nworkforce is going to be critical to the growth of this Nation. Yet \nover the course of the past week, as we have debated this bill in the \nSenate and across the country, we have been met by either silence or \nresistance from those on the other side of the aisle. Time and again we \nhave heard the same excuses on why we cannot join together to provide \nthe guaranteed fairness women deserve.\n  First, we heard this was a ``manufactured issue.'' Mr. President, if \nyou talk to American women all across our country, you will quickly \nlearn what some of my colleagues have called ``manufactured'' is an \nall-too-real part of everyday American women's lives. Women will tell \nyou that at a time when families across America are struggling to make \nends meet, equal pay for equal work should not be a pipe dream; it \nshould be law. They will tell you that nearly 50 years after the Equal \nPay Act was signed, the pay gap between what men and women earn is just \nas real today as it was back then. They will tell you women still earn \n77 cents for every dollar earned by men. They will tell you this gap \nundermines their retirement security because they receive reduced \nSocial Security benefits. Then, most importantly, they will tell you \nwomen are not worth less than men.\n  The other argument we have heard is that this critical vote is in \nsome way a distraction from the economic issues we face, as if somehow \nthe pay of women--who compromise nearly half of all American workers--\nis not at its very core an economic issue. Let me be very clear. When \nwomen are not paid what they deserve, middle-class families, \ncommunities, and our economic growth pay the price.\n  Let's consider that in my home State of Washington where women still \nearn 77 cents on the dollar--or a pay gap that averages over $11,000 in \nlost earnings every year--for the average family that is an extra 90 \nweeks of groceries, it is 7 months of mortgage payments or it is 179 \ntanks of gasoline--all at a time when women are participating in the \nworkforce at higher rates than ever before.\n  Surely, my friends and colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nrealize this is not the time to be denying American families this extra \nincome they need to make ends meet. Surely, we should be guaranteeing \nAmerican women and their families the fairness they deserve. This \nshould not be a partisan issue. Throughout the history of the Senate, \nwe have joined together to root out discriminatory practices and \nprovide the protections American workers deserve. Today, as American \nfamilies struggle, it is time to make sure unfair practices are not \ncontributing to those struggles.\n  Today we have an opportunity to close loopholes in the system that \nallows for pay discrimination, to create strong incentives for \nemployers to obey the laws that are in place, and to strengthen Federal \noutreach and enforcement efforts on behalf of women.\n  Today we all have an opportunity to say the status quo is not good \nenough. We have the opportunity to tell our daughters we are not going \nto let another generation face a pay gap because we are unwilling to \nstand and fight. We have the chance to improve our economy right now. \nSo to those of my colleagues who claim to be so concerned about the \neconomy and the struggles of the middle class, now is your chance to \nprove to your constituents you mean what you say. Now is the chance to \nprovide nearly half of all Americans with the economic fairness they \ndeserve. Now is the time to guarantee American women equal pay for \nequal work.\n  I yield the floor and yield back the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Will the leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. Leader, I noted that on the last vote, you voted no. Was that so \nthe bill could be reconsidered?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, through the Chair, there is no one in \nthis body who has a reputation for a bigger and better fighter than \nBarbara Mikulski, the senior Senator from Maryland. I entered the \nmotion to reconsider the vote because I want the fight to continue.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I would like to respond to the majority leader. We want \nto fight too. We thank him for his vote and his voice. I want him to \nknow that although we lost the vote today, we are not going to give up \non this vote. It is a very sad day here in the Senate, but it is a \nsadder day every day when paycheck day comes and women continue to make \nless than men.\n  We are sorry that this vote occurred strictly on party lines. Under \nthe leader's effort to reconsider, we hope to bring up this bill again. \nWe hope to forge a bipartisan vote. We are coming up on the 49th \nanniversary of equal pay for equal work. We are not going to let this \nbill die in parliamentary entanglements. The majority should rule in \nthe Senate.\n  I want to say this, in the words of Abigail Adams. While John Adams \nand all the guys were sitting around Philadelphia writing the \nConstitution, she wrote him a letter and said, ``Don't forget the \nladies.'' And they did it for 150 years, and then they forget, too, to \nget rid of the loopholes in the Equal Pay Act now. Well, Abigail said: \nIf you forget us, we will foment our revolution, and we are going to \nfoment our revolution.\n  So I say to the women here, to the good men who support us, to the \nwomen out there in America, let's keep this fight going. Put on your \nlipstick, square your shoulders, suit up, and let's fight for this new \nAmerican revolution where women are paid equal pay for equal work. \nLet's end wage discrimination in this century once and for all.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the statement made by \nthe Senator from Maryland, as usual. She will outline a way to proceed \non this matter that will be dignified and strong.\n  I filed cloture on this motion to proceed to this very important bill \nrelating to farm programs in America and nutrition programs in \nAmerica--extremely important legislation. I am confident--maybe it is \nthe wrong thing in the temperament of the Senate today--that we are \ngoing to be able to complete this bill. It is an important bill for \nAmerica. It will be a good thing for this Congress to do this farm \nbill. The two managers of this bill, Senator Stabenow of Michigan and \nSenator Roberts of Kansas, have done a remarkably good job. This bill \ncreates jobs and reduces subsidies by a significant amount. Where else \nwould you find a bill that reduces the debt of this country by $24 \nbillion? This is a fine piece of legislation, and I hope we can work \nsomething out so we do not have to have a vote on this matter on \nThursday, that we can start legislating.\n  We have had good fortune shine upon us on the last couple of big \nbills we brought through here. We had the managers work with floor \nstaff to work on the relevant amendments and then have a way to finish \nthe bill. I hope we can do that.\n  I repeat, I have confidence in Senator Stabenow and Senator Roberts. \nThey are very good legislators. We need to proceed on this bill. This \nbill is not a Democratic bill or Republican bill, it is a bill for \nAmerica.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I want to say that I agree with my friend's comments \nabout\n\n[[Page S3715]]\n\nSenator Stabenow and Senator Roberts. I consider both my friends. They \nare terrific legislators.\n\n\n                       The Paycheck Fairness Act\n\n  I do want to go back to the vote that just occurred. I would note \nthat we had present in the Chamber some of the House Members, women of \nthe House. I think they are gone now. It was to underscore the \nimportance of this vote and what it means.\n  My question goes to this: Is my colleague aware that women in their \nlifetime are so shortchanged that the average woman, in the course of \nher career, by the end of her career has made $400,000 less than her \nmale counterpart? Is my friend aware of that?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. In the State of Nevada--I am sure it is maybe more \nthan that in California--in the State of Nevada, women earn $400,000 \nless. A man in his lifetime makes X number of dollars, and in Nevada a \nwoman makes $400,000 less--in fact, a little more.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I think it is important for people to understand what \njust occurred. We had a straight party-line vote on an issue that \nimpacts every single woman in this country. I think when people say \nthere is a difference between the parties--I like working with my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle. I have good relationships \nwith them. But for goodness' sake, how can you have a party that, to a \nperson here, votes against equal pay for equal work?\n  I will close with this question to my friend. It is my understanding \nthat 90 percent of the people support the idea of equal pay for equal \nwork. Is my leader aware of this, and when does he think he might bring \nthis back before the body?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, through the Chair, she is absolutely \nright. Seventy-seven percent of Republicans across America support this \nlegislation. Eighty-one percent of men across America support this \nlegislation.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, before speaking about moving forward on \nthe Agriculture Reform, Food and Jobs Act, I want to thank our leader. \nI also want to thank Senator Mikulski. Together we have brought forward \nthe issue of equal pay for equal work, and we intend to focus on that \nuntil we make this truly the law of the land.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to allow us to \nproceed to the Agriculture Reform, Food and Jobs Act, commonly known as \nthe farm bill. I first want to thank my friend, colleague, and partner \nas we moved through the committee process, Senator Roberts. It has been \nterrific working with my ranking member and his staff. We worked in a \ntruly bipartisan way. I think that is reflected in the fact that this \nbill came out of committee with a strong bipartisan vote of 16 Members \nand only 5 dissenting. We are looking forward to working with all of \nour colleagues on the floor of the Senate to have this same kind of \nstrong bipartisan vote as we move through the process in the Senate.\n  There are 16 million people in this country who have a job that \nrelies on the strength of American agriculture. The farm bill is a jobs \nbill. Over the last few years when our Nation's economy has seen some \nvery rough times, agriculture has been one of the few bright spots. In \nfact, in Michigan, during our toughest times in manufacturing, \nagriculture was growing five times faster than any other part of our \neconomy. Agriculture is one of the only parts of the economy with a \ntrade surplus. I think it is, in fact, our No. 1 trade surplus with \n$42.5 billion in trade surplus.\n  We are growing it here, we are processing it here, developing it \nhere, selling it overseas, but the jobs are here. This farm bill is all \nabout keeping it that way. Last year our farmers exported $136 billion \nworth of goods, which is a 270-percent increase in the last 10 years. \nThis is about jobs, and we want to continue our leadership not only in \nthis country but internationally in agriculture through this important \nbill.\n  We also know our country is facing serious deficits. Last August the \nSenate passed the Budget Control Act by a vote of 74 to 26. That law \ncreated a deficit reduction committee, which we called the \nsupercommittee. They set out a process to find significant savings, and \nI am very proud of the fact that the Agriculture Committee came \ntogether in the House and the Senate. The chairman and the ranking \nmember in the House--along with me and the ranking member in the \nSenate--did some very tough negotiating and made tough decisions, \nworked long hours, and came up with a detailed deficit reduction plan. \nI wish we had that same kind of opportunity with every committee.\n  Unfortunately, in the end, the Agriculture Committee was the only \ncommittee that did that. We did our part, and we believe the work we \ndid in the fall helped to not only build relationships that are \nimportant to allow us to work together, but also set up a foundation \nfrom which we have written what we call the farm bill, or the \nAgriculture Reform, Food and Jobs Act.\n  We have built into this bill a real deficit reduction of $23 billion. \nLet me emphasize that the Agriculture Committee passed a bipartisan \nbill that strengthens the economy and cuts the Federal deficit. This \n$23 billion is roughly 2 percent of what the Budget Control Act put in \nplace in terms of sequestration next January of $1.2 trillion. We are \nroughly 2 percent of Federal outlays. In those efforts are agriculture \nproduction, conservation, and nutrition through the UFDA.\n  The UFDA is roughly 2 percent of Federal outlays. We are taking \nresponsibility for 2 percent of the cuts, and this is more than is \nactually required in the Budget Control Act, and it is double what was \nrecommended in Simpson-Bowles and the Gang of 6.\n  So agriculture is doing its fair share, and we are doing it in a \nresponsible way that focuses on reform and strengthening those efforts \nto make sure we have a strong agricultural economy, strong conservation \npractices, and support for jobs through energy and other important \nnutrition efforts.\n  We end direct payments. That means no more paying farmers for crops \nthey don't grow and no more payments for farmers when they are already \ndoing very well. In fact, the biggest savings in the bill comes from \neliminating direct payments and consolidating three other commodity \nsubsidy programs. America's farmers know in order to lower the deficit \nwe all need to do our fair share. Agriculture has stepped up and is \nwilling to do that.\n  We also make sure millionaires no longer get payments from commodity \nprograms. We tightened payment limits to half of what farmers currently \nare able to receive. We closed what is known as the managers' loophole \nthat lets people get farm payments when they are not farming. Instead, \nwe support a strong safety net based on crop insurance and risk.\n  If someone has a risk, if they have a loss, then it is critically \nimportant we stand with American agriculture. We have the safest and \nmost affordable food supply in the world, and it is critically \nimportant that we have the risk management tools available for our \nNation's farmers.\n  We heard over and over when Senator Roberts was in Michigan--and I am \ngrateful he joined me. I was pleased to have joined him in Kansas. We \nheard the same issues in our hearings in DC and around the country that \ncrop insurance was the most important tool for our producers.\n  Nobody wants to see a family farm--some passed down from generation \nto generation--go out of business because of a few days of bad weather \nor because of other changes in the markets beyond their control. I \ncannot think of a more high-risk venture, frankly, than agriculture.\n  This year in my State when it got very warm in February and March, \nthe cherry blossoms, apple blossoms, peaches, and grapevines all \nthought it was spring and the blossoms came out. Then when the freeze \nand the snow came, we were literally wiped out of tart and sweet \ncherries, apples, peaches, and grapes. Everything across the board was \ndevastated. I can't think of any other business that has to go through \nthat kind of risk other than farmers.\n  So we put in place a strengthened program so more specialty crops and \nmore fruit and vegetable growers can get access to crop insurance. We \nhave new capacity to support expanded risk tools. We substituted that \nwith a market-oriented, risk-based approach that\n\n[[Page S3716]]\n\nsupports farmers in the bad times; so they will not get a government \ncheck in the good times but in the bad times when we need to make sure \nour farmers can survive and thrive.\n  This bill does not set a government price. It focuses on what is \nhappening in the marketplace. The farmers are choosing what to plant \nfrom the market. We make sure no farmer goes off the cliff when a price \ndrops immediately, and that crop insurance is there for them as well. \nIndependent economists have said this is a fair system that is \nequitable to all regions and all commodities.\n  We have a very diverse country. We know we have colleagues that still \nhave concerns, and we are certainly working with them to fine-tune this \nbill, but we also know moving to a risk-based system treats all regions \nfairly. It is the kind of reform people across the country, including \ntaxpayers, are asking us to do.\n  This bill is much more than just a bill related to production \nagriculture--as important as production agriculture is. I am very proud \nof what we have been able to do on conservation. We have gone through \nevery program, streamlined them, and increased flexibility. We have \ndone what families and farmers across the country are doing, analyzing \nand stretching every dollar.\n  Frankly, we have a conservation title that does more with less. We \nhave taken 23 programs, consolidated them into 13, and put them into \nfour different areas with a lot of flexibility. We are maintaining our \nconservation tools and strengthening key priorities. There are certain \nareas that did not have any funding when this farm bill ends on \nSeptember 30. We have been able to combine that into a larger effort, \nand we are now able to continue and strengthen conservation. That is \nwhy we have heard from 643 conservation groups in all 50 States that \nsupport the approach we have taken in this bill. We continue the \nimportant work done in the farm bill around nutrition and helping \nfamilies who are most in need.\n  I have heard from so many people in Michigan in the last few years, \nwith the huge recession we have gone through, who never imagined in \ntheir lives they would need help putting food on the table. They paid \ntaxes all their lives and never thought they would have to ask somebody \nto help them and their children get through the month but are now in \nthat situation. I am committed to making sure every single dollar goes \nto people who need it.\n  We are cracking down on trafficking. We have had at least two \nsituations in Michigan where lottery winners somehow maintained food \nassistance. Obviously, that is crazy, and so that will not happen \nanymore under this bill.\n  Students who live at home with their parents and have been able to go \nthrough the loopholes to get food help, it is not right. That is not \nwhere it is intended. We address that as well. We have tightened a \nnumber of areas on accountability. We know there are areas where we can \nmake sure there is accountability, there is transparency and, in fact, \nfamilies in need know they can help feed their children during these \ntough economic times.\n  We are also recognizing the diversity of agriculture in America by \nstrengthening support for fruits and vegetables and other specialty \ncrops. We are making sure we are getting those healthy foods into \nschools, supporting organic farmers, farmers' markets, and food hubs \nlocally. By the way, that also creates jobs.\n  We are continuing our work on energy and helping farmers save money \non their bills while getting America off of foreign oil. We are opening \nopportunities for new innovative companies involved in \nbiomanufacturing. This is an exciting area for me as we look at how we \nmake and grow things in this country and bring those two together. I \nthink that is why we have a middle class in America--because we make \nand grow things.\n  Biomanufacturing is the process of taking raw materials from \nagricultural products, whether it is soybean oil, corn byproducts, \nwheat husk, biomass materials, and using them to create products and \nreplace chemicals and petroleum in plastics, for example, with \nbiodegradable bio-based products, which is very important for our \nfuture in so many ways. That is what the Agriculture Reform, Food and \nJobs Act is all about.\n  As we go further in this debate, I will have much more to say about \nall of the specifics in the titles. But let me just end with this \nbefore turning to my friend to speak.\n  The current farm bill, the Agriculture Reform, Food and Jobs Act--the \ncurrent farm bill expires this September 30, when farmers are getting \nready for the harvest. If Congress cannot come together in a bipartisan \nway, as we did in the Agriculture Committee and as we did in the fall \nwith the agricultural leaders, and pass this bill before then, it will \ncreate tremendous uncertainty and job losses in communities all across \nAmerica, and it will have a serious impact on our economic recovery. I \nhope our colleagues will work with us, will join with us to make sure \nthat does not happen.\n\n  We have received broad support for this legislation from 125 farm \ngroups, healthy food groups, and other stakeholders. I am very grateful \nto 45 of our colleagues who, on a bipartisan basis in a letter to \nleadership, urged that this bill be taken up. It is clear there is \nbroad support in Congress and across the country for the farm bill. So \nI urge my colleagues to let us begin the debate on this important jobs \nbill that affects 16 million people across this country.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I intend to give my full opening comments \nin regard to the farm bill tomorrow, but I wish to quickly say thank \nyou to the chairwoman for helping to bring us to this point. I thank \nher for her leadership. It has truly been a bipartisan effort. It has \nbeen a team effort.\n  I wish to reiterate what the chairwoman has said. I wish to tell our \ncolleagues this is a true reform bill. I could say that 10 times over \nfor emphasis, but it is a true reform bill. It also reduces and \nstreamlines the Department of Agriculture programs--long overdue. We \ncut $23 billion in mandatory spending, and it was voluntarily, without \nany direction from the Budget Committee or anybody else, and it is real \nmoney. It is mandatory money.\n  The Super Committee tried to work out a deal, and they weren't so \nsuper. They tried hard. I am not trying to criticize a tough deal. We \nare the only authorizing committee that I know of in the Senate that \nhas voluntarily come forth and said: Here is real deficit reduction in \nmandatory spending--over $23 billion. It is rather remarkable that \npeople who tend to be critical of agriculture would all of a sudden \ndiscover it is the Agriculture Committee, in a bipartisan effort, that \nhas cut real money, real mandatory money.\n  How many times have we heard folks back home say: Why don't you work \ntogether? Why can't we all get along? Why can't you reach across the \naisle and accomplish something? We did that in our committee, with \nstrong bipartisan support, and we achieved this true spending \nreduction. We eliminated four of the commodity programs.\n  I just had a colleague come in to visit with me this morning. He \nsaid: I looked at this farm bill and I couldn't figure it out. It is so \ncomplex I don't know how anybody can figure it out. That is pretty true \nin farm country too--trying to figure out all of the complexities, and \nwhen they go down to the farm service agency, trying to figure out what \nis in each program and which one they should pick. We eliminated four \ncommodity programs and made it much simpler. We strengthened and \nimproved crop insurance, which is the No. 1 issue we heard about in \nevery hearing we had. We eliminated $6 billion in conservation spending \nwhile streamlining 23 programs into 13 to eliminate duplication. When \nhave we heard: When are you going to start to streamline and reduce \nduplication? We have done that. We cut $4 billion in nutrition \nprograms--a painful cut for some, I understand that. But it is not \ngoing to affect anybody's payments so much as it is the $4 billion--\nthat is 82 percent, by the way, of the agriculture budget is in \nnutrition.\n  We have eliminated a grand total of more than 100 programs. Get this: \nWe have eliminated a grand total of more than 100 programs--I don't \nknow of any other committee that has done that--and authorizations \ntotaling nearly $2 billion in reduced authorizations alone. So we dealt \nwith not only mandatory spending but also $2 billion in authorizations.\n\n[[Page S3717]]\n\n  This is, as I have said, a reform bill. We need to get this thing \npassed. We need to get the farm bill passed. The current law expires on \nSeptember 30 of this year. Failure to pass the bill means we revert to \npermanent 1949 law that would provide absolute chaos in the \ncountryside. If we don't pass this bill by September 30, then we are \nback here voting on an extension. Who wants to extend the current farm \nbill? It is yesterday's farm bill. This is tomorrow's farm bill. We \ncan't go back to 1949, and I do not think we need to be in any business \nof trying to extend the current act when we have a true reform bill and \none that is fiscally sound.\n  The big thing is we need to provide set guidance to our producers and \ntheir lenders--our farmers, ranchers, bankers, all up and down Main \nStreet who depend on agriculture, including every rural community and, \nfor that matter, anybody who eats, every consumer. We are talking about \nthe hometown banker and the farm credit agencies so they can know \nexactly what this farm bill looks like when, as early as this August, \nthey will begin to discuss their operating loans for the coming year.\n  I know we are debating the motion to proceed at this time, but the \nchairwoman and I and our staffs are available. We are available. If \nsomeone has heartburn, we are available. We have the Rolaids; don't \nworry about it. Our staffs are available. Come to us if a colleague \nwants to discuss a possible amendment. Come to us and talk to us. We \nare working together in a bipartisan effort. I urge Members who intend \nto offer amendments to please come to us and allow us to begin working \nwith them now. We stand ready and willing and, with the help of \nMembers, able.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Always Free Honor Flight\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise to recognize a very special event \ntaking place tomorrow in our Nation's Capital: West Virginia's first \never Always Free Honor Flight, a free trip for our veterans to see the \nmonuments built for their service and sacrifice.\n  I have always said West Virginia is one of the most patriotic States \nin this great Nation, and we are so proud of the number of veterans and \nActive-Duty members who have served our country with honor and \ndistinction. The 31 veterans who are traveling to the Capitol tomorrow \nembody our State's history and contributions to the freedom of this \nNation: 12 of them served in World War II, 3 in the Korean war, and 16 \nin Vietnam.\n  I wish to tell my colleagues a little bit about this very special \ngroup. These heroes engaged in combat across the globe, fighting in the \nAleutian Islands, England, Normandy, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the \nSouth Pacific, the Philippines, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. Some served \nhere at home, servicing aircraft with ammunition. Some served in \nhistoric events such as the Battle of the Bulge, the liberation of the \nPhilippines, and the front in Japan. They took on different roles, \nserving as infantrymen, door gunners, ammunition soldiers, combat \nfighters, tactical fighters, and medics. One brave World War II veteran \nreceived the Legion of Honor Chevalier Award from the French Embassy.\n  These veterans come from all parts of our great State--from Welch to \nBeckley, to Huntington, to Princeton, to Bluefield, to Lester, and all \nthe places in between.\n  I especially wish to point out one special person. His name is Gene \nCecil Pennington of Princeton, WV, and he will be joining us tomorrow \nalso. He is the youngest West Virginia veteran of World War II, and \nthat is because he lied about his age to join the Navy in the 1940s and \nfirst saw combat--think of this--first saw combat at the age of 16. He \nis 83 now, and we are so proud he will be visiting with us.\n\n  In addition to the veterans visiting us, a number of volunteer \nescorts will also be accompanying them. Seven of these escorts will be \nrepresenting their deceased fathers who served in various wars \nthroughout the years. Three of our World War II veterans are \naccompanied by their sons who themselves are veterans of the Vietnam \nwar. Service is truly a family tradition in our State and in this \nNation.\n  Our veterans have a full day's journey ahead of them tomorrow. They \nwill leave Princeton, WV, at 2:15 in the morning, traveling here by \nbus. They will return to West Virginia after touring our beautiful \nCapitol Building, the World War II Memorial, the Korean War Memorial, \nthe Vietnam War Memorial, and the Iwo Jima Memorial. These monuments to \nservice and sacrifice have important meaning to everyone in this \ncountry, but I know our veterans will find special meaning tomorrow \nwhen they tour these sites.\n  This is the first time for many of these veterans to see these \nmonuments, which is why I am very grateful for the hard work of the \nWest Virginians who made this trip possible by bringing the Honor \nFlight Network to our State--the Denver Foundation and Little Buddy \nRadio located in Princeton, WV. These nonprofits were founded by Bob \nDenver--also known as Gilligan from ``Gilligan's Island''--and his wife \nDreama, a West Virginia native. Their love of West Virginia, their \nvision, and their dedication to service have truly been a gift to our \ngreat State.\n  The Honor Flight Network is an idea that started with Earl Morse, a \nphysician assistant and retired Air Force captain who wanted to honor \nthe veterans he had cared for over 27 years. Earl found that many of \nhis patients couldn't afford to see the monuments built to honor their \nservice, so he took it upon himself to make that happen.\n  Earl was also a private pilot, and he offered a free flight to a \nWorld War II veteran who was also his patient. One free trip led to \nanother, and with the help of more volunteers, Earl's efforts grew into \nthe Honor Flight Network. The first flight took place in May of 2005, \nand by the end of that year, Honor Flight had taken 137 World War II \nveterans to visit their memorial. The Honor Flight Network has expanded \nto cities and States around the country, and in 2011, the network \ntransported 18,055 veterans to see their memorials--at no cost to those \nveterans.\n  In West Virginia, we are lucky to have had the operations manager at \nLittle Buddy Radio in Princeton, WV, Charlie Thomas, introduce the \nHonor Flight to our State. Tomorrow, Charlie will be representing his \ndeceased father, Clifford Richardson, who served in the Navy during \nWorld War II.\n  I would also like to take a moment to thank the Vice President of the \nAlways Free Honor Flight, Dreama Denver, who is the widow of \n``Gilligan''--Bob Denver. She is representing her deceased father, Glen \nE. Peery, who served in the Army during the Korean War.\n  I would like to thank Pam Coulbourne, who has been instrumental in \nplanning West Virginia's first Honor Flight. She is representing her \nfather Francis Fluharty, an Air Force aerial photographer on a B 24 \nLiberator during World War II.\n  Thanks to Charlie, Dreama, Bob Denver, Pam, and the hard work of so \nmany others, 31 veterans will be traveling to Washington tomorrow on \nthis very special journey. I commend them for their dedication and for \ngiving West Virginia just one more way to say thank you to our veterans \nfor their service and sacrifice.\n  I have always said we owe our men and women who have served more than \na debt of gratitude. Showing our appreciation is something we should do \neach and every day. But tomorrow is a special day where we can pay \ntribute to those who have made the ultimate sacrifice for our great \nNation. I am so pleased I am able to greet some of our most courageous \nWest Virginia veterans who are all heroes. I ask the Senate to join me \nin honoring these 31 veterans and welcome them and their close friends \nand family to Washington, DC, tomorrow.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                             Security Leaks\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, over the past few months there has been \na\n\n[[Page S3718]]\n\ndisturbing stream of articles in the media and common among them, they \ncite elite, classified, or highly sensitive information in what appears \nto be a broader effort by the administration to paint a portrait of the \nPresident of the United States as a strong leader on national security \nissues--information for which there is no legitimate reason whatsoever \nto believe should be in the public domain. Indeed, the release of this \ninformation in these articles harms our national security and puts in \ndanger the lives of the men and women who are sworn to protect it.\n  What price did the administration apparently pay to proliferate such \na Presidential persona--highly valued in an election year? Access. \nAccess to senior administration officials who appear to have served as \nanonymous sources divulging extremely sensitive military and \nintelligence information and operations.\n  With the leaks that these articles were based on, our enemies now \nknow much more than they did the day before they came out about \nimportant aspects of our Nation's unconventional offensive capabilities \nand how we use them. Such disclosures can only undermine similar \nongoing or future operations and, in this sense, compromise our \nnational security. For this reason, regardless of how politically \nuseful these leaks may have been to the President, they have to stop. \nThese leaks have to stop.\n  The fact that this administration would aggressively pursue leaks \nperpetrated by a 22-year-old Army private in the Wikileaks matter and \nformer CIA employees in other leaks cases but apparently sanction leaks \nmade by senior administration officials for political purposes is \nsimply unacceptable. It also calls for the need for a special counsel \nto investigate what happened.\n  I am also pleased to report that Chairman Carl Levin has agreed, at \nmy request, to hold a hearing on these leaks in the Senate Armed \nServices Committee. The Senate Armed Services Committee has a \nresponsibility here, and I am grateful that Chairman Levin has agreed \nto hold a hearing.\n  In the latest of the recently published articles--published on June \n1, 2012, just a few days ago--the New York Times documented in rich \ndetail the President's secret decision to accelerate cyber attacks on \nIran's nuclear enrichment facilities with a computer virus that came to \nbe known as Stuxnet. The author of the article, Mr. David Sanger, \nclearly states that former and current American officials spoke to him \nbut refused to do so on the record because the program is both highly \nclassified and parts of it are ongoing. I repeat, the administration \nofficials discussed a most highly classified operation that is both \nhighly classified and still ongoing, an operation that was clearly one \nof the most tightly held national security secrets in our country until \nnow. And I might point out to my colleagues that this is all about the \nIranian effort to acquire nuclear weapons, which is one of the most \ndifficult national security challenges this Nation faces.\n  Other recent articles divulged critical and classified information \nregarding U.S. plans to expand the secret drone campaign against \nterrorists in Yemen and the Horn of Africa. One of these pieces was a \nsorry excuse for journalism that the New York Times published on May \n29, 2012, which Charles Krauthammer rightly observed should have been \nentitled ``Barack Obama--Drone Warrior.''\n  Finally, there was a recent so-called article about the so-called \n``kill list''--the highly classified list of counterterrorism targets \nagainst whom the President has authorized lethal action--in other \nwords, to kill. It was reported in that article on May 29, 2012, in the \nNew York Times that David Axelrod, the President's chief political \nadviser--who is running the reelection campaign as we speak--began \nattending the meetings in which this list was discussed. I repeat, the \nPresident's campaign manager was present and attending the meetings \nwhere lists of possible people to be eliminated through drone strikes \nwas discussed and decisions were made. The only conceivable motive for \nsuch damaging and compromising leaks of classified information is that \nit makes the President look good.\n  These are not the only times I have been frustrated about national \nsecurity-related leaks coming from this administration. The \nadministration similarly helped journalists publish some of the highly \nsensitive tactics, techniques, and procedures that enabled our special \noperations forces--including the classified name of the unit involved--\nto carry out the operation to kill Osama bin Laden last year. It is \nentirely possible that this flurry of anonymous boasting was \nresponsible for divulging the identity of Dr. Shakil Afridi, the \nPakistani doctor who assisted us in our search for Osama bin Laden and \nwhose public exposure led to his detention and a 33-year prison \nsentence in Pakistan. His name was divulged by members of the \nadministration, and he has been basically given a death sentence, a 33-\nyear sentence in prison in Pakistan. Our friends are not the only ones \nwho read the New York Times; our enemies do, too.\n  Let me be clear. I am fully in favor of transparency in government. I \nhave spent my entire career in Congress furthering that principle. But \nwhat separates these sorts of leaks from, say, the whistleblowing that \nfosters open government or a free press is that these leaks expose no \nviolations of law, abuses of authority, or threats to public health or \nsafety. They are gratuitous and utterly self-serving.\n  These leaks may inhibit the Nation's ability to employ the same or \nsimilar measures in its own defense in the future. How effectively the \nUnited States can conduct unmanned drone strikes against belligerents, \ncyber attacks against Iran's nuclear program, or military operations \nagainst terrorists in the future depends on the secrecy with which \nthese programs are conducted. Such activities are classified or \nenormously sensitive for good reason--in many cases, for reasons \nrelated to operational security or diplomacy. Their public disclosure \nshould have no place in how this or any other administration conducts \nitself. These are the kinds of operations and intelligence matters no \none should discuss publicly, not even the President.\n\n  With this in mind, I call on the President to take immediate and \ndecisive action, including the appointment of a special counsel, to \naggressively investigate the leak of any classified information on \nwhich the recent stories were based and, where appropriate, to \nprosecute those responsible. A special counsel will be needed because \nthe articles on the U.S. cyber attacks on Iran and expanded plans by \nthe United States to use drones in Yemen were sourced to--and I quote \nfrom the articles--``participants in the [cyber-attack] program'' and \n``members of the [P]resident's national security team.'' In the cyber \nattacks article, in particular, the author stated that ``current and \nformer American officials'' spoke to him anonymously about the program \nbecause ``the effort remains highly classified and parts of it continue \nto this day.''\n  What could be worse?\n  The suggestion that misconduct occurred within the executive branch \nis right there in black and white and is why a special counsel is \nneeded.\n  As part of this investigation, this special counsel should also \nscrutinize the book from which the New York Times cyber attacks article \nwas adapted, which was just released yesterday, for other improper or \nillegal disclosures.\n  Where classified information regarding cyber operations was leaked, \nthe President should assess any damage that those leaks may have caused \nto national security and how that damage can be mitigated.\n  In my view, the administration should be taking these leaks, \napparently perpetrated by senior administration officials, as seriously \nas it pursued those made by relatively low government personnel such as \nthe Army private in the WikiLeaks matter or the former CIA employee who \nprovided the New York Times with classified information about U.S. \nattempts to sabotage the Iranian nuclear program. The failure of the \nadministration to do so would confirm what today is only an inference--\nthat these leaks were, in fact, sanctioned by the administration to \nserve a pure political purpose.\n  As I continue to closely monitor developments in this matter, I hope \nto be proved wrong.\n  There is a Wall Street Journal article, ``FBI Probes Leaks about \nCyberattacks by U.S.'' I am glad the FBI is going to probe that. It \nsays Mr. Sanger, in an appearance on CBS News ``Face the Nation,'' \nsuggested that deliberate White House leaking ``wasn't my experience.''\n\n[[Page S3719]]\n\n  He added:\n\n       I spent a year working on the story from the bottom up and \n     then went to the administration and told them what I had. \n     Then they had to make some decisions about how much they \n     wanted to talk about . . . I'm sure the political side of the \n     White House probably likes reading about the President acting \n     with drones and cyber and so forth. National security side \n     has got very mixed emotions about it because these are \n     classified programs.\n\n  Mr. Sanger again is authenticating that senior members of the White \nHouse and our intelligence community decided to talk to him about \nclassified programs. Their motivation for doing so--perhaps we don't \nknow particularly at this time, but I don't think one could argue that \nthese articles have all conveyed the impression that the President is a \nvery strong warrior in carrying out his responsibilities as Commander \nin Chief, something I have disputed as far as Iraq, Afghanistan, and \nother national security issues, which I will discuss on another day.\n  I don't know how one could draw any conclusion but that senior \nmembers of this administration in the national security arena have \neither leaked or confirmed information of the most highly classified \nand sensitive nature. Some of these leaks have concerned ongoing \noperations. Since they were highly classified and sensitive \ninformation, that classification was there for a reason--the reason \nbeing that if that information was classified, it could harm our \nnational security.\n  These are very serious actions on their part. They are very serious \nactions when ongoing operations in the war against terror and the issue \nof Iranian acquisition of nuclear weapons could trigger attacks either \nby Israel or the United States to prevent such an eventuality. We now \nfind leaks which have exposed, not only to the American people but to \nthe Iranians as well, exactly what American activity is of the most \nsensitive nature. This is not a proud day for the United States of \nAmerica.\n  I ask unanimous consent that following the remarks of Senator \nChambliss, he and I be permitted to engage in a colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (Disturbance in the Visitors' Galleries)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I wish to thank my friend from Arizona \nfor his very direct comments on this very sensitive issue. As vice \nchairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, I can say \nwithout a doubt that these ongoing leaks of classified information are \nextraordinarily harmful to our intelligence operations.\n  Every day we ask our intelligence officers and agents to be out there \non the frontlines, putting their life in harm's way, gathering \ninformation, meeting sources, and using a variety of highly sensitive \ncollection techniques. Depending on where these officers are around the \nworld, the operating environment can be both dangerous and downright \nhostile. This means they have to be as much or more on guard to ensure \nthat operations don't get blown and their own lives and the lives of \nour sources are not jeopardized.\n  But each time classified information shows up in the media, the \nintelligence community's ability to do these dangerous assignments \nbecomes that much more difficult. Not only do these leaks tell our \nenemies how we do our jobs and therefore how they can block or impede \nour efforts, but with each leak our friends and allies are left to \nwonder how much they can trust us with their own secrets.\n  These are not hypothetical concerns. Senator McCain alluded to a \ncouple of anecdotes. Also, a few weeks ago, in the middle of an ongoing \noperation, we all--friends and enemies alike--learned the details of \nefforts to disrupt an al-Qaida plot to bomb a civilian aircraft. Up to \nthat point, most Members of Congress knew nothing about this operation. \nThat is how sensitive we were told it was. Unfortunately, rather than \nquietly recognize our--and, frankly, our partners'--successes and move \non with the business of protecting the American people, some in the \nadministration apparently decided that scoring political points in an \nelection year outweighed protecting our intelligence operations as well \nas our liaison relationship with our intelligence partners around the \nworld.\n\n  Whether we could have learned more from an operation that was cut \nshort by this leak will now never be known, but we have been warned by \nsome of our allies they will think twice before they share highly \nclassified information with us.\n  Unfortunately, the leak of the airline plot was no isolated incident. \nFrom kill lists and bin Laden movies to cyber warfare, it appears \nnothing is off-limits, nothing is too secret, no operation is too \nsensitive, and no source is too valuable to be used as a prop in this \nelection year posturing. The doctor associated with the bin Laden \noperation appears to be paying the price for this posturing. Following \npublic disclosures of his involvement, he has been sentenced to 33 \nyears in prison--a true life sentence of 33 years in prison in \nPakistan. This hardly provides incentive for anyone else to help us.\n  These disclosures--whether quietly sanctioned or not--are simply \nunacceptable, and they are against the law. This administration reminds \nus repeatedly that they are prosecuting more people for leaking \nclassified information than ever before, and I support that effort. But \njust as we hold ordinary government employees accountable for violating \ntheir oaths to protect our Nation's secrets, we must also hold the most \nsenior administration officials accountable. Recently, the FBI began an \ninvestigation into the scenario surrounding this latest bomb plot, and \nI applaud the FBI's efforts. Following the public disclosure in the \npress reports on comments made by senior administration officials, I \nsent a letter to Director Mueller and asked him to please include this \naspect of these leaks in his investigation. I received a letter back \ntoday that he is indeed going to do that, and I applaud that. I don't \nknow whether the reports are true. I have no idea. But if they are, \nthey are serious violations of the law having been conducted by senior \nadministration officials.\n  Beyond that, we still have to do more. So today I join with my good \nfriend Senator McCain from Arizona in calling for the appointment of a \nspecial counsel to investigate this pattern of recent leaks. Leaks \nshould never be tolerated, but leaking for political advantage is \nespecially troubling. There must be swift and clear accountability for \nthose responsible for playing this dangerous game with our national \nsecurity.\n  The Senator from Arizona has been around here a lot longer than me. \nHe has been involved in the world of national security for many years, \nboth on the frontline himself as well as a Member of this body.\n  Has the Senator from Arizona ever seen anything as egregious as the \npurported leaks that are coming from this administration on these \nhighly classified and sensitive number of programs that we have seen in \nthe last few days and weeks?\n  Mr. McCAIN. As my colleague well knows, the leaks are part of the way \nthe environment exists in our Nation's capital, and leaks will always \nbe part of the relationship between media and both elected and \nappointed officials. I understand that. I think my colleague would \nagree there have been times where abuses have been uncovered and \nexposed because of leaks so this information was made public, and we \nhave always applauded that.\n  There has also continuously been a problem of overclassification of \ninformation so government officials don't have to--be it Republican or \nDemocratic administrations--discuss what is going on publicly.\n  But I have to tell my friend, I do not know a greater challenge that \nthe United States faces in the short term than this entire issue of \nIran acquiring nuclear weapons. The President of the United States said \nit would be ``unacceptable.'' We all know the Israelis are going \nthrough an agonizing decisionmaking process as to whether they need to \nattack Iran before they reach ``breakout,'' which means they have \nenough parts and equipment to assemble a nuclear weapon in a short \nperiod of time.\n  Here we are exposing something that, frankly, I was never told about. \nI was never informed of Stuxnet, and it is ongoing, at least according \nto the media reports. So aren't the Iranians going to\n\n[[Page S3720]]\n\nlearn from this? I would ask my colleague, aren't the Iranians going to \nbecome more and more aware?\n  Drone strikes are now one of the leading methods of going after al-\nQaida and those radical terrorists who are intent on destroying \nAmerica. So now al-Qaida and our enemies, both real and others who plan \nto be, are very aware of the entire decisionmaking process in the White \nHouse.\n  I guess the most disturbing part--and I would ask my friend--it is \none thing to have a private, in the WikiLeaks matter, who had access to \nit, low-level members of certain agencies, one in the CIA who I know \nwas prosecuted, but this is, according to the articles that are \nwritten, the highest levels in the White House are confirming this \nclassified information and maybe even volunteering it, for all we know.\n  But there, obviously, has been a very serious breach of perhaps the \ntwo most important challenges we face: the Iranian nuclear process and, \nof course, the continued presence and efforts of al-Qaida to attack \nAmerica.\n  I wonder if my friend from Georgia would agree that these are two of \nthe most challenging national security issues America faces.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I think my friend from Arizona is \nexactly right. There have been rumors of the drone program for actually \na couple years now, maybe back almost into some period back into the \nBush administration. As a member of the Intelligence Committee, we were \nalways told--and rightfully so--this is a covert program and we simply \ncannot discuss it. So we never have. Now we pick up the newspaper, and \nover the last several weeks we have seen the President of the United \nStates discussing the drone program. We have seen the Attorney General \nof the United States discussing the drone program. We have seen the \nNational Security Adviser discussing the drone program. Yet, \ntechnically, we as Members of Congress--particularly members of the \nIntelligence Committee--cannot talk about this because they are covert \nprograms.\n  So there is simply no question but that our enemy is better prepared \ntoday because of these various leaks and public disclosures.\n  Let me move to the other issue the Senator has talked about, though, \nthe issue of the nuclear weaponization of Iran. There is no more \nimportant national security issue in the world today. It is a daily \ndiscussion at the United Nations, it is a daily discussion at the \nPentagon, it is a daily discussion in Israel and in virtually every \npart of the Middle East that we cannot allow for the country of Iran to \nbecome nuclear weaponized. Here, all of a sudden, we see public \ndisclosure, whether all of it is true or not, in a newspaper article on \nthe front page of an American newspaper, detailing a purported program \nof attack against that Iranian program.\n  What are our friends in the intelligence community to think? What are \nour friends in Israel to think? How much cooperation are they going to \nnow give us from the standpoint of disclosing information to the U.S. \nIntelligence community on any program if they can expect that--if this \nis, in fact, true--what they tell us is going to be on the front page \nof the New York Times? Not only that, but it is not coming from some \nprivate who went on the Internet and found a bunch of classified \ndocuments. It is coming from statements made, supposedly, by high-level \nadministration officials.\n  It puts us in a real--not a quandary. This is not a quandary. It puts \nus in a position of having to defend ourselves with our allies over \ncertain statements that purportedly are made by high senior \nadministration officials. I simply can never remember a scenario of \ninformation being leaked where we have the level of administration \nofficials that now supposedly have made these comments, and they are \nquoted by name in some instances.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I finally add, the disturbing aspect of this is \nthat one could draw the conclusion, from reading these articles, that \nit is an attempt to further the President's political ambitions for the \nsake of his election at the expense of our national security. That is \nwhat is disturbing about this entire situation.\n  I see our friend from Oregon is waiting to illuminate us, so I yield \nthe floor. I thank my friend from Oregon for his patience.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Forest Service Airtanker Fleet\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, yesterday I joined with Chairman Bingaman \nto introduce legislation to address an urgent threat to America's \nnational forests: the lack of resources to fight serious wildfires that \nat this very moment are burning on more than 300,000 acres in our \ncountry. To date--and it is certainly early in the fire season--more \nthan 830,000 acres already have burned.\n  The heart of the problem is, as the fires have gotten bigger, the \nForest Service airtanker fleet to fight these fires has gotten smaller. \nIn 2006, the Forest Service had 44 large airtankers under contract in \ntheir fleet. Last week, they had just 11 large airtankers under \ncontract, and 10 of those averaged 50 years of age.\n  After the very tragic events of this past weekend--in which one of \nthose airtankers crashed and its courageous pilots were killed and \nanother had a failure of its landing gear and sustained serious \ndamage--the Forest Service is down to nine large airtankers. This is an \nextraordinarily serious problem and a solution is long overdue.\n  The reason I have come to the floor this afternoon is that Congress \nhas an opportunity to expedite what could be the beginning of a \nsolution. The Forest Service now is ready to begin awarding contracts \nfor the next generation of airtankers, consistent with their large \nairtanker modernization strategy.\n\n  On May 25, as is required by law, under 41 U.S.C. 3903(d), the Forest \nService gave Congress a 30-day notification of its intent to award four \nmultiyear contracts, which contain cancellation ceilings in excess of \n$10 million and require congressional notification.\n  These four contracts would, in effect, begin to fill the Federal \nGovernment's need for large airtankers to fight wildfires. The 30-day \nwaiting period is simply delaying urgently needed action. Without \ncongressional action, these contracts will not be awarded until June \n25. My view is, with hundreds of thousands of acres burning and a \nseverely depleted capacity for sending airtankers to battle these \nfires, I see nothing that can be served by the Congress sitting on its \nhands and waiting for those 30 days to expire.\n  The Forest Service requested that Congress waive the requirement to \nwait the full 30 days to award these important contracts. The sooner \nthe Forest Service can award these contracts, the sooner the companies \nthat receive the awards can begin to deliver those next-generation \nairtankers and get them out fighting the fires.\n  I wish to be clear that I do not know the details of these contracts \nand have no idea as to which companies that submitted bids are going to \nbe the successful recipients, but I do know the Forest Service has \ncomplied with its obligation to notify the Congress. Congress has been \nnotified with the required information, and I just fail to understand \nhow the country is going to benefit by simply letting time pass. I urge \nmy colleagues to see how important and how serious this fire situation \nis and approve the critical legislation I have introduced with Chairman \nBingaman.\n  At this very moment, there are 11 uncontained large fires nationally, \n152 new fires that have been reported in just the last 24 hours, and \ndire predictions about hot and dry conditions combining with strong \nwinds, looming thunderstorms, and arid lands across much of our \nlandscape. All these factors contribute to a dangerous fire situation \non the ground. Yet, as we speak, the Forest Service now has only nine \nairtankers to assist those hard-working fire crews. Eight of those \ntankers are getting to the point where they ought to be considered \nmuseums in the sky.\n  While the Forest Service can and should use all possible assets--such \nas helicopters and innovative options such as the 20,000 gallon Very \nLarge Airtankers--and the agency is likely to need to call in the \nNational Guard, the large airtankers remain a critically important tool \nfor fire suppression. In fact, the firefighting agencies mobilized \nairtankers 153 percent above the\n\n[[Page S3721]]\n\n10-year average in 2011. Yet these planes needed to assist on-the-\nground firefighters have dwindled to the dire shortage--they have \natrophied to the point I have described this afternoon.\n  This lack of resources is coming at a time when the Nation's forests \nare very vulnerable to fire. The fire season is early, but we are \nalready seeing the production of record-breaking fires. Fire seasons \nare getting longer and they are more severe and we are seeing more and \nmore of what the professional foresters called a megafire.\n  From 2000 to 2008, at least 10 States had fires of record-breaking \nsize. The Forest Service indicated in its airtanker mobilization \nstrategy that the agency will need up to 28 of these airtankers in \norder to adequately battle fire threats. So the Forest Service says we \nneed 28. As of this moment, this afternoon, there are only nine.\n  I am asking today for the Senate to recognize the seriousness of the \nthreat and let the Forest Service proceed in awarding these new \ncontracts as rapidly as possible. The legislation Chairman Bingaman and \nI have introduced would enable the agency to do just that and begin to \ntackle this extraordinarily serious health problem.\n  In closing, I wish to express my thanks to all of America's \ncourageous and dedicated firefighters. They put themselves in harm's \nway to protect our communities, and we should be grateful to them and \nto the pilots and companies and agency personnel who tirelessly battles \nthese fires. I believe, on behalf of every Member of the Senate, it is \nappropriate to express our deepest condolences to the families and \ncolleagues and friends of the recently deceased pilots. I hope by \nadvancing the legislation I have described this afternoon, Congress \nwill be sending a message to those courageous firefighters and those \nwith whom they work that the Congress is beginning to put in place a \nsystem that would provide them real relief.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               DREAM Act\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, people wonder as they watch the Senate how \nbills get started. One of the bills that I have worked on probably the \nhardest in my career got started 11 years ago when there was a phone \ncall to my Senate office in Chicago. It was a phone call from a friend \nof ours, Duffie Adleson, who was managing a program called the Merit \nMusic Program.\n  It is a wonderful program in Chicago that offers opportunities for \nfree musical instruments and free music lessons for kids from some of \nthe poorest schools in town. The net result of it is a life-changing \nexperience. One hundred of the Merit Music Program graduates go on to \ncollege. It is transformative.\n  Well, she had a story to tell me. It was about a young lady named \nTereza Lee, Korean, who was a child prodigy when it came to the piano. \nShe played it so well she had been offered many scholarships, including \nto the Manhattan Conservatory of Music. When she went to fill out her \napplication, one of the questions was, What is your citizenship or \nnationality?\n  She turned to her mother and said: What is it, Mom? Her mom said: I \ndo not know. You see, they brought Tereza to America when she was 2 \nyears old on a visitor's visa. Her mom said: We never filed anything \nafter that.\n  Mom and dad became citizens. Brother and sister born here \nautomatically became citizens, but Tereza was a question mark. What am \nI? So she called Duffie. Duffie called the office, and we checked the \nlaw.\n  The law said Tereza Lee, who had lived in the United States for 16 \nyears, had to leave for 10 years and after 10 years could apply to come \nback into the United States. She did not know where she would go. Her \nfamily had come to Chicago from Brazil, originally from Korea. There \nwas no place to go, no other language that she spoke. This was the only \ncountry she ever knew.\n  So I wrote a bill and called it the DREAM Act. The DREAM Act said \nyoung people like her should be given a chance to become legal in \nAmerica, to earn their way into legal status. The bill basically laid \nout some conditions: First, that they came to the United States as a \nchild; second, they completed high school; third, they have no \nsignificant problems of moral character or a criminal record to speak \nof, and beyond that they had to do one of two things: finish at least 2 \nyears of college or enlist in the American military.\n  Well, when I introduced this bill it was bipartisan. In fact, as many \nas 13 Republican Senators would vote with me. But we never quite got to \nthat magic number of 60 votes in the Senate. We would get a majority \nbut never quite get 60 votes. Then over the years this political issue \nstarted changing. Unfortunately, we started losing support on the \nRepublican side of the aisle. Even those who were the original \ncosponsors of the bill started voting against it. They heard the talk \nabout amnesty and all the criticism. They were swept into the belief \nthat this should not pass.\n  But the bill is still very much alive, and it is the most important \nthing I have pending in the Senate, and has been for a long time. What \nit does, of course, is offer this opportunity.\n  I want to salute Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. He is a new \nRepublican Senator, conservative, who took a look at this issue and \nsaid this is not an immigration issue; this is a humanitarian issue. We \nshould offer these young people a chance, a chance to earn their way \ninto legal status.\n  He is right. He remembered when 600,000 Cubans left to come to \nAmerica to escape Castro's regime it was not the immigration system \nthat welcomed them; it was the humanitarian effort by the United States \nto allow them to find a home. What a difference they have made, a \npositive difference in this country, not just in Florida but all over \nthe country.\n  Look at Marco Rubio, a man who now represents Florida in the Senate. \nIt was his father and grandfather who made it here because of that \nhumanitarian gesture. He and I and many others are working now to try \nto find a bipartisan way to put this together again.\n  I have come to the floor countless times--dozens of times--to ask my \ncolleagues to think about this issue in real human terms. Almost every \nweek I come and tell the story of one of the students who would be \naffected by the DREAM Act. When I started on this issue, the DREAM Act \nstudents would hide in the shadows. They would wait in the darkness by \nmy car to tell me: I am one of those undocumented immigrants. I am one \nof those students who has no place to go.\n  Well, times have changed. They are now stepping up and saying: Look \nat me. Know who I am. Realize, as Senator Menendez has said on the \nfloor many times, these are young people who spent their entire lives \nwith their hands over their hearts pledging allegiance to the only \ncountry they ever knew. They only know one national anthem, and it is \nours. They think it is theirs. But technically, legally, they have no \nlegal standing.\n  Let me introduce you to a young man who has a great story. His name \nis Novi Roy. He grew up in Illinois. He was brought to the United \nStates from India as a child. He was an especially good student. Novi \nattended Evanston Township High School just north of Chicago, graduated \nwith a 3.9 grade point average.\n  During high school he volunteered working in the soup kitchen in \nRogers Park and continues to do that even today. He went to the \nUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, which we are pretty proud \nof, and he graduated with a bachelor's degree in economics. Just last \nmonth he had two master's degrees awarded to him, one in business \nadministration and one in human resources. He is 24 years old now.\n  His dream is to work in the health care field to try to provide \nhealth care protection to people who don't have it today. He said this \nin a letter he wrote me:\n\n       I love America for all its opportunities and, like any \n     other aspiring student, I want\n\n[[Page S3722]]\n\n     a chance to realize the American dream. I owe the State of \n     Illinois, its taxpayers, and America a huge debt of gratitude \n     for the level of education I have attained thus far. I am \n     confident that my education will serve me well enough to make \n     a difference in people's lives [and] there is nothing I \n     [would] like more than to give back to the community that has \n     been so good to me.\n\n  For the record, Novi, because he is DREAM Act eligible, is not \neligible for Federal assistance for education. These young people, \nDREAM Act students, have to work harder, borrow a lot more money, if \nthey can, or save it, and it will take longer to get through. But they \ndo it anyway because they are so determined to have a good life.\n  Novi has been offered jobs with Fortune 100 companies, but he cannot \nwork legally in America because he is undocumented. Novi came to the \nUnited States legally, and his family applied for legal permanent \nresident status. When their application was denied, Novi was placed in \ndeportation proceedings.\n  He never committed a crime. He grew up in this country. We have \nalready invested in Novi, obviously, with an outstanding education from \na great university. He has a potential to make America a better place. \nDespite these facts, even at this moment, Novi could be deported from \nthe United States.\n  In his letter to me, he said this about that possibility:\n\n       I have never entered the U.S. illegally, nor broken any of \n     its laws at any time. Unfortunately, my immigration case has \n     simply fallen through the cracks. I have lived here in \n     Illinois for the last 10 years, and my entire identity is \n     exclusively based on my life in the U.S. I have nothing to go \n     back to--no friends, no family, nothing. America is my home.\n\n  My office contacted Immigration and Customs Enforcement and asked \nthem to consider Novi's request that his deportation be placed on hold. \nWe just learned yesterday this request had been granted. But the \ndecision to put Novi's deportation on hold is temporary. It doesn't \ngive Novi permanent legal status, and he still is at risk of \ndeportation in the future. The only way for Novi to become a citizen is \nfor the DREAM Act to become law.\n  Would America be stronger and better if Novi Roy was deported? Of \ncourse not. He has all these years of education and his graduation from \nEvanston Township High School with a high GPA, two degrees from the \nUniversity of Illinois, and we would let him leave and go to some other \ncountry and use his talents to make their country better? That makes no \nsense.\n  He has overcome great odds to achieve the great success he has so \nfar. He doesn't have any criminal background problems or pose any \nthreats to this country. He would make America a better place.\n  Novi is not an isolated example. There are literally thousands of \nothers just like him around the country.\n  The DREAM Act would give Novi and other bright, accomplished, and \nambitious young people like him the chance to become America's future \nentrepreneurs, doctors, engineers, teachers, and soldiers.\n  Today, I again ask my colleagues to support the DREAM Act. Let's give \nNovi Roy and so many other young people like him a chance to contribute \nmore completely to the country they call home. It is the right thing to \ndo, and it will make America stronger.\n\n\n                             Overseas Visit\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, last week during the Senate recess I \ntraveled overseas to four countries: Ukraine, Turkey, Georgia, and \nArmenia. It was a lot of ground to cover in 5 days in a region with \nconsiderable history and great, challenging issues.\n  Before I go further on the matter, let me say for the record how \nimpressed I am with the men and women who work representing the United \nStates overseas. The ambassadors, all of their staff, the consular \nservice, the military attaches, and those working through the \nDepartment of Agriculture do us proud every day. Many make a personal \nsacrifice to represent our country. They are on the front line.\n  I thank Ambassador John Tefft in Ukraine, Ambassador Ricciardone in \nTurkey, Ambassador Bass in Georgia, and Ambassador Heffern in Armenia \nfor their public service. They are a reminder of why the relatively \nsmall amount of money we spend on our diplomatic and foreign assistance \nefforts makes a big difference in the world.\n  A visit through this region is a reminder of the legacy of the Soviet \nUnion and the challenges facing countries such as Ukraine, Georgia, and \nArmenia as they try to rebuild independent and democratic nations. They \ninherited an environmental degradation that had been virtually \ndestroyed by the Soviet Union, with broken economies built on a failed \nSoviet model and weak political and governing institutions. Sadly, \nthese countries are not just trying to build modern nations, but must \nat times face continued and increased pressure from Russia on issues \nsuch as security and energy.\n  Ukraine is a good example when it comes to energy. They continue even \nthough they face pressures from Russia to look west to the European \nUnion, the United States, and NATO. They long to be in partnerships \nwith the United States. We need to support that relationship, as well \nas the programs that help them transition away from the Soviet-era \nlegacy.\n  There isn't enough time to cover all the issues facing these \ncountries, but I will mention a few.\n  In Ukraine there has been a troubling development recently that \nthreatens to overshadow so much of the economic and democratic progress \nthey have made in recent decades. Specifically, this government \ncurrently in control has jailed former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko \nover her alleged wrongdoing regarding a contract for natural gas with \nRussia. Many people have read about her detention and hunger strike.\n  One need not agree with policy decisions of former politicians--and I \nam not here to judge whether that gas contract was sound, but I can say \nin a democracy one should not make a practice of jailing political \nopponents. It kind of discourages people from running.\n  Doing so has the bad taste of Lukashenko's dictatorship in \nneighboring Belarus--not exactly the model a modern democratic Ukraine \nshould follow. I have seen that firsthand where, the day after his \nelection, the last dictator in Europe jailed all of his political \nopponents. Talk about discouraging people from running for office.\n  As long as no criminal activity occurred, in a democracy voters \nshould decide at the ballot box if they did or didn't like policy \ndecisions of an elected official.\n  I had a heart-breaking discussion with Tymoshenko's daughter Eugenia. \nI was deeply troubled by some of the stories I heard about her mother's \ndetention.\n\n  I also had a hopeful meeting with Prime Minister Azarov and President \nYanukovich on many issues of shared U.S. and Ukrainian cooperation, as \nwell as the Tymoshenko detention. They are going to move on a timely \nbasis to deal with this detention, and I assured them that the West was \nwatching closely. I hope she will be released from her detention as \nquickly as possible.\n  My second stop was in Turkey. I have been there several times before. \nIt is a growing power in a region and the world, a thriving Muslim \ndemocracy and a strong NATO partner of the United States.\n  Turkey most recently agreed to build an important NATO radar base on \nits soil, an installation that is absolutely critical in keeping an eye \non Iran and its nuclear ambitions. It was a hard decision by Turkey to \nagree to this installation for NATO, and they made it. I thank them for \nthat. It makes the world a safer place.\n  Turkey is hosting on its border more than 20,000 refugees who have \nfled the violence in Syria. I visited one of these refugee camps in the \ntown of Kilis. Almost 10,000 refugees--more than 60 percent of them \nwomen and children--were given a good, clean safe place to stay there, \neducation for the kids, as well as health care.\n  The Turkish Government needs to be commended for the generous \nhospitality and kindness they provided to their Syrian neighbors \nfleeing Syrian President Assad's brutality. I wonder if the United \nStates would be as welcoming under those circumstances. Well, Turkey \nhas been and they should be commended for it.\n  I spoke with many of the Syrians in the camp, and they told me deeply \ntroubling stories about the violence\n\n[[Page S3723]]\n\nthey faced and why they had to leave everything behind and flee to a \nneighboring country. They were worried about family and friends who are \nstill in Syria--particularly given the massacre reported last week in \nHoula.\n  The international community must do more to end the violence and \nfoster a representative transition to democracy in Syria.\n  I have to note for the record that I saw my colleague, John McCain, \non the Senate floor. He, Senator Lieberman, and others have been to the \nsame place and have met with refugees and have strong feelings about \nSyria. I have to say, and I said this to the Syrian opposition I met \nwith, I don't believe there is an appetite in America for invading \nanother Muslim country or sending in our Army. We are war weary after \nmore than 10 years at it. What we are looking for is an international \norganization or others who will join in the effort to stop Bashir al-\nAssad.\n  We encouraged Russia to step up. It has always had a special \nrelationship with Syria. If Russia can bring the various parties \ntogether and end the violence and start a transition away from the \nbrutality of Bashir al-Assad, it will be in the best interest of Russia \nand of the world.\n  The Arab League needs to raise its voice about solving those problems \nin Syria. We cannot let Assad bring any further embarrassment to the \nnations around the world. He has proven himself unworthy of the support \nof Russia or any country.\n  I urge Russia to join the United States and Turkey and others to find \na timely way forward in Syria.\n  Georgia and Armenia are two other friends of the United States. In \nGeorgia, President Saakashvili has made great progress on democratic \nand economic reforms. He was a leader in the Rose Revolution. His term \nis ending soon, and I hope the ensuing election will serve as a model \nfor the region.\n  We should also not forget one important thing about Georgia. It is \nstill dealing with the aftereffects of the 2008 war with Russia that \nresulted in the breakaway republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. I \ninvestigated the South Ossetia borderline, and I saw the permanent \nRussian facility there. It is clear that Putin is trying to create a \nprovocative environment within Georgia today.\n  We need to take steps to make sure the EU six-point plan is worked \nout--a plan that wasn't implemented after the war. I hope displaced \npersons and communities in South Ossetia and those in Abkhazia as well \nwill have a chance to be reintegrated back into Georgia where they \nbelong.\n  We need to take the steps to eliminate and reduce unnecessary human \nsuffering. The EU has an important monitoring mission there, and I urge \nRussia and Georgia to work with them.\n  One last point about Georgia is that a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. \nMarine Corps, stationed at Tbilisi in our Embassy, reported on what is \na phenomenal thing going on. Georgia is not in NATO. President Obama \nhas said they can be, and will be, and should be. At this moment, \nGeorgia is contributing more forces and soldiers per capita than any \nnation on Earth to the NATO mission in Afghanistan. A lieutenant \ncolonel in our Marine Corps, who is training Georgian soldiers, said \nthey were great fighters. He went on to say: If you want to know how I \ncan prove that, I am sending them to Afghanistan to stand next to our \nU.S. Marines and help us in the fight. That is as great an endorsement \nany marine could give to another fighting soldier.\n  Lastly, Armenia. There are so many Armenians across America who have \nmade such a profound impact on our Nation--in fact, around the world. \nThe diaspora of Armenian citizens is larger than the current population \nof that nation. They have lived through terrible brutality and loss of \nlife. The genocide that occurred in the beginning of the last century \nmay have claimed as many as 1.5 million lives as Armenians were \ndisplaced from eastern Turkey, and it is a legacy they will always \nremember.\n  I visited the Armenian Genocide Memorial and Museum to pay tribute \nand acknowledge the great loss of life that Armenia has suffered. There \nwas a special tribute to Clara Barton, who may be remembered in \nAmerican history for her work in establishing nursing and health care. \nShe went late in her life--in her seventies--to Armenia to provide that \nsame kind of assistance. She is given special recognition in the \nGovernment of Armenia today. The Armenian Genocide Memorial pays \ntribute to the many Armenians who died during this terrible period and \nthe courageous leadership of those countries that went forward after \ntheir painful past.\n  I called on the President of Turkey, when I visited him, as I did \nseveral years ago, to work closely with the Armenians to try to resolve \npast differences and make an honest acknowledgement of the history \nbetween the two countries and try to work out a peaceful and \ncooperative relationship.\n\n  Mr. President, one encounter in Armenia in particular gave me hope \nthat such a path forward is possible. I met with six Armenians who had \nparticipated in U.S.-supported cross-border reconciliation programs \nwith Turkey. They were artists, journalists, business entrepreneurs, \nfilmmakers, and high school students. Some of their stories were deeply \nmoving.\n  One high school student named Victoria talked about the summer camp \nshe visited in Vermont with Turkish high school counterparts and how \nthey broke through stereotypes and started friendships. The filmmaker \ntalked about joint films made with Turkish counterparts and then shown \nat the Istanbul Film Festival. An entrepreneur in Armenia talked about \na service he set up to help businesspeople from Turkey work in Armenia \nand invest there.\n  These stories gave me hope that some of the painful wounds between \nthese countries can be healed.\n  Let me close by saying what a reminder these countries are of the \nimportance still played by American leadership all over the world. At a \ntime with so many economic and security challenges around the world, \nnow is not the time for the United States to retreat from the global \nstage.\n  I support the President's ending of the war in Iraq. I believe we \nshould remove our troops from Afghanistan as quickly as possible. I \nknow we have to remain engaged. The world still looks to us for \nleadership and values that they can build their countries' future on as \nwell.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

MORSE, SR.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the extraordinary \ncareer of Phillip D. Morse, Sr., who served the United States Capitol \nPolice with great distinction for 27 years, serving the final 5\\1/2\\ \nyears as Chief of Police.\n  Chief Morse entered duty with the Capitol Police in May 1985. After \ntraining, his first duty assignment was providing security and law \nenforcement to the Senate. Since that time, he has worked in many \ndifferent areas throughout the department, including the Containment \nand Emergency Response Team, Patrol Mobile Response Division, Capitol \nDivision, and Office of Professional Standards and Compliance. Chief \nMorse eventually moved to the Dignitary Protection Division, where he \nimplemented new financial management controls for the division and \nmanaged the overall security planning for the 2004 Democratic and \nRepublican Conventions.\n  In 2004, he was promoted to the rank of Captain and returned to the \nCapitol Division. Upon his promotion to Inspector, Chief Morse assumed \ncommand of the Capitol Division and oversaw all police, security, and \nprotective operations at the Capitol Building. During this time, Chief \nMorse established a Capitol Security Survey,\n\n[[Page S3724]]\n\nwhich addressed emergency procedures and protocols for prevention, \nresponse, and mitigation of critical incidents. In addition, he planned \nthe security, evacuation, and emergency response for the 55th \nPresidential Inauguration. He later served as deputy chief of the \nUniformed Services Bureau, the largest component of the Capitol Police.\n  On October 30, 2006, he was appointed as chief of the Capitol Police. \nAs leader of the nearly 1,800-officer force, Chief Morse has overseen \nenhancements in numerous areas, including recruiting, training, \ntechnology, community outreach, and emergency preparedness. During his \ntenure, Chief Morse oversaw the opening of the Capitol Visitor Center \nand the merger between the Capitol Police and Library of Congress \nPolice.\n  Throughout his career, Chief Morse has continuously exhibited \nexceptional skills as a crisis manager, security coordinator, \ninnovator, and team builder. Always leading by example, Chief Morse \nmotivated all who came into contact with him through his enthusiasm and \nflexibility. Thanks to his leadership and service, the Capitol Police \ntoday is a stronger, more professional, and effective law enforcement \nagency.\n  Born in Wilmington, NC, Chief Morse holds a Bachelor of Science and a \nMaster of Science degree in management from the Johns Hopkins \nUniversity. He is a loving and devoted husband and father of three \nchildren.\n  Speaking both for himself and the ranks of law enforcement officers \nwho serve the Congress, Chief Morse once stated, ``The security and \nprotection of this great institution is not only our job, but we \nconsider it a sacred duty and privilege to serve you, the Congressional \nstaff, and the millions of visitors from every corner of the world who \ncome to the United States Capitol complex every year.'' We have all \nbenefited from his distinction and dedication.\n  On behalf of the U.S. Senate, I congratulate Chief Morse on his well-\nearned retirement from the United States Capitol Police and salute his \ndistinguished career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/05/senate-section/article/S3724-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3724]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ.

CONNORS, JR.\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I rise today in tribute to \nJohn M. ``Jack'' Connors, Jr., of Brookline, MA, a larger-than-life \nfigure in a region with quite a few outsized personalities. A \nMassachusetts native, he grew up in the Roslindale section of Boston \nand graduated from Boston College. A born go-getter, to help pay for \ncollege Jack landed one of the greatest jobs in New England--selling \nhotdogs and peanuts at Fenway Park.\n  Not long after graduation, Jack cofounded Boston's Hill Holliday ad \nagency and spent the better part of 30 years as an ad man. Now a part \nof the Interpublic Group of Companies, Jack remains chairman emeritus \nof this leading agency. He is a fierce competitor in business and built \nhugely successful and profitable enterprises that employ tens of \nthousands and have contributed billions to the regional economy. In \nJuly, Jack will step down after a phenomenally successful 17-year \ntenure as chairman of the board of Partners Health Care Systems.\n  Partners began with the merger of two of our Nation's leading \nteaching hospitals, Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and \nWomen's Hospital. Of course, the real work of any merger comes after \nthe deal is signed, and when Jack was elected chairman of Partners' \nboard in 1996, he helped lead the integration and growth of the new \nnot-for-profit network.\n  Today, Partners is the largest health care network in Massachusetts, \nand with over 50,000 employees, the State's largest private employer. \nIt is also one of our Nation's great medical research centers. In fact, \nPartners is the largest recipient of National Institutes of Health \nresearch grants, a testament to their world-class scientists and \nfacilities.\n  Jack serves on the boards of many companies and organizations, \nincluding Covidien and Hasbro. He is also a trustee of Emmanuel \nCollege, his alma mater Boston College, and is a member of Harvard \nMedical School's Board of Fellows.\n  Throughout his career, Jack has been a relentless fighter for the \nless fortunate in the Boston area. From an early age, Jack worked \nclosely with Boston's leading charities, often providing pro bono ad \nwork for these nonprofits. Jack seemed to always know that any true \nmeasure of a successful life must include helping others.\n  Jack worked tirelessly to save many of the Boston Archdiocese's \nstruggling schools. As a businessman, he knew that rescuing these \nschools required more than throwing money at the problem--and by some \nestimates, Jack raised about $70 million for the cause--it also \nrequired a more businesslike approach to running these schools. So Jack \nencouraged the archdiocese to build parochial academies such as Pope \nJohn Paul II Catholic Academy that serve more than one parish. These \nacademies are now models of primary education and well over 95 percent \nof their students go on to college.\n  Over the years, Jack worked closely with Boston Mayor Tom Menino on a \nnumber of important projects to help enrich the lives of at-risk youth. \nAmong their more ambitious--and hugely successful--is Camp Harbor View. \nThis partnership with the city and the Boys & Girls Clubs of Boston \nhas, in a few short years, created a summer haven for nearly 800 young \npeople on Long Island off Quincy, MA. This remarkable program has a \nfull-time staff which stays in contact with campers and their families \nduring the school year.\n  In closing, it is a privilege for me to join Jack's friends, family, \nand colleagues in congratulating him on his retirement from Partners. \nAnd though Jack will be leaving Partners, we can be sure he will \ncontinue to have a larger-than-life presence in the educational, \ncultural, and business life of Boston. I thank Jack for his tremendous \nservice to the people of Massachusetts and wish him and his wife Eileen \nall the best in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/05/senate-section/article/S3724-3", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3724-S3725]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING SENATOR JAMES ABDNOR\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I rise today to mark the \npassing of a great public servant from South Dakota, Senator James \nAbdnor.\n  Senator Abdnor is remembered across South Dakota as a man that never \nlost touch with the people who elected him. Throughout his life, no \nmatter what office he achieved, he was in his heart the same small town \nSouth Dakotan he had always been. He traveled the world, but wherever \nhe went, he always took his hometown, Kennebec, SD, with him.\n  Before he was a U.S. Senator, Jim Abdnor served in the South Dakota \nState Senate in Pierre, and spent 3 years as Lieutenant Governor. In \n1972, he was elected to Congress, where he served three terms in the \nU.S. House. In 1980, he defeated Senator George McGovern to serve in \nthe Senate, and later headed the Small Business Administration for 2 \nyears under President Reagan.\n  Beyond his official titles, Senator Abdnor was also the son of a \nLebanese immigrant, an Army veteran, a farmer and rancher, an avid \nfollower of small town baseball, and a father-figure to many of his \nstaff members, who continue to carry out his legacy to this day.\n  Senator Abdnor was regarded as a decent and humble man, by both \npolitical supporters and opponents. He would be the first to admit that \nhe was not a flashy speaker, but, one-on-one, he had a way of \nconnecting with people. Plain spoken, straightforward, friendly, and \naccessible--there are few politicians like Senator Abdnor, and our \nNation is poorer for it.\n  As one South Dakotan recently wrote,\n\n       I may have voted for someone else, but I never voted \n     against Jim.\n\n  His service inspired countless South Dakotans on both sides of the \naisle, and we all mourn his passing.\n\n[[Page S3725]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/05/senate-section/article/S3725-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3725]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   REMEMBERING JUDGE ROBERT BOOCHEVER\n\n Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, today I wish to memorialize the \nHonorable Robert Boochever, a retired jurist of the 9th Circuit Court \nof Appeals. Born in New York in 1917, Judge Boochever led a \ndistinguished and balanced life while he helped to build a community, \ndefine the laws of a new State, and serve his country. Among the rarest \nof men, he is remembered as much for his love of family as for his \ncommitment to community and dedication to duty.\n  As a graduate of Cornell University's School of Law, Bob joined the \nU.S. Army Infantry and in 1941 was stationed in Newfoundland. There, \nCaptain Boochever met Connie, an Army nurse, who was to be his wife \nuntil her death in 1999. After his 1945 discharge, the couple came \nnorth to Alaska where Bob served as Assistant U.S. Attorney for the \nAlaska Territory.\n  In 1947 Bob entered private practice at the law firm Faulkner, \nBanfield, Boochever, and Doogan. For the next 25 years, he focused his \ndiverse talents on his firm, his family and his community. As the \nleader on more than a dozen community and professional boards, he \nhelped to shape the capital city of Juneau and the State of Alaska. \nWhether as president of the Juneau or Alaska Bar Association, Juneau \nRotary, or the Juneau Chamber of Commerce, Bob had a hand in policy \ndevelopment and quality of life for a developing territory and State. \nHe chaired Juneau's first city Planning Commission, helped to develop a \ncomprehensive plan, and served on the selection committee to choose a \nsite for the University of Alaska Southeast. He was recognized with an \nhonorary doctorate at UAS, and in 1974, was chosen as ``The Man of the \nYear'' for the Juneau Chamber of Commerce. He also received a \nDistinguished Alumnus Award from Cornell Law School.\n  A quiet man of many talents, Bob was an accomplished athlete. He \nlettered in four sports during high school and two at Cornell--football \nand tennis. In the Army he learned to ski, so in Juneau he helped to \ndevelop Eaglecrest, a highly acclaimed community operated ski slope. \nHis granddaughter, Hilary Lindh, got her start there and became a \nsilver medalist at the 1992 Albertville Winter Olympics.\n  A quiet man with a twinkle in his eye, Bob loved his family and, with \nConnie, helped to raise four wonderful daughters. Complementing \nConnie's love and advocacy for the arts, he was a poet, a writer, and \nplayed the piano, creating stories and songs for each of his children. \nHe championed family camping trips, bird watching, fly fishing, and \nmade major expeditions to explore for new places to fish. He wrote \nstories for publication in Alaska Magazine about his travels.\n  In 1972, ready for a new professional challenge, Bob accepted \nGovernor Bill Egan's appointment to the Alaska Supreme Court. During \neight years on the bench, he served four as Chief Justice. Many cases \nin which he played an integral part are frequently referenced, in \nparticular: Ravin v. State established the right to privacy in a \nperson's home; and Aguchak v. Mongtomery Ward limited a creditor's \nability to collect a debt against a rural Alaskan by filing a case in \nan Alaska court distant from their home.\n  Recognized for his protection of individual rights and liberties, \nJustice Boochever was tapped in 1980 by President Jimmy Carter to serve \non the Nation's largest appellate court, the 9th Circuit Court of \nAppeals. The first Alaskan so appointed, he presided as an active \nmember for six years before achieving senior status, which he held \nuntil his passing on October 9, 2011.\n  Praised as a man who wanted to improve the administration of justice, \nJudge Robert Boochever was someone who championed the rights of \nminorities and the disadvantaged. His colleagues have said he was the \nbest writer on the bench--succinct, clear, and to the point. He was a \nperson of integrity who was honest, warm and caring; and a gentle, \ngenerous man who was a tireless advocate.\n  Robert Boochever was among the best of men and a great Alaskan. We \nare better because of his caring and compassion for family and \ncommunity, his commitment to public service and fair adjudication, and \nhis outstanding contributions and investments in the humanities.\n  Our deepest condolences are extended to his family--daughters Barbara \nLindh, Ann Boochever, Linda Boochever, and Miriam Medenica; step-\ndaughters Betty Thompson, Joan Stark and Laurie Craig; his 11 \ngrandchildren; and his 3 great-grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/05/senate-section/article/S3725-2", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3725]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO ERNIE YATES\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to my \nfriend Ernie Yates, the dynamic California labor leader who is retiring \nnext month after 49 years as a member, business agent, and officer of \nTeamsters Local 665 in San Francisco.\n  Ernie was born in San Francisco in 1946 and attended Mission High \nSchool. At age 17, he got a job at Allright Parking and joined Local \n665.\n  In 1977, Ernie was appointed as the business agent for Local 665 and \nhis assignments included policing labor agreements and processing \ngrievances in a variety of crafts, including the rent-a-car, parking \ngarage, shuttle bus, and taxicab industries. Three years later, he was \nelevated to the executive board of Local 665 and became its president. \nThroughout the next decade, Ernie negotiated Teamster regional, master, \nand white paper contracts in all of the core automotive industries \nunder the local's jurisdiction.\n  In 1992, with the active support of hundreds of Local 665 members, \nErnie was elected secretary-treasurer, the principal officer of the \nunion, a position he has held until his announced retirement in 2012.\n  During his 35 years as an officer and business agent of Local 665, \nErnie honed his skills as an expert labor negotiator. In both good and \nbad economic times, Ernie has used these skills to bring fair and just \ncontract settlements to thousands of workers at Teamster worksites \nthroughout the San Francisco Bay Area.\n  Ernie has been married to his beloved wife Janet for 47 years. \nTogether they have two sons, Michael and Mark; a daughter, Kimberly; 12 \ngrandchildren and 4 great-grandchildren.\n  On June 12, 2012, Teamsters Local 665 will celebrate Ernie's decades \nof service to the union's membership and the working families of \nCalifornia. I am honored to join them in saluting a great Californian \nand a great American, Ernie Yates.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/05/senate-section/article/S3725-3", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3725-S3726]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO SUE GLADHILL\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \nextraordinary accomplishments of T. Susan Gladhill, MSW, who will be \nretiring as Chief Government & Community Affairs Officer and Vice \nPresident after more than three decades of service to the University of \nMaryland, Baltimore--UMB.\n  Sue began her career at UMB as an instructor at the School of Social \nWork, where she had earned her Master's degree in Social Work. Then, \nshe joined the president's office, first as an assistant in government \naffairs. One of her first tasks was to secure passage of legislation to \nprivatize the University of Maryland Hospital. During Sue's tenure, she \nhas served as associate vice president for government affairs, vice \npresident for government affairs, and--since 1995--vice president for \nexternal affairs, a position which also includes managing UMB's \ncommunications and development. Sue has done an admirable job \nrepresenting the University of Maryland's legislative interests. She \nhelped to acquire construction funding for the R. Adams Cowley Shock \nTrauma Center and she was involved in landmark legislation that re-\nestablished the University System of Maryland as a public corporation. \nShe also worked on passage of the Public Private Partnership Act, which \nmade it possible for university faculty to enter into business \nrelationships with the private sector. This act was critically \nimportant with regard to establishing a highly successful technology \ntransfer program.\n  Sue has also been a prolific fundraiser for the university, raising \nmoney for the Health Sciences & Human Service Library and the Schools \nof Social Work, Nursing, Law, Dentistry, Pharmacy, and Health Science \nFacilities I, II, and III. She has raised funds for renovating research \nspace in Howard Hall. She was instrumental in establishing an \ninstitutional-affiliated foundation\n\n[[Page S3726]]\n\nknown as the University of Maryland Baltimore Foundation, which has \ngrown its assets to just under $200 million since 2000. She is the \nfoundation's president and chief executive officer. Through it all, Sue \nhas also managed to serve as an adjunct clinical associate professor at \nthe University of Maryland School of Social Work.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Sue Gladhill for her \ndedicated service and consummate leadership at the University of \nMaryland, Baltimore. She has contributed greatly to the success of the \nexcellent education and services provided by the University of \nMaryland's prestigious graduate schools and medical center, and she \nwill be missed. Please join me in wishing her well in her retirement. \nShe certainly has earned it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/05/senate-section/article/S3726-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3726]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        AROOSTOOK COUNTY, MAINE\n\n Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, Aroostook County in far northern \nMaine has long been a thriving center of farming and logging. In the \nearly years of the 20th century, it seemed that the only barrier to \ngrowth and prosperity was a shortage of modern health care facilities \nand trained medical professionals.\n  Two local citizens took it upon themselves to remove this barrier. By \nhorse and wagon, Frank White, an attorney, and Charles E. Hussey, a \nfarmer, traveled through the countryside calling on their neighbors and \ncollected $2,500 to establish a center for health care. In the spring \nof 1912, Presque Isle General Hospital opened with 20 beds, an \noperating theater with the latest equipment, four physicians, and a \ntraining school for nurses.\n  Much has changed during the past 100 years. What began in one three-\nstory converted house as Presque Isle General is known today as the \nAroostook Medical Center, TAMC, with facilities in Presque Isle, Mars \nHill, and Fort Fairfield, an ambulance service, and outreach services, \nsuch as a dialysis center and primary care clinics, throughout the \nnorthern part of the largest county east of the Mississippi. It has a \nmedical staff of more than 60 trained professionals and a workforce of \nmore than 1,000, making it the region's largest employer.\n  What has not changed is the spirit of service that is the foundation \nof this remarkable organization. As one who was born and raised in \nAroostook County, I am proud of what has been accomplished there and \ngrateful for the contributions and dedication over the generations that \nhave made this invaluable community resource possible.\n  The commitment that established the region's first public hospital in \n1912 was not a one-time event. Less than a decade later, the growing \npopulation created the need for a larger hospital. Another, even more \nsuccessful fund drive led to the opening in 1921 of a facility with \nmore than twice the beds and vastly expanded services. In 1960, a \ncapital campaign of unprecedented size for this area established the \nA.R. Gould Memorial Hospital that continues to grow and serve Aroostook \nresidents.\n  The namesake of today's hospital is of special significance to my \nSenate colleagues. Arthur Robinson Gould was a Presque Isle \nentrepreneur who built a lumber mill, powerplants, and an electric \nrailroad. In 1926, he was elected to the U.S. Senate to fill the term \nof Senator Bert M. Fernald, who died in office. Senator Gould is best \nremembered for the courageous stand he took against the Ku Klux Klan at \na time when that hateful group was gaining prominence in American \npolitics. Despite the esteem in which he was held, Senator Gould chose \nnot to run for reelection in 1930, saying, ``I want to get back to my \nrailroad and the pine forests of Maine.''\n  That simple statement describes the affection the people of Aroostook \nCounty have for their home and helps to explain how they could join \ntogether to create, sustain, and grow a modern health care \norganization. By proclamation of the Governor of Maine and the city of \nPresque Isle, June 9, 2012, is the official day of celebration for this \ngreat centennial. I am honored to commemorate the occasion by \ncongratulating the men and women of the Aroostook Medical Center and \nthe people of Aroostook County for 100 years of accomplishment, and I \nwish them the best in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/05/senate-section/article/S3726-2", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3726]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE B 52\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to recognize the men and women of our United States Air \nForce on the 60th anniversary of the B 52 Stratofortress strategic \nbomber.\n  On April 15, 1952, 60 years ago, America's first B 52 lifted off on \nits maiden flight. This year also marks 50 years since the last B 52, \ntail number 61 040, rolled off the assembly line in Wichita, KS, and \nwas delivered to Minot Air Force Base in the great state of North \nDakota. Through its unwavering service during and after the Cold War, \nthe B 52 has shown itself as a time-tested and proven solution for the \nlong-range strike and nuclear deterrence missions and become an iconic \nsymbol around the world of America's dedication to ``peace through \nstrength.'' Half a century after this jet was developed and fielded to \nguarantee nuclear deterrence of the Soviet Union, it played a critical \nrole in military operations after September 11. No other airframe in \nthe history of the Nation has done more to keep this country strong and \nsafe than the B 52.\n  The Boeing Company originally built 744 B 52s. As the global \nenvironment evolved, many of these have since been retired. \nNonetheless, 74 aircraft remain in the fleet--more than any other \nbomber. I sponsored legislation, later signed into law, which requires \nthe B 52 fleet to be maintained at no less than 74 aircraft and \npreserves the fleet through 2018. With appropriate funding, we expect \nthe remaining 74 B 52s to serve the Nation honorably until 2045.\n  The fact that the B 52 is still serving the United States today is a \ntestament to the innovation and dedication of the men and women all \naround this Nation who designed, built, maintained, supported and \nemployed the B 52 for over 50 years. In fact, these aircraft have been \nso thoroughly and effectively upgraded and modernized that they are \nprojected to continue to play a critical role defending our country for \nthe foreseeable future and beyond.\n  During this time of ever-tighter budgets, the B 52 is more important \nthan ever, because it is the most cost effective bomber in our \ninventory. Or, as the military would say, the B 52 provides great \n``economy of force,'' which means the B 52 brings a tremendous amount \nof ``bang'' for the taxpayer's dollar. B 52 modernization must be a top \npriority to ensure that ``the best bomb truck for the buck'' and its \nairmen can continue to meet emerging strategic challenges now and well \ninto the future.\n  The longevity, cost-effectiveness, and adaptability of the B 52 are a \ntestament to the quality of its design and procurement. In many ways, \nthe B 52 is the last great success story of American bomber design and \nprocurement. As the development of the new Long Range Strike Bomber \nmoves forward, we must demand the same innovative thought and \ndedication that led to the development of the B 52 in the 1950s. Our \nnew bomber must be cost-effective, reliable, and versatile. And it must \nbe produced on schedule, on budget and in quantity. Anything less would \nbe mismanagement we cannot afford, either fiscally or strategically.\n  2012 has been coined the ``Year of the B 52.'' This year, more than \never, we celebrate the American innovation and dedication that produced \nthis time-tested and tireless workhorse for the Nation. We also \ncelebrate and give our whole-hearted thanks to the men and women who \nkeep these great aircraft flying and keep our Nation safe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/05/senate-section/article/S3726-3", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3726-S3728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECOGNIZING THE 2011 SLOAN AWARD RECIPIENTS\n\n Mr. CRAPO.

Mr. President, today I wish to commemorate the \nbicentennial of the beginning of the War of 1812, on June 18, 2012, in \nthe Record.\n  President James Madison signed a declaration of war against Great \nBritain on June 18, 1812. The sacrifices by those soldiers, citizens, \nand their families who fought in the War of 1812 further defended the \nliberties previously won in the American Revolution. These sacrifices \ninclude heroic efforts by Dolley Madison to save some of our national \ntreasures from destruction during the burning of the White House by the \nBritish on August 24, 1814. The conflict and bravery shown during this \nconflict would inspire Francis Scott Key to write a poem describing the \nbombardment of Fort McHenry in Baltimore Harbor, and this would later \nbecome our country's national anthem, known as the ``Star Spangled \nBanner.''\n  The War of 1812 further solidified the independence of the United \nStates from Great Britain, and the Treaty of Ghent was signed on \nDecember 24, 1814, to end the War of 1812. Many Georgia residents can \ntrace their lineages back to these patriotic early settlers.\n  Descendants of the veterans of the War of 1812 chartered the Georgia \nState Society within the General Society of the United States Daughters \nof 1812 on June 18, 1901, to promote a general awareness of the history \nof the War of 1812 among the citizens of Georgia and the Nation. As we \nobserve the bicentennial of the War of 1812, I urge all citizens to \nbecome more knowledgeable of the role the War of 1812 played in the \nhistory of our great Nation and the State of Georgia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/05/senate-section/article/S3728-2", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          150TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, today I wish to \npay tribute to my alma mater, the University of South Dakota, on their \n150th anniversary. Throughout its history, USD has been a shining \nexample of excellence in education, research, and service. USD \nconsistently produces extraordinary graduates, prepared for the complex \nchallenges of modern-day society.\n  Founded in 1862 in Vermillion, USD has the distinction of being South \nDakota's oldest university. Since its founding, the campus has grown \nfrom one building to 63, serving a student population of nearly 10,000. \nUSD offers a complete range of undergraduate and graduate programs of \nstudy, as well as the only schools of law and medicine in South Dakota. \nStudents are well-served by USD's liberal arts tradition, which \nencourages interdisciplinary study. This produces adaptable, well-\nrounded graduates, prepared for the ever-changing world.\n  USD students have been awarded some of the most prestigious honors in \nacademia including Rhodes, Fulbright, Truman, Udall, and Goldwater \nScholarships. Graduate and undergraduate students frequently \ncollaborate one-on-one with USD's dedicated faculty to conduct \nresearch. This high degree of collaboration is enabled by the \nuniversity's 15 1 student-faculty ratio.\n  Athletics are an important part of university life, and USD is no \nexception. The iconic DakotaDome is the cornerstone of USD Coyote \nathletics. This multipurpose 145,000 square foot structure has brought \nfans and athletes together for more than 30 years. The Coyotes have \nmade the jump to division I, bringing increased exposure and a higher \nlevel of competition to the athletic program.\n  It is a great pleasure to have this opportunity to honor the \nUniversity of South Dakota for 150 years of academic success. USD is a \nfamily tradition; it is where I met my wife, Barbara, and when it was \ntime for our three children to attend college they all chose USD. The \nworld-class education I received at USD gave me skills and knowledge \nthat serve me well to this today. I congratulate my good friend, \nPresident Jim Abbott, and the entire USD community on this milestone in \nthe rich history of the university. As an alumnus, I would be remiss if \nI didn't close my statement with, ``Go Yotes!''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/05/senate-section/article/S3728-3", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ROYAL ROSARIANS\n\n Mr. MERKLEY.

A bill to require the Secretary of Transportation to modify \nthe final rule relating to flightcrew member duty and rest requirements \nfor passenger operations of air carriers to apply to all-cargo \noperations of air carriers, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am proud to join my colleague \nSenator Snowe in once am introducing legislation to improve aviation \nsafety.\n  The Safe Skies Act we are introducing today will close a loophole in \nthe Department of Transportation's recent rule on pilot fatigue, and \nensure that pilots of cargo planes are just as well rested and prepared \nfor their important work as the pilots of passenger planes who they \nshare airports and airways with.\n  Following the tragic crash of Flight 3407 in 2009, Senator Snowe and \nI introduced legislation to address several important aviation safety \nissues, including the need to update pilot fatigue regulations to \nreflect new, scientific research.\n  Under the new rule issued by the Department of Transportation, pilots \nof passenger planes will be limited to flying eight or nine hours, \ndepending on the start time. Minimum rest periods will be 10 hours, \nwith the opportunity for eight hours of uninterrupted sleep.\n  Unfortunately, cargo pilots were left out of the rule--which \nundermines the one level of safety we are trying to achieve in our \nairline industry.\n  Current rules regarding cargo flight operations permit cargo pilots \nto be on duty as many as 16 hours during a 24-hour period, regardless \nof when they begin their shift. Compared to passenger pilots, cargo \npilots are permitted to fly 60 percent more hours--as much as 48 hours \nin a 6-day period.\n  Keeping cargo pilots out of the improved flight and duty time \nregulations does not make sense; they too need rest in order to safely \nperform their jobs. And the safety of our skies depends on all pilots \nperforming well.\n  This legislation directs the Secretary of Transportation to apply the \nsame flight and duty time regulations for pilots of passenger planes to \ncargo pilots as well. This bill is supported by the Airline Pilots \nAssociation, the Independent Pilots Association and the Coalition of \nAirline Pilots Associations, and has been championed in the House by \nRepresentatives Chip Cravaack and Timothy H. Bishop.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this legislation \nas part of our ongoing efforts to improve the safety of our Nation's \naviation system.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 3265. A bill to amend the Federal Power Act to remove the \nauthority of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to collect land \nuse fees for land that has been sold, exchanged, or otherwise \ntransferred from Federal ownership but that is subject to a power site \nreservation; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n[[Page S3732]]\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we often hear refrains of the need to \nmake government policies more fair, clear, or simple--especially when \nthese policies involve the collection of fees or taxes. Today I rise to \nintroduce legislation to fix an inherently unfair policy by prohibiting \nthe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission from charging land-use fees \nfor hydropower projects that are no longer located on federal land.\n  FERC is responsible for licensing private, municipal and state \nhydropower projects. Pursuant to the Federal Power Act, the Commission \nis authorized to collect fees from project owners for those hydro \nprojects located on federal lands. The rationale behind these land-use \nfees is to recompense the United States for the ``use, occupancy, or \nenjoyment'' of its federal lands. The Federal Government is, in some \nsense, a landlord for these types of projects, and can collect just and \nreasonable rent from its tenants. The current level of these rents is a \nseparate issue--which I encourage all of my colleagues to examine as \nwell since FERC is seeking to change its collection methodology and \nincrease those fees--but today I am focused on how a technicality in \nfederal law allows the government to continue to collect land-use fees \neven when the land at issue has been transferred out of federal \nownership. Under current law, if the Federal Government sold the land \nunderneath a hydropower project to the operator, or transferred it into \nstate ownership, FERC would continue to assess full land use fees \nagainst the operator. This untenable situation is like a landlord \ncontinuing to collect rent from a tenant even after the tenant buys the \nhouse outright!\n  While the inherent unfairness of such a scenario is clear, the \nstatutory and regulatory web that has created this snare is extremely \ncomplex. In addition to allowing for the collection of federal land-use \nfees, the Federal Power Act also contains a section regarding Power \nSite Classifications, or PSCs. A PSC attaches to the land when a \npreliminary hydropower license application is made, and entitles the \ngovernment, or its designees, to enter the associated land and develop \na hydropower project if some other person or operation is occupying it. \nThese classifications are similar to easements, in that they \npermanently attach to the title of the lands. The purpose of PSCs is to \nmake sure that hydropower can be developed in the limited number of \nareas on federal land that are suitable, and furthermore that once such \nan area is identified by a preliminary application, that the site is \nnot then diverted to an alternate use.\n  However, FERC has interpreted the statutory fee collection provisions \nto give these PSCs another affect that is not in keeping with this \npurpose--to charge land-use fees from existing hydropower operators in \ncases where the Federal Government no longer owns the land. In such a \ncase, there is no need for a PSC to preserve the hydropower value of \nland as it is already being used for power production. Nor is the \nFederal Government somehow missing out on other beneficial uses of the \nland, because it no longer owns the land at issue. But FERC's current \ninterpretation of the FPA is that a PSC qualifies as a significant \nenough interest in the associated land to justify the collection of \nfull land-use fees.\n  When I first learned of this issue, I asked FERC for a list of the \nhydropower projects for which it was collecting these PSC-based federal \nland-use fees. Apparently, while FERC has been perfectly capable of \ncollecting these fees, it has been less diligent in keeping track of \nwhich projects are located on lands that 2 have since been transferred \naway from federal ownership. Despite numerous requests from my office, \nFERC was unable to produce even a possible list of impacted projects. \nConsequently, my staff attempted to survey the number of affected \nprojects by consulting with both the National Hydropower Association \nand the Alaska Power Association. This search identified 15 possible \nprojects subject to these PSC land use fee collections--10 of which are \nlocated in my home state of Alaska. While some may dismiss these fees \nas being relatively minor, I can tell you that these annual federal \nfees for land not even owned by the Federal Government can represent a \nsignificant hardship for my constituents.\n  The bill I am introducing today would put a halt to this kind of fee \ncollection. It simply says that when FERC is making fee determinations, \nit cannot take PSCs into account. Therefore, the only land that the \nFederal Government will be able to collect ``use, occupancy, and \nenjoyment'' fees is for land that it actually owns. I hope all of my \ncolleagues can agree this treatment is a fair resolution of the issue \nand I ask for their support.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3265\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
