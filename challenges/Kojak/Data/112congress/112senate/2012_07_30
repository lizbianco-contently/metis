The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are on the motion to proceed to S. 3414, \nwhich is the cybersecurity bill. This is postcloture. At 4:30 p.m., the \nSenate will proceed to executive session to vote on the nomination of \nRobert Bacharach, of Oklahoma, to be a U.S. circuit judge for the Tenth \nCircuit. This likely will be our last vote on a circuit judge for this \nCongress. I hope we can be successful. This is a person whom I will \ntalk about a little bit, and he is certainly well qualified. He came \nout of committee unanimously.\n  At 5:30 p.m., today, there will be a cloture vote on the Bacharach \nnomination. If cloture is not invoked on the Bacharach nomination, the \nSenate will resume legislative session and begin consideration of the \ncybersecurity bill following the vote.\n\n\n               Measure Placed on the Calendar--H.R. 6082\n\n  I am told H.R. 6082 is at the desk and due for a second reading.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the bill by \ntitle.\n  The assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 6082) to officially replace, within the 60-day \n     Congressional review period under the Outer Continental Shelf \n     Lands Act, President Obama's Proposed Final Outer Continental \n     Shelf Oil & Gas Leasing Program (2012-2017) with a \n     congressional plan that will conduct additional oil and \n     natural gas lease sales to promote offshore energy \n     development, job creation, and increased domestic energy \n     production to ensure a more secure energy future in the \n     United States, and for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I object to any further proceedings with \nregard to this bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard. The bill will \nbe placed on the calendar.\n\n\n                          Middle-Class Tax Cut\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I was glad to hear Speaker Boehner say last \nweek he will bring the Senate-passed middle-class tax cut to the House \nfloor for a vote. I heard again today he is going to hold to what he \nsaid. I think that is very good.\n  Our struggling Nation is one vote away from avoiding the fiscal cliff \nfor middle-class families. Every Member of the House of Representatives \nshould have an opportunity to show where they stand: with millionaires \nor the middle class. Members can support the Democrats' plan to cut \ntaxes for 98 percent of Americans while reducing the deficit by almost \n$1 trillion or they can support the Republican plan to hand out more \ntax breaks to millionaires and billionaires, increasing taxes for 25 \nmillion American families struggling to put kids through college or \neven food on the table.\n  The two approaches demonstrate a glaring difference in priorities. \nThere is another difference between the two plans. The Democrats' \nproposal is the only one with a chance of becoming law. President Obama \nsaid he would sign it tomorrow. What he will not do is sign into law \nany more wasteful giveaways to the wealthiest 2 percent.\n  The Senate has defeated the Republican proposal in a bipartisan vote, \nso it is simply a waste of time for House Republicans to continue to \npursue their middle-class tax hike. House Republicans should stop \nholding the middle class hostage to extract more tax cuts for the \nrichest of the rich. They\n\n[[Page S5632]]\n\nshould pass our middle-class tax cut now. American families cannot \nafford to wait until the last moment to find out how their bottom line \nwill look come January 1. People are sitting around their kitchen \ntables now trying to figure out whether they can afford to buy a home \nor rent a home, should they send their kids to college or trade school \nor should they or can they retire? Republicans shouldn't force 114 \nmillion families to guess whether they will have $1,600 less to spend \nor save next year. They certainly need to do something and do it now, \nand one simple vote can give them that certainty.\n  Mr. President, cybersecurity is basically a new word. Today, the \nSenate also continues to work to address this problem. This is a \nproblem that national security experts call the most urgent threat to \nour country; that is, weakness in our defense against cybersecurity. \nCyber terrorism could cripple the computer networks that control our \nelectrical grid, water supplies, sewers, nuclear plants, energy \npipelines, transportation networks, communications equipment, and \nfinancial systems, to name a few. GEN Martin Dempsey, chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, said: ``A cyber attack could stop this society \nin its tracks.'' Cyber espionage does not just threaten our national \nsecurity, it threatens our economic security as well. Hackers have \nalready attacked one of the most important businesses we have in \nAmerica today, the Nasdaq stock exchange. Major corporations are under \nattack every day, spending millions and millions of dollars to protect \nagainst cyber attacks. These attacks cost our economy billions of \ndollars a year and thousands of jobs.\n  GEN James Clapper, Director of National Intelligence, said Chinese \ncyber theft of American intellectual property is ``the greatest \npillaging of wealth in history.''\n  ``That's our future disappearing in front of us,'' added GEN Keith \nAlexander, Director of the National Security Administration.\n  In a report released last year, the American Chamber of Commerce said \nthe government and private sector should work together to develop \nincentives for businesses to voluntarily act to protect our Nation's \ncritical infrastructure. The legislation before this body today does \nexactly that. It establishes a public-private partnership to make our \nNation safer and protect American jobs. I hope the Chamber will join in \nour efforts to pass this important legislation.\n  I personally believe this bill could go further to address the \ncritical infrastructure, such as the networks operating our electrical \ngrid, our water supply, and other life-sustaining systems. It is a \ntremendously important first step.\n  I applaud Senators Lieberman, Collins, Feinstein, and Rockefeller for \ntheir work on this legislation. The bill managers are compiling a list \nof relevant amendments for consideration. I hope we can cooperate to \nwork through the list and pass this legislation this week. We can't \nafford to fail to address what experts have called the greatest \nsecurity challenge since the dawn of the nuclear age.\n\n\n                          Bacharach Nomination\n\n  I said I would talk a little bit about Judge Bacharach, and I intend \nto do that now.\n  Today, the Senate will vote on whether to end a filibuster of Judge \nRobert Bacharach, a nominee from Oklahoma to the Tenth Circuit Court of \nAppeals. By any measure, this man is the type of noncontroversial \nnominee the Senate would routinely confirm with broad bipartisan \nsupport. He was reported out of the Judiciary Committee by voice vote. \nEverybody said he is a good guy. He has the support of two Republican \nSenators from his State of Oklahoma. Senator Coburn, the junior Senator \nfrom Oklahoma, said Friday that Judge Bacharach is a stellar candidate \nand ought to get through.\n  Yet Republicans have signaled they are going to block his nomination. \nIf they hold up this consensus candidate, it will be the first time an \nappeals court nominee with this bipartisan support has ever been \nfilibustered on the floor.\n  Why should we ever be surprised? We have already had 85 filibusters, \nso we can add another one to it. I hope they don't filibuster this good \nman. I have already said this would be our last circuit court judge. It \nis too bad that is the case.\n  If Senator Coburn and Senator Inhofe broadly support this qualified \nnomination, blatant partisanship will be to blame. Senator Coburn said \nJudge Bacharach is ``an awfully good candidate caught in election-year \npolitics.''\n  Will the Chair announce the business of the day.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nleadership time is reserved.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                            Higher Education\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, 2 years ago, not long after I became \nchairman of the Senate's Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee, I made the decision to undertake an investigation of the \nfor-profit sector of higher education.\n  My reason for doing so was compelling: Congress had just finished \nmaking huge new investments in the Pell grant program; meanwhile, \nenrollment in for-profit colleges had increased 225 percent over the \nprevious 10 years compared to 31 percent for the rest of higher \neducation.\n  So this is what we were looking at, as shown on this chart. The \nenrollment in the for-profit sector kept going up, and finally, in \n2006, it took a huge increase--up from 765,000 in 2001 to 2.5 million, \nalmost, in 2010. So while students at for-profit colleges made up \nbetween 10 and 13 percent of all the students, for-profit colleges now \nwere receiving almost 25 percent of all student loans and Pell grants.\n  Meanwhile, troubling reports began to surface: prospective students \nbeing lied to by aggressive recruiters; other recruiters showing up at \nwounded warrior facilities and homeless shelters; students saddled with \na mountain of debt, unable to find jobs.\n  Two years later, our investigation is complete. The committee has \nheld 6 hearings, issued 30 document requests, compiled data from \nmultiple agencies, interviewed many former students and employees, and \ncompiled a fact-based authoritative public record.\n  Earlier today, we announced the release of our final report called \n``For-Profit Higher Education: The Failure to Safeguard the Federal \nInvestment and Ensure Student Success.''\n  This report provides a detailed explanation of how Congress has \nfailed to properly monitor student outcomes in this sector of higher \neducation or to safeguard the enormous investment taxpayers are making.\n  As this next chart shows, Pell grants going to the for-profit sector \nhave grown from $2.5 billion to $8.8 billion, in just 5 years. Again, \nthis is what we are looking at. Just think, that we had to do \nsomething; and look at this: $2.5 billion, up to $8.8 billion, in 5 \nyears. These are Pell grants. As I said, about 10 percent of the \nstudents, 25 percent of all the Pell grants. This was twice as fast as \nanything else in higher education.\n  As the chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee that funds Pell \ngrants, we work very hard to make sure Pell grants keep up, that we \nincrease them. So it was distressing and outrageous to learn that a \ndisproportionate share of this Federal investment is going to schools \nthat are raking in big profits but failing to educate our students.\n  I will now put up another chart.\n  You have to ask the question: Has the American taxpayer gotten an \nacceptable return on this huge investment in students attending school \nin the for-profit sector? The answer is a resounding no.\n  More than half of the students who enrolled in 2008 and 2009 had \nwithdrawn by 2010. At many of them, as the chart shows, the withdrawal \nrate was 67 percent, as shown here for Ashford University.\n  What this means is, for students who signed up at one of these \nschools and\n\n[[Page S5633]]\n\ngot a loan, got a Pell grant, 1 year later 50 percent of them were not \nthere. It was as high as 67 percent of students at Bridgepoint, Ashford \nUniversity, who were not there.\n  So you say: Well, what happened to the money? Guess what. Bridgepoint \ngot the Pell grant. Bridgepoint got the Stafford loan. The student \ndropped out, and the student has the debt.\n  The student has the debt, and the student has nothing to show for it: \nno appreciable skill, no diploma, nothing. In fact, they are worse off \nthan when they started because now they have a huge debt hanging around \ntheir neck. I just want to say that in this report, what we will find \nis overwhelming documentation of exorbitant tuition, unsavory \nrecruiting practices, abysmal student outcomes, taxpayer dollars spent \nexcessively on marketing and pocketed as profits, and regulatory \nevasion--regulatory evasion and manipulation.\n  I will have more to say about that later. Again, these practices are \nnot the exception, they are the norm. They are systemic throughout the \nindustry. There are, of course, individual exceptions. Again, there are \nreal differences among the various for-profit colleges. That is why we \ntook profiles of 30 different companies. We took 15 that were publicly \nowned, investor owned, and we took 15 that are more private. We took \nsome from the biggest to the smallest so we would have a broad picture \nof what was happening in this industry.\n  Now, again, compared to the industry overall, some for-profit \ncolleges are doing a better job for their students. I would mention \nStrayer, Walden, National American University, and American Public \nUniversity--all private, for-profit schools doing a much better job for \ntheir students.\n  There are also for-profit colleges that have had serious \nshortcomings. But they are beginning to make some changes. They are now \nopen to new thinking about how to improve student outcomes. I would \ninclude in this list Kaplan, DeVry, and Apollo, which is basically the \nUniversity of Phoenix. The bottom line is that a large share of the $32 \nbillion that taxpayers invested in these schools in 2010 was wasted. We \ncannot allow this to continue.\n  Why? Because 73 percent of undergraduate students in this country are \nnontraditional students. For example, they are holding down jobs, they \nare older, perhaps they have family responsibilities, come from maybe \nlow-income communities, and they may be the first in their family to \nattend college. Our Nation's existing network of public and not-for-\nprofit colleges and community colleges cannot meet the demand for \nhigher education or meet President Obama's goal of producing more \ncollege graduates without increasing the number of Americans who spend \nat least some time in higher education. We need for-profit schools to \noffer these students more than a path to enrollment. We need them to \noffer students a path to success and graduation.\n  We uncovered two overall problems with the status quo in for-profit \nhigher education. One, billions of taxpayer dollars are being diverted \nfrom the educational activities they were intended to finance; and, \ntwo, taxpayer dollars are being used to do real lasting harm to the \nstudents these colleges enroll.\n  Again, think about it. In just the 1 year we examined, more than half \na million students enrolled in for-profit colleges and then quit. \nAlmost every one of those dropouts left school worse off than when they \nbegan, with no tangible economic benefit, but saddled with debt that \ncannot be discharged in bankruptcy, far less able now to continue their \nhigher education in the future because they will have defaulted on \nthose loans. They will not be able to get Federal loans, and they will \nnot get any more Pell grants.\n  So we have to ask why is this happening? One of the reasons is that \nthe tuition at for-profit colleges is grossly out of line with the cost \nof comparable programs at public and nonprofit institutions and fail to \nreflect the often dubious value of a degree from a for-profit. As this \nchart shows, this is average, from a public college in yellow, and the \npurple is for-profit colleges.\n  For an average certificate program, public schools, $4,249--this is \ntuition. At a for-profit, $19,806; for an average associate degree, 2 \nyears, $8,000 in public schools; that would be our community colleges \nand others, $34,988--almost $35,000 at a for-profit school. For a \nbachelor's degree, $52,000 in public schools; $62,000 in the for-profit \nschools. It costs 20 percent more for an online degree from Ashford \nUniversity than a degree from the University of Michigan.\n  Now, since these schools do not have bricks and mortar, they do not \nhave to pay heating bills and cooling bills and upkeep of dorms and all \nof that kind of stuff, one would think they could offer these courses \nmuch cheaper than what they are doing. That is not the case. They are \nmuch more expensive.\n  So why doesn't this lower overhead translate into lower tuition? We \nwill put up the next chart. The answer is the efficiencies of online \neducation are not passed on to students. Instead, those lower costs of \ndelivery go straight to profits, marketing, and executive salaries. \nTuition is set primarily based on maximizing revenue from Federal \ntaxpayer dollars and on what executives think the market will bear.\n  That is sort of what this chart shows. This red line is the average \navailable Federal aid to a student. This would be Stafford loans and \nPell grants. This is average, $13,205. When we examined all of the \nprivate schools--this is just a representative sample--they are all \njust above that line. In fact, we have internal documents from many of \nthese schools, from their executives, saying they are going to set \ntheir tuition in order to make sure they can maximize access to those \nFederal dollars.\n  Now, there are exceptions. I wanted to put one in there. American \nPublic Institute, as I said earlier, they are way down here. They made \na profit, they are profitable, and they provide a good service. They \nare not pegging their tuition costs at just what they can maximize. So \nthere are examples out there, but the vast majority set it just at what \nthe market will bear and how they can maximize their Federal dollars.\n  How much are these Federal dollars? About 83 percent. So I think \nanother feature of the for-profit schools is their almost total \nreliance on taxpayer money. They say they are for-profit, but it is not \nlike a for-profit for a private business that is competing in selling \ncars or washing machines or refrigerators or maybe some other kind of a \nservice where one can pick and choose. About 83 percent--this is \nmilitary, 3.8 percent, and 79.3 percent is Federal student aid dollars; \n83 percent comes directly from the taxpayers of this country.\n  So if for-profit colleges charge exorbitant tuition and often provide \nan inferior education while experiencing sky-high dropout rates, how \nare they able to recruit a steady stream of new students? The answer is \nthat for-profit colleges are what I would call a marketing machine. \nThey spend 42.1 percent of their revenues on marketing, recruiting, and \nprofit. Yet they only spend 17 percent of revenues on actual \ninstruction.\n\n  By comparison, the University of North Carolina System spends less \nthan 2 percent of its budget on marketing--2 percent. What we see is 42 \npercent--42 percent on marketing and profits; 17 percent on student \ninstruction. This is interesting: 40.7 percent all other spending. I \nwould point out herein are executive salaries, executive compensation, \nbonuses paid to recruiters, and on and on and on. Only 17 percent for \ninstruction.\n  Most colleges, when they talk about marketing, it is down around 2 or \n3 percent. I will bet the University of Virginia is probably down \nthere. I do not know. We may have that documentation. I know the \nUniversity of Iowa System is down around that 2- to 3-percent total for \nmarketing. You have seen their ads, different things for public \nuniversities, nonprofit universities, but nothing close to 42 percent.\n  This is what leads to what we call the ``churn.'' Students come in, \nthey get recruited, they get their Pell grants, they get their loans, \nthe school gets the money, a year later the student drops out, and so \nthe marketers go out and bring in more students. So we get this \ntremendous churn in the student body at these for-profit schools. \nPerhaps most critical, these institutions fail to provide adequate \nstudent support services, as I said. This is a critical finding of our \nreport.\n\n[[Page S5634]]\n\n  Despite knowingly enrolling some of the most at-risk students in our \ncountry, many of these schools do not provide these students with the \nservices common sense tells us they need to succeed. How many times \nhave we heard from the for-profit industry: Yes, we are different \nbecause we are enrolling students who do not go to our normal colleges, \ndo not go to the University of Iowa, to the University of Virginia. \nThese are nontraditional students. Many of them are poor. That is true, \nbut that is who they are recruiting.\n  Why are they recruiting them? To get the most Pell grants and the \nmost Stafford student loans. That is what the college gets.\n  Now, if they are doing that, then they need to provide mentoring, \ntutoring, some kind of alumni network, job partnerships, and genuine \ncareer counseling. Two of the largest for-profit companies provide no \ncareer counseling or placement to students whatsoever. Yet these are \nthe very students who need the most help when they go to college. \nStudents from upper income families who go to good schools, they do not \nneed that. English language learners, Latinos, African-American \nstudents, those we intuitively know need more education. Maybe they \nhave lost a job and now they realize: I have to do something. I have to \nget a better education. These marketers go after them. This is what our \nreport found.\n  If you look at the enrollment in these schools, as I said, it has \ngone up. The enrollment has gone up. Look at the recruiters. From 2007 \nto 2010, we went from a little over 20,000 to 35,202 recruiters at 24 \nof these companies.\n  Down here, the red line, these are the career services. These are the \npeople who counsel and mentor and tutor and help with career guidance. \nIt has not gone up a bit. Huge increase in students, big increase in \nrecruiters, and almost no increase at all in career counselors. This is \na failure, an abject failure.\n  This report is the first comprehensive fact-based analysis of this \nindustry. Earlier today I saw that the association for for-profit \ninstitutions called this a flawed process. As near as I can understand \ntheir critique, the process was flawed because it was about them, but \nthat is what congressional oversight is about.\n  This was not an overnight thing. This is what we produced: four huge \nvolumes, data-driven documentation, documentation on what is happening \nin this industry. This is the summary. This holds most of what we \nfound. These three will have all of the backup documentation that is \nneeded to support the findings we have.\n  We have before us a factual record that we have never had before. The \nDepartment of Education did not have it. No one has had it before. This \ncan guide us as we move toward reauthorization of the Higher Education \nAct next year. Again, during the reauthorization we will also be \nlooking at traditional higher education.\n  We have already held two hearings on college affordability. There is \nno question that we need to find a way to improve outcomes not just at \nfor-profit colleges but also at low-cost community colleges. That said, \nthe fact is there are problems that are unique--unique to the for-\nprofit sector that will require some unique solutions.\n  We have seen some progress on this front, as I said. I have met with \nsome of them. They have expressed a determination to reform and to do \nright by their students. In addition, the Department of Education took \nsteps that are beginning to have real impacts.\n  In April, President Obama issued an Executive order that will help to \nensure our veterans are not the subject of deceptive and misleading \nrecruiting, and that will help solders and veterans to make better \ndecisions about where to use their GI bill dollars.\n  Last month, Kentucky Attorney General Jack Conway led a 20-State \nattorney general settlement with QuinStreet, one of the companies \nengaged in some of the most egregiously misleading recruiting efforts \ntargeted at veterans. But these are not enough. As I said, there is an \nimportant role for for-profit colleges in our increasingly knowledge-\nbased economy.\n  A solid record of student success is in the national interest. The \nchallenge is to require the companies to be as focused on student \nsuccess as they are on financial success.\n  Now, there are four things we need to do.\n  First, we need to know how every student enrolled in college is \ndoing, not just first-time, full-time students. This is a flaw in our \nsystem. The Department of Education only tracks first-time, full-time \nstudents. Most of the students who go to our for-profit schools are not \nfirst-time, full-time students, they are part-time students. So what we \nneed to do is that for any student who gets a Pell grant and/or \nStafford loan, we need to know how that student is doing and how they \ndo later on.\n  Second, we need to be very clear that the Federal education money has \nto be spent on education, not advertising, recruiting, or lobbying. \nThat is just common sense. I challenge anyone to stand up here and say: \nNo, they should use taxpayer dollars to lobby, to advertise, or to pay \na recruiter. No. We have to be very clear--they can spend it on \neducation but not on advertising, recruiting or lobbying.\n  Third, we need to make sure these schools are providing at least a \nbasic level of student services that would give the at-risk students \nthey enroll a fair shot at completing. If there is one thing that \ndistinguishes good for-profit schools from the bad ones, this is it: a \ngenuine commitment to providing a network of student support--\nmentoring, tutoring, employer partnerships, genuine career counseling--\nnot just in the beginning but all the way through the program. The good \nschools that are doing that are turning out quality products.\n  Fourth, we have to think seriously about outcome-based thresholds, \nparticularly for colleges that get a very high proportion of their \nrevenue from taxpayers. And we need to build on the gainful employment \nrule to ensure that students are not being loaded up with debt they \ncannot repay.\n  I am confident the record we are laying out today will make some of \nthese reforms inevitable as we move forward. I wish to also thank some \nof my colleagues and to note that work has already begun on \nlegislation.\n  Senator Hagan is sponsoring a bill to ban the use of Federal \nfinancial aid dollars for marketing.\n  Senators Murray and Webb are sponsoring comprehensive legislation to \nbetter protect servicemembers and veterans using the post-9/11 GI bill.\n  Senator Lautenberg is sponsoring a bill to provide every veteran who \nreceives education aid from the Department of Veterans Affairs with \ncounseling to help make the right choices and to create a system to \ntrack veterans' complaints of waste, fraud, and abuse by these for-\nprofit schools.\n  Senators Carper and Durbin are sponsoring bills to address the \nabsurdity of not counting all Federal money in the restriction on how \nmuch money these schools can receive.\n  One of the things we picked up on as we started this investigation \nwas the tremendous focus these for-profits were now making on veterans, \nespecially Iraq and Afghanistan veterans, and Active-Duty personnel. \nThe reason for that is because we have a 90-10 rule that says for-\nprofit schools can only get 90 percent of their money from the Federal \nGovernment. The other 10 percent has to come from someplace else--\nprivate sources. But that doesn't count military. If a for-profit \nschool bumps up on the 90-10 level, it cannot go out and recruit any \nmore people, but if it recruits one military person, it can get nine \nmore nonmilitary. So that pays for them to go after the military. Well, \nSenators Carper and Durbin have a bill in to stop that.\n  Senator Durbin is also a leader on the issue of private student loans \nand bankruptcy, as well as a great partner in helping to draw attention \nto the experiences of students who have attended these schools.\n  I also thank other members of the HELP Committee who have been active \nparticipants at hearings, including Senators Franken, Merkley, and \nBlumenthal.\n  I have also received a great deal of support and encouragement along \nthe way from organizations dedicated to ensuring that students have a \ngenuine path to success in higher education. In particular, I thank the \nCouncil for Opportunity in Education, the Education Trust, the \nLeadership Council on Civil Rights, the Institute for College Access\n\n[[Page S5635]]\n\nand Success, Campus Progress, and the National Association for College \nAdmissions Counseling. All of them have been involved in helping us \nover the last couple of years to get the data we needed.\n  On behalf of servicemembers and veterans, we have had tremendous \nassistance from the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans Association, the \nVeterans of Foreign Wars, the Military Officers Association of America, \nBlue Star Families, the Vietnam Veterans Association, Student Veterans \nof America, the American Legion, VetJobs, VetsFirst, Paralyzed Veterans \nof America, the National Association for Black Veterans, the National \nGuard Association, the Air Force Sergeants Association, the Association \nof the United States Navy, Wounded Warriors, and Veterans for Common \nSense. All of them have been involved. We have gone to them, and they \nhave been so forthcoming and helpful, helping our staff and me to \nunderstand what is happening.\n  I also thank the witnesses at our hearings, several of whom have been \nsubjected to unwarranted and undeserved criticism. In particular, I \nthank Steve Eisman, who provided the committee with unique expertise \nand insights about the industry in a way that helped policymakers \nunderstand that these companies were much more than just colleges. As \neveryone in this body knows, people with a financial stake in an \nindustry testify before Congress every day and, like Mr. Eisman, \nprovide some of the most insightful and accurate information we \nreceive.\n  I also thank former Westwood employee Joshua Pruyn, who provided a \nreal-world view of working as a for-profit recruiter. He was willing to \ncome forward for the sole purpose of shedding light on this industry, \nand the criticism he has sustained speaks poorly of those who claim to \nbelieve in the valuable role whistleblowers play.\n  I thank my staff, who have pursued this investigation tirelessly and \ntenaciously.\n  I thank my oversight team and my HELP Committee, who spearheaded the \ninvestigation, analyzed the numbers, calculated all of the outcomes, \ninterviewed students and employees, reviewed thousands of pages of \ndocuments, and prepared this final report. That oversight team was led \nby Beth Stein. She was assisted throughout six hearings, three previous \nreports, many spreadsheets, charts, and megabytes of documents by \nElizabeth Baylor and Ryan McCord. More recently, they were joined by \nKia Hamadanchy and Bryan Boroughs, who have dedicated many long hours \nto the research, writing, and publication of this report.\n  I also owe a tremendous thanks to several staffers who are no longer \nwith the committee but played a critical role in this investigation: \nBeth Little, Luke Swarthout, and Robin Juliano.\n\n  I also thank my former and current HELP Committee staff directors, \nDan Smith and Pam Smith, who have ably guided this sometimes \nchallenging effort.\n  Our communications staffers have patiently explained the 90-10 rule, \nthe cohort default rate, and the fact that we don't actually know how \nveterans attending for-profit schools are doing to hundreds of \nreporters throughout the country. I thank Justine Sessions, Kate \nFrischmann, and Liz Donovan.\n  I also thank my education policy staffers who joined this effort more \nrecently but who will be carrying us forward in our legislative reform \nefforts: Mildred Otero, Spiros Protopsaltis, and Libby Masiuk, as well \nas Carrie Wofford, who has played a tremendous role in outreach to \ngroups across the country and has been a particular advocate on behalf \nof veterans impacted by the practices of the for-profit colleges.\n  I also thank our tremendous group of law clerks, who dedicated many \nhours to the less glamorous tasks of getting this put together: Abre \nConnor, Joel Murray, Lauren Scott, David Krem, Ashley Waddell, Lindsey \nDaughtry, Zach Mason, Sophie Kasimow, and Brittany Clement.\n  A special thank-you goes to the law clerks who helped write and \nprepare the report: Lucy Stein, Nicholas Wunder, Shauna Agean, Keagan \nBuchanan, and Douglas Dorando, and also Andrea Jarcho, who has juggled \nmultiple roles and worn multiple hats.\n  For their assistance along the way, I also thank Paul Edenfield, \nMadeline Daniels, Alyssa Davis, and also Dan Goldberg for his always-\nsound analysis and advice.\n  Finally, I thank Denise Lowrey and Carolyn Bolden, on the committee \nstaff, who spent many hours making the report as error-free as humanly \npossible.\n  Today we bring the HELP Committee investigation of for-profit \ncolleges to a close, but the record we have laid out leaves much to be \ndone, and I look forward to continuing to work with my Senate \ncolleagues to help for-profit colleges realize their potential as a \ngenuinely transformative force in higher education.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                             Global Warming\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, the Senator from Oklahoma, Jim Inhofe, is \na friend of mine. While we have strong philosophical and political \ndifferences, we have had a very positive personal relationship since I \nentered the Senate 5\\1/2\\ years ago. I like Senator Inhofe, and on \noccasion, despite our political differences, we have been able to work \ntogether as members of the Environment and Public Works Committee, on \nwhich we both sit. I especially applaud the Senator for his strong \nefforts on the recently passed Transportation bill in which he led the \neffort in getting his fellow Republicans to move forward on the vitally \nimportant issue of rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure--in this \ncase, roads and bridges.\n  Unfortunately, Senator Inhofe has some very radical views regarding \nglobal warming. I believe he is dead wrong and dangerously wrong on \nthis issue. Not only is he wrong, but because he is the leading \nRepublican on the Environment Committee, his views hold great influence \nover other Republicans in the Senate, in the House, and across the \ncountry. Because many Republicans follow Senator Inhofe's lead, it \nmeans we are making very little progress in Congress in combating what \nmost of the scientific community sees is a global environmental crisis.\n  I am on the floor today to ask Senator Inhofe to rethink his views on \nthis enormously important issue and to ask my Republican colleagues to \ndo the same. I am asking them to join the overwhelming majority of \nscientists who have studied and written about this issue in \nunderstanding that, one, global warming is real; two, global warming is \nsignificantly caused by human activity; three, global warming is \nalready causing massive and costly destruction to the United States and \naround the world, and it will only get worse in years to come.\n  I am also asking Senator Inhofe and my Republican colleagues to \nunderstand that the United States, with all of our knowledge, all of \nour expertise, and all of our technology, can and must lead the rest of \nthe world, which must follow our effort in cutting back on carbon \nemissions and reverse global warming, and to understand that when we do \nthis--when we transform our energy system away from fossil fuels and \nenter into energy efficiency and sustainable energy--when we do that \nover a period of years, we can create millions of good-paying jobs.\n  What I want to do this afternoon is nothing more than to simply quote \nsome of the statements and assertions Senator Inhofe has made and to \nexpress to you why he is dead wrong and dangerously wrong on this \nvitally important issue.\n  Mr. President, on July 11--just 2\\1/2\\ weeks ago--Senator Inhofe \nspoke on this floor reiterating his longstanding views on global \nwarming. What he said during that speech is pretty much what he has \nbeen saying for years. I read that speech, and I want to use this \nopportunity to comment on it. Specifically, I want to discuss a number \nof observations in which Senator Inhofe is completely wrong.\n\n  First and foremost, Senator Inhofe tells us in his speech that global \nwarming science is wrong. First and foremost, Senator Inhofe tells us \nin his speech that global warming science is wrong. Mr. Inhofe states, \non page S4860 of the Congressional Record from July 11--and I will do \nmy best to quote him as accurately as I possibly can--the following \nabout global warming:\n\n       In 2003 . . . I started hearing from a lot of the real \n     scientists that it was a hoax.\n\n  And Senator Inhofe continued, again from July 11, 2012:\n\n       It is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American \n     people.\n\n\n[[Page S5636]]\n\n\n  Let me repeat again what Senator Inhofe said just a few weeks ago on \nthe floor of the U.S. Senate.\n\n       [Global warming] . . . is the greatest hoax ever \n     perpetrated on the American people.\n\n  In fact, the title of Senator Inhofe's new book--which he was kind \nenough to give me a copy of--is ``The Greatest Hoax.'' That is the \ntitle of his book.\n  Well, let's examine that assertion on the part of Senator Inhofe. The \nUnited States Global Change Research Program, which was supported and \nexpanded by President George W. Bush, a conservative Republican, and \nwhich includes scientists at NASA, EPA, the Department of Defense, the \nDepartment of Agriculture, the Department of Energy, the State \nDepartment, the Department of Health, the Departments of \nTransportation, Commerce, and Interior, have said:\n\n       Global warming is unequivocal and primarily human-induced.\n\n  Senator Inhofe has said global warming is a hoax, but the Global \nChange Research Program, which brings together many departments of the \nU.S. Government, says:\n\n       Global warming is unequivocal and primarily human-induced.\n\n  Our National Academy of Sciences joined with academies in Brazil, \nCanada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, \nSouth Africa, and the United Kingdom. They all came together and said:\n\n       The need for urgent action to address climate change is now \n     indisputable.\n\n  It is now indisputable. Senator Inhofe says global warming is a hoax; \nacademies of science all over the world state the need for urgent \naction to address climate change is now indisputable.\n  Eighteen scientific professional societies, including the American \nGeophysical Union, the American Chemical Society, and others say:\n\n       Climate change is occurring and rigorous scientific \n     research demonstrates that the greenhouse gases emitted by \n     human activities are the primary driver.\n\n  That is a quote from 18 scientific professional societies. Senator \nInhofe says global warming is a hoax, but 18 scientific professional \nsocieties say climate change is occurring and rigorous scientific \nresearch demonstrates that the greenhouse gases emitted by human \nactivities are the primary driver.\n  Even noted climate skeptic Richard Muller, who, interestingly enough, \nSenator Inhofe has cited in his own speeches over the years, wrote in \nthe Wall Street Journal last year that his latest research proved \n``global warming is real.'' More to the point, in an op-ed published 2 \ndays ago, Richard Muller, who in the past was cited by Senator Inhofe \nas a global warming skeptic, wrote an op-ed in the New York Times \nentitled ``The Conversion of a Climate Change Skeptic.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe op-ed I have just referred to.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, this is how Richard A. Muller--again, the \nscientist who was often quoted by Senator Inhofe--began his op-ed 2 \ndays ago in the New York Times. This is the quote from Richard A. \nMuller.\n\n       Call me a converted skeptic. Three years ago, I identified \n     problems in previous climate studies that, in my mind, threw \n     doubt on the very existence of global warming. Last year, \n     following an intensive research effort involving a dozen \n     scientists, I concluded that global warming was real and that \n     the prior estimates of the rate of warming were correct. I'm \n     now going a step further: Humans are almost entirely the \n     cause.\n\n  And Dr. Muller continues:\n\n       My total turnaround, in such a short time, is the result of \n     careful and objective analysis by the Berkeley Earth Surface \n     Temperature project, which I founded with my daughter \n     Elizabeth. Our results show that the average temperature of \n     the earth's land has risen by 2\\1/2\\ degrees Fahrenheit over \n     the past 250 years, including an increase of 1\\1/2\\ degrees \n     over the most recent 50 years. Moreover, it appears likely \n     that essentially all of this increase results from the human \n     emission of greenhouse gases.\n\n  That was Dr. Richard Muller from an op-ed in the New York Times on \nJuly 28, 2012.\n  I am not going to tell you that every single serious scientist in the \nworld agrees with Dr. Muller or agrees with me or agrees with the vast \nmajority of scientists that global warming is real and primarily caused \nby human activity. But I will say that, according to the National \nAcademy of Sciences, approximately 98 percent of active climate \nscientists who published peer-reviewed papers agree with the assertion \nthat global warming is occurring and human activity is a significant \ndriver of it--not 100 percent but 98 percent.\n  When we talk about scientists publishing with peer review, what we \nare saying is their papers and research were reviewed and examined by \nother expert scientists in their field. That is the great thing about \nscience and peer review. The process invites criticism and invites \nother scientists to prove your idea is wrong. When we say 98 percent of \nactive climate scientists agree about global warming, we are talking \nabout scientists whose work has been examined critically and found to \nbe well-documented and correct by their peers in the field.\n  This is an important point to be made. There may well be scientists \nout there who may have different views. But by and large they have not \nwritten peer-reviewed literature which has been examined by other \nexperts in that field. So the bottom line here--and the important \nbottom line--is when Senator Jim Inhofe says global warming is a hoax, \nhe is dead wrong according to the overwhelming majority of scientists \nwho have studied this issue.\n  I hope very much--and I mean this sincerely, because this is an \nenormously important issue--that Senator Inhofe will rethink his \nposition, and those Republicans who have followed Senator Inhofe's lead \nwill also rethink their position.\n  In July of 2010, in an interview with ABC News, Senator Inhofe said:\n\n       We're in a cycle now that all the scientists agree is going \n     into a cooling period.\n\n  Let me repeat that, because I don't want anyone to think I made a \nmistake about what I said. July 2010, ABC News, quoting Senator Inhofe.\n\n       We're in a cycle now that all the scientists agree is going \n     into a cooling period.\n\n  On July 11, on the floor of the Senate, Senator Inhofe stated in his \nremarks--and this is found on page S4860 of the Congressional Record. I \nwant everyone to make sure I am not misquoting Senator Inhofe. I would \nnot do that. From page S4860 of July 11, the Congressional Record:\n\n       . . . we went into a warming period that went up to the \n     turn of the century. Now it is actually going down into a \n     cooling period again . . .\n\n  That was Senator Inhofe, July 11, 2012. In other words, as I \nunderstand it, Senator Inhofe is saying that since the year 2001 we are \nin a cooling period. Unfortunately, Senator Inhofe's assertion that we \nhave entered a cooling period could not be more incorrect.\n  Let's look at what the scientific data shows us. The last decade was \nnot one where our temperature got cooler. It was, in fact, the very \nopposite. According to NASA, the last decade was in fact the warmest on \nrecord, using temperature records that date to the late 1800s. NASA's \ndata shows that 9 of the 10 warmest years on record occurred since \n2000, when Senator Inhofe says we went into a ``cooling period.'' So \nNASA says the last decade was the warmest on record, but Senator Inhofe \nsays we have gone into a cooling period.\n  But it is not just NASA making this finding. The National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration--NOAA--issued a report from 300 scientists \nin 48 countries that confirms the last decade was the warmest on \nrecord--the warmest on record at a time when Senator Inhofe tells us we \nare going into a cooling period.\n  The World Meteorological Organization also confirms that the last \ndecade was the warmest on record, and they found the 13 warmest years \non record have all occurred since 1997.\n  So the American people and my Republican friends are going to have to \nmake a decision: Is Jim Inhofe right that we are entering into a \ncooling period or is NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration correct in saying that the last decade was, in fact, the \nwarmest on record?\n  As my fellow Vermonter, Bill McKibben, recently pointed out, globally \nwe have seen 327 consecutive months where the temperature exceeded the \nglobal average for the 20th century. Senator Inhofe tells us the world \nis getting cooler, but science shows us we have just experienced the \nwarmest\n\n[[Page S5637]]\n\ndecade on record. Somebody is right and somebody is wrong, and I do not \nbelieve Senator Inhofe is right.\n  Senator Inhofe stated on July 11, 2012, page S. 4862 of the \nCongressional Record:\n\n       One thing we did find out when we got a report from several \n     universities, including MIT, was that the cost of this, if we \n     were to pass any of the bills, would have been between $300 \n     billion and $400 billion a year.\n\n  This is not the first time Senator Inhofe has asserted that the cost \nof cutting greenhouse gas emissions is $300 billion to $400 billion a \nyear. In an interview with Fox News on February 11, 2000, Senator \nInhofe was asked by the Fox anchor about the cost of global warming \nlegislation, and he responded:\n\n       It would cost between $300 billion and $400 billion a year.\n\n  Senator Inhofe gets his estimates by looking at worst-case scenarios \nfrom an out-of-date report that looked at legislation from 2007. The \ntruth is, however, more recent research proves we can take strong \naction to cut emissions while at the same time growing our economy and \nsaving Americans substantial sums of money on their energy bills.\n  For example, a 2009 study from McKinsey consulting firm found that \nthe United States can meet our 2020 targets for greenhouse gas emission \nreductions just through cost-effective energy efficiency efforts, with \na net savings for American consumers of $700 billion. A 2010 report \nfrom the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy found that by \ndoing things nationally, many States--including the State of Vermont, \nmy own State--are doing on energy efficiency already, we could achieve \nsubstantial benefits. The study found by investing aggressively in \nenergy efficiency in our buildings, in our schools, in our factories, \nand in our transportation systems we would create over 370,000 net new \njobs by 2020, boost our rate of economic growth and GDP, and save \nhouseholds significant sums of money on their energy bills--all while \nvastly exceeding our 2020 target of cutting greenhouse gas emissions 17 \npercent from 2005 levels.\n  In this scenario, we could cut emissions over 30 percent by 2020 as \nwe create jobs and as millions of people save money on their energy \nbills. To my mind, creating jobs, cutting greenhouse gas emissions, and \nsaving money on people's fuel bills is a win-win-win situation.\n  In addition to the clear benefits from taking action, I want to point \nout to Senator Inhofe the costs and risks if we do not take action, if \nwe do nothing. The alternative is we step back, we don't do anything, \nand what happens?\n  Already, the extreme weather we have seen is impacting our Nation's \ninfrastructure. An interesting article appeared just a few days ago, \nJuly 25, 2012, in the New York Times. It said the Nation's \ninfrastructure is being taxed to worrisome degrees by heat, drought, \nand vicious storms. The article noted that on a single day in July, an \nairplane got stuck in asphalt that softened due to 100-degree \ntemperatures, and a subway train derailed after heat caused a track to \nbend. It also cited highways that are heating up and expanding beyond \ntheir design limits, causing cracks and jarring bumps in the road. The \narticle mentioned how powerplants are having difficulty using their \nregular cooling sources during operation because the water is now \nexcessively warm.\n  A power company executive with 38 years of experience was quoted as \nsaying:\n\n       We've got the storm of the century every year now, after \n     power was knocked out for 4.3 million people in 10 States \n     after the June derecho storm that raced from the Midwest to \n     the East Coast at near hurricane-force winds.\n\n  Interestingly, not generally noted as being terribly progressive, the \ninsurance industry has noted their costs for property damage from \nincreasingly extreme weather have already increased in the United \nStates from $3 billion a year in the 1980s to $20 billion a year today. \nAccording to Mark Way, an official with Swiss Re, a large reinsurance \ncompany:\n\n       A warming climate will only add to this trend of increasing \n     losses, which is why action is needed now.\n\n  A landmark study prepared for the British Government by Nicholas \nStern, former chief economist of the World Bank, found that doing \nnothing to reverse global warming could eventually shrink the global \neconomy by 20 percent. The Chairman of the National Intelligence \nCouncil under President George W. Bush testified to Congress that \nintelligence assessments indicated that global warming could worsen \nexisting problems, such as poverty, social tensions, environmental \ndegradation, ineffectual leadership, and weak political institutions. \nClimate change could threaten domestic stability in some States, \npotentially contributing to conflict, particularly over access to \nincreasingly scarce water resources.\n  Unlike Senator Inhofe, most Americans are seeing the evidence of \nglobal warming with their own eyes. I want to take some time to talk \nabout what we are seeing.\n  The Associated Press reported on July 3, 2012:\n\n       But since at least 1988, climate scientists have warned \n     that climate change would bring, in general, increased heat \n     waves, more droughts, more sudden downpours, more widespread \n     wildfires and worsening storms. In the United States, those \n     extremes are happening here and now.\n       So far this year, more than 2.1 million acres have burned \n     in wildfires, more than 113 million people in the U.S. were \n     in areas under extreme heat advisories last Friday, two-\n     thirds of the country is experiencing drought, and earlier in \n     June, deluges flooded Minnesota and Florida.\n\n  We saw extreme weather last year as well. In 2011, we had a record-\nbreaking 14 weather disasters in the United States that each caused \nover $1 billion in damage. One of those was Hurricane Irene, which \ncaused devastating flooding and loss of life in the State of Vermont \nand other States in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic. According to FEMA:\n\n       Considered together, the federally declared disasters of \n     2011 presented crises all but unprecedented in their \n     frequency and scope. The 99 major disasters, 29 declared \n     emergencies, and 114 requests for fire management assistance \n     touched 48 out of 50 states.\n\n  In other words, 48 States had a federally declared disaster last \nyear.\n  Global average surface temperature has already increased 1.3 degrees \nFahrenheit since 1900, according to NOAA. The last 12 months is the \nwarmest 12-month period on record in the United States. Since January \n1, 2012, cities and regions in the United States have set 40,000 \nrecords for warm temperatures, compared to just 6,000 for cold \ntemperatures, according to NOAA. In the 20th century we set warm and \ncold temperature records at roughly a 1-to-1 ratio. In the 21st \ncentury, that has changed 2 to 1 in favor of heat records, and this \nyear it has jumped to 7 to 1.\n  As the planet warms, we are seeing more extreme heat wave events. \nHeat waves killed tens of thousands in Europe in 2003 and Russia in \n2010, and a heat wave in Texas and Oklahoma caused severe drought and \nwildfires in 2011. Global warming made these heat waves significantly \nmore likely, according to the latest science.\n  Leading climatologist James Hansen and several of his colleagues \npublished a report that said:\n\n       Extreme heat waves such as that in Texas and Oklahoma in \n     2011, and Moscow in 2010, were caused by global warming, \n     because their likelihood was negligible prior to the recent \n     rapid global warming.\n\n  Another study from German researchers published in the U.S. National \nAcademy of Sciences found an 80-percent likelihood that the Russian \nheat wave in 2010 was attributable to global warming. And a study from \nNOAA found the heat wave and drought in Texas in 2011 was 20 times more \nlikely to occur today than 50 years ago due to the warming of the \nplanet.\n  As I mentioned, this country is currently experiencing a devastating \ndrought. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has designated disaster \nareas due to drought in 1,369 counties in 31 States this year. The \nprice of corn has increased 50 percent in the last 3 months, and \nsoybean prices are up 25 percent since June. This is because 78 percent \nof the corn crop and 77 percent of soybean production is in drought-\naffected areas.\n  This is not the first time we have seen devastating droughts spike \nfood prices in recent years. Severe drought in Russia in 2010 led that \ncountry to ban exports of grain, which contributed to a near doubling \nin wheat prices over a 2-month period in that year. The worst drought \nin China in 60 years occurred last year in 2011, affecting 12 million \nacres of wheat and contributing--along with floods in Australia\n\n[[Page S5638]]\n\nand the drought in Russia--to record food prices.\n  Some commentators cited the record food prices caused by these \nextreme weather events as contributing to unrest. When food prices go \nup, there is often instability in countries around the world--including \nthe Middle East and Africa.\n  Sea levels have already risen 7 inches globally, according to EPA. We \nhave seen during the last three summers record low levels of Arctic Sea \nice, and we know from NASA satellites that Antarctica is losing 24 \ncubic miles of ice every year. In Glacier National Park in this country \nwe had 150 glaciers when it was formed in 1910, but today only 25 \nremain. Some studies predict a sea level rise of 5 feet or more by the \nend of this century. But even if sea levels rose 3 feet, cities such as \nMiami, New Orleans, Charleston, SC, Oakland, CA, and others could find \nthemselves partially underwater.\n  The average annual acreage consumed by wildfires in the United States \nmore than doubled during the last decade compared with the previous \nfour decades. Last year in Texas wildfires destroyed 2,700 homes. This \nyear in Colorado--the most destructive wildfire in that State's \nhistory--destroyed 350 homes. Wildfires in Colorado this year caused \ntens of thousands to evacuate their homes. In New Mexico, we saw the \nlargest wildfire in that State's history this year burn more than \n170,000 acres that broke the previous record which was set just last \nyear when a fire burned more than 150,000 acres.\n  Mr. President, last year floods along the Mississippi River caused $2 \nbillion worth of damage. Floods in North Dakota displaced 11,000 people \nfrom their homes. Record floods in Australia in 2011 caused its State \nof Queensland to conduct the largest evacuation in its history. Floods \nin Pakistan in 2010 killed 2,000 people and left one-fifth of that \nnuclear-armed nation under water for weeks. That is the kind of \npotentially destabilizing extreme weather events the folks at the \nDepartment of Defense and the CIA worry about. Unfortunately, I could \ngo on and on. The bad news is if we do nothing, the science is clear \nthat temperatures will continue to increase, sea levels will continue \nto rise, and extreme weather will become more frequent and more \ndevastating. The good news is--and it is very good news--that we now \nhave the technology, the knowledge, and the know-how to cut emissions \ntoday through energy efficiency and through moving toward such \nsustainable and renewable technologies as solar, wind, geothermal, and \nbiomass.\n  It is time for Congress to get serious about global warming and to \nwork to transform our energy system to sustainable energy, and that \nstarts by beginning to understand that global warming is real and that \nif we do not address it now, it will only get worse and bring more \ndanger to this country and to our planet.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. SANDERS. Yes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of the remarks of my friend from Vermont, I be recognized as \nin morning business for such time as I will consume.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I am glad to see my friend from Oklahoma \nhere on the floor. I want to conclude by reading a review of Senator \nInhofe's book, which is called ``The Greatest Hoax,'' by a gentleman \nnamed J.C. Moore. This review by J.C. Moore was published in the Tulsa \nWorld which is, I suspect, the largest newspaper in the State of \nOklahoma. J.C. Moore is a native Oklahoman--the same State Senator \nInhofe represents--and a Ph.D. who taught chemistry and physics and is \na member of the American Geophysical Union.\n  This is what Mr. Moore wrote: ``Inhofe claims he is winning in his \nfight to debunk global warming.'' After discussing the scientific \nconsensus among climate scientists and major scientific institutions \nall over the world, Moore writes:\n\n       Inhofe's greatest adversary is nature itself, as research \n     shows the climate is changing in response to human \n     activities. The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is \n     increasing, the temperature of the Earth is rising, the \n     oceans are becoming more acidic, glaciers and polar ice caps \n     are melting, sea levels are rising, the probability of severe \n     weather events is increasing, and weather-related natural \n     disasters are becoming more frequent and more costly. It is \n     time we examine more closely who is actually winning by \n     ignoring science.\n\n  As I understand it, that is from a review of Senator Inhofe's book, \n``The Greatest Hoax,'' by a gentleman named J.C. Moore in the Tulsa \nWorld.\n  There is much more to be said on this issue because here on the floor \nof the Senate we are saying virtually nothing. I might say that we look \npretty dumb to the rest of the world by ignoring what many scientists \nbelieve is the major environmental crisis of our time which, if we \ndon't get a handle on, will have profound impacts on the well-being of \nthis country and countries throughout this world.\n  So I say to my friend Senator Inhofe--and he is my friend--I hope \nvery much the Senator will rethink his position. I hope those \nRepublicans who are following the Senator's lead will rethink their \nposition because nothing less than the future of our planet is at \nstake.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 28, 2012]\n\n               The Conversion of a Climate-Change Skeptic\n\n                         (By Richard A. Muller)\n\n       Call me a converted skeptic. Three years ago I identified \n     problems in previous climate studies that, in my mind, threw \n     doubt on the very existence of global warming. Last year, \n     following an intensive research effort involving a dozen \n     scientists, I concluded that global warming was real and that \n     the prior estimates of the rate of warming were correct. I'm \n     now going a step further: Humans are almost entirely the \n     cause.\n       My total turnaround, in such a short time, is the result of \n     careful and objective analysis by the Berkeley Earth Surface \n     Temperature project, which I founded with my daughter \n     Elizabeth. Our results show that the average temperature of \n     the earth's land has risen by two and a half degrees \n     Fahrenheit over the past 250 years, including an increase of \n     one and a half degrees over the most recent 50 years. \n     Moreover, it appears likely that essentially all of this \n     increase results from the human emission of greenhouse gases.\n       These findings are stronger than those of the \n     Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the United Nations \n     group that defines the scientific and diplomatic consensus on \n     global warming. In its 2007 report, the I.P.C.C. concluded \n     only that most of the warming of the prior 50 years could be \n     attributed to humans. It was possible, according to the \n     I.P.C.C. consensus statement, that the warming before 1956 \n     could be because of changes in solar activity, and that even \n     a substantial part of the more recent warming could be \n     natural.\n       Our Berkeley Earth approach used sophisticated statistical \n     methods developed largely by our lead scientist, Robert \n     Rohde, which allowed us to determine earth land temperature \n     much further back in time. We carefully studied issues raised \n     by skeptics: biases from urban heating (we duplicated our \n     results using rural data alone), from data selection (prior \n     groups selected fewer than 20 percent of the available \n     temperature stations; we used virtually 100 percent), from \n     poor station quality (we separately analyzed good stations \n     and poor ones) and from human intervention and data \n     adjustment (our work is completely automated and hands-off). \n     In our papers we demonstrate that none of these potentially \n     troublesome effects unduly biased our conclusions.\n       The historic temperature pattern we observed has abrupt \n     dips that match the emissions of known explosive volcanic \n     eruptions; the particulates from such events reflect \n     sunlight, make for beautiful sunsets and cool the earth's \n     surface for a few years. There are small, rapid variations \n     attributable to El Nino and other ocean currents such as the \n     Gulf Stream; because of such oscillations, the ``flattening'' \n     of the recent temperature rise that some people claim is not, \n     in our view, statistically significant. What has caused the \n     gradual but systematic rise of two and a half degrees? We \n     tried fitting the shape to simple math functions \n     (exponentials, polynomials), to solar activity and even to \n     rising functions like world population. By far the best match \n     was to the record of atmospheric carbon dioxide, measured \n     from atmospheric samples and air trapped in polar ice.\n       Just as important, our record is long enough that we could \n     search for the fingerprint of solar variability, based on the \n     historical record of sunspots. That fingerprint is absent. \n     Although the I.P.C.C. allowed for the possibility that \n     variations in sunlight could have ended the ``Little Ice \n     Age,'' a period of cooling from the 14th century to about \n     1850, our data argues strongly that the temperature rise of \n     the past 250 years cannot be attributed to solar changes. \n     This conclusion is, in retrospect, not too surprising; we've \n     learned from satellite measurements that solar activity \n     changes the brightness of the sun very little.\n       How definite is the attribution to humans? The carbon \n     dioxide curve gives a better match than anything else we've \n     tried. Its\n\n[[Page S5639]]\n\n     magnitude is consistent with the calculated greenhouse \n     effect--fextra warming from trapped heat radiation. These \n     facts don't prove causality and they shouldn't end \n     skepticism, but they raise the bar: to be considered \n     seriously, an alternative explanation must match the data at \n     least as well as carbon dioxide does. Adding methane, a \n     second greenhouse gas, to our analysis doesn't change the \n     results. Moreover, our analysis does not depend on large, \n     complex global climate models, the huge computer programs \n     that are notorious for their hidden assumptions and \n     adjustable parameters. Our result is based simply on the \n     close agreement between the shape of the observed temperature \n     rise and the known greenhouse gas increase.\n       It's a scientist's duty to be properly skeptical. I still \n     find that much, if not most, of what is attributed to climate \n     change is speculative, exaggerated or just plain wrong. I've \n     analyzed some of the most alarmist claims, and my skepticism \n     about them hasn't changed.\n       Hurricane Katrina cannot be attributed to global warming. \n     The number of hurricanes hitting the United States has been \n     going down, not up; likewise for intense tornadoes. Polar \n     bears aren't dying from receding ice, and the Himalayan \n     glaciers aren't going to melt by 2035. And it's possible that \n     we are currently no warmer than we were a thousand years ago, \n     during the ``Medieval Warm Period'' or ``Medieval Optimum,'' \n     an interval of warm conditions known from historical records \n     and indirect evidence like tree rings. And the recent warm \n     spell in the United States happens to be more than offset by \n     cooling elsewhere in the world, so its link to ``global'' \n     warming is weaker than tenuous.\n       The careful analysis by our team is laid out in five \n     scientific papers now online at BerkeleyEarth.org. That site \n     also shows our chart of temperature from 1753 to the present, \n     with its clear fingerprint of volcanoes and carbon dioxide, \n     but containing no component that matches solar activity. Four \n     of our papers have undergone extensive scrutiny by the \n     scientific community, and the newest, a paper with the \n     analysis of the human component, is now posted, along with \n     the data and computer programs used. Such transparency is the \n     heart of the scientific method; if you find our conclusions \n     implausible, tell us of any errors of data or analysis.\n       What about the future? As carbon dioxide emissions \n     increase, the temperature should continue to rise. I expect \n     the rate of warming to proceed at a steady pace, about one \n     and a half degrees over land in the next 50 years, less if \n     the oceans are included. But if China continues its rapid \n     economic growth (it has averaged 10 percent per year over the \n     last 20 years) and its vast use of coal (it typically adds \n     one new gigawatt per month), then that same warming could \n     take place in less than 20 years.\n       Science is that narrow realm of knowledge that, in \n     principle, is universally accepted. I embarked on this \n     analysis to answer questions that, to my mind, had not been \n     answered. I hope that the Berkeley Earth analysis will help \n     settle the scientific debate regarding global warming and its \n     human causes. Then comes the difficult part: agreeing across \n     the political and diplomatic spectrum about what can and \n     should be done.\n\n  With that, I am happy to yield the floor for my friend, Senator \nInhofe of Oklahoma.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, something my friend from \nVermont said a minute ago would surprise a lot of people, and that is \nwe are friends. It is kind of strange. People don't understand being \nviolently opposed to each other in this body and yet also being very \nclose friends. My friend from Vermont has a different philosophy than I \ndo. That is the nice thing about both the House and the Senate. We have \npeople with different philosophies who believe in different things. \nSomewhere in the midst of this, the truth ultimately does come out most \nof the time. I think we would probably agree with that.\n  One thing I like about my friend from Vermont is he really believes \nand is willing to stand up and fight for something he believes. I am \nnot going to suggest there are hypocrites in this body. I wouldn't say \nthat at all. When we look around the political scene, we see people who \nsomehow might ingratiate a block of people who are wanting support. \nMaybe it is for the next election, maybe it is for a cause. That is not \nthe case with my friend from Vermont. He believes in his heart \neverything he says.\n  Sometimes I talk to young people who come in as interns. I tell them \nthere are varied philosophies in the Senate and in the House. We have \nextreme liberals who believe our country should have a greater \ninvolvement in the decisions we make. We have conservatives, like I am, \nwho believe we have too much government in our lives as it is. It is a \nbasic difference. But I say to them, even though I am on the \nconservative side, I would rather someone be a far outspoken liberal \nextremist than be in the mushy middle and not stand for anything. My \nfriend from Vermont is not in the mushy middle. He stands for \nsomething.\n  It was not too long ago that another friend in his office, his press \nsecretary--we are very close friends--said something, and I don't want \nto misquote him. He said, My boss would like to have a copy of your \nbook. I said, Not only will I give him a copy, but I will autograph it \nfor him, but with one commitment, and that is he has to read it. He \nkept that commitment; I can tell by the things he said.\n  Let me go over a few things that were said, and I think it is \ninteresting. This Dr. Richard Muller--I can't recall too much about \nhim, but I do know he was listed among scientists who were skeptics. \nFor the benefit of people who may not know the terminology, I refer to \nan alarmist as someone who thinks there is great alarm because \nsomething is happening and the end of the world is coming because of \nglobal warming. Skeptics are those like myself who don't believe that. \nHe apparently has changed from being a skeptic to an alarmist. I would \nonly say this, and that is my Web site, epw.senate.gov, shows from \nprobably over 12 years ago a list of scientists who are calling me, \nmaking statements, and saying that the IPCC--that is the United \nNations, and that is what we are talking about. The United Nations came \nout with a preconceived notion that they wanted to believe a \npreconceived conclusion. When they did this, the scientists who were \nincluded in the process were scientists who agreed with them.\n  So when I questioned it by standing on the floor--I don't remember \nthe date of this. My friend from Vermont may remember that. I made \nstatements about two or three scientists who had called me. After that, \nthe phone was ringing off the hook. Keep in mind there are a lot of \nscientists out there. We listed on the Web site up to over 1,000 \nscientists who declared they were skeptics about this whole thing. So I \ncan take some gratitude about the fact that the only scientist who was \non the skeptic list who has changed to an alarmist is 1 out of 1,000.\n  My friend was talking about the National Academy of Sciences. I think \nit is kind of interesting because let's remember it was the National \nAcademy of Sciences that came out with a report in 1975 warning of a \ncoming ice age. Keep in mind we are all going to die whether it is \nglobal warming or another ice age. That is the National Academy of \nSciences, the same group. According to a lot of people, they have \nturned themselves into an advocacy group.\n  I will quote MIT's Dr. Richard Lindzen, who was a former U.N. IPCC \nreviewer. He was talking about Ralph Cicerone, who is the president of \nthe NAS. He said:\n\n       Cicerone of NAS is saying that regardless of evidence the \n     answer is predetermined, if gov't wants carbon control, that \n     is the answer--\n\n  That is what the NAS will provide. If you control carbon, you control \nlife.\n  So we have had a lot of differing and varying interpretations of \navailing science over the years. I can recall one of my first \nintroductions to this. Of course, this came way back during the Kyoto \nConvention. Some people have forgotten that Kyoto was a convention that \nwas going to get everyone to get together under the leadership of the \nUnited Nations and we were all going to reduce our carbon, and so they \nhad this big meeting down there. I will always remember it. This is the \nfamous Al Gore meeting that was called the Earth Summit of 1992. So \nthey came out with this and said this is going to happen. The United \nNations said it is, and so they thought everything was fine. Everyone \nbelieved it.\n  It was shortly after that I remember hearing someone talk about it. \nWe can go back and look at this. This is not something I am just \nsaying. There were statements that were made in the 30-year period--\nlet's take the 30-year period from 1895 to 1925. That is 30 years. \nDuring that time everyone feared that another ice age was coming. They \ntalked about another ice age, and that the world was coming to an end. \nThey provided all of this documentation during that 30-year period that \nthat is what was happening.\n  Well, from 1925 to 1945, that 20-year period was a global warming. In \nfact,\n\n[[Page S5640]]\n\nthe first time we heard of global warming was in that 20-year period \nfrom 1925 to 1945. So the world was going to come to an end again, and \nit was going to be during that period of time due to global warming.\n  Then came the 30-year period from 1945 to 1975. During that time they \nsaid it is a cold spell, and that is when all of these companies came \nin--the Senator from Vermont is right. I have given probably 30 talks \nwell in excess of an hour each talking about these things. During that \ntime, I remember holding up the cover of Time magazine where they \ntalked about how another ice age was coming. Then I held up a cover of \nthe Time magazine 20 years later, and they said, no, it is global \nwarming. They had the last polar bear stepping on the last cube of ice, \nand saying we are going to die.\n  We went through a period of 1945 to 1975 where they declared it a \nperiod of another ice age. Then 1975 to the turn of the century--so \nthat was another 30-year period of time--when it was global warming. So \nwe have gone back and forth.\n  Here is the interesting thing about that. The assertion is always \nmade that we are having catastrophic global warming because of manmade \ngases, CO2, anthropogenic gases, and methane. Yet the \ngreatest surge of CO2 came right after World War II starting \nin 1945, and that precipitated not a warming period but a cooling \nperiod. So when you look at these things, sometimes--by the way, the \nonly disagreement I would have with my friend from Vermont is that he \nhas quoted me as saying some things.\n  Actually, unlike Al Gore and some of these other people, I recognize \nI am not an expert. I am not a scientist, but I read what the \nscientists say. I get my phone calls, I look at it, and I try to apply \nlogic to it and come to my conclusions. So that is what has been \nhappening over the last--oh, it has been now 12 years, I guess, since \nall this started.\n\n  I wish to mention a couple of other things that were said. For \nexample, on the idea of the science--here it is, right here. As far as \nscientists are concerned, I can remember quoting from the Harvard-\nSmithsonian study. The study examined results of more than 240 peer-\nreviewed--``peer-reviewed'' is the term used by my friend from \nVermont--the Harvard-Smithsonian study examined the results of more \nthan 240 peer-reviewed papers published by thousands of researchers \nover the past four decades. The study covers a multitude of geophysical \nand biological climate indicators. They came to the conclusion that \n``climate change is not real. The science is not accurate.''\n  Then we have another quote from a former President of the National \nAcademy of Sciences. He is Dr. Fred Seitz. He said:\n\n       There is no convincing scientific evidence that human \n     release of carbon dioxide, methane, or other greenhouse gases \n     is causing or will in the foreseeable future cause \n     catastrophic heating of the Earth's atmosphere and disruption \n     of the Earth's climate.\n\n  Again, he is a former President of the National Academy of Sciences.\n  Then we had a study from not long ago done by George Mason \nUniversity. This is one my friend from Vermont may not have seen. It \nwas called to my attention, and I missed it somehow in the media. It \nwas a survey of 430 weather forecasters by the university, and it found \nthat only 19 percent of the weather forecasters believed that the \nclimate is changing and if so, that it is due to manmade gases--only 19 \npercent. That means 81 percent of them think it is not.\n  Dr. Robert Laughlin is a Nobel Prize winner and a Stanford University \nphysicist. He said--this is kind of good. I enjoyed this one. He said:\n\n       Please remain calm: The earth will heal itself. Climate is \n     beyond our power to control. The earth doesn't care about \n     governments or their legislation. Climate change is a matter \n     of geologic time, something that the earth routinely does on \n     its own without asking anyone's permission or explaining \n     itself.\n\n  It is happening. I think it is kind of arrogant for people to think \nwe can change this. I am recalling one of the statements made by my \ngood friend that we have all of these--we must provide the leadership.\n  We have watched these great big annual parties the United Nations has \nin these exotic places around the world. I can remember going to a few \nof them. I remember one of them in Milan, Italy. It would have been \n2003. I went there. They had ``wanted'' posters on all the telephone \npolls with my picture and quoted me when I first came out with the hoax \nstatement. These big parties are kind of interesting. I have only gone \nto three of them, but they have people invited from all over the world. \nThe only price to pay to come to this is to believe that catastrophic \nwarming is taking place and that it is the fault of bad old man and \nanthropogenic gases.\n  Anyway, the last one was an interesting one--not the last one, the \nmost enjoyable one in Copenhagen. At that time--I am going from memory, \nbut I believe President Obama had been there, Secretary Clinton had \nbeen there, Nancy Pelosi had been there, and several others. There were \nfive different people--I can't remember the other two--and they were \nthere to assure the other countries--keep in mind, 192 countries--they \nassured them that we were going to pass some type of cap-and-trade \nlegislation. So I went. Right before I went over, I announced myself as \na self-described--I don't mean it in an arrogant way--as a self-\nproclaimed, one-man truth squad. I went over to tell them the truth, \nthat it wasn't going to happen.\n  But right before it happened--talk about poetic justice, I say to my \nfriend from Vermont--right before that happened was a hearing we had \nwith the director of the EPA, Lisa Jackson, whom I love dearly. She is \none of my three favorite liberals whom I often talk about, and she came \nout and said--I looked at her and I said: I am going to Copenhagen \ntomorrow. I have a feeling that when I leave to go to Copenhagen, you \nare going to have a declaration that will declare that it is a hazard \nand all this and give the bureaucracy justification to do through \nregulation what they could not do and have not been successful in doing \nthrough legislation.\n  I saw a smile on her face.\n  I said: In the event you make that finding, it has to be based on \nscience. What science do you think it will be based on?\n  She said: Well, primarily the IPCC--the Intergovernmental Panel on \nClimate Change.\n  It is a branch of the United Nations. It was all started by the \nUnited Nations.\n  By the way, I would not mention my book; however, I checked before I \ncame down, and if somebody else mentions my book, which is ``The \nGreatest Hoax,'' then it is all right for me to mention it. I see my \nfriend from Vermont nodding in agreement. So I want people to read the \nlongest chapter, which is the chapter on the United Nations. It goes \nback and tells what the motives were for this. It goes back to 1972. We \nwere in the midst of an ice age at that time, if my colleague \nremembers. It talks about the meeting that was going to be held at the \nEarth Summit in 1992, what the motivation was, and then it goes forward \nfrom there.\n  Here is what is interesting. I was going to mention this in a hearing \nwe will both be attending tomorrow. They had the Earth Summit Plus 20 \njust a month ago in Rio de Janeiro, the same place it was held 20 years \nbefore that when George Bush was President of the United States. He \nwent down there even though he didn't really agree with the stuff that \nwas going on. In this case, President Obama didn't even go down. In \nfact, it has been conspicuous.\n  I was glad to see my friend from Vermont coming to the floor and \ntalking about an issue that hasn't been talked about now for years. I \nam glad it is coming up again. I am glad people realize the cost it is \ngoing to be to the American people. By the way, the $300 billion to \n$400 billion originated from a study that was done by scientists--I am \nsorry--by economists from the Wharton School, and they came up with \nthat figure. Later on, MIT and several universities said: Well, that is \nthe $300 billion to $400 billion, what it will cost. So that has been \npretty much agreed to. Yet I am sure there is a dissenting view. But \nthis is the first time I have heard on the floor of this Senate a \ndenial of that assertion that was made. Everyone knows what it will \ncost.\n  I remember the McCain-Lieberman bill when Senator Lieberman said: \nYes, it will cost billions of dollars. There is\n\n[[Page S5641]]\n\nno question about it. Cap and trade will cost billions of dollars. The \nquestion is, What do we gain from it?\n  Well, that is a pretty good question.\n  Getting back to Lisa Jackson, I asked the question--this was in a \nlive hearing. I think the Senator from Vermont may have been there; I \ndon't know for sure. It was live on TV.\n  I said: The assertion has been made that global warming is--that if \nwe pass something, we are going to be able to stop this horrible thing \nthat is going on right now. Let me ask you for the record, live on TV, \nin a committee hearing, if we were to pass the cap-and-trade bill--I \nthink it was the Markey bill at that time; I am not sure. Cap and trade \nis cap and trade--pretty much the same. If we were to pass that, would \nthat lower worldwide emissions of CO2?\n  She said: No, it wouldn't.\n  Wait a minute. This is the Obama-appointed director of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency who said: No, it wouldn't, because the \nproblem isn't here. The problem is in other countries.\n  I don't remember what countries she named--probably China, India, \nMexico. It could be other countries; I am not sure. But nonetheless, \nshe said: No, it really wouldn't do that.\n  So what we are talking about is this tax on the American people of \n$300 billion to $400 billion. I remember--and I think the Senator from \nVermont remembers this also--way back in 1993, during the first of the \nClinton-Gore administration, they had the Clinton-Gore tax increase of \n1993. That was an increase of marginal rates, the death tax, capital \ngains, and I believe it was the largest tax increase in three decades \nat that time. That was a $32 billion tax increase. This would be a tax \nincrease ten times that rate.\n  I know there are people--their heads swim when they hear these \nnumbers. It doesn't mean anything to them. I will tell my colleagues \nwhat I do. In Oklahoma, I get the number of families who file a tax \nreturn, and then I do the math every time somebody comes up. In the \ncase of that increase, of the $300 billion to $400 billion, we are \ntalking about a $3,000 tax increase for each family in my State of \nOklahoma that files a tax return. So, fine, if they want to do that, \nthey can try to do it, but let's not say something good will come from \nit when the director of the EPA herself said no, it is not going to \nreduce emissions.\n  The other thing too that my friend from Vermont mentioned was the \nheat. Yes, it is hot. In fact, it was kind of funny--during the remarks \nof my friend from Vermont, my wife called me from Oklahoma and said: Do \nyou think I should call in and say today it is 109 degrees?\n  I said: No, it wouldn't be a good idea. Let me say it.\n  So it is true. Now and then we have some very hot summers, and in the \ncase of my State of Oklahoma, it is hot almost every summer. We have \nhad a lot of heat. However, the people who try to say there is proof \nthat global warming is taking place are the same ones who--back when we \nhad the most severe winter 2 years ago, when my kids built the famous \nigloo, that was one of the most severe winters. In fact, all the \nairports were closed at that time. It was kind of funny. I have 20 kids \nand grandkids. One family is headed up by Jimmy and Molly Rapert. She \nis a professor at the University of Arkansas. She has a little girl we \nhelped find in Ethiopia many years ago. Zagita Marie was just a few \ndays old when we found her and not in very good shape. We nursed her \nback to health. Molly and her husband, who have three boys, decided \nthey wanted a girl, and they adopted her. She is now 12 years old. She \nreads at college level. Every year I have the Africa dinner in \nFebruary, and she has been the keynote speaker at that.\n  Anyway, 2 years ago in February, she had given her keynote speech and \nthey were getting ready to leave and go back home, but they couldn't \nget out because all the airports were closed. What do you do with a \nfamily of six? You go out and build an igloo. This wasn't just an igloo \nthe kids built; it slept four people, right next to the Library of \nCongress, and on top of it they had a little sign saying ``Al Gore's \nNew Home.''\n  Anyway, they were talking about that single weather event at that \ntime--or some were; not me; I know better than to do that--saying \nglobal warming can't take place because we have had the most severe \nwinters. Anyway, a lot of people have tried to use--and I don't blame \nthem for doing it--the idea that, oh, it is really hot out there; \ntherefore, this must be global warming.\n  I would suggest that--oh, yeah, the one weather event. Roger Pielke, \nJr., professor of environmental studies at the University of Colorado, \nsaid:\n\n       Over the long run, there is no evidence that disasters are \n     getting worse because of climate change.\n\n  Judith Curry, chair of the Georgia Institute of Technology School of \nEarth and Atmospheric Sciences, said:\n\n       I have been completely unconvinced by any of the arguments \n     that attribute a single extreme weather event or a cluster of \n     extreme weather events or statistics of extreme weather \n     events to an anthropogenic forcing.\n\n  Myles Allen, the head of the Climate Dynamics Group at the University \nof Oxford's Atmospheric, Oceanic and Planetary Physics Department, \nsaid:\n\n       When Al Gore said that scientists now have clear proof that \n     climate change is directly responsible for the extreme and \n     devastating floods, storms and droughts, my heart sank.\n\n  The other day, I was on the ``Rachel Maddow Show.'' I watch Rachel \nMaddow. She is one of my three favorite--let me just declare today that \nI have four favorite liberals, and the Senator from Vermont is one of \nthem. He just graduated to that today, I say to my friend from Vermont.\n  Anyway, I have been on her show before--and I always like doing it \nbecause they are on the other side of these issues--but her own guy, \ncalled Bill Nye the Science Guy, agrees, one, it is wrong to try to \nattribute climate to a weather event. There is a big difference between \nweather and climate. So we have an awful lot of people who are talking \nabout that.\n  My good friend from Vermont talked about the global cooling \npredictions. Let me correct him in saying that I did not say that. I \nsaid that quoting scientists. I try to do that because I do not want \nanyone to think I know that much about science because I do not.\n  A prominent Russian scientist, Dr. Abdussamatov, said:\n\n       We should fear a deep temperature drop--not catastrophic \n     global warming. . . .\n       It follows that [global] warming had a natural origin, the \n     contribution of CO2 to it was insignificant. . . .\n\n  This second thing: ``UN Fears (More) Global Cooling Commeth!'' This \nis the IPCC. This is the United Nations, the same people who, in my \nopinion--I do say this--are trying to profit from this issue. When I \nsay that, let me clarify that because when the United Nations comes up \nwith something that is not in the best interests of this country--I \nhave often said we ought to correct this. I have written letters, \nsigned by Members of this Senate, and before that by Members of the \nHouse when I was in the House, saying: You guys are going to have to \ncome to the meeting and talk about this because it is going to be a \nserious problem.\n  When you talk about all these things that are going on, it is \nsomething that is not actually taking place.\n  So they said--and I am quoting now. This would be palaeoclimate \nscientist Dr. Bob Carter from James Cook University in Australia, who \nhas testified before the U.S. Senate Committee on EPW. I was there at \nthat testimony. He noted on June 18, 2007: The accepted global average \ntemperature statistics used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange show that no ground-based warming has occurred since 1998. \nOddly, this is 8-year long temperature stability that occurred, despite \nan increase over the same period of 15 parts per million of atmospheric \nCO2.\n  So, again, these are scientists. I know there are scientists with \nvarying views, but there sure are a lot of them here.\n  Just months before the Copenhagen matter took place--by the way, I \nkind of enjoyed that trip to Copenhagen because when I got over there--\nthis, again, was the meeting where they invite all the people who \nbelieve in global warming and make all these countries--192 countries--\nbelieve if they will go along with this, they will get great rewards \nfor doing something about global warming. So, anyway, I enjoyed that \nvery much because I was\n\n[[Page S5642]]\n\nable to go over and show the people what the truth was in this country.\n  But Andrew Revkin, just before Copenhagen, on September 23, 2009, in \nthe New York Times, acknowledged:\n\n       The world leaders who met at the United Nations to discuss \n     climate change . . . are faced with an intricate challenge: \n     building momentum for an international climate treaty at a \n     time when global temperatures have been relatively stable for \n     a decade and may even drop for the next few years.\n\n  I look at some of the things--incidentally, I kind of wish I had \nknown my good friend from Vermont was going to be talking about this \nbecause I would have been delighted to join in and get a little bit \nbetter prepared. But I would say this as to the cost: When you talk \nabout where this cost comes from, the $300 to $400 billion, the Kyoto \nProtocol and cap-and-trade cost--this is from the Wharton Econometrics \nForecasting Associates I mentioned just a minute ago--Kyoto would cost \n2.4 million U.S. jobs and reduce GDP by 3.2 percent or about $300 \nbillion annually, an amount greater than the total expenditure on \nprimary and secondary education.\n  Oh, yes, let's talk about polar bears. I am not sure my friend \nmentioned the polar bears, so I will skip that part. Anyway, let me \njust say this: It has become something that has been somewhat of a \nreligion to talk about what is happening and the world is coming to an \nend. I would just suggest they are not winning that battle.\n  In March 2010, in a Gallup poll, Americans ranked global warming dead \nlast--8 out of 8--on environmental issues. That was not true 10 years \nago. Ten years ago, it was No. 1, and everyone thought that. The more \npeople sit back and look at it and study it, they decide: Well, maybe \nit is not true after all.\n  In March 2010, a Rasmussen poll: 72 percent of American voters do not \nbelieve global warming is a very serious problem. In a Rasmussen poll \nat the same time as to the Democrat base: Only 35 percent now think \nclimate change is manmade.\n  The global warmist Robert Socolow laments:\n\n       We are losing the argument with the general public, big \n     time . . . I think the climate change activists, myself \n     included, have lost the American middle.\n\n  In a way, I am kind of pleased it is coming back up and surfacing \nnow. I thank my good friend, and he is my good friend. People do not \nunderstand--they really do not understand--what the Senate is all \nabout. The House was not that way when I was in the House. But in the \nSenate, you can love someone and disagree with them philosophically and \ncome out and talk about it.\n  I have no doubt in my mind that my friend from Vermont is sincere in \nwhat he believes. I believe he would say he knows I am sincere with \nwhat I believe. That is what makes this a great body.\n  But I will just say this: It is popular to say the world is coming to \nan end. When we look historically, I could go back and talk about what \nhas happened over the years--over the centuries really--and going \nthrough these periods of time, and it is always that the world is \ncoming to an end.\n  Well, I am here to announce--and I feel very good being able to do it \nwith 20 kids and grandkids; I am happy to tell them all right now--the \nworld is not coming to an end, and global warming--we are going through \na cycle. We have gone through these cycles before, and every time we go \nthrough--in part of my book I talk about the hysterical things people \nare saying.\n  Back during that period of time, I mentioned between 1895 and 1930 \nabout how the world was coming to an end, and the same thing from 1930 \nto the end of the war. Then, of course, getting into the little ice \nage, all these things that were taking place, the little ice age from \n1945--not the ice age but this cooling period--the cooling period that \nstarted in 1945 and lasted for 30 years was the time in our history \nwhere we had the greatest increase in carbon in the air, the greatest \nuse of that. So it is inconsistent with what reality was.\n  So I would say to my good friend, I have no doubt in my mind that the \nSenator from Vermont is sincere in what he says. While he and I are \nranked at the extreme sides of the philosophical pendulum, I would say \nI know he is sincere. But I will also say this is a tough world we are \nin right now. When we look at the problems we have in this country and \nthe problems we are having in the world and the cost that it has, I am \nvery thankful those who are trying to pass the cap and trade, all the \nway from the Kyoto Treaty--which was never brought to the Senate, never \nbrought because they knew they were not going to be able to pass it--up \nuntil the time when that ended in about 2009, I would say a lot of \nactivists were out there, but I think people have now realized: Just \nlook at the patterns. It gets colder, it gets warmer, it gets colder, \nit gets warmer. God is still up there. And I think that will continue \nin the future.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I have talked for a long time on this \nissue, so I do not want to make a great speech and continue speaking at \ngreat length. I do want to say a few things.\n  First of all, I want to thank Senator Inhofe for his kind words. Let \nme respond in the same way. He and I philosophically and politically \ncome from very different places. I have never doubted for one moment \nthe honesty or the sincerity of the Senator from Oklahoma. He is saying \nwhat he believes. He has the courage to get up here and say it, and I \nappreciate that. So we are good friends, and I hope we will continue to \nbe good friends.\n  I think, frankly, it does this Senate, and it does this country, good \nwhen people hear varied differences of opinion on an issue that I \nconsider to be of enormous consequence. So what I would say to my \nfriend is, I hope, in fact, this is the beginning of a resurgence of \ndiscussion about this issue, and I look forward to engaging in the \ndiscussion with my friend from Oklahoma.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Webb). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/30/senate-section/article/S5642-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5642-S5651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF ROBERT E. BACHARACH TO BE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR \n                           THE TENTH CIRCUIT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Robert E. Bacharach, of \nOklahoma, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Tenth Circuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 1 hour \nof debate equally divided and controlled in the usual form.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Today's debate and vote on the partisan filibuster of the \nOklahoma judicial nominee, who has had the support of the Republican \nSenators from Oklahoma since President Obama nominated him 6 months \nago, is another example of how extreme Senate Republicans have gone in \ntheir efforts to obstruct judicial confirmations. If they succeed in \ntheir partisan filibuster, it will be another first for them. Never \nbefore has the Senate filibustered and refused to vote on a judicial \nnominee with such strong bipartisan support, who was voted out of the \nJudiciary Committee with virtually unanimous support.\n  Their partisan efforts to shut down Senate confirmations of qualified \njudicial nominees who have bipartisan support do not help the American \npeople. This is a shortsighted policy at a time when the judicial \nvacancy rate remains more than twice what it was at this point in the \nfirst term of President Bush. Judicial vacancies during the last few \nyears have been at historically high levels. Nearly one out of every 11 \nFederal judgeships is currently vacant. Their shutting down \nconfirmations for consensus and qualified circuit court nominees is not \nhelping the overburdened Federal courts to which Americans turn for \njustice.\n\n[[Page S5643]]\n\n  Over his 13-year career as a U.S. Magistrate Judge in the Western \nDistrict of Oklahoma, Judge Robert Bacharach has handled nearly 3,000 \ncivil and criminal matters, presided over 400 judicial settlement \nconferences, and issued more than 1,600 reports and recommendations. As \nan attorney in private practice, Judge Bacharach tried 10 cases to \nverdict, argued 2 cases before the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, and \nbriefed scores of other cases to the tenth circuit and the Oklahoma \nSupreme Court. The ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary has \nrated Judge Bacharach unanimously well qualified, the highest possible \nrating from its nonpartisan peer review.\n  Judge Bacharach's judicial colleagues in the Western District of \nOklahoma stand strongly behind his nomination. Vicki Miles-LaGrange, \nChief Judge of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of \nOklahoma, has said of Judge Bacharach:\n\n       He is an outstanding jurist and my colleagues and I \n     enthusiastically and wholeheartedly recommend him for the \n     Tenth Circuit position . . . We knew that we were lucky to \n     have Bob as a Magistrate Judge, and he's been remarkable in \n     this position for over 12 years. He is an absolutely great \n     Magistrate Judge. His research and writing are excellent, his \n     temperament is superb, his preparation is top-notch, and he \n     is a wonderful colleague to all of the judges and in general \n     to the entire court family. . . . All of the other judges and \n     I--Republicans and Democrats alike--enthusiastically and \n     wholeheartedly recommend Judge Bob Bacharach for the Tenth \n     Circuit position. All of us believe very strongly that Judge \n     Bacharach would be a superb choice for the position.\n\n  Throughout this very careful and deliberate process in which Judge \nRobert Bacharach has been thoroughly vetted, considered, and voted on \nby the Judiciary Committee, I have not heard a single negative word \nabout him. There is no Senator that I know of who is opposed to his \nnomination on the merits. The only obstacle standing between Judge \nBacharach being confirmed to serve the people of the tenth circuit is \npartisan obstruction.\n  Nor is Judge Bacharach the only victim of this abuse. In a letter \ndated June 20, 2012, the president of the American Bar Association \nurged Senator Reid and Senator McConnell to work together to schedule \nvotes on the nominations of William Kayatta and Richard Taranto, as \nwell as Judge Bacharach. These are three consensus, qualified circuit \ncourt nominees awaiting Senate confirmation so that they may serve the \nAmerican people. I ask that a copy of that letter be printed in the \nRecord, along with an article from the Oklahoman on this nomination.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     American Bar Association,\n\n                                       Chicago, IL, June 20, 2012.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Republican Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid and Republican Leader McConnell: \n     Amid concerns that the judicial confirmation process is about \n     to fall victim to presidential election year politics through \n     the invocation of the ``Thurmond Rule,'' I am writing on \n     behalf of the American Bar Association to reiterate our grave \n     concern for the longstanding number of judicial vacancies on \n     Article III courts and to urge you to schedule floor votes on \n     three pending, noncontroversial circuit court nominees before \n     July and on district court nominees who have strong \n     bipartisan support on a weekly basis thereafter.\n       Three of the four circuit court nominees pending on the \n     Senate floor are consensus nominees who have received \n     overwhelming approval from the Senate Judiciary Committee. \n     Both William Kayatta, Jr. of Maine, nominated to the First \n     Circuit, and Robert Bacharach of Oklahoma, nominated to the \n     Tenth Circuit, have the staunch support of their Republican \n     senators. Richard Taranto, nominated to the Federal Circuit, \n     enjoys strong bipartisan support, including the endorsement \n     of noted conservative legal scholars. All three nominees also \n     have stellar professional qualifications and each has been \n     rated unanimously ``well-qualified'' by the ABA's Standing \n     Committee on the Federal Judiciary.\n       As you know, the ``Thurmond Rule'' is neither a rule nor a \n     clearly defined event. While the ABA takes no position on \n     what invocation of the ``Thurmond Rule'' actually means or \n     whether it represents wise policy, recent news stories have \n     cast it as a precedent under which the Senate, after a \n     specified date in a presidential election year, ceases to \n     vote on nominees to the federal circuit courts of appeals. We \n     note that there has been no consistently observed date at \n     which this has occurred during the presidential election \n     years from 1980 to 2008. With regard to the past three \n     election years, the last circuit court nominees were \n     confirmed in June during 2004 and 2008 and in July during \n     2000. In deference to these historical cut-off dates and \n     because of our conviction that the Senate has a continuing \n     constitutional duty to act with due diligence to reduce the \n     dangerously high vacancy rate that is adversely affecting our \n     federal judiciary, we exhort you to schedule votes on these \n     three outstanding circuit court nominees this month.\n       We also urge you to continue to work together to move \n     consensus district court nominees to the floor for a vote \n     throughout the rest of the session, lest the vacancy crisis \n     worsens in the waning months of the 112th Congress. With five \n     new vacancies arising this month and an additional five \n     announced for next month, this is not just a possibility; it \n     is a certainty, absent your continued commitment to the \n     federal judiciary and steady action on nominees.\n       Thank you for your past efforts and for your consideration \n     of our views on this important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                       Wm. T. (Bill) Robinson III,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  [From the Oklahoman, June 15, 2012]\n\n   Senate Republicans To Block Vote on Oklahoma Nominee for Federal \n                             Appeals Court\n\n                           (By Chris Casteel)\n\n       Washington.--Senate Republicans won't allow a vote before \n     November's presidential election to confirm U.S. Magistrate \n     Judge Robert E. Bacharach to a federal appeals court, despite \n     Bacharach's credentials and support from both Oklahoma \n     senators, Sen. Tom Coburn said Thursday.\n       Coburn, R-Muskogee, said Senate Republican leader Mitch \n     McConnell told him Republicans were following a tradition \n     used by both parties to block votes on circuit court nominees \n     a few months before a presidential election.\n       That means a vote on Bacharach, whose nomination to the \n     10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals cleared the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee last week, ``is not going to happen,'' \n     Coburn said.\n       Coburn said the nomination of John E. Dowdell to be a U.S. \n     district judge in Tulsa still has a ``great chance'' of \n     clearing the full Senate.\n       Bacharach is ``an awfully good candidate'' for the circuit \n     court position, said Coburn, who praised his character and \n     judicial temperament. Bacharach, who has been a magistrate \n     judge in Oklahoma City since 1999, was given a rating of \n     ``unanimously well qualified'' for the appeals court position \n     by the American Bar Association.\n       Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Tulsa, praised Bacharach during a \n     committee hearing last month.\n       But the selection and confirmation process moved too slowly \n     to fill the vacancy on the appeals court--which is a step \n     below the U.S. Supreme Court--given the political timetable \n     in Washington.\n       Though the position has been open since July 2010, the \n     White House didn't make a nomination until January, after \n     spending months vetting candidates that weren't going to be \n     acceptable to Coburn and Inhofe.\n       Then, it took more than three months to schedule a \n     committee hearing for Bacharach as the staff conducted a \n     background investigation; Coburn withheld his approval for a \n     committee hearing until the committee investigation was \n     completed.\n       Ultimately, Bacharach may have just narrowly missed a full \n     Senate vote. The Senate this week, over the objections of \n     most Republicans, confirmed a nominee from Arizona for \n     another circuit court. After that vote, McConnell told \n     Republican senators no other votes on circuit judges would be \n     held.\n       McConnell's office declined to comment on Thursday.\n       Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, chairman of the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee, said Thursday, ``This is really a \n     challenge to the senators who have said that they will not \n     support these filibusters and this kind of shutdown, and to \n     those Republican senators who support the circuit court \n     nominees from Maine and Oklahoma.''\n       But Coburn said there wasn't anything he could do about the \n     situation.\n       The delaying tactic on circuit court judges, which will \n     likely extend to district court judges later this year, has \n     become common practice for the party that doesn't control the \n     White House.\n       This year, it means Republicans will block votes on \n     nominees for appeals courts, which can have great influence \n     on a wide range of legal issues since the Supreme Court \n     agrees to hear relatively few cases.\n       The aim of the tactic is to delay making lifetime \n     appointments to federal courts in hopes their party will \n     regain the White House and the power to fill judicial \n     vacancies. Coburn said Bacharach could be cleared late this \n     year if President Barack Obama wins re-election. If not, \n     Coburn said, Bacharach would make a great nominee for a \n     Republican president.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. The ABA president wrote:\n\n\n[[Page S5644]]\n\n\n       Amid concerns that the judicial confirmation process is \n     about to fall victim to presidential election year politics \n     through the invocation of the ``Thurmond Rule,'' I am writing \n     on behalf of the American Bar Association to reiterate our \n     grave concern for the longstanding number of judicial \n     vacancies on Article III courts and to urge you to schedule \n     floor votes on three pending, noncontroversial circuit court \n     nominees before July and on district court nominees who have \n     strong bipartisan support on a weekly basis thereafter.\n\n  This is the precise danger that was the reason for that letter. \nIncluding Judge Bacharach, William Kayatta of Maine, and Richard \nTaranto, there are currently 20 judicial nominees voted out of the \nJudiciary Committee and being blocked by Senate Republicans.\n  During the Judiciary Committee meeting approving the nomination of \nJudge Bacharach, Senator Coburn noted:\n\n       I believe that Judge Bacharach will uphold the highest \n     standards and reflect the best in our American judicial \n     tradition by coming to the bench as a well-regarded member of \n     the community. At a time when our country seems as divided as \n     ever, it is important that citizens respect members of the \n     judiciary and are confident they will faithfully and \n     impartially apply the law. . . I believe Judge Bacharach \n     would be an excellent addition to the Tenth Circuit.\n\n  Senator Inhofe likewise has said: ``I believe that Judge Bacharach \nwould continue the strong service Oklahomans have provided the Tenth \nCircuit.'' When asked last month about this effort to block a vote on \nJudge Bacharach's nomination, Senator Coburn told The Oklahoman: ``I \nthink it's stupid.'' He is right. It is just obstruction.\n  There is no good reason that the Senate should not vote on consensus \ncircuit court nominees thoroughly vetted, considered and voted on and \napproved with nearly unanimous bipartisan support by the Judiciary \nCommittee. There is no reason the Senate cannot vote on the nomination \nof William Kayatta of Maine to the first circuit, a nominee strongly \nsupported by both of Maine's Republican Senators and reported nearly \nunanimously by the committee 3 months ago and 2 months before \nconsidering Judge Bacharach's nomination. This is the same person who \nChief Justice John Roberts recommended to Kenneth Starr for a position \nin the Justice Department. He is widely respected in Maine. Republicans \ncannot seriously oppose his nomination on the merits or for ideological \nreasons. It is just more obstruction.\n  There is also no reason the Senate cannot vote on Richard Taranto's \nnomination to the Federal circuit. He was reported almost unanimously \nby voice vote nearly 4 months ago, and is supported by conservatives \nsuch as Robert Bork and Paul Clement. Republicans cannot seriously \noppose his nomination to the Federal circuit on the merits or for \nideological reasons. It is just more obstruction.\n  Each of these circuit court nominees has been rated unanimously well \nqualified by the nonpartisan ABA Standing Committee on the Federal \nJudiciary, the highest possible rating. These are not controversial \nnominees. They are qualified and should be considered as consensus \nnominees and confirmed. Senate Republicans are blocking consent to vote \non superbly qualified circuit court nominees with strong bipartisan \nsupport. This is a new and damaging application of the Thurmond rule.\n  It is hard to see how this new application of the Thurmond rule is \nreally anything more than another name for the stalling tactics we have \nseen for months and years. I have yet to hear any good reason why we \nshould not continue to vote on well-qualified, consensus nominees, just \nas we did up until September of the last 2 Presidential election years. \nI have yet to hear a good explanation why we cannot work to solve the \nproblem of high vacancies for the American people. I will continue to \nwork to confirm as many of President Obama's qualified judicial \nnominees as possible to fill the many judicial vacancies that burden \nour courts and the American people across the country.\n  Senate Republicans have become the party of no--no help for the \nAmerican people, no to jobs, no to economic recovery, no help to extend \ntax cuts for the middle class, and no to judges to provide Americans \nwith justice in their Federal courts. Although the public announcement \nthat they would be blocking qualified and consensus circuit court \nnominees was not until June, the truth is that Senate Republicans have \nbeen obstructing President Obama's judicial nominees since the \nbeginning of his Presidency, beginning with their filibuster of his \nfirst nominee.\n  Senate Republicans used to insist that filibustering of judicial \nnominations was unconstitutional. The Constitution has not changed but \nas soon as President Obama was elected they reversed course and \nfilibustered President Obama's very first judicial nomination. Judge \nDavid Hamilton of Indiana was a widely respected 15-year veteran of the \nFederal bench nominated to the seventh circuit and was supported by \nSenator Dick Lugar, the longest-serving Republican in the Senate. They \ndelayed his confirmation for 5 months. Senate Republicans then \nproceeded to obstruct and delay just about every circuit court nominee \nof this President, filibustering nine of them. They delayed \nconfirmation of Judge Albert Diaz of North Carolina to the fourth \ncircuit for 11 months. They delayed confirmation of Judge Jane Stranch \nof Tennessee to the sixth circuit for 10 months. They delayed \nconfirmation of Judge Ray Lohier of New York to the second circuit for \n7 months. They delayed confirmation of Judge Scott Matheson of Utah to \nthe tenth circuit and Judge James Wynn, Jr. of North Carolina to the \nfourth circuit for 6 months. They delayed confirmation of Judge Andre \nDavis of Maryland to the fourth circuit, Judge Henry Floyd of South \nCarolina to the fourth circuit, Judge Stephanie Thacker of West \nVirginia to the fourth circuit, and Judge Jacqueline Nguyen of \nCalifornia to the ninth circuit for 5 months. They delayed confirmation \nof Judge Adalberto Jordan of Florida to the eleventh circuit, Judge \nBeverly Martin of Georgia to the eleventh circuit, Judge Mary Murguia \nof Arizona to the ninth circuit, Judge Bernice Donald of Tennessee to \nthe sixth circuit, Judge Barbara Keenan of Virginia to the fourth \ncircuit, Judge Thomas Vanaskie of Pennsylvania to the third circuit, \nJudge Joseph Greenaway of New Jersey to the third circuit, Judge Denny \nChin of New York to the second circuit, and Judge Chris Droney of \nConnecticut to the second circuit for 4 months. They delayed \nconfirmation of Judge Paul Watford of California to the ninth circuit, \nJudge Andrew Hurwitz of Arizona to the ninth circuit, Judge Morgan \nChristen of Alaska to the ninth circuit, Judge Stephen Higginson of \nLouisiana to the fifth circuit, Judge Gerard Lynch of New York to the \nsecond circuit, Judge Susan Carney of Connecticut to the second \ncircuit, and Judge Kathleen O'Malley of Ohio to the Federal circuit for \n3 months.\n  As a recent report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research \nService confirms, the median time circuit nominees have had to wait for \na Senate vote has skyrocketed from 18 days for President Bush's \nnominees to 132 days for President Obama's circuit court nominees. This \nis the result of Republican foot dragging and obstruction. In most \ncases, Senate Republicans have been delaying and stalling for no good \nreason. How else do you explain the filibuster of the nomination of \nJudge Barbara Keenan of Virginia to the fourth circuit who was \nultimately confirmed 99-0? And how else do you explain the needless \nobstruction of Judge Denny Chin of New York to the second circuit, who \nwas filibustered for 4 months before he was confirmed 98-0?\n  The only change in their practices is that Senate Republicans have \nfinally acknowledged that they are seeking to shut down the \nconfirmation process for qualified and consensus circuit court \nnominees. Three of the five circuit court judges finally confirmed this \nyear after months of unnecessary delays and a filibuster should have \nbeen confirmed last year. The other two circuit court nominees \nconfirmed this year were both subjected to stalling and partisan \nfilibusters, which were thankfully unsuccessful.\n  The American people need to understand that Senate Republicans are \nstalling and filibustering judicial nominees supported by their home \nState Republican Senators. Just consider the States I have already \nmentioned as having circuit nominees supported by their home State \nRepublican Senators unnecessarily stalled--Indiana, North Carolina, \nUtah, South Carolina, Georgia. Just last month we needed to overcome a \nfilibuster to confirm\n\n[[Page S5645]]\n\nJustice Andrew Hurwitz of the Arizona Supreme Court to the ninth \ncircuit despite the strong support of Senators Jon Kyl and John McCain. \nNow it is nominees from Oklahoma and Maine who are being filibustered \ndespite the support of their home State Republican Senators.\n  The year started with the majority leader having to file cloture to \nget an up-or-down vote on Judge Adalberto Jordan of Florida to the \neleventh circuit even though he was strongly supported by his \nRepublican home State Senator. And every single one of these nominees \nfor whom the majority leader was forced to file cloture this year was \nrated unanimously well qualified by the nonpartisan ABA Standing \nCommittee on the Federal Judiciary, the highest possible rating. Most \nwere to fill a judicial emergency vacancy. So when I hear some Senate \nRepublicans say they are now invoking the Thurmond rule and have \ndecided they are not going to allow President Obama's judicial nominees \nto be considered, I wonder how the American people are supposed to be \nable to tell the difference from how they have been obstructing for the \nlast 3\\1/2\\ years.\n  The minority's stalling of votes on judicial nominees with \nsignificant bipartisan support is all to the detriment of the American \npeople. This has been a tactic that they have employed for the last \n3\\1/2\\ years, despite repeated appeals urging them to work with us to \nhelp solve the judicial vacancy crisis. We have seen everyone from \nChief Justice John Roberts, himself appointed by a Republican \nPresident, to the nonpartisan American Bar Association urging the \nSenate to vote on qualified judicial nominees who are available to \nadminister justice for the American public. Sadly, Republicans insist \non being the party of no.\n  What the American people and the overburdened Federal courts need are \nqualified judges to administer justice in our Federal courts, not the \nperpetuation of extended, numerous vacancies. Today vacancies on the \nFederal courts are more than 2\\1/2\\ times as many as they were on this \ndate during the first term of President Bush. The Senate is more than \n40 confirmations off the pace we set during President Bush's first \nterm.\n  Because they cannot deny the strength of this comparison--using \napples to apples by comparing first terms--Senate Republicans instead \ntry to draw comfort by making comparisons to President Bush's second \nterm after we had already worked hard to reduce vacancies by 75 \npercent. In fact, during President Bush's second term, the number of \nvacancies never exceeded 60 and was reduced to 34 near the end of his \nPresidency. In stark contrast, vacancies have long remained near or \nabove 80, with little progress made in these last 3\\1/2\\ years. Today, \nthere are still 76 vacancies. Their tactics have actually led to an \nincrease in judicial vacancies during President Obama's first term--a \ndevelopment that is another sad first.\n  But the real point is that their selective use of numbers does \nnothing to help the American people. We should be doing better. I know \nthat we can because we have done better. During President Bush's first \nterm, notwithstanding the 9/11 attacks, the anthrax attack on the \nSenate, the ideologically driven selections of judicial nominees by \nPresident Bush, and his lack of outreach to home State Senators, we \nreduced the number of judicial vacancies down to 29 by this point \nduring his first term and acted to confirm 205 circuit and district \ncourt nominees by the end of his first term.\n  Another excuse from the minority comes across more as partisan score \nsettling than anything else. They claim that having confirmed two \nSupreme Court Justices, the Senate cannot be expected to reach the 205 \nnumber of confirmations in President Bush's first term.\n  But those Supreme Court confirmation proceedings from years ago do \nnot excuse the Senate from taking the actions it could now on the 20 \njudicial nominees voted out of the Judiciary Committee and ready for \nfinal Senate action. That second Supreme Court confirmation was in \nAugust 2010. That is almost 2 years ago and it was opposed by most \nSenate Republicans.\n  Senate Republicans held down circuit and district court confirmations \nin President Obama's first 2 years in office to historically low \nnumbers--12 by the end of 2009 and another 48 in 2010 for a total of \nonly 60. They refused to act on 10 nominees ready at the end of 2009 \nand on 19 as 2010 drew to a close. Last year they employed the same \ntactic in stalling action on another 19 judicial nominees at the end of \n2011. Now it is 20 judicial nominees in this summer of 2012 that they \nare stalling. Had Republicans not stalled 19 nominations at the end of \nlast year and dragged those confirmations out into May of this year, we \nthe American people and the Federal courts would be much better off. As \nit is, however, the fact remains that there are 20 qualified judicial \nnominations that the Senate could be voting on without further delay.\n  They refuse to acknowledge that in addition to confirming two Supreme \nCourt Justices in President Clinton's first term, the Senate was able \nto confirm 200 circuit and district court judges. And in 1992, at the \nend of President George H.W. Bush's term, the Senate with a Democratic \nmajority was able to confirm 192 circuit and district court judges \ndespite confirming two Supreme Court Justices. Republicans have kept \nthe Senate well back from those numbers by only allowing the Senate to \nproceed to confirm 154 of President Obama's circuit and district court \nnominees. That is a far cry from what we have been able to achieve in \naddition to our consideration of Supreme Court nominations when the \nSenate was being allowed to function more fairly and to consider \njudicial nominees reported with bipartisan support.\n  Nor are the nominees about whom we are concerned recently nominated. \nThese are not nominees dumped on the Senate in scores at the end of a \nPresidential term. These are, instead, nominations that date back to \nOctober of last year. Most were nominated before March. In fact the \ncircuit court nominees who Republicans are refusing to consider date \nback to October and November of last year and January of this year. \nWilliam Kayatta was voted on by the committee and placed before the \nSenate by mid-April and could have been confirmed then. Richard Taranto \nand Judge Patty Shwartz have been stalled before the Senate even \nlonger, since March. The truth is that Senate Republicans have shut \ndown confirmations of circuit court judges not just in July but, in \neffect, for the entire year. The Senate has yet to vote on a single \ncircuit court nominee nominated by President Obama this year. Since \n1980, the only Presidential election year in which there were no \ncircuit nominees confirmed who was nominated that year was in 1996, \nwhen Senate Republicans shut down the process against President \nClinton's circuit nominees. The fact that Republican stalling tactics \nhave meant that circuit court nominees that should have been confirmed \nin the spring--like Bill Kayatta, Richard Taranto and Patty Shwartz--\nare still awaiting a vote after July 4th is no excuse for not moving \nforward this month to confirm these circuit nominees.\n  The American people who are waiting for justice do not care about \nexcuses. They do not care about some false sense of settling political \nscores. They want justice, just as they want action on measures the \nPresident has suggested to help the economy and create jobs rather than \npolitical calculations about what will help Republican candidates in \nthe elections in November.\n  When Republican Senators try to take credit for the Senate having \nreached what they regard as their ``quota'' for confirmations this \nyear, they should acknowledge their strenuous opposition and attempts \nto filibuster many of the nominations for which they now take credit. \nAs recently as 2008, Senate Republicans denied there was a Thurmond \nrule. They used to say that any judicial nominee reported by the Senate \nwas entitled to an up-or-down vote and that they would never filibuster \njudicial nominees. Well, the majority leader has had to file 30 cloture \npetitions to end their filibusters of judicial nominees. Now they are \nflip-flopping on their own call for up-or-down votes.\n  What they are doing now is a first. As I have noted, in the past 5 \nPresidential election years, Senate Democrats have never denied an up-\nor-down vote to any circuit court nominee of a Republican President who \nreceived bipartisan support in the Judiciary Committee. They\n\n[[Page S5646]]\n\nare denying votes not only to Robert Bacharach, a nominee from Oklahoma \nsupported by his conservative home State Republican Senators but also \nto William Kayatta, a universally respected nominee from Maine \nsupported by his home State Republican Senators, and Richard Taranto, \nwhose nomination to the Federal circuit received virtually unanimous \nsupport. Even Judge Patty Shwartz, whose nomination to the third \ncircuit received a split rollcall vote, has the bipartisan support of \nNew Jersey Governor Chris Christie.\n  Personal attacks on me, taking quotes out of context, trying to \nrepackage their own actions as if following the Thurmond rule or what \nthey seek to dub the Leahy Rule do nothing to help the American people \nwho are seeking justice in our Federal courts. I am willing to defend \nmy record but that is beside the point. The harm to the American people \nis what matters. Republicans are insisting on being the party of no \neven when it comes to judicial nominees who home State Republican \nSenators support.\n  As chairman and when I served as the ranking member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, I have worked with Senate Republicans to consider judicial \nnominees well into Presidential election years. I have taken steps to \nmake the confirmation process more transparent and fair. I have ensured \nthat the President consults with home State Senators before submitting \na nominee. I have opened up what had been a secretive, blue-slip \nprocess to prevent abuses. All the while I have protected the rights of \nthe minority, of Republican Senators. If Republicans want to talk about \nthe Leahy rules, those are the practices I have followed. And I have \nbeen consistent. I hold hearings at the same pace and under the same \nprocedures whether the President nominating is a Democrat or a \nRepublican. Others cannot say that.\n  Senate Republicans are fond of taking quotes of things I have said \nout of context. But look at my record as chairman. I have not \nfilibustered nominees with bipartisan support in July of Presidential \nelection years. As chairman of this committee, I have steadfastly \nprotected the rights of the minority. I have done so despite criticism \nfrom Democrats. I have only proceeded with judicial nominations \nsupported by both home State Senators. I will put my record of \nconsistent fairness up against that of any chairman and remind Senate \nRepublicans that it is they who blatantly disregarded evenhanded \npractices when they were ramming through ideological nominations of \nPresident George W. Bush. They would proceed with nominations despite \nthe objection of both home State Senators.\n  So those are the Leahy rules--respect for and protection of minority \nrights, increased transparency, consistency, and allowing for \nconfirmations well into Presidential election years for nominees with \nbipartisan support.\n  And what were the results? In the last two Presidential election \nyears, we were able to bring the number of judicial vacancies down to \nthe lowest levels in the past 20 years. In 2004, at the end of \nPresident Bush's first term, vacancies were reduced to 28, not the 76 \nwe have today. In 2008, in the last year of President Bush's second \nterm, we again worked to fill vacancies and got them down to 34, less \nthan half of what they are today. In 2004, 25 nominees were confirmed \nfrom June 1 to the Presidential election. In 2008, 22 nominees were \nconfirmed between June 1 and the Presidential election. So far, since \nJune 1 of this year, only eight judges have been confirmed and five \nrequired the majority leader to file cloture to end Republican \nfilibusters.\n  In 2004, the Senate confirmed five circuit court nominees of a \nRepublican President that had been reported by the committee that year. \nThis year we have confirmed only two circuit court nominees that have \nbeen reported by the committee this year, and we had to overcome \nRepublican filibusters in both cases. By this date in 2004 the Senate \nhad already confirmed 35 of President Bush's circuit court nominees. So \nfar, the Senate has only been allowed to consider and confirm 30 of \nPresident Obama's circuit court nominees--5 fewer, 17 percent fewer--\nwhile higher numbers of vacancies remain, and yet the Senate Republican \nleadership demands an artificial shutdown on confirmation of qualified, \nconsensus nominees for no good reason.\n  In fact, during the last 20 years, only four circuit nominees \nreported with bipartisan support have been denied an up-or-down vote \nduring a Presidential election year by the Senate; all four were \nnominated by President Clinton and blocked by Senate Republicans. While \nSenate Democrats have been willing to work with Republican Presidents \nto confirm circuit court nominees with bipartisan support, Senate \nRepublicans have repeatedly obstructed the nominees of Democratic \nPresidents. In the previous 5 Presidential election years, a total of \n13 circuit court nominees have been confirmed after May 31. Not \nsurprisingly, 12 of the 13 were Republican nominees. Clearly, this is a \none-way street in favor of Republican Presidents' nominees.\n  Senate Republicans, on the other hand, have repeatedly asserted that \nthe Thurmond rule does not exist. For example, on July 14, 2008, the \nSenate Republican caucus held a forum and said that the Thurmond rule \ndoes not exist. At that meeting, the senior Senator from Kentucky, the \nRepublican leader stated: ``I think it's clear that there is no \nThurmond rule. And I think the facts demonstrate that.'' Similarly, the \nSenator from Iowa, my friend who is now serving as ranking member of \nthe Judiciary Committee, stated that the Thurmond rule was in his view \n``plain bunk.'' He said: ``The reality is that the Senate has never \nstopped confirming judicial nominees during the last few months of a \nPresident's term.'' We did not in 2008 when we proceeded to confirm 22 \nnominees over the second half of that year.\n  So at the end of President Bush's second term, and at the beginning \nof his first term as well, Senate Democrats worked to confirm consensus \nnominees and reduce the judicial vacancy rate. Despite the pace we set \nduring President Bush's first term for reducing vacancies, vacancies \nhave remained near or above 80 for most of President Obama's first term \nand little comparative progress has been made during the three and a \nhalf years of President Obama's first term. As contrasted to 29 \nvacancies in July 2004, there are still 76 vacancies in July 2012. If \nwe could move forward to Senate votes on the 20 judicial nominees ready \nfor final action, the Senate could reduce vacancies to less than 60 and \nmake some progress. We were 9 months later in confirming the 150th \ncircuit or district judge to be appointed by President Obama. Another \nway to look at our relative lack of progress and the burden the \nRepublican obstruction is placing on the American people seeking \njustice is to note that by mid-November 2002 we had already reduced \njudicial vacancies to below where we are now. In fact, when on November \n14, 2002, the Senate proceeded to confirm 18 judicial nominees, \nvacancies went down to 60 throughout the country. We effectively worked \ntwice as efficiently and twice as fast. By that measure, the Senate is \nalmost 20 months behind schedule. This is hardly then the time to be \nshutting down the process.\n  In a letter to Senators Coburn and Inhofe dated July 19, 2012, the \nAmerican Bar Association's State Delegate for Oklahoma urged the \nRepublican Senators to rise above politics and to end this filibuster \nof Judge Bacharach. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this letter \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     American Bar Association,\n\n                                 Oklahoma City, OK, July 19, 2012.\n     Senator James M. Inhofe,\n     Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Senator Tom Coburn,\n     Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Inhofe and Coburn: The undersigned, \n     Oklahoma's current delegates to the American Bar Association \n     (ABA) (less two judge members who abstain from this letter), \n     are writing to ask you respectfully to press the Republican \n     Senate leadership for a floor vote, before the traditional \n     August recess, on the nomination of Judge Robert Bacharach to \n     the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals vacancy.\n       As you probably know, the ABA wrote to the Senate leaders \n     of both parties on June 20, 2012, after Senator McConnell \n     announced his party's intention to invoke the so-called \n     ``Thurmond Rule'' and block floor consideration of any more \n     nominees to any federal circuit court vacancies, including \n     those, like Judge Bacharach, that: (1) have passed through \n     the Judiciary Committee; (2)\n\n[[Page S5647]]\n\n     present no controversy on their qualifications; and (3) have \n     the support of their home state senators.\n       We appreciate your role in the selection of Judge Bacharach \n     and your public support for his nomination. As you know, he \n     has been rated ``unanimously well qualified'' by the ABA \n     panel that reviewed his qualifications.\n       We understand that both political parties have engaged in a \n     variety of stalling tactics, including the threat of a \n     filibuster, regarding judicial nominations in the past. \n     However, this ignores the fact that this Oklahoma slot on the \n     Tenth Circuit has now been vacant for over two years.\n       Therefore, we are asking you (1) to use your considerable \n     influence within the Senate and urge the leadership of both \n     parties to schedule a floor vote on Judge Bacharach's \n     nomination before the August recess, and (2) to publicly \n     announce your willingness to vote to end any filibuster \n     preventing a vote on the merits of the nomination, if \n     necessary.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                    Jimmy Goodman,\n                                  ABA State Delegate for Oklahoma.\n       For himself and also for: Cathy M. Christensen, OBA (OK Bar \n     Assoc.) President; William G. Paul, ABA Past President; \n     Dwight L. Smith, ABA Division Delegate; James T. Stuart, OBA \n     President-Elect; M. Joe Crosthwait, Jr., Okla. County Bar \n     Delegate; Mark A. Robertson, ABA Section Delegate; Peggy \n     Stockwell, OBA Vice President; Robert S. Farris, Tulsa County \n     Bar Delegate; Jennifer Kirkpatrick, Young Lawyer Delegate.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is time for reasonable and independent \nthinking Senators to end this needless and damaging filibuster on Judge \nBacharach's nomination and confirm him. With judicial vacancies \nremaining at such high levels for so long, we need to continue \nconfirming judicial nominees. At a time when judicial vacancies \nremained historically high for 3 years, with 40 more vacancies and 40 \nfewer confirmations than at this point in President Bush's first term, \nthe Senate Republican leadership should reconsider its obstruction and \nwork with us to fill these longstanding judicial vacancies in order to \nhelp the American people. We have well-qualified, consensus nominees \nwith bipartisan support who can fill these vacancies. It is only \npartisan politics and continued tactics of obstruction that stand in \nthe way.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that any time in \na quorum call be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, for the last few weeks, it has been \nroutine practice here in the Senate that we vote on consensus district \ncourt nominees most Mondays. We have done so quite a number of times in \nthis Congress. We could have done so again tonight. Instead, the \nmajority leader has decided to pursue another course. Rather than \nconfirm what would have been the 155th judge tonight, the majority will \ninstead engage in a political activity. Make no mistake, it is purely \nand simply a political posturing situation. It is really unfortunate.\n  It is well known that the practice and tradition of the Senate is to \nstop confirming circuit nominees in the closing months of a \nPresidential election year. That is what we have done during the last \nnumber of Presidential election years. That started in 1980, I believe. \nSo that would be 32 years. In fact, today is July 30. You would have to \ngo back that number of years to find a Presidential election year when \nwe approved a circuit court judge this late.\n  Of course, the rationale has been that this close to an election, \nwhoever wins that election should be the one to pick these lifetime \nnominees who will run our judiciary system. It is true that there were \nsome votes in relation to circuit nominations in July during the last \ntwo election years. The only problem, of course, is that those were \ncloture votes on outstanding nominees the Democrats were filibustering.\n  For example, in July 2004--remember, that was a Presidential election \nyear--cloture votes were held on four outstanding circuit nominees the \nDemocrats were filibustering. Those included Miguel Estrada, nominated \nfor the D.C. Circuit; Richard Griffin, nominated to the sixth circuit \ncourt; David McKeagh, nominated to the sixth circuit; and Henry Saad, \nalso nominated to the sixth circuit.\n  I would note that at the time the sixth circuit alone had a 25-\npercent vacancy rate. And every one of those vacancies was designated \nas judicial emergencies.\n  That, of course, didn't matter to the other side. Despite the fact \nthat the sixth circuit was in dire straits, the other side filibustered \nevery one of those nominees.\n  I don't recall too much concern from my friends on the other side of \nthe aisle about the need to confirm those judges.\n  And now, when our side seeks to enforce the rule the other side \nhelped create and perfect, all we hear are complaints.\n  Mr. President, if ever there was an example of ``crocodile tears,'' \nthis is it.\n  In 2008, the other side was at it again. Once again, they closed-up \nshop on Circuit nominations in June. This time, it was the Fourth \nCircuit that was in dire straits.\n  Despite the fact that the Fourth Circuit was 25 percent vacant, the \nDemocrats refused to even process four outstanding consensus nominees.\n  Those nominees included Judge Robert Conrad, even though he had \nalready been confirmed unanimously as a U.S. Attorney and District \nCourt Judge. Democrats refused to process Judge Glen Conrad even though \nhe had strong bipartisan home state support. Steve Matthews also had \nstrong home-state support yet the Democrats in Committee refused to \ngive him a vote. To show you the incredible lengths the Democrats were \nwilling to go, they even tried to justify blocking the nomination of \nU.S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein to the fourth circuit by claiming he was \ndoing ``too good of a job'' as U.S. Attorney to be promoted.\n  By refusing to give these nominees a vote in Committee, the Democrats \nengaged in what amounted to a ``pocket filibuster'' of all four of \nthese candidates to the fourth circuit.\n  And again, this was at a time when the fourth circuit's vacancy rate \nwas over 25 percent, similar to the Sixth Circuit vacancy rate in 2004. \nBut that didn't matter to the other side. In 2008, just like in 2004, \nthey simply refused to process any more circuit nominees after June.\n  At the end of the day, based on any fair and objective metric, the \nsuggestion that we today are operating any differently than Democrats \ndid in 2004 and 2008 is simply without merit. Democrats stalled and \nblocked numerous highly qualified circuit nominees during those \nPresidential election years including even nominees with bipartisan \nsupport.\n  The Democratic leadership has invoked repeatedly what has been called \nthe ``Thurmond Rule'' to justify stalling nominees--even those with \nbipartisan support. And now they don't want us to play by the same set \nof rules. The Democratic leadership doesn't want us to enforce the rule \nthat they helped establish.\n  Let me quote from a CRS report on this subject:\n\n       The Senator who most frequently has asserted the existence \n     of a Thurmond rule has been the current chairman of the \n     Judiciary Committee.\n\n  The CRS report noted that on March 7, 2008, the Chairman recalled:\n\n       When President Reagan was running for President and Senator \n     Thurmond, then in the Republican minority as ranking member \n     of the Judiciary Committee, instituted a policy to stall \n     President Carter's nominations. That policy, known as the \n     ``Thurmond Rule,'' was put in when the Republicans were in \n     the minority. It is a rule that we still follow, and it will \n     take effect very soon here.\n\n  Again, this was in March of that Presidential election year, not June \nor July.\n  CRS went on to note the strong support the majority leader has \nexpressed for the so-called Thurmond rule. According to CRS:\n\n       Senator Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader, has \n     expressed agreement with Senator Leahy about the existence of \n     a Thurmond rule. In April 10, 2008, floor remarks, Senator \n     Reid said, ``In a Presidential election year, it is always \n     very tough for judges. That is the way it has been for a long \n     time, and that is why we have the Thurmond rule and other \n     such rules.''\n\n  Five days later, the Majority Leader said:\n\n\n[[Page S5648]]\n\n\n       You know, there is a Thurmond doctrine that says: After \n     June, we will have to take a real close look at judges in a \n     Presidential election year.\n\n  These quotes indicate not only the expectation, but in fact a support \nfor slowing down and cutting off the confirmation of judges in a \nPresidential election year.\n  Senate Republicans are invoking this practice in a more narrow \nfashion, and after more confirmations than Democrats did in the past.\n  Setting aside the so-called Leahy-Thurmond rule, by any objective \nmeasure, this President has been treated fairly and consistent with \npast Senate practices.\n  For example, with regard to the total number of confirmations, this \nPresident is well ahead of his predecessor. We have confirmed 154 of \nthis President's district and circuit nominations. We have also \nconfirmed 2 Supreme Court nominations during President Obama's first \nterm. When Supreme Court nominations are pending in the Committee, all \nother nominations work is put on hold.\n  The last time the Senate confirmed two Supreme Court nominees was \nduring President Bush's second term. And during that term the Senate \nconfirmed a total of only 119 district and circuit court nominees.\n  Let me put it another way, under similar circumstances, we have \nconfirmed 35 more district and circuit nominees for President Obama \nthan we did for President Bush.\n  During the last Presidential election year, 2008, the Senate \nconfirmed a total of 28 judges--24 district and 4 circuit. This \nPresidential election year we have already exceeded those numbers, \nhaving confirmed a total of 32 judges. So those who say that this \nPresident is being treated differently either fail to recognize \nhistory, or want to ignore the facts, or both.\n  While this President has not been treated differently than previous \nPresidents, he certainly has behaved differently with regard to \nnominations. He has been slow to send nominees to the Senate, and he \nabused his recess appointment authority. If President Obama hasn't \ngotten as many confirmations as he could have, it is because he has \nbeen slow to nominate and he has abused his recess appointment power.\n  Let me take just a moment to discuss how slow the President has been \nwith his nominations.\n  When President Obama took office, there were 59 judicial vacancies. \nOne year earlier, at the beginning of 2008, there were only 43 \nvacancies. So, during the last year of President Bush's second term, \nwhen the Democrats controlled the Senate, and during a time when they \nrefused to process four nominees for the fourth circuit, they allowed \nthe vacancy rate to increase by more than 37 percent.\n  By mid-March 2009, when the first Obama judicial nomination was sent \nup to the Senate, there were 70 judicial vacancies. Over the next 3 \nmonths, only five more circuit nominations were sent to the Senate. By \nthe end of June, when the Senate received its first district \nnomination, there were 80 vacancies.\n  The failure or delay in submitting nominations for vacancies has been \nthe practice of this administration and it still continues to this day.\n  By the end of 2009, there were 100 vacancies, with only 20 nominees. \nIn December 2010, more than half of the 108 vacancies had no nominee. \nAt the beginning of this year, only 36 nominees were pending for the 82 \nvacancies. And it continues to this day, more than half of the 76 \nvacancies have no nominee.\n  I just want to remind my colleagues that all of this begins with the \nWhite House. So if someone wants to complain about judicial vacancies, \nthey should mail those complaints to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.\n  Now, I also mentioned that the President could have had a few more \ndistrict court nominees at the end of last Congress.\n  Our side offered to confirm quite a number of district court nominees \nwho were on the Executive Calendar, If the President would provide his \nassurances that he wouldn't bypass the Senate with recess appointments. \nThe President refused to provide those assurances, and we found out why \na couple weeks later when the President unconstitutionally bypassed the \nSenate.\n  I want everyone to understand that. At the end of last Congress we \noffered to confirm quite a few district court nominees. But the \nPresident wouldn't take ``Yes'' for an answer. Rather than choosing a \npath that led to more progress and a greater number of confirmations, \nthe President chose the path to more confrontation and fewer \nconfirmations.\n  The same thing happened last week. Once again, our side offered to \nconfirm additional district court nominees. But, once again, the other \nside refused to take ``Yes'' for an answer. Rather than choosing the \npath that led to cooperation and additional confirmations, the other \nside chose more confrontation and fewer confirmations. They would \nrather waste precious time on a vote to nowhere, than spend the little \ntime we have left on getting more nominations done. So here we are \nengaged in this political theater.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``No'' on cloture.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it is almost August. We are just a few \nweeks away from the political parties' nominating conventions. At this \npoint in past Presidential election years, the Senate is diligently \nworking on things such as appropriations bills or the Defense \nauthorization bill but not this year in the Senate.\n  Our Democratic colleagues refuse to do the basic work of government. \nEven though Chairman Inouye has said he would like to pass some of the \nnine appropriations bills his committee has worked hard to complete, we \nhaven't taken up a single one. Our Democratic colleagues will not bring \nthe Defense authorization bill to the floor either, even though both \nthe chairman and the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee are \nready to work on this important legislation as well. And they refuse to \nwork with us to help the economy or to prevent a looming tax hike on \nnearly 1 million small businesses at the end of the year.\n  Instead, they prefer to waste valuable time on a vote they have \nargued for many years shouldn't take place this close to a Presidential \nelection. Now that there is a Democrat in the White House, they refuse \nto follow past practice on postponing the consideration of circuit \ncourt nominations this late in a Presidential election year so the \nAmerican people can decide whom they want to make these important \nappointments. This practice is known as the Leahy-Thurmond rule. It is \na custom they vigorously defended when there was a Republican in the \nWhite House.\n  So let's take a look at recent history. In 2004, the unemployment \nrate was only 5.4 percent. On our circuit courts, however, back in \n2004, there were nine declared judicial emergencies. That didn't matter \nto our Democratic colleagues. The Senate stopped--stopped--circuit \ncourt nominations in June of that year, even though we had nine \njudicial emergencies. In 2008, the unemployment rate wasn't much \nhigher, at 6.1 percent. In our circuit courts, there were almost as \nmany judicial emergencies. But in the Fourth Circuit things were much \nworse: Fully one-fourth of the seats were empty, even though there were \nqualified nominees to fill them. Our Democratic colleagues didn't care \nthen either. In the name of Senate custom and practice--by which I mean \nthe Leahy-Thurmond rule--they pocket-filibustered several outstanding \ncircuit court nominees in committee.\n  It didn't matter to our Democratic friends that these nominees \nenjoyed strong home State support, including bipartisan home State \nsupport, or that they had outstanding credentials or that they would \nfill declared emergencies on our circuit courts. The Senate couldn't \nprocess them--they told us again and again and again--because it was \nJune and that was--to quote the chairman of the Judiciary Committee--\n``way past the time'' of the Leahy-Thurmond rule.\n  Today, it is August, not June, that is upon us. The country's \nunemployment\n\n[[Page S5649]]\n\nrate is, unfortunately, much higher than it was in either 2004 or 2008. \nIt is now at 8.2 percent. But the situation on our circuit courts is \nmuch better than it was in either 2004 or 2008. There are now fewer \njudicial emergencies. In terms of what the Senate can do about it, as \nopposed to the President's failure to nominate people, we have \nconfirmed--we have confirmed--every nominee whom the President has \nsubmitted to fill a judicial emergency on our circuit courts, save \none--only one. That is right. The Senate has confirmed every nominee \nthe President has sent to fill an emergency on our circuit courts, save \none, and that one nominee isn't on the Senate floor.\n  In fact, the Senate has already confirmed as many or more circuit \ncourt nominees this year than it did in 2004 or 2008. It has confirmed \na much higher percentage of circuit court nominations and it has \nconfirmed those nominations faster than during the Bush administration.\n  On that last point, although we will not hear our Democratic friends \nacknowledge it, the average time from nomination to confirmation--the \naverage time from nomination to confirmation--of a circuit court \nnominee for President Obama is over 1 month faster than it was for \nPresident Bush in his first term. Again, the time from nomination to \nconfirmation for President Obama is over 1 month faster for a circuit \ncourt nominee than in President Bush's first term, and it is over 100 \ndays faster than it was for President Bush's circuit court nominees \noverall.\n  So the situation with our economy is worse now than it was in 2004 or \n2008, while the situation on our circuit courts is better. The economy \nis worse, but the situation on circuit courts is better. So what do you \nthink our Democratic colleagues are going to focus on? Are they going \nto do the basic work of government--fund the government, for example? \nIt doesn't look like it. Are they going to reauthorize important \nprograms for our Nation's defense? I am told it has been 50-some-odd-\nyears since the Defense authorization bill hasn't passed--no sign of it \nthis year. Are they going to work with us to fix the economy or prevent \na looming tax hike? I don't see any evidence of it yet.\n  What they want to do, instead, is violate the custom in Presidential \nelection years that the Congressional Research Service says they have \nbeen the biggest proponents of. This is not me saying this, this is the \nCongressional Research Service. They want to violate the custom in \nPresidential election years that the CRS says they have been the \nbiggest proponents of.\n  The CRS does not say the biggest proponent of the Leahy-Thurmond rule \nis me or Ranking Member Grassley or even Senator Thurmond. Rather, the \nCRS says the most frequent proponent of the rule ``is the current \nchairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.''\n  No doubt we will hear some post hoc, gerrymandered rationale from our \nDemocratic friends as to why the rule the CRS says they have been the \nbiggest proponents of somehow doesn't apply to them. They will ignore \nthe pocket filibusters of people who would have filled judicial \nemergencies during a Republican administration. But, of course, that is \npar for the course.\n  Whether it is pro forma sessions to prevent recess appointments, or \njudicial filibusters, or the Leahy-Thurmond rule, our friends don't \nwant the practices they have pioneered or been the biggest proponents \nof to apply to them. They don't want the practices they have been the \npioneers of and the biggest proponents of to apply to them. Now it is \npretty convenient for them, but that is not the way the Senate is \nsupposed to work.\n  In sum, on the subject of the Leahy-Thurmond rule, we have been more \nresponsible in deciding to invoke it in this year than our Democratic \ncolleagues were in either 2004 or 2008. I would urge my friends to \noppose this double standard and to oppose cloture.\n  Let me repeat. This is not about the individual who has been \nnominated. It wasn't, in many respects, about the individuals to be \nnominated in 2004 or 2008. What this is is a bipartisan timeout--\nbipartisan in the sense that it has been used by both sides--a timeout \nwithin, this year, 6 months of an election; in 2008, it was within 8 \nmonths of the end of a term--but within 6 months of an election to \nthese important lifetime jobs to see who the next President may be.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield to my friend from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Let me first say it is awkward that one of the best \nnominees, Robert Bacharach, is the one subject to this. I regret that \nis the case. The problem is this would be the latest confirmation of a \ncircuit court nominee during an election year in 20 years.\n  I was thinking today that I cannot vote against this guy, but I sure \ncan vote present. If we have a 20-year precedent that was put in there \nby the Democrats and the Republicans alike, I wouldn't want to be the \none to break that precedent. We are within 4 months of an election \nright now. It is very important that we do what we have done over the \nlast 20 years and allow the new administration to come in.\n  The nomination of Robert Bacharach has been up there for 2 years \nbefore any action. You have to be a little suspicious as to why is he \ncoming up right now. So I may end up voting present.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my friend from Oklahoma. He confirms that this \nis not about the nominee, who apparently is well qualified. This is \nabout an approach that has developed over several decades called the \nLeahy-Thurmond rule, under which it has been the practice to kind of \ncall a timeout within rather close proximity to an election. In 2008, \nthe timeout was called in June. We are going to enter August at the end \nof this week.\n  I would say also to my friend from Oklahoma, we have confirmed for \nthe President in this election year five circuit court nominees. \nPresident Bush in 2008 got four; President Bush in 2004 got five. We \nhave not been unfair to the administration. And it is certainly no \nreflection on what is apparently an outstanding nominee from your \nState.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I hope the American people are witnessing \nthis moment in the Senate. We are about to make history. We are going \nto make history here in a few minutes when we have a rollcall vote on \nU.S. Magistrate Judge Robert Bacharach to the Tenth Circuit Court of \nAppeals. This fine man who has been nominated to this high position in \nthe Federal judiciary has the support of both Senators of his home \nState. They are both Republicans.\n  Listen to what Senator Tom Coburn said of Mr. Bacharach: A stellar \ncandidate. Listen to what Senator Inhofe said about this same nominee \nfrom his State: A great guy.\n  I listened to these comments. Then I reflect on the fact this man was \nreported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee on a voice vote. There \nwas so little controversy because of his outstanding record, he was \nreported out on a voice vote.\n  The Democratic majority leader has offered to bring to the floor of \nthe Senate a nominee approved by both Republican Senators from \nOklahoma, and now you hear Senator McConnell come to the floor and \nexplain why the Republicans will have to filibuster and stop this man \nfrom being appointed to the court. Is it something about him? No. It is \nall about politics and it is all about the Presidential campaign.\n  If the Republicans sustain this filibuster and stop this good man \nfrom his service on the circuit court, it will be the first time in the \nhistory of the Senate that an appeals court nominee with bipartisan \ncommittee support has ever been filibustered on the floor of the \nSenate. But how can we be surprised? This will be the 86th Republican \nfilibuster this Congress.\n  It is said that if the only tool you own is a hammer, every problem \nlooks like a nail. If you happen to be a Republican leader in the \nSenate, every day looks like another chance for a filibuster. Eighty-\nsix filibusters. Now they are filibustering judicial nominees approved \nnearly unanimously by the committee and approved by both Republican \nSenators. The President is prepared to assign this man into this \nposition--a critically important position in the judiciary--and who is \nstopping him? The Republicans in the Senate, the 86th Republican Senate \nfilibuster in this Congress. No surprise that it comes from Senator \nMcConnell, who very openly and candidly, and I assume honestly, said, \nMy biggest job in the Senate is to make sure\n\n[[Page S5650]]\n\nBarack Obama is a one-term President. That is how he welcomed President \nObama to the White House.\n  So they have piled filibuster on top of filibuster to stop the rare \npossibility that this President would give this good man, this \nexceptional man, a chance to serve his country. Listen to the \nbackground of this man who is about to become a victim of the 86th \nRepublican filibuster:\n  For 13 years he has served as a federal magistrate. He has handled an \nimpressive caseload, including almost 3,000 civil and criminal matters, \nand 400 judicial settlement conferences. He is the type of consensus \nnominee we look for in every single State. He has been given the \nhighest possible rating by the American Bar Association. No questions \nasked, this is a good man and a good candidate for this job. In the \nAmerican Bar Association's nonpartisan peer review, every single \nreviewer said this magistrate is well qualified to serve as a circuit \ncourt judge in the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. And where are the \npolitics there? The politics are that the Democratic majority leader \nhas offered to the two Republican Senators from Oklahoma a chance for \nthis good man to serve, and now they are going to stop him with a \nRepublican filibuster.\n  If you are looking for evidence of a dysfunctional Senate, hold on \ntight. In just a few moments we will start a rollcall, and you will \nwatch as Republican after Republican comes and votes to kill this man's \nnomination for the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. President Obama will \nbe the first President in 20 years to complete his first term with more \njudicial vacancies than when he took office. They have dragged their \nfeet every step of the way with filibusters and delays to stop this \nPresident from appointing the judges he was elected to appoint. And \ngood people--good people such as U.S. Magistrate Judge Robert \nBacharach--who submit their names in this process, who go through \nextensive background investigations, who put their lives on hold \nwondering if they are going to make it, end up getting caught in a \npolitical game that is being played here on the floor.\n\n  I hope there is a handful--five, six, or seven--Republican Senators \nwho will give this man a fair break and will give him a chance to serve \nhis country as a circuit judge for the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. \nPlease, let us not make history today by stopping a highly qualified \nbipartisan nominee, well qualified by the American Bar Association, \nfrom serving this circuit. The Republican Senators from Oklahoma are \nright--he is a stellar candidate and, by every measure, a great guy. \nPlease don't make him a victim of last-minute political campaigning in \nthis last week before the recess we take for our Democratic national \nconvention and the Republican national convention. He shouldn't be a \nvictim of this Presidential campaign. He deserves a chance to serve.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I don't like to get involved in the back \nand forth on this issue. It bothers me. Chairman Leahy goes into all \nthese numbers, and they are distorted for the most part in connection \nwith the reality. I have said that I simply will not, however, stand by \nand see the record misconstrued and the picture painted as something \nother than it is.\n  President Bush's judicial nominees were filibustered extraordinarily, \nunlike anything we had ever seen before. And this is the way it \nhappened. I was here, I remember it very distinctly. President Bush was \nelected President. In 2001, shortly after he was elected, the New York \nTimes reported that a group of well-known liberal law professors, \nincluding Laurence Tribe, Cass Sunstein, and Marsha Greenberger, met \nwith Democratic Senators in a retreat. They proposed to the Democratic \nconference, who were then in the minority in the Senate--they didn't \nhave the majority. President Bush was going to be nominating judges, \nand they decided to change the ground rules of judicial confirmation. \nThat is a fact. After that, they aggressively executed a plan of \nunprecedented obstruction of judicial nominees.\n  In a totally unprecedented use of the filibuster, the Senate \nconfirmed only 6 of 25 of President Bush's circuit court nominees. Two \nof those six were prior Clinton nominees President Bush, in an act of \ngood faith, renominated. Of course they were immediately confirmed. Yet \nthe majority of President Bush's first nominees to the circuit court \nwaited years for confirmation. Many were never confirmed.\n  Perhaps the most disturbing story was that of Miguel Estrada, which \nhas come up recently in the confirmation of Supreme Court Justices in \nwhich some of my Democratic colleagues basically acknowledge that he \nwas unfairly treated. He is an outstanding appellate lawyer, supremely \nqualified to serve on the District of Columbia Circuit Court. He waited \n16 months for a hearing. They would not give him a hearing.\n  This was all after 2000, in their determination to change the ground \nrules. Before that, filibusters had not been utilized against nominees, \nnot to any degree. Almost never, actually. We had a fight over it. I \nspoke on maybe half a dozen or a dozen times about Mr. Estrada. There \nwere seven cloture votes--seven attempts--by the Republicans to get a \nvote on Mr. Estrada so he could be confirmed. He was a superb nominee, \nand he was treated very poorly. It was not the right thing, and people \nhave acknowledged it since.\n  Mr. President, is there a time agreement on the vote to commence?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time for the minority leader just expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have one \nadditional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Let me just say this: In the last 20 years, going back even before \nthis dispute began in 2000, when Democrats changed the ground rules of \nconfirmations and started filibustering systematically qualified \nnominees, not one circuit judge has been confirmed after this day. That \nhas been the tradition of the Senate. It has been referred to as the \nThurmond rule. Maybe it would be even more appropriate to say the Leahy \nrule.\n  Others have talked about the quotes that have been made from Senator \nReid and Senator Leahy on the floor. This is the tradition of the \nSenate that when someone is up for reelection, after this day, to get \ntheir nominees confirmed, they have to win reelection. If President \nObama is successful in being reelected, I am sure he will have a high \nlikelihood of getting this nominee and others confirmed.\n  I thank the Chair, yield the floor, and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I yield back all time prior to the vote.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, pursuant to rule \nXXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the nomination of \n     Robert E.

Three-fifths of the Senators duly \nchosen and sworn not having voted in the affirmative, the motion is \nrejected.\n  Mr. COBURN. We just disallowed one of the best candidates for the \nappellate court in my 8 years since I have been in the Senate. \nMagistrate Judge Bob Bacharach is a stellar individual rated ``very \nhighly qualified'' by the American Bar Association. What has happened \nis we are in the position today because of games that are being played, \npolitical games.\n  Let me just put into the Record what is going on. There are three \njudges ahead of Bob Bacharach in line. We have had a Leahy-Thurmond \nrule for some 20 years. I have been quoted saying I think it is a \nstupid rule. But the background is that protecting the prerogative of \nthe Senate is one of the most important things the majority leader can \ndo.\n  What we have seen happen with the lack of agreement this last holiday \nseason over the moving forward of judges and their approval was the \nunconstitutional usurpation of power by the President of the United \nStates in the appointment, during our pro forma sessions, of four \nindividuals, one to CFPB and three to the NLRB.\n  Quite frankly, if we look at what Madison wrote in Federalist 51:\n\n       The great security against a gradual concentration of the \n     several powers in the same branch of government consists in \n     giving to those who administer each branch the necessary \n     constitutional means and personal motives to resist \n     encroachment of the others. Ambition must made to counteract \n     ambition. The interest of the man must be connected with the \n     constitutional rights of the place.\n\n  So started the saga in January of this past year, where the reaction \nof my colleagues on my side of the aisle was to shut down, in response \nto the President's move, all circuit court confirmations.\n  I stood in my caucus and fought that. I thought it was the wrong \naction then. I still think it would have been the wrong action. But I \nconvinced my caucus not to go that direction. To do that, I agreed I \nwould consent to the Leahy-Thurmond rule in this election cycle. But I \nhope this is the last election cycle we use the Leahy-Thurmond rule.\n  Because on the other side of the constitutional issues is that a duly \nelected President does have the right to have their nominees \nconsidered, whether I agree with them or not. To prove this, that this \nwas a stunt rather than anything other than that, and Bob Bacharach \nbecomes the pawn in that, is that we had an agreement on judges. Then \nwe had cloture filed on fourteen district court judges, of which there \nwas no real controversy.\n  All of those district court judges, after that cloture was filed on \nthem and then withdrawn, have henceforth been approved. To the American \npublic, the game is politics and not policy for our country. To me, it \nsaddens me. It frustrates me that we are at this state because it is \nnot a whole lot different than what we see in the playground at a \nkindergarten.\n  The person who most has spoken in favor of the Leahy-Thurmond rule is \nthe chairman of the Judiciary Committee. Yet we find this impasse \ntoday. So what we ought to all do, every Member of the Senate and the \nJudiciary Committee during the break after this election, is work \ntogether to try to resolve this so this does not happen to any other \nPresident and does not do damage to the Senate and the integrity of the \nSenate and the game on judges. The President gets elected, with their \nhome State Senators, they make a selection. We should not use the \nfilibuster, unless a judge is highly questionable or biased in their \nviewpoint.\n  I regret that we are in this position. I think this was just a vote \nto delay Bob Bacharach's eventual confirmation. If President Obama wins \nthe election, I fully expect Judge Bob Bacharach will be approved. If \nhe does not win the election, I plan on standing and fighting for this \njudge for this same position under a Republican President because he is \nexactly what we want on a court, someone who is right down the middle \nin terms of what the law means, what the Constitution means. He has \nstellar intellectual capabilities, and he has the qualities we all \nwould want, both from the right and the left, as a fair decider of the \nfacts. That is what we want in judges. He will make an ideal appellate \njudge, regardless of his political affiliation.\n  If we cannot get there then what that says is the partisan politics \nof today, as everybody outside Washington recognizes, is killing our \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/30/senate-section/article/S5651-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I come to the floor this evening to talk about an amendment I have \nfiled to the Cybersecurity Act, S. 3414. This is the fourth time I have \nfiled this amendment, and it is not on the Cybersecurity Act per se, \nalthough it does address energy use, which is one of the critical \nchallenges we face as we are trying to address cybersecurity in this \ncountry.\n  This is an amendment that is the substance of S. 1000, the Energy \nSavings and Industrial Competitiveness Act, of which the other sponsor \nis Senator Rob Portman, and he is a cosponsor on this amendment.\n  What the Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act and the \namendment I filed does is create a national energy efficiency strategy \nfor the United States. So this amendment is the same language Senator \nPortman and I filed to the Bring Jobs Home Act and the Middle Class Tax \nCut Act, and it is one we are going to continue to file because we \nthink it is important for this amendment and this legislation to have \nan opportunity for a vote from this entire Senate because we think this \nis bipartisan legislation that has broad support among our colleagues.\n  This legislation is based on two important premises I have already \nspoken to in the Chamber: first, that the American public desperately \nwants Congress to work together in a bipartisan way to address this \nNation's energy needs; and, second, that energy efficiency is the \nfastest, cheapest way to meet our energy challenges. Not only does it \nhelp us develop a strategy around energy, but it is a strategy that can \nbe supported whether you live in New England, as I do, whether you live \nin the West, whether you live in the South. It is a strategy that is \nimportant whether you support fossil fuels--oil and gas--whether you \nsupport nuclear, or whether you support wind and solar. We all benefit \nfrom energy efficiency. It is also a strategy that creates thousands of \ngood jobs.\n  There is evidence that the American public wants to see the Senate \nact on energy efficiency legislation. I think that evidence is \noverwhelming because last week I started an online campaign asking \npeople to sign a petition calling on Senate leadership to bring this \nbill to the floor. The text of the petition is what we see here--small \nprint so it is hard to read, but it asks people to support the Shaheen-\nPortman energy efficiency bill.\n  I just wish to read a section of it. It says:\n\n       The Shaheen-Portman Act would help make the United States a \n     global leader in the fastest and cheapest method we have for \n     addressing our energy needs, energy efficiency. Energy \n     efficiency is within our grasp. It uses proven technology \n     that we can manufacture here at home to lower energy costs \n     across all sectors of our economy.\n\n  In just a matter of days, we have already collected over 4,600 \nsignatures from supporters across the country, and that number \ncontinues to grow. Anyone interested in signing the petition and in \nlearning more about the many benefits of energy efficiency can easily \ndo so by visiting my Web site at shaheen.senate.gov.\n  While drafting the bill, Senator Portman and I met with a number of \nstakeholders so we could better understand the obstacles the private \nsector faces when they are trying to deploy energy-efficient \ntechnology. So we had discussions with people from energy-intensive \ncompanies, from trade groups, from those representing the real estate \ncommunity, from environmental advocates and from financing \norganizations.\n  The feedback we received about ways to remove these barriers and \ndrive the adoption of energy-efficient technologies became the basis \nfor this legislation. As a result, we have a bill that provides a \nvariety of low-cost tools that will speed this Nation's transition to a \nmore energy-efficient economy.\n  The bill addresses three major areas of U.S. energy use: residential \nand commercial buildings, which consume 40 percent of all energy used \nin the country; the industrial sector, which consumes more energy than \nany other sector of the U.S. economy; and the Federal Government, which \nis the country's single biggest user of energy.\n  Highlights of the bill include: establishing advanced building codes \nfor voluntary residential and commercial buildings to cut energy use. I \nwould emphasize that those codes are voluntary. We worked with the real \nestate and the building industries on those codes.\n  Second, the legislation helps manufacturers finance and implement \nenergy-efficient production technologies and practices because that is \none of the biggest obstacles to retrofitting buildings for energy \nefficiency.\n  Third, the legislation would require the Federal Government to adopt \nbetter building standards and smart metering technology.\n  Our legislation is bipartisan. In addition to the thousands of \nsignatures on this petition, it has support from well over 200 \nbusinesses, environmental groups, think tanks, and trade association. \nThose groups include: The National Association of Manufacturers, the \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Environmental Defense Fund, businesses \nsuch as Johnson Controls, Honeywell, United Technologies Corporation.\n  This broad coalition of supporters recognizes that the legislation is \nan easy first step that will make our economy more competitive and our \nNation more secure by reducing our dependence on foreign oil and still \nmeeting the demand for energy saving technologies for individuals and \nbusinesses alike.\n  I think it is important to point out that there are real economic \nbenefits. A recent study by policy experts at the American Council for \nan Energy-Efficient Economy found that the legislation will achieve \nsavings for consumers and businesses. Specifically, their study found \nthat by 2020, the bill could save consumers $4 billion a year once it \nis enacted. It would add 80,000 jobs to the economy.\n  In a time when we are worried about growing the economy, when we are \nworried about the fragile recovery, this is the kind of legislation \nthat will allow us to create good jobs with off-the-shelf technologies. \nWith the Shaheen-Portman energy efficiency bill, the Senate has an \nopportunity to provide the American people with exactly what they want, \nan effective bipartisan approach to addressing this Nation's energy \nneeds that also creates jobs and grows the economy. I hope we will be \nable to persuade leadership and my colleagues that this is legislation \nthat merits full debate and a vote on the floor and that we will be \nable to bring S. 1000 or this amendment to the floor for a vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for such time as I may consume, and that when I \nfinish, the Senator from Ohio be recognized for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                Apology\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I wished to come to the floor to talk \nabout two or three subjects. The first is to issue an apology to the \nmajority leader. I do not apologize for my frustration with this place, \nbut occasionally my words are harsh and inaccurate. This past week, I \nused words that were inappropriate in describing his actions in the \nSenate, and for that I offer a public apology.\n  I do not apologize for how I think the Senate is being run and the \ndamage that I think is being done to the country, but as an individual, \nhe has a very difficult time and I understand that and to him I ask his \nforgiveness.\n\n\n                              Fiscal Cliff\n\n  Madam President, if I was coming to the floor with intelligence about \nan imminent threat to our national security, Americans would demand \nthat our government and this body take immediate action. If an Army was \non our border,\n\n[[Page S5653]]\n\nif missiles were about to be launched at our territory or if there were \na terrorist plot in motion, doing anything less than us uniting in the \nface of that threat and taking decisive action would be seen as \ncowardice and foolishness.\n  Yet that is precisely where we are today, which brings me to my \nfrustration with the majority leader. The threat, though, does not come \nfrom traditional armies or terrorists, the threat comes from our \nunsustainable spending and this body's refusal to unite and take \naction. It is not just the conservatives who are sounding the alarm, \nthe warnings are coming from our military leaders, diplomats, and \nstatesmen on both sides of the aisle, as well as the international \nfinancial community.\n  ADM Mike Mullen, the retired Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nwhile he was still Chairman, said the greatest threat to this Nation is \nits debt. We have done not one thing since January to address that \nproblem. We are having spats over judges. We are having spats over all \nthe small things. But the greatest imminent danger to our country, we \nare doing nothing about. I believe we have less than 2 to 5 years to \nact to make a significant change in our path.\n  No one knows when this Nation will cross the point of no return. We \nmay have already. But there is a point where we will lose control of \nour own destiny. It is coming. The fact that the Senate, this year, has \nhad fewer votes than at any time since 1947, according to the \nCongressional Research Service--why is that? Because we have a \npolitical year. We don't want to take votes. We don't want to have to \nexplain to our constituencies why we voted yea or nay on something. So \nthe whole goal is to not vote.\n  Ultimately, the whole goal is to not address the very pressing issues \nfacing this country. What do you think is going to happen to the \nDefense Department with no Defense authorization bill? They are in la-\nla land. Where do they go? We are not going to give them the direction \nwith which to spend the largest discretionary amount of money in our \ngovernment--$600 billion. They are going to be coasting, flying by the \nseat of their pants. They are not going to have radar or anything. \nThere is not going to be any stealth. Yet we refuse to do that.\n  We have spent a larger amount of time in quorum calls--37 percent of \nthe time this year--nothing but quorum calls. Less than one-third an \namount of the time available to the Senate has actually been on the \nbusiness associated with the country, and most of the business we have \naddressed isn't this critical risk in front of our country.\n  Last week, Vanguard, the largest private owner of U.S. bonds--$186 \nbillion they own of U.S. bonds--said we have until 2016 to act. If we \ndon't act, we will go into a debt spiral. Bond investors will revolt, \nthey will drive up prices--drive up interest rates and drop prices. We \nalready know from CBO that the entitlement programs are on the brink of \ninsolvency. Social Security disability--we have added 3.2 million \npeople to those rolls since January 1, 2009. That system will be \nbankrupt in less than 18 months; 8\\1/2\\ million people depend on that. \nAnd there has not been a comment from the leadership in addressing a \ntrust fund that will be out of money in less than 18 months.\n  Our Founders believed that republics that lived beyond their means \ndon't survive. They talked about it. History is full of examples. \nEurope is reminding us of that today. The euro in Europe, as we know \nit, is on its deathbed. Every month, every week there is a new set of \nresuscitative efforts that are not working. What is the real problem? \nThe real problem is they spent money they didn't have on things they \ndidn't need.\n  If you want to see what America will look like in 2 or 3 years, just \nlook at Europe. Look at the demonstrations, look at the crying out of \nthe masses to say: How did we get here? The pain of fixing it is too \ngreat. That is why we should be addressing our problems now.\n  The reason America looks good is that we are the least wilted rose in \nthe bud vase. The only reason we look good is because they look so bad. \nWe are at 103 percent debt to GDP. It is costing us at least 1.2 \nmillion jobs in new job creation every year. We are at historical \ninterest rates. Our interest costs per year would be over $1 trillion. \nThe interest rates are falsely low because of what the Federal Reserve \nhas done.\n  The price to pay for that is coming in the future. What is the \ncontrast? I ask seniors all the time: Do you think we ought to save \nMedicare?\n  They say: Yes.\n  I say: Do you think we ought to save Medicare just like it is.\n  They say: Yes.\n  I say: If we save Medicare just like it is, do you know that your \ngrandchildren will have a standard of living that will be one-third \nlower than yours was?\n  Then they say: No.\n  America is used to doing hard things. It is just that the Senate \nright now will not do the hard things, will not come together, will not \nmake the sacrifices. We value our positions more than we value the \ncountry we live in. The consequences are showing.\n  We have an 8.2-percent unemployment rate. If we use the same \nstatistics we used in 1980, our unemployment rate is above 9.6 \npercent--just measuring it the same way we did it 32 years ago. Now \nthat we are measuring it differently, we don't see the real impact.\n  Today we are dangerously close to a global great depression. Let's \nremember the last time the world saw a great depression. That \ndepression was a leading cause of the global war that killed 60 million \npeople--2.5 percent of the world's population. Do we dare go down that \npath by putting politics ahead of principle and policy?\n  Fortunately, many of our leaders see this threat and are calling on \nus to take action. Consider this exchange between former Secretary of \nState James Baker and current Secretary of State Hillary Clinton last \nmonth on ``The Charlie Rose Show'':\n  Secretary Baker:\n\n       I know one thing. We are broke. We can't afford wars \n     anymore. We can't afford a lot of things, and the biggest \n     threat facing the country today is not some threat from the \n     outside--Iran, nuclear weapons, or anything else--it's our \n     economy. We better darn well get our economic house in order \n     because the strength of our Nation has always depended upon \n     our economy. You can't be strong politically, militarily, or \n     diplomatically if you are not strong economically.\n\n  He is giving us a foreshadow of what is coming.\n  Secretary Clinton said this in response:\n\n       Well, amen to that, because I have had to go around the \n     world the last 3\\1/2\\ years reassuring many leaders both in \n     the governments and the business sectors of a lot of \n     countries that the United States was moving forward \n     economically, that we were not ceding our leadership \n     position, and that we are as powerful as ever. But we \n     recognized that we had to put our economic house in order.\n\n  If former Secretary Baker and Secretary Clinton can agree, why can't \nwe? They both see the same thing. The only problem is we haven't put \nour economic house in order.\n  I know it is the Senate majority leader's position to try to protect \nboth his incumbent President and his Members. I know that conventional \nwisdom says we cannot get anything done in an election year. But I want \nto tell you that isn't good enough anymore--not good enough for the \ncountry. The country deserves better.\n  By doing nothing, we are pushing our children and grandchildren off a \nfiscal cliff. By doing nothing, we are guaranteeing the very tax \nincreases and cuts in entitlements that both sides say they want to \navoid.\n  If you are an unemployed American right now or someone struggling to \nmake ends meet, when is the right time for us to act? Is it a perfect \npolitical moment that is always a mirage beyond the horizon of the next \nelection or is it today or this week? The American people have lost \ntheir confidence in us because we refuse to act even as we call on \nothers to do things that we will not do ourselves.\n\n  Today we are asking our soldiers to risk their lives for our country. \nWhy can't we do the same? Why are we allowed to play it safe when we \nask others to make the ultimate sacrifice--especially when we as \nelected leaders have so much less at stake.\n  I believe the American people want us to do hard things and will \nactually reward us for demonstrating leadership and courage. The \nproblems before us today can all be solved, but delay means the pain \nthat comes with the solution is much greater. Yet to delay--\n\n[[Page S5654]]\n\nthat is the path we have chosen in the Senate; that is the path the \nPresident has chosen--to not face the real issues, the coming and \nimpending bankruptcy of Medicare, and the fact that the average \nMedicare couple will take three times more out of Medicare than what \nthey put in, and the fact that the baby boom generation will overwhelm \nthe trust fund that pays the hospital bills the worst-case scenario is \nthat in 4 years the Medicare trust fund will be bankrupt. I know that \nsounds like a lot of things. Let me show the American people some \nexamples.\n  We hear mindless, partisan rhetoric about which side is to blame, \njust like the debate we heard before the vote on Judge Bacharach. The \ntruth is both sides are to blame, both Republicans and Democrats, when \nRepublicans had the chance to restore limited government, and we helped \ndouble the size of government.\n  Meanwhile, the leaders today--their chief complaint is we didn't \noverspend enough. I know the Senate majority leader has a tough job and \nthe burden of leadership, but he is refusing to accept the \nresponsibility that is truly ours today. This Congress will be measured \nby our actions.\n  At the end of this week, for 5 weeks, the Senate is going to take \noff, and we are going to be just like Rome. Actually, what should \nhappen to every Senator as we leave this place at the end of the week, \nwe should each be handed a fiddle so we can all fiddle while the \ngovernment and the financial situation and the economic chaos that is \nours today grows unabated.\n  Real leadership isn't about being right, it is about doing the right \nthing. We are not doing the right thing in the Senate today. We are not \nreforming the Tax Code that is 90,000 pages and takes 110,000 IRS \nemployees to administer. We are not addressing the impending bankruptcy \nof Medicare. We are not assuring the solvency of Social Security and \nincreasing payments for those on the very low end of the totem pole. We \nare not addressing the key issues facing our country.\n  Why are we here if we are not going to address those issues? We are \naddressing every issue but those. Again, it is evident my frustration \nis high. I want the Senate to return to the body it was when I first \ncame here. I think we can do that. I think Senator Reid can lead us to \ndo that. Every day we waste, every day we are not fixing the real \nproblems, the disease that faces our country means we are responsible \nfor a significant increase in the pain and disruption that is coming. \nLet it not be so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n\n\n                            Olympic Omission\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I rise today because there was an \nobvious omission in the Olympic opening ceremony on Friday.\n  Forty years after 11 Israeli Olympians and a German police officer \nwere murdered in the 1972 Munich games, the London games opened with no \nacknowledgement of this tragedy. There was neither mention nor a moment \nof silence for those victims of the Munich massacre.\n  Forty years ago, on September 4, five Palestinians stormed the \napartments of the Israeli national team in the Olympic Village, \nmurdering 11 Israeli team members. Yet, again and again, the IOC has \nrejected requests to hold a moment of silence for the Munich 11 at the \nopening ceremonies.\n  I thank Senator Gillibrand for her resolution calling on the IOC to \nhold a moment of silence at the opening ceremonies to remember the 1972 \nMunich massacre.\n  I remind the International Olympic Committee that it is not too late. \nWe can still pay tribute to these Olympians. These athletes were not \nrandom victims. They were targeted because of the country they \nrepresented and the beliefs they held.\n  Jacques Rogge, the IOC President, has said:\n\n       We feel that the opening ceremony is an atmosphere that is \n     not fit to remember such a tragic incident.\n\n  That is the best he can do.\n  On the 40th anniversary, I cannot think of a more appropriate moment \nto remember and honor these 11 Olympians.\n  The Munich massacre is part of the Olympic story. We can't erase it, \nand we should not overlook it. After all, we know what happens when we \navoid the past. Of course, we cannot afford to repeat it.\n  I ask we all do everything we can to convince the IOC to step up and \ndo the right thing.\n  Let me explain why this especially matters for people in my home \nState of Ohio--in greater Cleveland, the part of Ohio which I call \nhome. In Beachwood, OH, a suburb east of Cleveland, there is a national \nmemorial to David Berger, an American citizen and one of the 11 Israeli \nteam members killed in Munich.\n  As a Nation, we honor his memory and the memory of his Israeli \nteammates, but we also have a moral responsibility to hold accountable \nthose responsible for his death. Holding them responsible includes \nthose who supported and financed the terrorists who perpetrated these \nactions.\n  We had the chance to hold Libya accountable. Yet during negotiations \nthat led to the 2008 U.S.-Libya claims settlement agreement, Mr. Berger \nwas not included, despite widely accepted evidence that Libya played an \nimportant role in the massacre.\n  We know the Qadhafi regime financially supported terrorist groups \nsuch as the Black September organization. It supported them and it \nwelcomed the bodies of the dead terrorists from the Munich massacre \nback to a hero's tribute.\n  Seeking justice and compensation for victims of global terrorism \nsends a powerful message to those who may be seeking to do further \nharm. The window of opportunity to engage the new Libyan Government has \nnever been greater. Libyan Ambassador Ali Suleiman Aujali said earlier \nthis month in an op-ed in the Washington Post that he hopes ``that \nWashington considers an enterprise fund for Libya'' and that ``we would \nwork closely with the U.S. Government on its creation.''\n  Those are the words of the Libyan Ambassador. Such a fund should \ninclude all those who deserve restitution for the losses they suffered. \nThis includes the Berger family.\n  This is about letting violent extremists know they and their \nsupporters will be pursued until justice is served--sending a clear \nsignal to those contemplating terrorism as a political tool.\n  As we all cheer on the American athletes in the next couple of weeks, \nI ask that we all take a moment to think about the Munich massacre, \nabout David Berger, and about what more we can do to preserve their \nlegacy and resolve to thwart those who by their use of terror and \nviolence would undermine all that the Olympic games are supposed to \nrepresent.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, with sadness I rise today to mark the \npassing on July 11, 2012, of former Kentucky State Representative \nDewayne Bunch. As a teacher and State representative, Dewayne served \nthe people of the Commonwealth, especially those in Whitley and Laurel \nCounties, with distinction. He also proudly served our country in Iraq \nas a member of the Kentucky National Guard. Elaine and I send our \ncondolences to his wife Regina, his family, his many friends, and all \nthose at Whitley County High School who knew and loved him.\n  A Corbin resident, Representative Bunch died at age 50. He is \nsurvived by his wife Representative Regina Bunch, and he was the father \nof three daughters. Though his life was cut short, it was characterized \nby a dedication to serving others in his community, State, and country. \nRepresentative\n\n[[Page S5655]]\n\nBunch was a member of the Kentucky National Guard for 23 years, where \nhe notably led the Mountain Warriors in Iraq as a first sergeant.\n  Although he valiantly represented his Nation and State abroad, \nRepresentative Bunch also did much of his work from within the \ncommunity. He was a math and science teacher at Whitley County High \nSchool for 17 years, and in 2010, with the support of the citizens of \nthe 82nd District, was elected State Representative. However, after an \ninjury in 2011, Bunch resigned from his post to receive medical \ntreatment. His wife Regina ran for the position and succeeded her \nhusband as the 82nd District's representative.\n  The loss of Representative Bunch to the members of the Whitley County \ncommunity is immeasurable, and Dewayne's death has saddened Kentuckians \nacross the State. Members of the State House Republican Caucus said he \nwas committed to serving the public and ran for elected office in order \nto more fully serve the people of the Corbin community. The Governor of \nthe State of Kentucky, Steve Beshear, acknowledged the loss of \nRepresentative Bunch by ordering flags lowered to half-staff.\n  Hundreds of people came to pay their respects at Representative \nBunch's funeral on July 15, held at Highland Park Cemetery in \nWilliamsburg. Military graveside honors were conducted by the Kentucky \nNational Guard. At the funeral, Representative Bunch was posthumously \nawarded the Kentucky Distinguished Service Medal to commemorate his \nwork on behalf of his community and the State of Kentucky. I am \nprivileged today to recognize Representative Bunch and his legacy of \nservice to the Commonwealth.\n  Madam President, at this time I ask my colleagues in the U.S. Senate \nto join me in honoring the life of Representative Dewayne Bunch of \nCorbin, KY. The Croley Funeral Home has published an obituary that \nhighlighted his achievements and pays tribute to those Representative \nBunch leaves behind. I ask unanimous consent that said article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Croley Funeral Home, July 12, 2012]\n\n                         Dewayne Everett Bunch\n\n       Dewayne Everett Bunch of Old Corbin Pike, Williamsburg, \n     Kentucky, departed this life on Wednesday, July 11, 2012, at \n     the Oak Tree Hospital in Corbin, Kentucky.

Madam President, I want to speak very briefly about recent \nevents in El Salvador which is in the midst of a constitutional and \npolitical crisis involving the composition and power of the Supreme \nCourt.\n  Essentially what happened is that in June the Supreme Court ruled \nthat the National Assembly had abused its power by naming justices to \nthe court on two separate occasions, and ordered a new judicial \nselection process with which the National Assembly then refused to \ncomply. A majority of the deputies took the extraordinary step of \nappealing the Supreme Court's decision to the Central American Court of \nJustice, and a final ruling is expected in a matter of days.\n  Last week, Congressman Jim McGovern, who is probably more \nknowledgeable about El Salvador than anyone else in Congress, and I \ncommented on the situation. We said:\n\n       We are encouraged by the commitment by President Funes and \n     representatives of El Salvador's political parties to resolve \n     this crisis expeditiously. We agree with the Department of \n     State that this is a matter to be resolved by Salvadorans \n     through dialogue, and we reaffirm our support for U.S. \n     assistance for El Salvador which addresses a range of mutual \n     interests, from improving law enforcement to combating \n     poverty.\n       Over the past 30 years, El Salvador has faced many \n     challenges, from civil war, to corruption, to cyclones. This \n     constitutional political crisis is the latest test of whether \n     the country's governmental institutions can emerge stronger, \n     the rule of law strengthened, and its people more united.\n\n  Since then, there has been further progress towards a resolution of \nthis crisis. As a former prosecutor, Chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee and Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on State and \nForeign Operations that funds international aid programs, I can think \nof few things as important to any society as an independent judiciary. \nLike free and fair elections, it is a cornerstone of democratic \ngovernment. Sometimes I agree with the decisions of our Supreme Court \nand sometimes I disagree. But we comply with its decisions because we \nknow the alternative is chaos and the erosion of the checks and \nbalances that protect our 226 year old democracy.\n  I suspect the people of El Salvador feel similarly, and I am hopeful \nthat however their representatives resolve this matter the independence \nof the Salvadoran judiciary will be preserved and strengthened.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/30/senate-section/article/S5655-2", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5655-S5656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LIFTING OF OBJECTION\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, on June 27, I provided notice of my \nintent to object to proceeding to the nominations of Mark J. Mazur, to \nbe an Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, and Matthew S. Rutherford, \nto be an Assistant Secretary of the Treasury. My support for the final \nconfirmation of these nominees depended on receiving information from \nboth the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service regarding \ntheir implementation of the tax whistleblower program. Since I have \nreceived the responses, I no longer object to proceeding to these \nnominations.\n  The IRS is making progress in paying whistleblower awards under the \nold statute over 90 awards paid from October 1, 2011, until now. \nHowever, I want to make clear that the responses do not alleviate my \nconcerns about these agencies' implementation of changes to the tax \nwhistleblower statute I authored almost 6 years ago. Regulations to \nimplement the new reward program have yet to be issued and only a \nhandful of awards are expected to be paid out before the end of this \nyear.\n  I began asking questions about the program's implementation in 2010. \nI wrote again in 2011 and then again on April 30 of this year. \nUnfortunately, I did not get complete answers until I objected to \nproceeding to the nominations of Mr. Mazur and Mr. Rutherford.\n  If I hadn't objected to proceeding to these nominations, Congress \nwould not have received the most recent annual report on the \nwhistleblower program that is mandated by law. It was provided to \nCongress on June 13, 2012, for the fiscal year ended September 30, \n2011. That is almost 9 months from the end of the year for which it \ncontains data.\n  If I hadn't objected to proceeding to these nominations, the IRS \nlikely would not have acknowledged that there is, in fact, a problem \nwith timely processing whistleblower claims. IRS Deputy Commissioner \nMiller's June 20, 2012, directive to IRS executives and\n\n[[Page S5656]]\n\nsenior managers is a good first step toward correcting this problem.\n  However, more needs to be done. IRS still has not committed to \nprioritizing claims raised by whistleblowers. In addition, the \nimportant protections afforded to taxpayers, including the right to \nappeal IRS decisions, delay IRS from actually collecting the taxes for \nyears and, as the law is currently written, the taxes must be collected \nfirst before a whistleblower can be paid any money.\n  From my long history of oversight of the IRS, I know that it is \nessential that taxpayers be protected from sometimes overeager IRS \nemployees. Yet there must be a way to ensure that the process and \nprocedures that exist to protect taxpayers don't deter whistleblowers \nfrom coming forward. The Treasury Department and the IRS have agreed to \nparticipate in a roundtable discussion that I hope will help identify \nsolutions.\n  It is unfortunate that objecting to these nominees, both of whom were \napproved by the Finance Committee by unanimous, bipartisan votes, was \nthe only way I could get information about the whistleblower program. \nAt least there is now more information than ever before about the IRS \nwhistleblower program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/30/senate-section/article/S5656-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BULGARIA TERRORIST ATTACKS\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I rise to express my outrage at the \nrecent attack on a tour bus in Burgas, Bulgaria, that killed five \nIsraeli citizens and the Bulgarian driver and injured scores of \npassengers. This heinous act was obviously the handiwork of terrorists \nwho prey on innocent civilians in order to shock and horrify the world \nand try to rally some to a twisted, violent ideology. The terrorists \nmust be stopped.\n  I am equally outraged by the fact that the Burgas attack appears to \nbe the latest in a series of attacks on Israeli citizens. There have \nbeen several since the beginning of this year alone, two aimed at \nIsraeli diplomats in India and Georgia in February, as well as a foiled \nplot against tourists in Cyprus the week before the tragedy in Burgas. \nThe attacks targeting Israeli Embassy personnel in India and Georgia \nfell on the 18th anniversary of a suicide bombing of the Jewish \nCommunity Center in Buenos Aires which killed 85 people. Argentine \nauthorities blamed that attack on Hezbollah operatives.\n  All of these attacks have the hallmarks of Iranian involvement or \nplots by their surrogates. The day after the attacks in India and \nGeorgia, Iranian nationals involved in a bomb-making plot in Thailand \nwere arrested after they accidentally detonated their homemade \nexplosives, severely injuring one of the perpetrators. Thai officials \nreported that the improvised explosives found in Bangkok were the same \nas those used in India and Georgia.\n  I understand that the investigation of the Burgas attack is ongoing \nand the United States and other countries are working closely with \nBulgarian officials. White House counterterrorism chief John Brenan has \nvisited Bulgaria, and, while he did not implicate Iran or Hezbollah in \npublic statements he made while there, he pointed out that both Tehran \nand its Lebanese surrogate have been implicated in attacks on civilians \nin the past.\n  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stated that Israel has \n``fully substantiated intelligence'' that the Burgas attack was carried \nout by Hezbollah. I have not seen that information, but I think that \nbased solely on press reports of results thus far in the investigations \nof these attacks, one can reasonably conclude that Iran and Hezbollah \nhave been involved--further evidence of Iran's longstanding use of \npolitical violence and sponsorship of terrorism to achieve its goals.\n  According to a recent edition of the Jewish Press, the Director of \nIsrael's Mossad and the Chief of its Shin Bet have said that Iran and \nHezbollah have tried to commit terrorist attacks against Israeli \ndiplomats, businessmen and tourists in over 20 countries during the \npast 2 years.\n  We must stand with the people and the Government of Israel. We must \nlead the international community in redoubling efforts to assist \nIsrael, and all countries on whose soil these heinous acts are \ncommitted, in tracking down the terrorists and bringing them to justice \nand continue to work to prevent such attacks in the future.\n  I am confident that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle support \nour government's work with Israel and the international community to \ncounter Iran's insidious network of terror.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/30/senate-section/article/S5656-2", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING NEIL McMURRY\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, Wyoming has experienced an incredible \nloss. I rise today to remember one of Wyoming's most beloved citizens, \nNeil McMurry. On Thursday, July 19, 2012, Neil passed away at the age \nof 88. During his remarkable life, Neil made a profound and lasting \ncontribution to the Casper community and the great State of Wyoming.\n  Neil was a successful entrepreneur, a committed citizen, and a good \nfriend. Throughout his life, Neil always demonstrated an enduring \ncommitment to his family, Wyoming, and our Nation. He loved his family. \nHe loved his home State of Wyoming. He loved his country.\n  Ann Chambers Noble, a Wyoming author, recently wrote Neil's \nbiography, ``Hurry McMurry: W.N. `Neil' McMurry, Wyoming \nEntrepreneur.'' The title appropriately describes this extraordinary \nman. He grew up during the Great Depression, and saw firsthand the \nimpact it had on his community. In 1941, Neil joined the U.S. Army Air \nCorps. He flew over 29 missions in Europe as a turret gunner on a B-17 \naircraft during World War II.\n  Following his brave service to our Nation, Neil returned to Wyoming \nto raise a family and start a very successful business career. Neil was \na man with determination, integrity, and a strong work ethic. He \nrecognized the vast opportunities and great potential Wyoming has to \noffer. In 1949, he saw opportunity in constructing roads and highways \nacross Wyoming. Along with his business partner, Vern Rissler, the \nRissler-McMurry Company became one of the largest highway construction \ncompanies in Wyoming. The company built much of Wyoming's \ntransportation routes.\n  While many people would have retired after running a successful \ncontracting firm for over three decades, Neil was on the lookout for \nnew opportunities. Neil and his business partners, John Martin and Mick \nMcMurry, had a hunch that significant natural gas was in the Jonah \nField in southwest Wyoming. In 1991, the McMurry Oil Company purchased \nwells and mineral leases in the Jonah area. His vision and willingness \nto take a risk turned into a natural gas play of historic proportions.\n  Neil McMurry will be remembered for his successful business endeavors \nthat created thousands of jobs for the people in Wyoming. His efforts \nand entrepreneurial spirit significantly impacted Wyoming's economy.\n  While his business abilities will continue to be admired, it will be \nhis selfless devotion to others and his willingness to give back to his \ncommunity that will forever keep his memory in the hearts of the people \nof Wyoming. His charitable donations made a difference in the lives of \npeople in his community.\n  Even though he lived a long life, Neil left us too soon. His \nremarkable contributions to the youth of Wyoming will be honored on \nAugust 7 by the Boys and Girls Clubs of Central Wyoming. While this \nwould have been just one of many honors, it was very special to Neil. \nThrough the generosity of the McMurry Foundation, Neil and his family \nhave given unprecedented levels of support to Wyoming organizations \nparticularly organizations supporting our youth.\n  My wife Bobbi and I will truly miss him. We are blessed that Neil was \nour friend and grateful for the moments we spent together. During this \ntime of such great loss, we find solace in knowing that the legacy of \nNeil McMurry will live on.\n  Bobbi and I extend our deepest sympathy to the McMurry family. We \nwish his family all of our best and send our prayers to each of them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/30/senate-section/article/S5656-3", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5656-S5657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                              MELBA, IDAHO\n\n Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate and \nacknowledge\n\n[[Page S5657]]\n\nthe 100th anniversary of the founding of the city of Melba, Idaho. \nStarting August 17, 2012, the citizens of Melba will gather throughout \nthe weekend to commemorate this special time in their southwestern \nIdaho community.\n  Melba was founded by Clayton C. Todd, naming the yet-to-be town after \nhis 4-year-old daughter. Stopping in Idaho on his way to Alaska to mine \nfor gold, Mr. Todd heard about a State land sale. He purchased 160 \nacres of land and laid out the town site. He had done his homework and \nsaw that this land with a siding on the railroad and expanding farms \nthroughout the area would cut five miles off the route to the nearest \ntown of Nampa and the mainline railroad.\n  Melba became a small boom town in the middle of an agricultural area. \nShortly after World War I, the area became famous for its sweet corn \nseed. Area farmers expanded their seed operations to grow carrot, onion \nand alfalfa seed, along with the corn. The rich, fertile soil, abundant \nwater and the hot summer days with cool nights earned Melba the moniker \n``The Seed Heart of America.''\n  Like many small communities in our great country, they have seen \ntimes of struggle. In 1949, Melba was hit hard by an epidemic of \ninfantile paralysis, also known as polio. The residents not only \nsupported one another, in 1950 they held the first Polio Auction, \nraising $2,000 for medical research on the disease. Now called the \nMelba Community Auction, area residents continue the tradition of \nhelping one another as they raise funds for nonprofit organizations \nthat provide services to those in and around Melba.\n  The spirit of small town America is alive and well in Melba. They \nbelieve in helping their neighbors as well as strangers. Their schools \nare a source of pride and strongly supported by the community. And as \nto their Fourth of July celebration? Let me put it this way--no one can \nquestion their patriotism and love of America! Theirs is a grand \ncelebration of our Nation's birthday.\n  So, Madam President, I am very proud to recognize this landmark \nanniversary and congratulate the community of Melba for this \ncentennial. Melba has much to celebrate as well as to look forward to \nin its next century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/30/senate-section/article/S5657-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO REX E.

Kirksey \non the occasion of his retirement, following a distinguished career \nserving the agricultural community in our home State of New Mexico and \nelsewhere.\n  Mr. Kirksey has dedicated 32 years of his life working for New Mexico \nState University to improve agricultural outreach and to facilitate \nvital research. As the Superintendent of the NMSU Agricultural Science \nCenter in Tucumcari, NM, Mr. Kirksey oversaw research programs focusing \non developing forage and grazing systems for irrigated lands in New \nMexico and the western United States.\n  In 2003, he took on additional responsibilities as superintendent of \nthe Agricultural Science Center in Clovis, NM. Under his leadership, \nthat institution emerged as the State's leading off-campus center with \nnationally and internationally recognized programs in agronomy, dairy \nmanagement, peanut breeding, and crop stress physiology.\n  During his tenure at New Mexico State University, Mr. Kirksey \nauthored many professional publications, including peer reviewed \njournal articles, proceedings papers, research reports and bulletins, \nprogress reports and published abstracts, and an extensive range of \nbusiness reports and correspondence. He has also given numerous \npresentations to industry and peer groups.\n  In addition to his work domestically, Mr. Kirksey has been involved \nwith the Afghanistan Water, Agriculture, and Technology Transfer, \nAWATT, project--a partnership with USAID and New Mexico State \nUniversity. This project aims to improve the community and farm-level \nmanagement of the supply and demand of irrigation water resources for \nincreased agricultural productivity and food security in Afghanistan. \nHe also has worked with the Botswana Sustainable Agriculture \nInitiative, an international consortium with a goal to develop an \nintegrated, sustainable agricultural system. The Botswana Initiative \nwill assist both small and large farms to employ conservation \nagriculture practices to increase fresh water availability, grow more \nnutritious food, build agricultural infrastructure, create more \nagricultural jobs, and stimulate enterprise creation in rural areas.\n  Mr. Kirksey's leadership and expertise has made a difference in the \nlives of so many people in our Nation, as well as other parts of the \nworld. Senator Bingaman and I thank Mr. Kirksey for his commitment and \ndedication to the people of New Mexico and to our agricultural \ncommunities. We would also like to thank his wife Cyndie and their \nthree children for always supporting Rex in his endeavors.

Res. 533\n\n       Whereas, according to a report by WorldatWork, a nonprofit \n     professional association with expertise in attracting, \n     motivating, and retaining employees, the quality of workers' \n     jobs and the supportiveness of the workplace of the workers \n     are key predictors of the job productivity, job satisfaction, \n     and commitment to the employer of those workers, as well as \n     of the ability of the employer to retain those workers;\n       Whereas ``work-life balance'' refers to specific \n     organizational practices, policies, and programs that are \n     guided by a philosophy of active support for the efforts of \n     employees to achieve success within and outside the \n     workplace, such as caring for dependents, health and \n     wellness, paid and unpaid time off, financial support, \n     community involvement, and workplace culture;\n       Whereas numerous studies show that employers that offer \n     effective work-life balance programs are better able to \n     recruit more talented employees, maintain a happier, \n     healthier, and less stressed workforce, and retain \n     experienced employees, which produces a more productive and \n     stable workforce with less voluntary turnover;\n       Whereas job flexibility often allows parents to be more \n     involved in the lives of their children, and research \n     demonstrates that parental involvement is associated with \n     higher achievement in language and mathematics, improved \n     behavior, greater academic persistence, and lower dropout \n     rates in children;\n       Whereas military families have special work-family needs \n     that often require robust policies and programs that provide \n     flexibility to employees in unique circumstances;\n       Whereas studies report that family rituals, such as sitting \n     down to dinner together and sharing activities on weekends \n     and holidays, positively influence the health and development \n     of children and that children who eat dinner with their \n     families every day consume nearly a full serving more of \n     fruits and vegetables per day than those who never eat dinner \n     with their families or do so only occasionally; and\n       Whereas the month of October is an appropriate month to \n     designate as National Work and Family Month: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates October 2012 as ``National Work and Family \n     Month'';\n       (2) recognizes the importance of work schedules that allow \n     employees to spend time with their families to job \n     productivity and healthy families;\n       (3) urges public officials, employers, employees, and the \n     general public to work together to achieve more balance \n     between work and family; and\n       (4) calls upon the people of the United States to observe \n     National Work and Family Month with appropriate ceremonies \n     and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/30/senate-section/article/S5660-2", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5660-S5661]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2621.

and\n       (C) states that the efforts described in paragraphs (1) and \n     (2) may be ongoing.\n       (4) As of November 2008, Iran had produced, according to \n     the IAEA--\n       (A) approximately 630 kilograms of uranium hexaflouride \n     enriched up to 3.5 percent uranium-235; and\n       (B) no uranium hexaflouride enriched up to 20 percent \n     uranium-235.\n       (5) As of November 2011, Iran had produced, according to \n     the IAEA--\n       (A) nearly 5,000 kilograms of uranium hexaflouride enriched \n     up to 3.5 percent uranium-235; and\n       (B) 79.7 kilograms of uranium hexaflouride enriched up to \n     20 percent uranium-235.\n       (6) On January 9, 2012, IAEA inspectors confirmed that the \n     Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran had begun \n     enrichment activities at the Fordow site, including possibly \n     enrichment of uranium hexaflouride up to 20 percent uranium-\n     235.\n       (7) Section 2(2) of the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, \n     Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-\n     195) states, ``The United States and other responsible \n     countries have a vital interest in working together to \n     prevent the Government of Iran from acquiring a nuclear \n     weapons capability.''.\n       (8) If the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran were \n     successful in acquiring a nuclear weapon capability, it would \n     likely spur other countries in the region to consider \n     developing their own nuclear weapons capabilities.\n       (9) On December 6, 2011, Prince Turki al-Faisal of Saudi \n     Arabia stated that if international efforts to prevent Iran \n     from obtaining nuclear weapons fail, ``we must, as a duty to \n     our country and people, look into all options we are given, \n     including obtaining these weapons ourselves''.\n       (10) Top leaders of the Government of the Islamic Republic \n     of Iran have repeatedly threatened the existence of the State \n     of Israel, pledging to ``wipe Israel off the map''.\n       (11) The Department of State has designated Iran as a state \n     sponsor of terrorism since 1984 and characterized Iran as the \n     ``most active state sponsor of terrorism''.\n       (12) The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has \n     provided weapons, training, funding, and direction to \n     terrorist groups, including Hamas, Hezbollah, and Shiite \n     militias in Iraq that are responsible for the murders of \n     hundreds of United States forces and innocent civilians.\n       (13) On July 28, 2011, the Department of the Treasury \n     charged that the Government of Iran had forged a ``secret \n     deal'' with al Qaeda to facilitate the movement of al Qaeda \n     fighters and funding through Iranian territory.\n       (14) In October 2011, senior leaders of Iran's Islamic \n     Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Quds Force were implicated \n     in a terrorist plot to assassinate Saudi Arabia's Ambassador \n     to the United States on United States soil.\n       (15) On December 26, 2011, the United Nations General \n     Assembly passed a resolution denouncing the serious human \n     rights abuses occurring in the Islamic Republic of Iran, \n     including torture, cruel and degrading treatment in \n     detention, the targeting of human rights defenders, violence \n     against women, and ``the systematic and serious restrictions \n     on freedom of peaceful assembly'' as well as severe \n     restrictions on the rights to ``freedom of thought, \n     conscience, religion or belief''.\n       (16) President Barack Obama, through the P5+1 process, has \n     made repeated efforts to engage the Government of the Islamic \n     Republic of Iran in dialogue about Iran's nuclear program and \n     its international commitments under the Treaty on the Non-\n     Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, done at Washington, London, \n     and Moscow July 1, 1968, and entered into force March 5, 1970 \n     (commonly known as the ``Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty'').\n       (17) Representatives of the P5+1 countries (the United \n     States, France, Germany, the People's Republic of China, the \n     Russian Federation, and the United Kingdom) and \n     representatives of the Islamic Republic of Iran held \n     negotiations on Iran's nuclear program in Istanbul, Turkey on \n     April 14, 2012, and these discussions are set to resume in \n     Baghdad, Iraq on May 23, 2012.\n       (18) On March 31, 2010, President Obama stated that the \n     ``consequences of a nuclear-armed Iran are unacceptable''.\n       (19) In his State of the Union Address on January 24, 2012, \n     President Obama stated, ``Let there be no doubt: America is \n     determined to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and \n     I will take no options off the table to achieve that goal.''.\n       (20) On March 4, 2012, President Obama stated ``Iran's \n     leaders should understand that I do not have a policy of \n     containment; I have a policy to prevent Iran from obtaining a \n     nuclear weapon''.\n       (21) Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta stated, in December \n     2011, that it was unacceptable for Iran to acquire nuclear \n     weapons, reaffirmed that all options were on the table to \n     thwart Iran's nuclear weapons efforts, and vowed that if the \n     United States gets ``intelligence that they are proceeding \n     with developing a nuclear weapon then we will take whatever \n     steps necessary to stop it''.\n       (22) The Department of Defense's January 2012 Strategic \n     Guidance stated that United States defense efforts in the \n     Middle East would be aimed ``to prevent Iran's development of \n     a nuclear weapons capability and counter its destabilizing \n     policies''.\n       (23) On April 2, 2010, President Obama stated, ``All the \n     evidence indicates that the Iranians are trying to develop \n     the capacity to develop nuclear weapons. They might decide \n     that, once they have that capacity that they'd hold off right \n     at the edge in order not to incur more sanctions. But, if \n     they've got nuclear weapons-building capacity and they are \n     flouting international resolutions, that creates huge \n     destabilizing effects in the region and will trigger an arms \n     race in the Middle East that is bad for U.S. national \n     security but is also bad for the entire world.''.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--Congress--\n       (1) reaffirms that the United States Government and the \n     governments of other responsible countries have a vital \n     interest in working together to prevent the Government of \n     Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons capability;\n       (2) warns that time is limited to prevent the Government of \n     the Islamic Republic of Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons \n     capability;\n       (3) urges continued and increasing economic and diplomatic \n     pressure on the Islamic Republic of Iran until the Government \n     of the Islamic Republic of Iran agrees to and implements--\n       (A) the full and sustained suspension of all uranium \n     enrichment-related and reprocessing activities and compliance \n     with United Nations Security Council resolutions;\n       (B) complete cooperation with the IAEA on all outstanding \n     questions related to the nuclear activities of the Government \n     of the Islamic Republic of Iran, including the implementation \n     of the additional protocol to Iran's Safeguards Agreement \n     with the IAEA; and\n       (C) a permanent agreement that verifiably assures that \n     Iran's nuclear program is entirely peaceful;\n       (4) expresses the desire that the P5+1 process successfully \n     and swiftly leads to the objectives identified in paragraph \n     (3);\n       (5) warns that, as President Obama has said, the window for \n     diplomacy is closing;\n       (6) expresses support for the universal rights and \n     democratic aspirations of the people of Iran;\n       (7) strongly supports United States policy to prevent the \n     Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran from acquiring a \n     nuclear weapons capability;\n       (8) rejects any United States policy that would rely on \n     efforts to contain a nuclear weapons-capable Iran; and\n       (9) joins the President in ruling out any policy that would \n     rely on containment as an option in response to the Iranian \n     nuclear threat.\n       (c) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section may be \n     construed as an authorization for the use of force or a \n     declaration of war.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2654.

Res. 533\n\n       Whereas, according to a report by WorldatWork, a nonprofit \n     professional association with expertise in attracting, \n     motivating, and retaining employees, the quality of workers' \n     jobs and the supportiveness of the workplace of the workers \n     are key predictors of the job productivity, job satisfaction, \n     and commitment to the employer of those workers, as well as \n     of the ability of the employer to retain those workers;\n       Whereas ``work-life balance'' refers to specific \n     organizational practices, policies, and programs that are \n     guided by a philosophy of active support for the efforts of \n     employees to achieve success within and outside the \n     workplace, such as caring for dependents, health and \n     wellness, paid and unpaid time off, financial support, \n     community involvement, and workplace culture;\n       Whereas numerous studies show that employers that offer \n     effective work-life balance programs are better able to \n     recruit more talented employees, maintain a happier, \n     healthier, and less stressed workforce, and retain \n     experienced employees, which produces a more productive and \n     stable workforce with less voluntary turnover;\n       Whereas job flexibility often allows parents to be more \n     involved in the lives of their children, and research \n     demonstrates that parental involvement is associated with \n     higher achievement in language and mathematics, improved \n     behavior, greater academic persistence, and lower dropout \n     rates in children;\n       Whereas military families have special work-family needs \n     that often require robust\n\n[[Page S5689]]\n\n     policies and programs that provide flexibility to employees \n     in unique circumstances;\n       Whereas studies report that family rituals, such as sitting \n     down to dinner together and sharing activities on weekends \n     and holidays, positively influence the health and development \n     of children and that children who eat dinner with their \n     families every day consume nearly a full serving more of \n     fruits and vegetables per day than those who never eat dinner \n     with their families or do so only occasionally; and\n       Whereas the month of October is an appropriate month to \n     designate as National Work and Family Month: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates October 2012 as ``National Work and Family \n     Month'';\n       (2) recognizes the importance of work schedules that allow \n     employees to spend time with their families to job \n     productivity and healthy families;\n       (3) urges public officials, employers, employees, and the \n     general public to work together to achieve more balance \n     between work and family; and\n       (4) calls upon the people of the United States to observe \n     National Work and Family Month with appropriate ceremonies \n     and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/30/senate-section/article/S5689-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MEASURES READ THE 1ST TIME--S. 3457 AND H.R. 4078\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio.
