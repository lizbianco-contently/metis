Mr. President, yesterday on the Senate floor my friend the \nRepublican leader said he supports an extension of the payroll tax cut \nthat had been enacted last year. There has been an extreme change of \nheart here. On the Sunday shows the assistant leader, my friend, the \njunior Senator from Arizona, said Sunday: Not a chance they would work \nto extend this payroll tax cut. Then, as late as Tuesday, my friend the \nRepublican leader said it would not ``do a thing to help the economy.'' \nObviously there has been a change of heart since then by the leaders of \nthe Senate Republicans.\n  But I noted yesterday that my friend was very careful to say only \nthat he supports existing cuts, not that he supports our plan to cut \ntaxes for 160 million workers in every business in the country.\n  Last night I found out why. I was disappointed to see the \nRepublicans' alternate proposal was actually a backdoor route to \nprotect the very rich while shortchanging the middle class and small \nbusinesses. Should we be surprised at this? That is what has been going \non this past year. Our proposal would provide relief for American \nfamilies and extend existing tax cuts to benefit businesses. The \nRepublican proposal rejects this new tax relief and\n\n[[Page S8080]]\n\ndoesn't provide a penny of additional tax cuts for working families and \nit does nothing for small businesses--the job creators the Republicans \nclaim to care so much about.\n  They seem to think our plan to put $1,500 back into the pocket of \nevery American, with rare exception, and give small businesses the \nboost they need to hire new employees goes too far. They are willing to \nfight for ever deeper tax cuts for the wealthy, but when it comes to \nthe middle class, Republicans here in the Senate--not Republicans \ngenerally, but Republicans here in the Senate--believe the status quo \nis good enough for struggling families. The Republican plan goes \ndirectly against the budget agreement we reached in the summer, the so-\ncalled Budget Deficit Reduction Act, where we raised the debt ceiling \nand those things we worked on. It took 3 months. Their plan goes \ndirectly against that plan that we made, which is now the law of this \ncountry. While Democrats have been working tirelessly to create new \njobs, the Republican plan goes in precisely the opposite direction. \nInstead of creating jobs, it would cost jobs. The report is out today \nthat during the month of October there were 206,000 private sector jobs \ncreated. Under their plan, the Republicans' plan, many more middle-\nclass families around the country would lose their jobs. That includes \nAmericans dedicated to public service, hard-working people committed to \nkeeping our streets safe--for example, an FBI agent, Drug Enforcement \nofficer, food safety workers, highway construction workers. They want \nto devastate those folks. That is how they want to pay for this tax \ncut. It is not anything that is going to help the economy. It hurts the \neconomy.\n\n  They are going after jobs that we need so desperately. Do the \nRepublicans believe--I guess so, because that is what their legislation \nis all about--that the way to revive the economy is to lay off more FBI \nagents or fire more Border Patrol officers? These cuts will not revive \nthe economy, they will only slow it down and cost more jobs. But, \nremember, the role of the Republicans here in the Senate is to defeat \nBarack Obama. It doesn't matter what it does to middle-class families, \nobviously.\n  While targeting the middle class, Republicans propose to do nothing \nto cut back on excessive subsidies for many large corporations that \nbenefit from government contracts. This is almost hard to comprehend. \nThe Republicans started it, and it caught fire during the Republican \ncontrol of the Presidency. There are more than 5 million government \ncontractors. The Republicans propose to do nothing to cut back on \nexcessive subsidies for many of these large corporations that benefit \nfrom government contracts. Employees at some of these taxpayer-\nsupported corporations are being paid more than $700,000 a year while \nmany public servants struggle to make ends meet. The Republicans want \nto whack these people who work to keep us safe in many different ways \nwhile they let these people go untouched.\n  The Republicans are uninterested in going after these high-income \nearners. As usual, the only real target of this Republican meat axe is \nthe middle class. It is wrong. Americans believe, across the country, \nthat the middle class is hurting. I have said--I will say it again--the \nonly people in America who believe that the richest of the rich should \nnot contribute a little bit to help our economy are the Senate \nRepublicans. The Republicans outside this body do not feel that way. \nAmerica's middle class has been hurting for a long time. They are the \npeople who are struggling. They are the ones who need help, not these \nmultimillionaires, and not large, profitable government contractors.\n  The Republican proposal is unacceptable. It will not pass the Senate. \nWe can do better and we must do better.\n  Would the Chair announce the business of the day?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/01/senate-section/article/S8080-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8080]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I come to the floor this morning to urge \nmy colleagues to support the middle-class tax cut bill that would \nextend and expand the payroll tax relief for our families and small \nbusiness owners. This legislation is straightforward. It should not be \ncontroversial. At a time when so many of our hard-working middle-class \nfamilies continue to struggle in this very tough economy, this bill \nwould cut their Social Security payroll tax in half, from 6.2 percent \nto 3.1 percent. That means a tax cut for 160 million workers in this \ncountry today.\n  In my home State of Washington it represents a tax cut of around \n$1,700 for a family earning the median income next year. This bill \nwould put money into the pockets of small business owners and encourage \nthem to hire workers by cutting the employer's side of the payroll tax \nin half as well and eliminating it altogether for firms that are making \nnew hires. In Washington State, 150,000 small business owners would \nreceive a tax cut under this plan and they would have thousands of \ndollars more in their pockets to spend in their communities and get \nworkers back on the job.\n  This is a big deal. Economists from across the ideological spectrum \nhave said payroll tax cuts create jobs and boost the economy. They have \nsaid it could be devastating to allow them to go up in this weak \neconomy.\n  In the past, Republicans have agreed and have strongly supported \npayroll tax cuts as an effective way to boost the economy and create \njobs, so this should be easy. It should be something both parties can \nget behind and quickly pass, but unfortunately it seems politics are \ngetting in the way. I am disappointed that many of the same Republicans \nwho spent the last few months fighting tooth and nail to prevent tax \nincreases on the richest Americans and biggest corporations are now \nhesitating to give average working families a break. In fact, it was \nthis very issue that prevented the Joint Select Committee on Deficit \nReduction to come to a deal.\n  On the Democratic side we put forward serious compromises on the \ntable to get to a balanced and bipartisan deal, but our Republican \ncounterparts refused to allow the wealthiest Americans to pay a single \npenny more in taxes and insisted that the middle class and seniors and \nmost vulnerable Americans bear the burden of this crisis alone. It was \nnot fair then; it is not fair now. This bill is fully paid for by \nasking millionaires, who earn more than $1 million a year, to pay a \nlittle bit more, a small step toward a fair share. It is not drastic. \nIt does not close the loopholes and shelters that Republicans have been \nfighting hard to maintain. It does not touch the Bush tax cuts for the \nrich they have been protecting. It doesn't end the tax breaks for the \noil and gas industry that they would not allow us to close. It simply \nadds a 3.25-percent tax on incomes over $1 million a year. That means \nif someone earns $1.2 million in a single year they only owe an \nadditional 3.25 percent on that last $200,000.\n  At a time when so many families are struggling, we think this is a \nfair thing to ask the wealthiest Americans, who survived so well, to \ncontinue to give working families a break.\n  This vote sets up a simple choice. Do you vote to extend tax cuts for \nmiddle-class families and small businesses that have been struggling in \nthis economy or do you vote to protect the wealthiest Americans from \npaying 1 penny more toward their fair share? I know where I stand. I \nfeel very strongly that we owe it to middle-class families across this \ncountry to extend this tax cut. I think it would be a whole lot easier \nif our Republican colleagues were as focused on tax cuts for the middle \nclass as they are for tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans and \ncorporations.\n\n[[Page S8081]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and extend tax cuts \nfor the families who need them most.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/01/senate-section/article/S8081-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8081]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, yesterday, Republicans, led by Senator \nHeller, introduced what we believe is a much smarter approach to \nextending the temporary payroll tax cut than the one proposed by \nDemocrats involving permanent tax hikes on job creators.\n  Similar to Democrats, we think struggling American workers should \ncontinue to get this temporary relief for another year. There is no \nreason folks should suffer even more than they already are from the \nPresident's failure to turn this jobs crisis around. But there is also \nno reason we should pay for that relief by raising taxes on the very \nemployers we are counting on to help jolt this economy back to life. We \nwould not be helping anybody by making it less likely that small \nbusinesses actually start hiring people again. Senator Heller's \nproposal would achieve the same result, the same relief, without a \ngratuitous hit on job creators. Even better, our plan protects Social \nSecurity and reduces the Federal deficit by more than $111 billion.\n  How do we do it? Consistent with the recommendations of the \nbipartisan Simpson-Bowles Commission, our payroll tax plan would \ninstitute a 3-year pay freeze on Federal civilian employees, including \nMembers of Congress. It would also reduce the Federal workforce \ngradually by 10 percent, not by firing anybody but by only hiring one \nreplacement for every three Federal employees who leave Federal service \nuntil a 10-percent reduction that the Simpson-Bowles Commission \nrecommended is reached. So over this period, only hire one worker for \nevery three who leave until it achieved a 10-percent reduction in the \nFederal workforce. This is a recommendation in the Simpson-Bowles \nCommission.\n  Our bill would also save money by means testing Medicare benefits for \nmillionaires and billionaires. What does that mean? One of the things \nthe economic downturn of the past few years has revealed is that a lot \nof people out there are getting a pretty good deal from the government \nat every level, all on the taxpayers' dime. Let me give you an example. \nYesterday, a CBS affiliate in Philadelphia reported that a former \nPhiladelphia school superintendent who got a nearly $1 million buyout \nin August is now putting in for unemployment benefits. The lady was \nshown the door, given $905,000 not to finish her 5-year contract with \nthe school district, and on top of that she now wants the taxpayers to \nsubsidize her unemployment benefits to the tune of about $30,000 a \nyear. Our proposal helps minimize this kind of thing.\n  What we are saying is, anybody who makes more than $1 million a year \nshould not get an unemployment check on top of it, paid for with tax \ndollars of folks struggling just to make ends meet. No more \nunemployment checks or food stamps for millionaires. No more \nunemployment checks or food stamps for millionaires. We don't think \nthese folks would mind having to pay the full freight on their Medicare \npremiums either. Millions of seniors need help covering their monthly \nMedicare premiums; Warren Buffett is not one of them.\n  Here is another way we think folks such as Warren Buffett can offset \nthe relief we are giving working Americans through our proposal of a \ntemporary extension of payroll tax cuts, which would also incorporate \nlegislation from Senator Thune, that would allow people who want to \nvoluntarily help pay down the Federal debt to do so on their tax \nreturn. There would actually be a new line right on Warren Buffett's \ntax returns enabling him or anybody else, for that matter, to give as \nmuch as they want. That way those who want to go that route can feel \nthey are contributing in a way they want to contribute, and small \nbusiness owners who want to help our economic and fiscal situation by \ngrowing their businesses and creating jobs can do that too without \nWashington dictating one way or the other.\n  This is the kind of balanced plan Americans are looking for. It is \nfocused on helping middle-class Americans without asking them to fund \nbenefits for the wealthiest among us, and it does so without \nhamstringing the economy--as the Democrats would--with a permanent tax \non job creators. Bear in mind what they are doing here is ``paying for \na temporary payroll tax relief with a permanent tax increase on job \ncreators.'' It also helps rein in the bureaucracy in Washington.\n  Millions of Americans have had to go without or to live with less \nover the past few years. Yet all they see here is that Washington just \nkeeps getting bigger and bigger and richer. It is about time Washington \ntook the hit for a change. We think this is a plan that those who are \nfed up with Washington and Wall Street can embrace but, as I have said \nbefore, we are never going to turn this economy around as long as we \nare focused on these temporary measures.\n  Yesterday, I outlined our vision for a tax-reform plan that restores \nbasic fairness, helps put businesses on a level playing field, and puts \nour tax rates in line with our competitors overseas. That is the kind \nof thing that will get this economy charging again and we will continue \nto press for it. Meanwhile, we will also continue to point out what \nthis administration is doing to prevent job creation right now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/01/senate-section/article/S8081-3", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8081-S8082]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yesterday, Republicans drew attention to one of the \ngreatest fumbles of this administration yet, and this is astonishing. I \ndon't know how many Americans are familiar with the proposed Keystone \nXL Pipeline, but this is an issue every single American is soon going \nto learn a lot about. The Keystone XL Pipeline is the single largest \nshovel-ready project in our entire country--the single largest shovel-\nready project in our entire country. It would transport oil from \nCanada--our friendly neighbor to the north--to the gulf coast. It is \nprivately funded, so it would not cost the taxpayer a dime, and we are \ntold that its approval would lead to the creation of 20,000 jobs, not \nsome other time but immediately, right now.\n  This project is enormous. It is a huge job creator, and it is ready \nto go. Labor unions love this project. Folks in the Heartland love this \nproject. The Chamber of Commerce loves this project. But here is the \nproblem: President Obama is getting heat from his base over this \nproject, especially from the very young and very liberal voters he will \nneed knocking on doors before November. So the State Department now \nsays they are going to delay the approval--even though previously they \nwere seemingly ready to approve it after a 3-year review that has \nalready occurred, including two exhaustive environmental evaluations.\n  Here is the bottom line. The President has said time and time again \nthat his top priority is jobs. Yet here we have the single largest \nshovel-ready project in the country ready to go, and he is delaying its \napproval--interestingly enough--until after the election next year. He \nis saying he doesn't care so much about jobs in States such as \nNebraska--that he doesn't think he will carry next year--so he can keep \nthe enthusiasm up in States he hopes to carry. So I think it is pretty \nclear the President cares less about this particular boon for job \ncreation than his own job preservation, and it is wrong.\n  There is no reason whatsoever to delay this project and these jobs by \nanother day. As the President recently put it, we have to decide what \nour priorities are. We have to ask ourselves what is not just best for \nme but what is best for us. What is the best way to grow the economy \nand create jobs? It was President Obama who said that. That is why \nRepublicans are proposing legislation today that would require the \nPresident either to approve this massive job-creating project within 60 \ndays or to explain clearly why he doesn't think it is in the national \ninterest to do so. We will give the President 60 days--not after next \nyear's election but 60 days--to decide why this should not be approved \nand explain it to us. We think the people who want to start hiring \ndeserve action or a straightforward explanation from the President \nhimself as to why he opposes it.\n\n[[Page S8082]]\n\n  Get this pipeline going right now or get out of the way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to speak about the issue of job \ncreation and also supporting our small businesses and strengthening our \neconomic recovery.\n  One of the fundamental questions I have been asked in Pennsylvania--\nand I think most Senators on both sides of the aisle have been asked \nrepeatedly, not just in the last couple of days or weeks but for many \nmonths now--is a very fundamental question: What are you doing as a \nMember of the Senate to create jobs or to at least create the \nconditions under which jobs will be created? What are you doing in your \nvotes, in your advocacy, in your fight in Washington for jobs? What \ndoes that mean? Sometimes we have a better answer than other times. \nToday, and certainly in the last couple days--and I think we will be \ndebating this for a number of days moving forward and that is a good \nthing--we will have a better answer to that fundamental question: What \nare you doing as a public official to create jobs in America?\n  One of the ways we can kick-start the economy and get job creation \nmoving in the right direction again is by passing legislation such as \nthe legislation that I have introduced, the Middle Class Tax Cut Act. \nIt is now before the Senate, as the Presiding Officer knows, and we \nhave been talking about it already, but we have more work to do on this \ntoday and some voting to do today on this legislation.\n  The legislation is fully paid for and will accomplish two important \nobjectives. No. 1, it will strengthen the economy to support middle-\nincome families, and specifically the way we do that is by providing \nmiddle-income families with a cut in the payroll tax, which means take-\nhome pay that will help make ends meet for that worker and that family, \nbut it will also have an impact by boasting demand throughout our \neconomy. No. 2, we will cut payroll taxes for small businesses to help \nthem grow and create jobs.\n  Here is what most people are confronting, and it is not just the big \nnumbers. There are more than 14 million people out of work across \nAmerica. In Pennsylvania, the latest number for October was more than \n500,000 people out of work. To be exact, it is 513,000 people out of \nwork. That number has fluctuated. Thank goodness it started to go below \nhalf a million, but then it bumped again to almost 525,000 so it is at \nleast is moving away from that number.\n  When half a million people are out of work in a State, you can \nimagine the hurt the families are feeling, the lives of struggle and \nsacrifice in our midst, and that is why we have to do something to \njump-start the economy and create jobs.\n  I think the American people also want us to do this in a bipartisan \nway and we can and we should. We came together at the end of 2010 and \npassed a tax bill which was bipartisan. There are elements of that bill \nthat one side or the other did not like, and vehemently so, but we came \ntogether in a bipartisan way to pass a tax bill at the end of last \nyear. We need to do the same thing on a payroll tax cut.\n  We need to work together, Democrats and Republicans, and get a result \nfor the American people. This is something we can do right now--not 6 \nmonths from now, not a year from now but right now--to help our \nfamilies and to create jobs. There is broad agreement that more needs \nto be done to support the economic recovery. We have to create more \njobs, and we have to kick-start the engine of economic growth.\n  While the economy has added nearly 2.8 million private sector jobs in \nthe past 20 months, we continue to face significant economic \nchallenges. Unemployment across the country, as we all know, is still \nat about 9 percent, and long-term unemployment remains at record \nlevels, with 4 out of every 10 unemployed workers having been jobless \nfor 6 months or more. We know that gross domestic product--so-called \nGDP--grew at less than 1 percent, the annual rate, for the first half \nof the year. So for the first 6 months of 2011, we had less than 1 \npercent growth. The third quarter of gross domestic product growth was \nrecently revised downward. Initially 2.5 percent, it was revised \ndownward to just a 2 percent annual rate. So it is self-evident that we \nhave to do something right now about jobs. With a weak labor market and \nonly modest economic growth this year, it is clear we have to act right \nnow.\n\n  Payroll tax cuts and credits are powerful tools to increase job \ncreation and provide economic relief for middle-income families. The \ncurrent 2 percent payroll tax cut for working Americans that is in \nplace now has played an important role in sustaining the economic \nrecovery. By the end of this year, 121 million families will have \nreceived an average tax cut of more than $930 based upon last year's \naction we took to cut the payroll tax. That was a good decision, but, \nif anything, we need to continue that as well as expand it, and I will \nexplain that as I go forward.\n  The number of families benefiting from this current payroll tax cut \nis very large because anyone who receives a paycheck benefits from a \ncut in payroll tax. Anyone who receives a paycheck gets this cut. \nCutting payroll taxes immediately increases the take-home pay of \neveryone who gets a paycheck.\n  Compared to reducing the tax rates for the top 1 percent of the \nAmerican people, more money goes to middle and lower income Americans, \nwho are likely to spend it, if we keep the payroll tax cut in place, \nand, of course, we want to expand it as well. Because take-home pay is \ngreater, people have more money in their pockets--as I said, more than \n930 bucks this year. This additional take-home pay will result in more \nspending. When we spend at that level--and a lot of families are \nspending more, especially during the holiday season--that boosts \ndemands for goods and services and that leads to job creation. This is \nnot theory. This is not some untested theory or hope. We know this \nworks. We did it in 2011, and we have to do more of it in 2012.\n  The employee side of this--and I will divide this into employee and \nemployer for a second--the employee tax cut expires at the end of this \nyear, as I mentioned. Without congressional action, employees' share of \nthe payroll tax will return to 6.2 percent of earnings, up from the \ncurrent 4.2-percent level. So we have a payroll tax that has been cut \nfrom 6.2 to 4.2. That is in place. But if we do nothing, if we don't \nact, if we don't pass an extension, that 4.2 percent will go up to 6.2 \npercent, and it will be a tax increase for families across the board. \nIf we fail to act, these middle-income families will see their payroll \ntax cut disappear at the end of this year. Let me say that again. If we \ndon't act by the end of December, middle-income families will lose this \npayroll tax cut that is in place now.\n  What does this mean? Well, it means basically losing between 900 \nbucks and 1,000 bucks. And this is take-home pay for workers and their \nfamilies.\n  This is a very tough time for families, as I mentioned before, with \nhigh unemployment and so many stresses, economic stresses and pressures \non their lives. Families who are already facing both declining wages \nand stubbornly high unemployment, families who are struggling to pay \nfor housing, make car payments, pay the food bill, pay for college \ntuition, whatever it is in their lives that means making ends meet, are \nstill having a terribly difficult time.\n  Losing this tax cut would also undermine the recovery by reducing \nconsumer spending. Numerous economists and forecasters have highlighted \nthe dangers to the economy of allowing this payroll tax cut to expire. \nIndependent analysts estimate that letting a 2-percent employee tax cut \nexpire would reduce gross domestic product growth by up to two-thirds \nof 1 percent in 2012. Mark Zandi, from Moody's, in an article from \nSeptember 9 of 2011 entitled ``An Analysis of the Obama Jobs Plan,'' \nmade that same point. If we don't continue the payroll tax cut, we will \nhave an adverse impact on economic growth. Goldman Sachs Global ECS \nResearch had a similar conclusion. So this isn't just about individuals \nlosing a payroll tax cut that is in place now, this is about harming in \na very adverse way our economy's ability to grow in a substantial way.\n  Let me talk for a moment about the legislation before us, the Middle \nClass Tax Cut Act which I introduced.\n\n[[Page S8083]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CASEY. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. I thank the Chair.\n  Let me talk for a moment about the legislation. The legislation \nbefore us, as I said before, would both extend and expand the payroll \ntax cut that is in place right now.\n  First of all, for employees, we cut it in half. So instead of paying \na 6.2-percent payroll tax, the employee, the worker, would pay just 3.1 \npercent. That has a sizable impact on the economy when we do that--\n1,500 bucks in the pockets of the average worker in America. \nApproximately 160 million American workers are impacted and as many as \n6.7 million in Pennsylvania. So we would not only keep in place the \npayroll tax cut for workers, but we want to expand it so it is fully \ncut in half.\n  Secondly, I wish to speak for a moment about the employer side of \nthis because that wasn't part of last year's effort. I introduced the \npayroll tax credit in early 2010 to encourage employers to hire and \naccelerate the pace of the recovery. A number of folks on both sides of \nthe aisle have worked on this. The ideas of those kinds of tax credits \nin those kinds of bills we introduced form the foundation of what we \nare trying to do today. This legislation incorporates elements of my \nand others' earlier legislation to provide businesses with quarterly \nincentives to increase their payrolls.\n  I wish to highlight a couple of elements of the legislation before \nus.\n  First, this bill cuts payroll taxes in half for 98 percent of U.S. \nbusinesses. These businesses have taxable payrolls of $5 million or \nless. They will see their payroll taxes cut in half, as I said before, \nfor the worker as well as the business.\n  Some people say: OK, that is 98 percent of businesses. That is good \nnews. What about the other 2 percent who have higher incomes?\n  Those businesses that have taxable income above $5 million will still \nget a payroll tax cut from 6.2 percent to 3.1 percent on the first $5 \nmillion of their taxable payroll. So they get it up to that level. So \nthis is a huge benefit to small businesses across the country and even \nsome businesses larger than that.\n  The Joint Economic Committee, of which I am the chair, recently \nreleased a report that indicated that small business lending remains \nwell below prerecession levels both in the number of loans and the \ndollar value of those loans. So a lot of small businesses still cannot \nget access to credit. This payroll tax cut legislation will help those \ncompanies substantially to be able to get access to credit.\n  Finally, I wish to make a point about the legislation as it relates \nto eliminating the employer's share of the Social Security payroll tax \non the first $50 million of increased payroll in 2012. This isn't just \na cut, this is an elimination if they do one of three things: if they \nare hiring more workers; if they increase the hours, which is another \nway to get the benefit; thirdly, if they are boosting pay.\n  This legislation is one of the best ways to create jobs, one of the \nbest ways to kick-start our economy.\n  I will conclude with this. If we look at the real world of \ncommunities across Pennsylvania or across the country, means that if we \npass this legislation, for median family income in Pennsylvania, the \nbenefit is $1,535, a little more than $1,500. So whether people go to \nsmall rural counties or big cities or suburban communities, wherever it \nis across a State such as ours, workers will be able to put roughly \n$1,500 in their pockets for this season coming up when people need some \nhelp, and small businesses will be substantially positively impacted by \nthis legislation.\n  We need to pass this legislation. We need to do it now to help our \nworkers, to help our businesses, and to grow the economy and create \njobs.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I have offered an amendment to the \nDefense authorization bill that unfortunately we are not going to get a \nchance to vote on, but I want to begin talking about it because I think \nthis is something we need to do as we appropriate money for our \nmilitary for the next year.\n  I wish to start by saying that I support the mission in Afghanistan, \nbut after years of work on wartime contracting issues and looking at \nthe way we have spent money through contracting in both Iraq and \nAfghanistan, I have come to a stark and real conclusion about the money \nwe have wasted and continue to waste in this effort.\n  We are building infrastructure in Afghanistan that we cannot secure \nand that will not be sustained. Since 2004, the Defense Department--\njust the Defense Department, not the State Department--has spent more \nthan $6.9 billion in Iraq and Afghanistan on humanitarian stabilization \nprojects that include infrastructure, energy, and road construction.\n  Primarily, this has occurred through what is known as the CERP fund. \n``CERP'' stands for ``Commanders Energy Response Program.'' This began \nas an effort in the war against insurgencies, the counterinsurgency \neffort, the COIN strategy. This began as a good idea where the \ncommanders on the ground would have money they could directly access to \ndo small neighborhood projects, to win the hearts and minds, to secure \na neighborhood, to stabilize a community.\n  These projects were envisioned, when I first came to the Senate, as \nfixing broken panes of glass in a shopkeeper's window. This program has \nmorphed into something much different than what was envisioned at the \nbeginning of the counterinsurgency effort in Iraq. These $100 projects, \n$1,000 projects, are now hundreds of millions of dollars. In fiscal \nyear 2010, more than 90 percent of the spending in CERP was for \nprojects over $\\1/2\\ million. At its height in 2009, the authorizations \nfor CERP spending in Afghanistan and Iraq reached $1.5 billion. And--\nthis is the kicker--the military building large infrastructure projects \nhas not shown a measurable impact on the success of our mission.\n  I have stacks of studies, and I am such a wonk; I have actually read \nall of these studies. These are just a few of the studies that have \nbeen done by inspectors general, by special inspectors general, by the \nDOD inspector general, by the Wartime Contracting Commission that \nSenator Webb and I put into place to look at all of the wartime \ncontracting issues. Even our own troops have studied the expenditure of \nthese funds. I want to quote their conclusion in a recent study that \nwas completed by the troops that are, in fact, fighting this effort in \nAfghanistan.\n\n       Despite hundreds of millions in investments, there is no \n     persuasive evidence that the Commander's Emergency Response \n     Program has fostered improved interdependent relationships \n     between the host government and the population--arguably the \n     key indicator of counterinsurgency success.\n\n  I go on, a direct quote:\n\n       The effectiveness of CERP in advancing our \n     counterinsurgency objectives in Afghanistan has yet to be \n     operationalized or well documented. The relationship between \n     development assistance and counterinsurgency is being \n     increasingly challenged in the academic and practitioner \n     fields with only unsubstantiated assertions and the \n     occasional anecdote offered as counterargument. There are no \n     clear objectives for a program that funds everything from \n     immediate emergency relief to multi-year, multi-million \n     dollar road projects. The lack of proper incentives and \n     accountability measures have rendered CERP and similar funds \n     an extractive industry for construction companies, \n     nongovernmental organizations, and multiple Afghan government \n     ministries, fueling rather than fighting corruption, \n     community insecurity and insurgent coercion.\n\n  Finding and defeating terrorists, fighting the Taliban, securing \nstrategic victories against al-Qaida, training the Afghanistan military \nand police--all of these things I support. But this amount of money \nbeing spent on large infrastructure projects that cannot be sustained \nwe must end.\n  In an unprecedented fashion, our military--not the State Department--\nhas embarked upon these massive projects. This year, for the first time \nin this authorization, there is now a new Afghanistan Reconstruction \nFund to get around the limits that have been placed on the size of \nprojects in the CERP fund. I call this fund the ``son of\n\n[[Page S8084]]\n\nCERP.'' It has now been documented that they want to go even larger and \neven bigger with these large multimillion dollar projects. I cannot \nstand by as we spend billions on roads, electrical grids, and bridges \nin Afghanistan, knowing the incredible need we have in this country for \nexactly that kind of investment.\n  These projects are not being built in a secure environment. We are \npaying off people to try to keep the contractors safe. And it has been \ndocumented that some of that money has gone right into the hands of our \nenemy. That must be stopped.\n  These projects, in many if not most instances, cannot be sustained. I \ncan give a number of examples. But all you would have to do is travel \naround Iraq and see the empty, crumbling health care centers built with \nAmerican taxpayer dollars, the water park that is a twisted pile of \nrubble that is no longer operational, all of the investments that were \nmade in oil production and electricity generation that were blown to \nbits.\n  I can give specific examples in Afghanistan. How about hundreds of \nmillion of dollars spent on a powerplant--the latest technology: duel \nfuel--and nobody there knows how to operate it. And they cannot afford \nto operate it, so it stands by as an empty, hulking potential generator \nfor backup power, while they buy cheaper electricity from a neighboring \ncountry.\n  For the first time, the Department of Defense has requested and \nreceived $400 million in authorization in this new Afghanistan \nReconstruction Fund. We should limit our military to the small projects \nthat CERP was originally intended for, not produce contracts to major, \nmultinational corporations.\n  All of these reconstruction funds should be pulled, and my amendment \nwould do just that. We would pull all of this money out with the \nexception of projects under $50,000. That would be as much as $700 \nmillion that we could immediately put directly into the highway trust \nfund in this country. That is what my amendment does. It will transfer \nthat investment from a nonsecure environment, in areas these projects \ncannot be sustained, to the very needy cause of infrastructure \ninvestment in the United States of America.\n  Let's do this. Let's stop these large projects that cannot be secured \nand be sustained. Keep in mind, as much as $700 million would be \npulled, and that is a small fraction of what we are spending in \nAfghanistan. The authorization for next year is more than $100 billion. \nSo anyone who tries to say this will cripple our mission in Afghanistan \ndoes not understand the numbers. Of the moneys we are spending in \nAfghanistan, the vast majority is about personnel: to train the Afghan \nmilitary, to train the Afghanistan police department, to fight the \nterrorists who are there, the Taliban, al-Qaida in the areas near \nPakistan. All of that remains. A very small percentage of this would be \npulled. But it should be pulled, and it should be pulled today. We \nshould take this investment and put it in roads and bridges right here \nin our country.\n  I hope this amendment will have success when we look at the \nappropriations process. I think it is time we stop this funding, and \nstop it now.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

DONALD BERWICK\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to commend \nDr. Donald Berwick for his service as Administrator of the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services and also to express my deep \ndisappointment that his nomination was blocked by a minority of \nSenators.\n  CMS, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, has benefitted \ngreatly from Dr. Berwick's innovation and leadership, and the refusal \nof some Members to support confirming him for this position is \ndifficult to understand.\n  Dr. Berwick is widely recognized as a highly qualified leader in the \nrealm of health care quality. But, unfortunately, many of my colleagues \nacross the aisle adamantly opposed Dr. Berwick's tenure, beginning when \nhe was first nominated by President Obama for this position in April of \nlast year. Many of these objections are based on inaccurate accusations \nand sound bites that have been completely taken out of context.\n  Dr. Berwick has the qualifications, expertise, and demonstrated \nleadership ability that CMS needs at this critical time. He is a \npediatrician by training, Harvard professor, health care analyst, \nelected member of the Institute of Medicine, a leading advocate on \nhealth care quality and patient safety, and a cofounder of the \nInstitute for Healthcare Improvement, which is a respected think tank \nthat trains hospitals on how to increase patient safety and improve \noperations.\n  Don Berwick has also written extensively, with there being more than \n120 scholarly articles he has authored or coauthored, along with \nseveral books, on the quality and efficiency of health care.\n  Dr. Berwick is a true visionary. He has been an advocate for \ntransparency and accountability within our health care system, and his \ndistinguished career has made him the ideal candidate to lead the CMS \nat this critical time.\n  It was due to Dr. Berwick's deep knowledge of health care, his vast \nexperience, and his passion for this issue that his nomination \noriginally won praise from across the political and professional \nspectrum. This includes Tom Scully and Mark McClellan, both former \nAdministrators of CMS under President George W. Bush. They strongly \nendorsed his nomination. His nomination also had the support of Dr. \nNancy Nielsen, who is the past president of the American Medical \nAssociation; John Rother, who is the former executive vice president of \nthe AARP; and former Republican Senator from Minnesota, our former \ncolleague, Dave Durenberger. In fact, Newt Gingrich even saluted Dr. \nBerwick for seeking a ``dramatically safer, less expensive, and more \neffective system of health care.''\n  During his tenure as CMS Administrator--the few months he has been in \nthat position--Dr. Berwick has been able to implement impressive \nreforms, including launching the new CMS Innovation Center, which will \ntest new health care delivery models that emphasize primary care and \ninnovative ways to finance health care.\n  He has also instituted a financial incentives program for physicians \nwho use electronic health records. And generally, he has set the tone \nfor health reform to take root and to provide Americans with \naffordable, high-quality health care in a cost-efficient manner.\n  To be perfectly clear, I am not in any way suggesting that I do not \ncontinue to have enthusiasm for the President's recent nominee to \nreplace Dr. Berwick. From all I know of this nominee, she will do an \nexcellent job. But I am frustrated that an eminently qualified public \nservant is being denied the opportunity to continue serving the \nAmerican people in this important position. There is no valid \njustification for denying him that opportunity.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority's time has expired.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I ask unanimous consent for an additional minute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. John McDonough of the Boston Globe, in his commentary \non the response to Don Berwick's nomination, wrote:\n\n       One of [health care's] most distinguished leaders and \n     voices got mugged by partisan Republicans who know better and \n     who got away with it.\n\n  I am truly disappointed that certain Senators have pledged to block \nhis nomination and that he has chosen to resign his position effective \ntomorrow.\n  Our task now is to assess the new nominee the President has sent us. \nI hope Members can come together to do what is right in this \ncircumstance; that is, to quickly confirm an Administrator for this \nvery important position.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I come to the floor deeply disappointed--\nlike many--over our failure to seize a unique opportunity to put \nAmerica on a more fiscally sane path for the future.\n  My No. 1 priority for this year--I have talked about it so many \ntimes, not only publicly but with colleagues in discussions for nearly \na year--that No. 1 priority has been to advocate for a deficit \nreduction package that would be deemed credible by the financial \nmarkets and would put us on a path to fiscal stability. I think, given \nthe situation that exists around the world today, nothing could have \nbeen more impactful in a positive way producing such a package.\n  Financial experts agree--and they have now for years--that we are on \nthe wrong path, that we are spending far too much in relationship to \nour anemic growth and GDP, and that we have staggered along for 3 years \nbut continued to spend an extraordinary amount of money without seeing \nthe economy recover.\n  A number of plans have come forward. One year ago today, Simpson-\nBowles produced one of those types of bold plans that could help get us \nback on this fiscal path to prosperity. As you know, Mr. Bowles was the \nChief of Staff to our former President Bill Clinton. He and our former \ncolleague Alan Simpson put together a package that--whether you agreed \nwith all of it or not, certainly was something that could have put us \non a more fiscally sound path. Yet those recommendations were rejected \nout of hand by the White House and others.\n  We have seen the activities and presentations of the Gang of 6. \nForty-plus Senators, including me, came together in a bipartisan way to \nurge the President to join us in pushing for a bold, comprehensive \nplan. That was rejected. Earlier in the year, the President's budget \nwas laughed out of this Chamber. Not one person--either Democrat or \nRepublican--voted for it.\n  Then in August we came far shot short of what we needed to do to \naddress our debt crisis when Congress passed the Budget Control Act. I \nwas not able to support that particular plan. Although it averted a \ndefault on our debt, it fell woefully short of what was needed to \naddress our fiscal situation. Nevertheless, that opportunity--which we \nhad with the involvement of both parties to do something truly \nsignificant--was passed over.\n  So then it fell to the committee of 12, which is called the \nsupercommittee. Many of us--offered suggestions and urged those members \nto try and go beyond the minimum of $1.2 trillion of deficit reduction \nover a 10-year period of time.\n  There was a so-called Draconian sequester, or across-the-board cut, \nthat would go into place automatically, starting in 2013, if the \ncommittee could not come to an agreement. The consensus at the time was \nthese cuts would be so Draconian that it would force an agreement among \nRepublicans and Democrats--to come forward with at least a minimal \nplan. Many of us were urging them to do much more, to bring forth \nsomething that would be credible with the investment community and \nrestore confidence that America understood the dire situation we were \nin and we were doing something about it as representatives of the \npeople.\n  No clearer message came to this body than the message sent in \nNovember of 2010 with the historic turnover of Members and an \noutpouring of support for putting the future of our country, our fiscal \nfuture and economic future and the future of our children and \ngrandchildren ahead of politics. Yet it is politics that defeated the \neffort.\n  Now, it is easy to blame the committee of 12. I know there was an \nearnest attempt to come together. I believe, politically, perhaps, it \nwas doomed from the start just by the way it was designed. That is one \nof the reasons I voted against that proposal. Nevertheless, they made \nan earnest attempt but, unfortunately, were not able to bring it home.\n  So the responsibility falls not just on those 12, but it falls on \nthis entire Congress because we would not even have gotten to that \nsupercommitteen if we had done our job earlier and presented a real \nplan in August, when we were bumping up against the debt limit \nextension. That's when we should have done what most of us intuitively \nunderstand needs to be done. Yet the political considerations and \nramifications were such that we came forward with a very timid and \nwoefully short plan of what we needed to do.\n  The President has to take some responsibility. We cannot really bring \nforward a bold change in the way the U.S. Government does business \nunless we have bipartisan support. We cannot get that bipartisan \nsupport unless the Chief Executive, the quarterback of the team, stands \nup and says: I want to be involved and engaged and stay engaged. While \nthere was some rhetoric coming out of the White House, there was no \nplan. As I said, the only plan we have had from the President--his \nbudget plan--was rejected earlier this year on a unanimous vote, every \nRepublican and every Democrat turned it down.\n  The President has said some nice words about what we needed to do and \nso forth and so on. But he was AWOL. As I said, the quarterback of the \nteam needs to be engaged. He is the key person. Yet that quarterback \nwas not even on the field. So responsibility falls on both Congress and \nthe White House. I think some responsibility also falls on outside \ngroups who distorted what we were trying to do, who mischaracterized \nwhat Republicans were seeking to accomplish, and there was some \nmischaracterization of what Democrats were seeking to accomplish as \nwell. But it was an undermining process. Those groups that supposedly \nare representative of seniors across this country, the shameful way in \nwhich they distorted the message and what we were trying to do--and, \nobviously, it had a political impact here and put restraint on Members \nbecause their base was being lied to in terms of what was under \nconsideration and what we were trying to do.\n  We all know Social Security and Medicare are not going to have the \nfunds available in the future to provide the services that were \npromised to the American people. Yet any attempt to try to salvage and \nsave and retain those programs' solvency was distorted by these groups \nthat supposedly represent the interests of our seniors. Many of these \ngroups falsely claimed that we were trying to take away their program, \nwe were trying to destroy their program.\n  I mean, how ridiculous it is that someone is going to come in here \nand say: My goal is to destroy retirement benefits for the American \npeople or I am here to take away health benefits for American retirees. \nNone of us are here to do that.\n  These programs are law. They are in place. We want them to be more \nefficient, more effective, but, more importantly, we want them to \nremain solvent. Yet outside groups were basically sending just the \nopposite messages. So the Congress failed. We came up short. But having \ndone so, Congress cannot avoid the responsibility we have to do \neverything in our power to try to address a very serious fiscal problem \nthat exists in this country.\n  Years and years, decades and decades, not only this Congress but \nformer Congresses, not only this President but former Presidents have \nmade promises to the American people that we now are unable to keep \nbecause we do not have the fiscal capability of doing so. We have not \nhad a budget come out of the Congress in more than 1,000 days. There is \nsome indication that we will have a budget next year. I sincerely hope \nwe can get together and come forward with a deficit reduction budget, \none that recognizes the fiscal plight in which we find ourselves. I \nwill work with both sides of the aisle to try to accomplish that. We \nhave to acknowledge that we continue to spend trillions more dollars \nthan we have available to us. No nation can sustain that.\n  All we have to do is look across the Atlantic at what is taking place \nin Europe from country to country. It is not just Greece, it is not \njust Portugal, it is not just Ireland anymore. It is Italy and maybe \nFrance and maybe other countries. The European Union is struggling to \ntry to address this serious debit crisis, the same type of problem we \nhave here.\n  There have been many here that look at Europe and say: They need to \nget\n\n[[Page S8086]]\n\ntheir act together. Well, we need to get our act together here because \nwhat we are seeing there may be coming across the shore. Certainly, \nsimilar problems exist: promising more than we can deliver, borrowing \nmore so that we can pay debts that we do not have the money to pay \nthrough the revenues we generate in our country. The same thing is \nhappening here.\n  This is the challenge in front of us. We need to find a way to seize \nthis opportunity to do something for the future of this country. Our \ngeneration must step up for the next generations and for the sake of \nthe country's future. We need to continue this debate and go forward. \nIt is easy to sit around and grumble and blame somebody else and say, \nwell, we gave it our best shot and therefore we will just let whatever \nhappens happen. We do not want to do that because what will happen \nhere, if we continue on the current course, is what is happening in \nEurope today. There is no clearer picture of the consequences of a \nsovereign nation promising more and spending more than it takes in over \ntime. It slows the economy. It piles up the interest payments. It \nshrinks the amount of money available for essential services. It puts \nthe programs that were in place in real jeopardy.\n  So if we consider the consequences, we clearly have to answer the \nquestion: Where do we go from here? How do we go forward in a \nconstructive way?\n  I would suggest a few things: First, we need to enforce the law that \nis there under the Budget Control Act. The law that is in place on the \nbooks now, even though I believe that law designed a process that is \nwoefully short of where we need to go, but we need to enforce it now.\n  No one wanted to get to this across-the-board cutting, this sequester \nthat impacts our national security and other functions of government. \nBut that sequester was supposed to prevent us from failing and urge us \nto come to agreement. It did not. The sequestration rule now is the \nlaw, and I think an attempt to undo that is one of the most cynical \nthings we can do, and the American people know it. I do not believe \nthey will allow us to do it.\n  So the law needs to be enforced if we cannot come up with the minimum \namount of cuts required. We need to go forward and do that. So there \nare a number of ways--and I commend the committee for at least trying \nto come up with some efficiencies and effectiveness rein in our Federal \nspending. I believe they have a list of things that we can look to in \norder to enforce more cuts. I have suggested a triage process when we \nreview every aspect of an agency of government, every function that is \nperformed through this Federal Government, and basically say: We have a \npatient that is sick, a patient with a potentially terminal disease. \nBut we need to triage. We have a bunch of people in the waiting room. \nSome of them need attention right away. So we need a triage of every \nagency, every function, every expenditure being examined from the \nstandpoint of, is this absolutely essential to the future of this \ncountry, to the protection of our citizens? Is this an absolutely \nessential function of government that cannot be done at the State \nlevel, at the local level, or at the private level? If so, then that \nneeds to have priority.\n  Secondly, there is a whole range of issues. We come down every day \nwith new ideas and thoughts of ``this would be nice to do, but we \ncannot afford to do.'' We have to delay these initiatives those or just \nsimply say to people: I am sorry, we do not have the money to pay for \nthis idea.\n\n  So we separate the essential from ``like to do and cannot do,'' and \nthen we look at what needs to be done that someone else can do better. \nWhether in the private sector, at the State level, or at the local \nlevel, there are a whole range of areas where the Federal Government \nhas gotten in way over its head. These are functions that can take \nplace in the private sector or through State and local governments.\n  We can look at the duplication and inefficiencies that exist. Senator \nCoburn came up with a long list, trillions of dollars in expenditures \nthat could be saved. We ought to look at that. We ought to look at \nthose and decide which ones we want to go forward with and how we can \nstart that process.\n  Let me mention a couple of things: 18 separate domestic food \nassistance programs. Do we need domestic assistance for food? Probably \nthere are some areas where we do. Do we need 18 separate programs \ndolling this out?\n  There are 47 different job training programs. OK. The economy is \nrestructuring. We need job training. Do we need 47 separate programs to \ndo that?\n  And my personal favorite: 56 financial literacy programs. We can \nargue that the Federal Government is in no place to teach the American \npeople how to be financially literate. I think what we need to do is be \nfinancially literate here in Washington and then use that model to show \npeople how to be literate rather than simply say, well, we have the \nanswer. We, obviously, do not have the answer. Why we have 56 financial \nliteracy programs in place through the Federal Government is just \nastounding.\n  So these are suggestions. There are many others regarding cutting of \nspending. But there are other functions that need to be addressed. \nThere are three major categories. One is regulatory reform. Regulation \nfrom various agencies is costing the American taxpayer and Americans \nmillions and billions of dollars.\n  There is a process underway to look at those. That is one category. I \ncan talk for a long time about that, but I will not. A second one is \nentitlement reform. Now, I have been talking about this subject from \nthe beginning. This is the engine that drives the train of deficits, \nand we can stand by and continue to lie to the American people and say \nthey have nothing to worry about. We can say we are going to preserve \nevery penny of the Social Security and every penny of the Medicare and \nMedicaid, and it will always be there. Do not worry. Even the money put \nin via payroll taxes and so forth, it is all sacrosanct, and do not \nworry about it. We can continue that lie or we can tell the American \npeople the truth; that is, if we want to keep these programs viable, we \nneed to take structured reform measures now.\n  Those could be increasing the age of eligibility for Medicare to \ncoincide with the current Social Security age. It could be changes in \nsome of the indexes that are used to calculate the cost-of-living \nadjustment. That could be modified through means testing.\n  Warren Buffett says he does not need Social Security. Fine. If people \ndo not need Social Security or Medicare or at least the full payment, \nlet's give them back what they paid in. So we could put means testing \nin there. We need to debate and talk about this issue.\n  Is it politically sensitive? Sure. But let's be honest with the \nAmerican people. They want us to be honest. I think that is what the \nmessage of 2010 was all about.\n  The third category, one in which I have been very involved in, is \nreforming our Tax Code, which is a mess.\n  The tax code is totally incomprehensible to anybody who spends less \nthan 15 hours a day as a career studying it and trying to figure it \nout. Our tax code is a nightmare. Americans spend billions of dollars \nhaving people do their taxes because the tax code is too complex to \nunderstand. There are tens of thousands of pages in the Tax Code.\n  There is a growing bipartisan consensus here in Congress that we need \nto reform our Tax Code. Senator Wyden and I have a bipartisan bill that \nhas been worked on for 3 years to reform the tax code. Our plan is not \nthe absolute answer to everything, but it is the only bipartisan bill \nin legislative text, it has been scored, and it is available to be \ndebated. I know the supercommittee looked at our proposal. The Ways and \nMeans Committee and the Finance Committee ought to look at it as well. \nTax reform can, make this country more competitive, grow economy, and \nhelp with our fiscal situation.\n  I sense that I am close to or running out of time. In deference to my \ncolleagues, I will wrap up.\n  I came here deeply disappointed today. I remain disappointed that we \nhaven't been able to do more. My No. 1 priority has been to advocate \nfor going big on a deficit reduction plan. We weren't able to do that. \nExperts agree that we must do more. We only have to look at Europe to \nsee what is coming next. Let's try to avoid that. There are plans out \nthere we can build off of right now. So instead of just folding our \ntent and saying there is nothing we\n\n[[Page S8087]]\n\ncan do except wait for the election results of 2012 when we may have a \ndifferent President or a different Congress, we have a responsibility \nto act now. There are ways we can do this. We need to demonstrate to \nourselves and to the American people that we will accept this \nresponsibility. I choose to do that. I choose to take the tough \nmedicine for the future of the country. I believe the American people \nchoose to do that as well.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me as we move forward. Let's not sit and \nwait for election results. Let's do something now because the urgency \nand the crisis is real, and it needs to be addressed now. Let's be \nresponsible and step up and do it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/01/senate-section/article/S8087-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8087-S8088]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO LARRY MUNSON\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my colleague, \nmy fellow University of Georgia graduate, Senator Isakson, to honor a \nman who died last week who became a legend in his own time in our great \nState, a legend who was respected by, as we would say, folks on both \nsides of the aisle. That term for this man means he was respected by \nGeorgia Tech football fans as well as University of Georgia football \nfans.\n  The man I am talking about is Larry Munson. Larry Munson was not a \nsoutherner by birth, but he became a southerner and Georgia Bulldog by \npassion. He was the Georgia football announcer for over four decades. \nDuring those four decades, he not only witnessed some of the most \nmemorable football games, but he made some of the most memorable calls. \nHis way of describing a football play will go down in the annals of \nbroadcasting as not only being unique, not only being fascinating, but \nit will go down in the annals of sports broadcasting as being some of \nthe best and most professional calls ever made on a football field.\n  But there was more to Larry Munson than the ``Run, Lindsay, run,'' \nmore to Larry Munson than the ``Oh, you Herschel Walker,'' more to \nLarry Munson than ``We just stomped on them with a hob-nailed boot.'' \nHe was a man who had passion for life, a man who had a thorough \nunderstanding of his profession, and a man who worked very hard at his \nprofession.\n  He used to get up every Saturday morning before a football game and \nhave coffee with our legendary coach, Vince Dooley. Coach Dooley said \nhe finally had to stop having coffee with Larry Munson because Larry \nwas ever the pessimist, from a football standpoint. Coach Dooley would \ncome to those coffees feeling good about his chances in the ball game \nthat day, and by the time he finished having coffee with Larry Munson, \nhe had to go back and rewrite his playbook.\n  Larry Munson was simply a man who loved the University of Georgia. He \nloved calling football games, and he loved putting his emotions into \nthose calls. He was also a man who cared not just about the University \nof Georgia but about his students. He used to have what he called a \nWednesday night movie night where he would invite students to join him \nat a theater in Athens, GA, and he would share time--his time--with \nstudents that he loved. He did this for years and years and years. I \nhave heard stories from some of those folks who attended those movie \nnights that Larry Munson was more passionate about movies than he was \nabout University of Georgia football, which is hard to imagine.\n  As we look back on the life of Larry Munson, those of us who live and \nbreathe Georgia football will always remember the passionate calls, the \nway he put his heart and soul into the football game, but we will also \nremember the man Larry Munson, who enjoyed life, enjoyed people, \nenjoyed his profession, and who gave so much back to his profession.\n  He was a man who loved the outdoors. He came south from his \nbirthplace of Minneapolis many years ago. He remained a true southerner \nnot just for his 40 years of broadcasting at the University of Georgia \nbut in his bass fishing, for example. I remember when he would come \ndown to our part of the world in south Georgia to speak to a touchdown \nclub, or whatever it may be, and he would always call up and say, \n``Where is the best bass pond in south Georgia? That is where I want to \nbe this afternoon before my speech.'' He thoroughly enjoyed the \noutdoors, and he enjoyed being around people. That was obvious in the \nway he expressed himself behind the microphone when he called football \ngames.\n  As we celebrate the life of Larry Munson, we celebrate more than his \nhistoric calls. His passion for football, his passion for his family, \nand his passion for friends exceeds any passion he had for football. He \nwas a great man, a great friend, and he will certainly be missed by our \nState and particularly by our university.\n  With that, I yield to Senator Isakson.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia, Mr. \nIsakson, is recognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I appreciate the opportunity to share a few moments with \nSenator Chambliss on the floor of the Senate to pay tribute to a great \nGeorgian, Larry Munson.\n  Larry Munson was born in Minneapolis, and after the service he got a \nscholarship at a broadcasting school, and he got a job at the \nUniversity of Wyoming. He worked his way to Tennessee, where he \nannounced for the Vanderbilt basketball and football programs. Then, \nwhen the Braves moved from Milwaukee to Atlanta, he was brought in to \nbe one of the announcers for Atlanta Braves baseball. Shortly after \nthat, the voice of the Georgia Bulldogs retired and went to another \njob, and Larry Munson was asked to take over broadcasting at the \nUniversity of Georgia. He was a Yankee, an outsider, not one whom many \npeople thought much of when he started. Well, he became a legend in his \ntime. He is a revered person in our State.\n  It is said that Southeastern Conference football is not a game, it is \na religion. In that analogy, if it is a religion in the Southeastern \nConference, Larry was the high priest. He was the man whom everybody \nlooked to to make the call nobody else could. The greatest tribute I \never saw to Larry Munson was on SEC football on an afternoon, at 3:30, \nwhen, a couple of years ago, before he retired, the announcer for CBS \ntelevision brought in Larry Munson's radio play by play and set \nthemselves aside because he was that good. He brought the game to life. \nHe brought a spirit to the game you just could not find.\n  He was a hometown boy. There was no question whom he worked for, no \nquestion who signed his ticket. He was always fair but always friendly \nto the Dogs. It was his spirit that brought the University of Georgia \nfrom the doldrums of the 1960s to the height of college football--the \nnational championship in 1980, four SEC championships in the last 12 \nyears, and, hopefully, an SEC championship this Saturday night.\n  Larry Munson passed away a few days before Thanksgiving in his \nbeloved town and hometown of Athens, GA. Although he started in \nMinneapolis, MN, and went to Wyoming and later to Tennessee, he finally \nresided in Georgia, and he died in Georgia. He is esteemed in our \nState.\n  On this day, let me, on behalf of the people I represent in my State \nof all persuasions when it comes to college football, pay tribute to a \nman who gave every single measure of himself to make sure every person \nwho listened to his voice saw a game, whether they were blind or could \nsee, because he brought life to a game like nobody else could. He was a \ngreat Georgian and a great American. He will be missed.\n  I can promise you this: His view at Stanford Stadium today is far \nbetter than the view he used to have in the broadcast booth because he \nis high over the stadium, where he made his living and where he will \nalways be remembered.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown of Ohio). Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I believe we are still in morning business.\n\n[[Page S8088]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I ask unanimous consent to enter into a colloquy, and if \nthe Chair could let me know when 10 minutes has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/01/senate-section/article/S8088-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8088-S8094]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. While we decide how we are going to move on the Defense \nbill, I appreciate Senator Kyl coming to the floor. Senator Kyl and I, \nalong with Senators Levin and McCain, have been working on detainee \npolicy for years now. There is an issue that is before the Senate soon. \nIt involves what to do with an American citizen who is suspected of \ncollaborating with al-Qaida or an affiliated group.\n  Does the Senator agree with me that in other wars American citizens, \nunfortunately, have aided the enemies of their time?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, yes. I would say to my colleague, \nunfortunately, it is the case that there probably hasn't been a major \nconflict in which at least some American citizen has decided to leave \nhis country and side with the enemy.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Is the Senator familiar with the efforts by German \nsaboteurs who landed--I believe, in the Long Island area, but I don't \nknow exactly where they landed--during World War II, and they were \naided by American citizens to execute a sabotage plot against the \nUnited States?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, yes. In fact, there is a famous U.S. Supreme \nCourt case, Ex parte Quirin, decided in 1942, that dealt with the issue \nof an American citizen helping the Nazi saboteurs that came to our \nshores.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Does the Senator agree with me that our Supreme Court \nruled then that when an American citizen decides to collaborate and \nassist an enemy force, that is viewed as an act of war and the law of \nwar applies to the conduct of the American citizen?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would say to my colleague, yes. My \ncolleague knows this case, I am confident. I think one quotation from \nthe case makes the point clearly--in Ex parte Quirin the court made \nclear: ``Citizenship in the United States of an enemy belligerent does \nnot relieve him from the consequences of his belligerency.''\n  In other words, if a person leaves their country and takes the \nposition contrary, they side with the enemy, they become a belligerent \nagainst the United States, the fact that they are still a citizen does \nnot protect them from being captured, from being held, and in this case \neven being tried by a military tribunal.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. So the law, at least since 1942, by the Supreme Court has \nbeen that if someone decides as an American citizen to join forces with \nenemies of the United States, they have committed an act of war against \ntheir fellow citizens. It is not a criminal event we are investigating \nor dealing with; it is an act of war, and the American citizens who \nhelped the Nazis were held as enemy combatants and tried as enemy \ncombatants?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, yes. I would just qualify that statement this \nway. A person can be subject to military custody being a belligerent \nagainst the United States, even while being a U.S. citizen, be tried by \nmilitary commission because of the act of war against the United States \nthat they committed. One could also theoretically have been tried in a \ncriminal court. But one can't reach the opposite conclusion, which is \nthat they can only be tried in civilian court.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. In the Military Commission Act of 2009, we prohibited \nAmerican citizens from being tried by military commissions. I am OK \nwith that. But what we have not done--and I would be very upset if we \nchose to do that--is take off the table the ability to interrogate an \nAmerican citizen who has chosen to help al-Qaida regarding what they \nknow about the enemy and what intelligence they may provide us to \nprevent a future attack.\n  Since homegrown terrorism is a growing threat, under the current law, \nif an American citizen became radical, went to Pakistan and trained \nwith al-Qaida or an affiliated group, flew back to Dulles Airport, got \noff the plane, got a rifle, went down to the Mall right behind us and \nstarted shooting people, does the Senator agree with me that under the \nlaw as it exists today, that person could be held as an enemy \ncombatant, that person could be interrogated by our military and \nintelligence community and we could hold them as long as necessary to \nfind out what they know about any future attacks or any past attacks \nand we don't have to read them their Miranda rights?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, yes. The answer to the question, short, is, \nyes. It is confirmed by the fact that in the Hamdi case, the U.S. \nSupreme Court precisely held that detention would be lawful. Of course, \nwith the detention being lawful, the interrogation to which my \ncolleague refers could also be taken.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Would the Senator yield for a question on that subject \npoint?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The individual who was an American citizen--Mr. Hamdi, \nthe subject of the U.S. Supreme Court case--was an American citizen \ncaptured in Afghanistan; is that correct?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yet in the Supreme Court decision reference is made to an \nindividual who was captured during World War II in the United States of \nAmerica; isn't that correct? It was referenced in the Supreme Court \ndecision.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes. The In re Quirin case dealt with an American citizen \nhelping the Nazis in America. The Hamdi case dealt with an American \ncitizen helping the Taliban in Afghanistan.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The reason why I raise the question is because the \nSenator from Illinois, and others, have cited the fact that Hamdi was \nan American citizen but captured in Afghanistan, not in the United \nStates of America.\n  Yet isn't it a fact that the decision in Hamdi also made reference to \na person who was apprehended in the United States of America?\n  This is what is bizarre about this discussion, it seems to me.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The Hamdi case cited In re Quirin for the proposition \nthat an American citizen who provides aid, comfort or collaboration \nwith the enemy can be held as an enemy combatant. The In re Quirin case \ndealt with an American citizen helping the Nazis in New York. The \nPadilla case involves an American citizen, collaborating with al-Qaida, \ncaptured in the United States.\n  Mr. McCAIN. So I guess my question is, it is relevant where the \ncitizen of the United States was captured. Because the decision made \nreference to people captured both in the United States and outside the \nUnited States.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Exactly. I would add, and get Senator Kyl's comment. \nWouldn't it be an absurd result if you can kill an American citizen \nabroad--Awlaki--whatever his name was--the President targeted him for \nassassination because he was an American citizen who went to Yemen to \nengage in an act of terrorism against the United States. The President \nwent through an Executive legal process, targeted him for assassination \nand a drone attack killed him and we are all better off. Because when \nan American citizen helps the enemy, they are no longer just a common \ncriminal; they are a military threat and should be dealt with \nappropriately.\n  But my point is, wouldn't it be an odd result to have a law set up so \nthat if they actually got to America and they tried to kill our people \non our own soil, all of a sudden they have criminal status?\n  I would argue that the homeland is part of the battlefield, and we \nshould protect the homeland above anything else. So it would be crazy \nto have a law that says if you went to Pakistan and attacked an \nAmerican soldier, you could be blown up or held indefinitely, but if \nyou made it back to Dulles Airport, you went downtown and started \nkilling Americans randomly, we couldn't hold you and gather \nintelligence. The Supreme Court, in 1982, said that made no sense.\n  If a Senator, in 1942, took the floor of the Senate and said: You \nknow those American citizens who collaborated with the Nazis, we ought \nnot treat them as an enemy, they would be run out of town.\n  I am just saying, to any American citizen: If you want to help al-\nQaida, you do so at your own peril. You can\n\n[[Page S8089]]\n\nget killed in the process. You can get detained indefinitely. When you \nare being questioned by the CIA, the FBI or the Department of Defense \nabout where you trained and what you did and what you know and you say \nto the interrogator: I want my lawyer, the interrogator will say: You \ndon't have a right to a lawyer because you are a military threat.\n  This is not ``Dragnet.'' We are fighting a war. The Supreme Court of \nthe United States has clearly said an American citizen who joins with \nthe enemy has committed an act of war.\n  Senator Feinstein, who is the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, \nis a very good Senator. But her concerns about holding an American \ncitizen under the law of war, her amendment, unfortunately, would \nchange the law.\n  Does Senator Kyl agree with that?\n  Mr. KYL. Yes. Mr. President, that is the key point. There is a reason \nwhy you don't want to adopt the Feinstein amendment: It would preclude \nus from gaining all the intelligence we could gain by interrogating the \nindividual who has turned on his own country and who would have \nknowledge of others who might have joined him in that effort or other \nplans that might be underway.\n  We know from past experience this interrogation can lead to other \ninformation to save American lives by preventing future attacks, and it \nhas occurred time and time again. In a moment, I will put a statement \nin the Record that details a lot of this intelligence we have gathered. \nIt is not as if an American citizen doesn't have the habeas corpus \nprotection--which still attaches--whether or not that individual is \ntaken into military custody.\n  The basic constitutional right of an American citizen is preserved. \nYet the government's ability to interrogate and gain intelligence is \nalso preserved by the existing law, by the status of the law that \nexists today. We would not want to change that law by something such as \nthe Feinstein amendment.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Simply stated, when the American citizens in question \ndecided to give aid and comfort to the Nazis, I am very glad they were \nallowed to be held by the military and interrogated about the plot and \nwhat they knew, because intelligence gathering is the best way to keep \nus safe.\n  I would be absolutely devastated if the Senate, for the first time in \n2011, denied the ability of our military and intelligence community to \ninterrogate somebody who came back from Pakistan and started killing \npeople on the Mall--that we could no longer hold them as an enemy \ncombatant and find out what they did and why they did it; that we would \nhave to treat them as a common criminal and read them their Miranda \nrights. That is not the law.\n  If that becomes the law, then we are less safe because I tell you, as \nwe speak, the threat to our homeland is growing. Homegrown terrorists \nare becoming the threat of the 21st century, and now is not the time to \nchange the law that has been in place for decades. I do hope people \nunderstand what this means.\n  It means we would change the law so that if we caught somebody in \nAmerica who went overseas to train and came back home, an American \ncitizen who turned on the rest of us, no longer could we hold them as \nan enemy combatant and gather intelligence. That, to me, would be a \nvery dangerous thing to do.\n  I ask the Senator, who determines what the Constitution actually \nmeans; is it the Congress or the Supreme Court?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, ultimately the U.S. Supreme Court, when cases \ncome before the Court that present these issues, determines what the \nlaw is. In this situation we have actually two specific cases, and \nthere are others that are tangential, that do clarify what the Court \nbelieves what the Constitution would provide in this case.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. So the issue is pretty simple. Our courts at the highest \nlevel--the Supreme Court has acknowledged that the executive branch has \nthe legal authority to hold an American citizen who is collaborating \nwith an enemy as an enemy belligerent to gather intelligence to protect \nthe rest of us; they recognize that power of the executive. Does the \nSenator agree with me that the amendment of Senator Feinstein would be \na situation where the Congress does not recognize that authority and \nwould actually try to change it?\n  Mr. KYL. Yes. One of the questions is this interplay between the \nexecutive and the legislative branch. When the legislative branch, as \nCongress has done here through the authorization of military force, has \nprovided the legal basis for the administration to hold a person \nengaged in war against us, then it cannot be denied that that authority \nexists. There is a 1971 law that Congress passed that said you could \nhold people only pursuant to law. This was the precise holding of the \nHamdi case, where the U.S. Supreme Court said they had the authority \nbecause of the authorization of military force. So the executive has \nthat authority, the legislature has provided the basis for the \nauthority, and the Supreme Court has upheld it by its ultimate \njurisdiction.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. And to conclude this colloquy--I enjoyed the discussion--\nI am not saying our law enforcement or military intelligence community \ncannot read someone their Miranda rights. I will leave that up to them. \nI am saying Congress should not take off the table the ability to hold \nsomeone under the law of war to gather intelligence, and that is what \nwe are about to do if this passes.\n  To those who believe that homegrown terrorists are a threat now and \nin the future, if you want to make sure we can never effectively gather \nintelligence, we only have one option, then that is what we are about \nto impose on the country.\n  Mr. KYL. If I might ask my colleague to yield for one other point I \nwish to make here.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Absolutely.\n  Mr. KYL. In a criminal trial, the object is to do justice to an \nindividual as it pertains to his alleged violation of law in the United \nStates. In the case of the capture and detention of a combatant, \nsomeone who has taken action against the United States, the object \nfirst is to keep the United States safe from this individual's actions \nand, second, where possible, gain intelligence from that individual. \nThat is the critical element that would be taken from our military, \nwere the Feinstein amendment to be adopted.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a statement \nthat makes very clear where military detention is necessary: to allow \nintelligence gathering that will prevent future terrorist attacks \nagainst the American people.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nWartime Detention of Enemy Combatants--Including U.S. Citizens Who Join \n  the Forces of the Enemy--Is An Established Practice That Is Clearly \n                             Constitutional\n\n       Unfortunately, in almost every major war that the United \n     States has fought, there have been some U.S. citizens who \n     have joined the forces of our Nation's enemies or who have \n     otherwise collaborated with the enemy. These traitors and \n     collaborators have always been treated as enemy combatants--\n     and have been subjected to trial by military commission where \n     appropriate.\n       The U.S. Supreme Court has consistently held that the \n     President has the constitutional authority to detain enemy \n     combatants, including U.S. citizens who have cast their lot \n     with the enemy.\n       In its 2004 decision in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, for example, the \n     Supreme Court held that the detention of enemy combatants is \n     proper under the U.S. Constitution. Moreover, the person \n     challenging his military detention in that case was a U.S. \n     citizen.\n       During World War II, the Supreme Court also upheld the \n     military detention and trial of a U.S. citizen who had served \n     as a saboteur for Nazi Germany and was captured in the United \n     States. The Court made clear that ``[c]itizenship in the \n     United States of an enemy belligerent does not relieve him \n     from the consequences of a belligerency.'' That case is Ex \n     Parte Quirin (1942).\n       In support of her amendment number 1126, Senator Feinstein \n     yesterday cited a 1971 law, apparently arguing that the \n     detention of an enemy combatant who is a U.S. citizen would \n     be prohibited under that law.\n       That 1971 law is 18 U.S.C. 4001. It provides that ``no \n     citizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained by the \n     United States except pursuant to an Act of Congress.''\n       This is the very law that was at issue in the Hamdi case. \n     And the precise holding of the U.S. Supreme Court in Hamdi \n     was that the detention of a U.S. citizen as an enemy \n     combatant through the duration of hostilities would not \n     violate that law.\n       The Supreme Court stated: ``[Hamdi] posits that his \n     detention is forbidden by 18 U.S.C. Sec. 4001(a). Section \n     4001(a) states that `[n]o citizen shall be imprisoned or \n     otherwise detained by the United States except pursuant\n\n[[Page S8090]]\n\n     to an Act of Congress.' . . .  Congress passed Sec. 4001(a) \n     in 1971. . . . [The government maintains] Sec. 4001(a) is \n     satisfied because Hamdi is being detained pursuant to an Act \n     of Congress, the AUMF. . . . [W]e conclude that . . . the \n     AUMF satisfied Sec. 4001(a)'s requirement that a detention be \n     pursuant to an Act of Congress.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n Why Military Detention Is Necessary: To Allow Intelligence Gathering \n That Will Prevent Future Terrorist Attacks Against the American People\n\n       Some may ask, why does it matter whether a person who has \n     joined Al Qaeda is held in military custody or is placed in \n     the civilian court system? One critical reason is \n     intelligence gathering. A terrorist operative held in \n     military custody can be effectively interrogated. In the \n     civilian system, however, that same terrorist would be given \n     a lawyer, and the first thing that lawyer will tell his \n     client is, ``don't say anything. We can fight this.''\n       In military custody, by contrast, not only are there no \n     lawyers for terrorists. The indefinite nature of the \n     detention--it can last as long as the war continues--itself \n     creates conditions that allow effective interrogation. It \n     creates the relationship of dependency and trust that \n     experienced interrogators have made clear is critical to \n     persuading terrorist detainees to talk.\n       Navy Vice-Admiral Lowell Jacoby, who at the time was the \n     Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, explained how \n     military custody is critical to effective interrogation in a \n     declaration that he submitted in the Padilla litigation. He \n     emphasized that successful noncoercive interrogation takes \n     time--and it requires keeping the detainee away from lawyers.\n       Vice-Admiral Jacoby stated:\n       DIA's approach to interrogation is largely dependent upon \n     creating an atmosphere of dependency and trust between the \n     subject and the interrogator. Developing the kind of \n     relationship of trust and dependency necessary for effective \n     interrogations is a process that can take a significant \n     amount of time. There are numerous examples of situations \n     where interrogators have been unable to obtain valuable \n     intelligence from a subject until months, or, even years, \n     after the interrogation process began.\n       Anything that threatens the perceived dependency and trust \n     between the subject and interrogator directly threatens the \n     value of interrogation as an intelligence gathering tool. \n     Even seemingly minor interruptions can have profound \n     psychological impacts on the delicate subject-interrogator \n     relationship. Any insertion of counsel into the subject-\n     interrogator relationship, for example--even if only for a \n     limited duration or for a specific purpose--can undo months \n     of work and may permanently shut down the interrogation \n     process.\n       Specifically with regard to Jose Padilla, Vice Admiral \n     Jacoby also noted in his Declaration that: ``Providing \n     [Padilla] access to counsel now would create expectations by \n     Padilla that his ultimate release may be obtained through an \n     adversarial civil litigation process. This would break--\n     probably irreparably--the sense of dependency and trust that \n     the interrogators are attempting to create.''\n       In other words, military custody is critical to successful \n     interrogation. Once a terrorist detainee is transferred to \n     the civilian court system, the conditions for successful \n     interrogation are destroyed.\n       Preventing the detention of U.S. citizens who collaborate \n     with Al Qaeda would be a historic abandonment of the law of \n     war. And, by preventing effective interrogation of these \n     collaborators, it would likely have severe consequences for \n     our ability to prevent future terrorist attacks against the \n     American people.\n       We know from cold, hard experience that successful \n     interrogation is critical to uncovering information that will \n     prevent future attacks against civilians.\n       On September 6 of 2006, when President Bush announced the \n     transfer of 14 high-value terrorism detainees to Guantanamo, \n     he also described information that the United States had \n     obtained by interrogating these detainees. Abu Zubaydah was \n     captured by U.S. forces several months after the September 11 \n     attacks. Under interrogation, he revealed that Khalid Sheikh \n     Mohammed was the principal organizer of the September 11 \n     attacks. This is information that the United States did not \n     already know--and that we only obtained through the \n     successful military interrogation of Zubaydah.\n       Zubaydah also described a terrorist attack that Al Qaida \n     operatives were planning to launch inside this country--an \n     attack of which the United States had no previous knowledge. \n     Zubaydah described the operatives involved in this attack and \n     where they were located. This information allowed the United \n     States to capture these operatives--one while he was \n     traveling to the United States.\n       Again, just imagine what might have happened if the \n     Feinstein amendment had already been law, and if the Congress \n     had stripped away the executive branch's ability to hold Al \n     Qaeda collaborators in military custody and interrogate them. \n     We simply would not learn what that detainee knows--including \n     any knowledge that he may have of planned future terrorist \n     attacks.\n       Under military interrogation, Abu Zubaydah also revealed \n     the identity of another September 11 plotter, Ramzi bin al \n     Shibh, and provided information that led to his capture. U.S. \n     forces then interrogated bin al Shibh. Information that both \n     he and Zubaydah provided helped lead to the capture of Khalid \n     Sheikh Mohammed.\n       Under interrogation, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed provided \n     information that helped stop another planned terrorist attack \n     on the United States. K.S.M. also provided information that \n     led to the capture of a terrorist named Zubair. And K.S.M.'s \n     interrogation also led to the identification and capture of \n     an entire 17-member Jemaah Islamiya terrorist cell in \n     Southeast Asia.\n       Information obtained from interrogation of terrorists \n     detained by the United States also helped to stop a planned \n     truck-bomb attack on U.S. troops in Djibouti. Interrogation \n     helped stop a planned car-bomb attack on the U.S. embassy in \n     Pakistan. And it helped stop a plot to hijack passengers \n     planes and crash them into Heathrow airport in London.\n       As President Bush stated in his September 6, 2006 remarks, \n     ``[i]nformation from terrorists in CIA custody has played a \n     role in the capture or questioning of nearly every senior al \n     Qaida member or associate detained by the U.S. and its \n     allies.'' The President concluded by noting that Al Qaida \n     members subjected to interrogation by U.S. forces: ``have \n     painted a picture of al Qaeda's structure and financing, and \n     communications and logistics. They identified al Qaeda's \n     travel routes and safe havens, and explained how al Qaeda's \n     senior leadership communicates with its operatives in places \n     like Iraq. They provided information that . . . has allowed \n     us to make sense of documents and computer records that we \n     have seized in terrorist raids. They've identified voices in \n     recordings of intercepted calls, and helped us understand the \n     meaning of potentially critical terrorist communications.\n       [Were it not for information obtained through \n     interrogation], our intelligence community believes that al \n     Qaeda and its allies would have succeeded in launching \n     another attack against the American homeland. By giving us \n     information about terrorist plans we could not get anywhere \n     else, this [interrogation] program has saved innocent \n     lives.''\n       If the Feinstein amendment were adopted, this is all \n     information that we would be unable to obtain if the Al Qaeda \n     collaborator that our forces had captured was a U.S. citizen. \n     It would simply be impossible to effectively interrogate that \n     Al Qaeda collaborator--the relationship of trust and \n     dependency that military custody creates would be broken, and \n     the detainee would instead have a lawyer telling him to be \n     quiet. And we know that information obtained by interrogating \n     Al Qaeda detainees has been by far the most valuable source \n     of information for preventing future terrorist attacks.\n       Again, in every past war, our forces have had the ability \n     to capture, detain, and interrogate U.S. citizens who \n     collaborate with the enemy or join forces with the enemy. I \n     would submit that in this war, intelligence gathering is more \n     critical than ever. Al Qaeda doesn't hold territory that we \n     can capture. It operates completely outside the rules of war, \n     and directly targets innocent civilians. Our only effective \n     weapon against Al Qaeda is intelligence gathering. And the \n     Feinstein amendment threatens to take away that weapon--to \n     take away our best defense for preventing future terrorist \n     attacks against the American people.\n\n  Mr. KYL. I hope this statement clarifies in anyone's mind the point \nthat by taking people in custody in the past we have gathered essential \nintelligence to protect the American people. That is the reason for the \ndetention in the first place--A, to keep the American people safe from \nfurther attack by the individual, and, B, to gather this kind of \nintelligence. Nothing precludes the United States, the executive \nbranch, from thereafter deciding to try the individual as a criminal in \nthe criminal courts with all the attendant rights of a criminal. But \nuntil that determination, it cannot be denied that the executive has \nthe authority to hold people as military combatants, gather \nintelligence necessary, and hold that individual until the cessation of \nhostilities.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The senior Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I understand we are still in morning \nbusiness?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time for morning business has expired.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent I be recognized for another 5 \nminutes as in morning business, and the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois be recognized for 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, earlier this week, one of this bill's lead \nsponsors said here on the floor of the United States Senate that the \nbill's detention subtitle would authorize the indefinite detention of \nU.S. citizens at Guantanamo Bay. That is a stunning statement. We \nshould all pause to consider the ramifications of passing a bill\n\n[[Page S8091]]\n\ncontaining such language. Supporters of the detention provisions in the \nbill continue to argue that such measures are needed because, they \nclaim, ``we are a nation at war.'' That does not mean that we should be \na Nation without laws, or a Nation that does not adhere to the \nprinciples of our Constitution.\n  One of the provisions in this bill, Section 1032, runs directly \ncontrary to those principles. Section 1032 requires the military to \ndetain terrorism suspects, even those who might be captured on U.S. \nsoil. This provision is opposed by the very intelligence, military, and \nlaw enforcement officials who are entrusted with keeping our Nation \nsafe--including the Secretary of Defense, the Director of National \nIntelligence, the Attorney General, the Director of the FBI, and the \nPresident's top counterterrorism advisor. As Chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, I support the efforts of Senator Feinstein, the chair of the \nSenate Intelligence Committee, to modify Section 1032 so that it does \nnot interfere with ongoing counterterrorism efforts or undermine our \nconstitutional principles.\n  In the fight against al-Qaida and other terrorist threats, we should \ngive our intelligence, military, and law enforcement professionals all \nthe tools they need. But the mandatory military detention provision in \nSection 1032 actually limits those tools by tying the hands of the \nintelligence and law enforcement professionals who are fighting \nterrorism on the ground, and by creating operational confusion and \nuncertainty. This is unwise and unnecessary.\n  On Monday, Director Mueller warned that Section 1032 would adversely \naffect the Bureau's ability to continue ongoing international \ninvestigations. Secretary Panetta has also stated unequivocally that \n``[t]his provision restrains the Executive Branch's options to utilize, \nin a swift and flexible fashion, all the counterterrorism tools that \nare now legally available.'' These are not partisan objections, but \nrather the significant operational concerns voiced by the Secretary of \nDefense and the Director of the FBI--both of whom were confirmed by \nthis body with 100-0 votes. And yet these are the voices that \nsupporters of this bill would ignore.\n  Supporters of this bill have argued that the new national security \nwaiver and implementation procedures in this section provide the \nadministration with the flexibility it needs to fight terrorism. The \nintelligence and law enforcement officials who are actually responsible \nfor fighting terrorism and keeping our Nation safe, however, could not \ndisagree more. As Director Mueller stated in his letter, these \nprovisions are still problematic and ``fail to recognize the reality of \na counterterrorism investigation.'' Director of National Intelligence \nClapper has stated that ``the various detention provisions, even with \nthe proposed waivers, would introduce unnecessary rigidity'' in the \nintelligence gathering process. Put differently, Lisa Monaco, the \nAssistant Attorney General for the National Security Division, recently \nstated that ``agents and prosecutors should not have to spend their \ntime worrying about citizenship status and whether and how to get a \nwaiver signed by the Secretary of Defense in order to thwart an al-\nQaida plot against the homeland.''\n  We should listen to the intelligence and law enforcement \nprofessionals who are entrusted with our Nation's safety, and we should \nfix this flawed provision.\n  Senator Feinstein's amendment would ensure that the requirement of \nmilitary detention of terrorism suspects does not apply domestically. \nAs Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I am proud to be a cosponsor of \nthis amendment, and I urge all Senators to support its adoption.\n  I know Senator Durbin is next, but I now understand from Senator \nDurbin the distinguished Senator from Missouri is going next.\n  In any event, I yield the floor and thank my colleagues for their \ncourtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate for 10 minutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUNT. I appreciate my good friend from Illinois allowing me to \ngo ahead and talk about the Defense bill at this time, but doing it in \nthe context of where we are on the floor right now.\n  Mr. President, defending the country is the Congress's most important \nconstitutional responsibility. Abraham Lincoln said that government \nshould do for people only those things that people cannot better do for \nthemselves. If there is anything at the top of that list, this is at \nthe top of that list. So it is critical that we have this discussion, \nthat we pass this bill as soon as possible in order to give our men and \nwomen in uniform the tools they need to do their job and the certainty \nwe need to know how that job is going to be done from the point of view \nof what the Government can and needs to provide.\n  While this bill we are debating today is only about next year's \ndefense program, we should not lose sight of the fact that our budget \nenvironment is more challenging all the time and whether the automatic \nbudget cuts to future defense happen, we do know we are going to have \nto be more thoughtful, more cautious about how we get the most for our \ninvestment in defense. Everybody else in America has spent the last 20 \nyears figuring out how you focus on a better result from less \ninvestment, and defense is going to have to be there as well. Still, \nthat does not mean it is not a top priority for the Federal Government.\n  I appreciate the work my friends Senator Levin and Senator McCain \nhave done to get this bill to the floor. I am proud to represent a \nState that is involved in our national defense. Missouri is the home of \nFort Leonard Wood, of Whiteman Air Force Base, of the Marine Corps \nMobilization Command Center in Kansas City. We have dozens of National \nGuard and Reserve facilities in our State. Our State has 17,184 active-\nduty soldiers, marines, and airmen right now; 34,000 Guard and \nReservists.\n  We are the home of large and small defense contractors that provide \nthousands of jobs in our State. Those defense contractors can do their \nwork better and our defense dollars are better spent if we know what \nthe plan is. The only real way to know what the plan is is to have an \nauthorization bill that works.\n  Since the beginning of Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom, \n134 Missourians have given their lives and over a thousand have been \nwounded in the line of duty. In fact, one of the amendments I have that \nI hope finds its way into this bill is research associated with \nrehabilitating those wounded warriors who have eye injuries. Thousands \nof vision-related injuries have occurred as a result of the wars we are \nfighting now. Tremendous work is being done by St. John's Hospital and \nMissouri State University in Springfield to see what can be done to \ndevelop better ways to deal with those eye wounds. With IEDs as a \nprincipal tool of our opponents, our enemies in this war, your eyes are \nthe hardest thing ultimately to protect. Twelve percent of our wounded \nwarriors have eye wounds. Hopefully we can look to see what we can do \nto provide greater protection and greater recovery from those wounds.\n  I join all Missourians in thanking those who serve. I think all of us \nwill show greater commitment to those who serve by actually having a \nDefense authorization bill that sets out a plan for the future.\n  I am particularly pleased that this bill contains funding for \nmodifications of the B-2 bomber's mixed load capacity. Most of our \nStealth bombers operate out of Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri and \nwe discovered, as recently as the operation in Libya, that operations \nwith our B-2 bombers are not as efficient as they need to be or could \nbe, simply by making that loading capacity work differently. That is \nthe kind of thing we are going to have to do as we look at more \ndifficult-to-get defense dollars. We are going to have to figure out \nhow we spend those defense dollars in the best possible way. I hope the \nSenate language as it is in the bill now prevails in a final bill.\n  I also want to call attention to the bill's full authorization of the \ndevelopment of the next generation long-range strike bomber and I am \npleased with the funding in this bill for a vehicle maintenance \nfacility at Fort Leonard\n\n[[Page S8092]]\n\nWood and weapons storage at Whiteman.\n  I filed a few amendments to this bill and I will mention a couple of \nthem. One I am working on with Senator Gillibrand is an amendment to \nensure National Guard soldiers mobilized for domestic emergency \noperations are entitled to the same employment rights as others are \nwhen they come back. Senator Gillibrand and I also worked on a bill to \nensure that people in the Guard and Reserve, and their families, have \naccess to financial and marital and other kinds of counseling as they \ntry to put their other life back together.\n  I thank my colleagues for bringing this bill to the floor. We face a \nwide variety of threats today, including some that are new and \nconstantly evolving--cyber-warfare, WMD, all things that we need to \ntake seriously. This is a principal responsibility of the Federal \nGovernment. I am looking forward to seeing this bill passing the Senate \ntoday and then to work with the House to get a bill on the President's \ndesk so that all who are involved in the defense of the country know \nwhat the long-term plan is.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Missouri, and I \nconcur with his comments about our American military. We have the best \nin the world. These men and women serve us well with courage and honor \nevery day, and we are fortunate to have them. We are fortunate--those \nof us who enjoy the blessings of liberty and the safety of this \nNation--to have men and women willing to risk their lives for America.\n  This Defense authorization bill is a bill that authorizes the \ncontinued operations of our military, and every year we pass this bill, \nas we should, in a timely manner. I have supported it consistently over \nthe years with very few exceptions and believe the work product brought \nto us by Senators Levin and McCain is excellent, bipartisan, and moves \nus in a direction toward an even safer America, and I thank them for \nall the work they put into it.\n  There are provisions within this bill today which trouble me greatly. \nThere are provisions on which I hope Members of the Senate will \nreflect, one in particular that I will address at this time. Senator \nFeinstein is offering amendment No. 1125, which I am cosponsoring. I \nwould say this amendment raises a serious question about section 1032 \nin this bill. I am concerned this section would limit the flexibility \nof any President to fight terrorism. I am concerned it will create \nuncertainty for law enforcement, intelligence, and our military \nregarding how to handle suspected terrorists. I think it raises \nfundamental and serious constitutional concerns.\n  This provision, 1032, would, for the first time in the history of the \nUnited States, require our military to take custody of certain \nterrorism suspects in the United States. On its face, that doesn't \nsound offensive, but, in fact, it creates a world of problems. Where do \nwe start this debate?\n  We understand the responsibility of Congress in passing laws and the \nPresident with the option to sign those laws or veto them and the \ncourts with the responsibility to interpret them. When it comes to the \nprotection of this country in fighting terrorism, most of us have \nbelieved this is primarily an executive function under Presidents of \nboth political parties. We may disagree from time to time on the \nPATRIOT Act and other aspects of it and debate those issues, but, by \nand large, I think we have ceded to Presidents of both parties the \npower to protect America.\n  My colleague and friend, Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican of \nSouth Carolina, on September 19, 2007, stated--and he states things \nvery colorfully and clearly--\n\n       The last thing we need in any war is to have the ability of \n     535 people who are worried about the next election to be able \n     to micromanage how you fight the war. This is not only \n     micromanagement, this is a constitutional shift of power.\n\n  That was Senator Graham's statement in 2007. Although I would \ncarefully and jealously guard the constitutional responsibility of \nCongress when it comes to the declaration of war, even the waging of \nwar, I do believe there is a line we should honor. We should not stop \nour President and those who work for him in keeping America safe by \nsecond-guessing decisions to be made.\n  Today, again, on the Republican side of the aisle came colleagues who \nmake the argument that it is a serious mistake for us to take a \nsuspected terrorist and put them into our criminal justice system. They \nargue the last thing in the world we want to do is to take a suspected \nterrorist and read them their constitutional rights: the right to \nremain silent, everything you say can be used against you, the right to \ncounsel. They argue that is when terrorists will clam up and stop \ntalking. Therefore, they argue, suspected terrorists should be \ntransferred to military jurisdictions where Miranda rights will not be \nread. On its face it sounds like a reasonable conclusion. In fact, it \nis not. It is not.\n  Since 9/11, we have arrested and detained 300 suspected terrorists, \nread them their Miranda rights, and then went on to prosecute them \nsuccessfully and incarcerate them. They cooperated with the Federal \nBureau of Investigation, gave information, and in many cases gave \nvolumes of information even after having been read their rights. So to \nargue that it cannot be done or should not be done is to ignore the \nobvious. Three hundred times we have successfully prosecuted suspected \nterrorists, and America has remained safe for these 10 years-plus since \n9/11. How many have been prosecuted under military tribunals in that \nperiod of time? Six, and three have been released. We are keeping this \ncountry safe by giving to the President and those who work for the \nPresident in the military intelligence and law enforcement community \nthe option to decide the best course of action when it comes to \narresting, detaining, investigating, and prosecuting an individual.\n  Remember the man who was on the plane flying into Detroit a couple of \nyears ago? He tried to detonate a bomb on the plane. His clothing \ncaught fire, and the other passengers subdued him, restrained him. He \nwas arrested, investigated by the FBI, and read his Miranda rights. \nWithin a day his parents were brought over. The following day he \ndecided to cooperate with the United States and told us everything he \nknew. At the end of the day, he was prosecuted, brought to trial, and \npled guilty. He went through our regular criminal court system, though \nhe was not an American citizen, and he was successfully prosecuted. \nPresident Obama had the right to decide what best thing to do to keep \nAmerica safe, and he did it. Why would we want to tie his hands?\n  Now let me talk about this section 1032 and why it is a serious \nmistake. Section 1032 in this bill would for the first time in American \nhistory require the military to take custody of certain terrorism \nsuspects in the United States. From a practical point of view, it could \nbe a deadly mistake for us to require this. Listen to what was said by \nthe Justice Department in explaining why:\n\n       While the legislation proposes a waiver in certain \n     circumstances to address concerns, this proposal inserts \n     confusion and bureaucracy when FBI agents and \n     counterterrorism prosecutors are making split-second \n     decisions. In a rapidly developing situation--like that \n     involving Najibullah Zazi traveling to New York in September \n     of 2009 to bomb the subway system--they need to be completely \n     focused on incapacitating the terrorist suspect and gathering \n     critical intelligence about his plans.\n\n  Instead, this provision, 1032, written into this law, would require a \nhandoff of terrorism suspects to military authorities. So what does our \nmilitary think about this?\n  Well, the Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta made it abundantly clear \nwhen he said:\n\n       The failure of the revised text to clarify that section \n     1032 applies to individuals captured abroad, as we have \n     urged, may needlessly complicate efforts by frontline law \n     enforcement professionals to collect critical intelligence \n     concerning operations and activities within the United \n     States.\n\n  What we have seen, then, as our Secretary of Defense tells us, ceding \nto the military this authority could compromise America's security at a \ncritical moment when every second counts, when the gathering of \nintelligence could literally save not just a life but thousands of \nlives.\n  Senator Feinstein's amendment makes it clear--as the administration\n\n[[Page S8093]]\n\nwants to make it clear--that those terrorism suspects who are arrested \nabroad will be detained by the military. But within the United States \nwe are told by this administration this provision will jeopardize the \nsecurity of our country, will require a procedure now to hand off these \nindividuals to the military side in places where they could not \npossibly be handed off quickly or seamlessly.\n  We have 10,000 FBI agents dedicated to the security of this country \nwhen it comes to these national security issues and 56 different \noffices. We don't have anything near that capacity when it comes to the \nmilitary picking up the interrogation of an individual who may have \nknowledge that if we can glean it from that person could save thousands \nof lives.\n  Why in the world do we want to tie the hands of law enforcement? Why \ndo we want to tie the hands of the intelligence community? Why do we \nwant to create this situation of giving to the military this \nresponsibility when they are not prepared at this moment to take it?\n  I think Senator Feinstein is doing the right thing for the protection \nof this country. Her position is supported by the Attorney General, by \nthe Secretary of Defense, and by the intelligence community. They have \ndone a good job in keeping America safe. They have asked us: Please, do \nnot micromanage. Do not presume, do not create another hurdle for us \nwhen it comes to gathering information that can save lives in America.\n  Why would we do that? After more than 10 years of success and \navoiding another 9/11, let's not make the situation worse by this 1032, \nthis section of the bill that is being presented to us.\n  I know we will hear arguments on the Senate floor, well, there are \nopportunities for a waiver. So if a person is detained by the Federal \nBureau of Investigation and then it is determined that this is a \nsuspect who falls in the category and needs to go to military detention \nand then we need to turn to the executive side for a waiver of that \nmilitary detention, how much time will be lost? Will it be minutes, \nhours, days? Could we afford that if what is at stake is the potential \nloss of thousands of American lives? Why? Why make it more complex?\n  I cannot understand why the other side of the aisle is now so \ndetermined with this President to micromanage the defense of this \ncountry when it comes to terrorism. When it was a Republican President \nany suggestions along those lines were dismissed as unpatriotic and \nunwise and illogical. Now, under this President, everything is fair \ngame. They want to change the rules, rules which have successfully \nprotected the United States for more than 10 years.\n  I urge my colleagues to support Senator Feinstein's amendment No. \n1125 and amend this section 1032 and make sure that our Defense \nDepartment, military and law enforcement, as well as intelligence \ncommunity have the tools they need to continue to keep America safe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized to speak as in morning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when we return \nto the bill, which will be after Senator Cornyn speaks, we move \nimmediately to Feinstein amendment No. 1125, and that there be a 30-\nminute debate evenly divided and that the vote would occur immediately \nfollowing that.\n  I withdraw my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I want to talk about something that is all \ntoo rare, and that is bipartisan support for an important piece of \nlegislation that not only fulfills America's commitments to our ally, \nTaiwan, under the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, but it helps stabilize \na critical region of the world--that would be in Asia--and particularly \nthe growing tensions between Taiwan and China. It also creates jobs in \nAmerica by facilitating foreign military sales of things made here in \nAmerica, by Americans, that we are going to sell to people in other \ncountries--our friends in other countries--for cash and doesn't cost \ntaxpayers a penny.\n  My amendment No. 1200 is pending before the Senate, and I was pleased \nin introducing this amendment to be joined by several of my colleagues \non a bipartisan basis: Senator Menendez from New Jersey, Senator Inhofe \nfrom Oklahoma, Senator Lieberman from Connecticut, Senator Wyden from \nOregon, and Senator Blumenthal from Connecticut.\n  This amendment is straightforward and simple. It would require the \nPresident to carry out the sale of 66 F-16C/D aircraft to Taiwan. These \nare American-made fighters our Democratic ally in Taiwan has been \ntrying to purchase since 2007. As I said earlier, this is a win-win \namendment. It reflects the right national security policy, and it is \ngood for the American economy and jobs. We know Taiwan's Air Force \ncontinues to deteriorate.\n  First, let me just remind my colleagues what Taiwan is looking at in \nterms of the disparity in combat aircraft between Communist China and \nDemocratic Taiwan.\n  Communist China has roughly 2,300 operational combat aircraft. Our \nally and friend democratic Taiwan has 490 operational combat aircraft--\nobviously a growing imbalance in the Taiwan Strait. But that only tells \npart of the story because, as my colleagues also know, this chart \nindicates the incredible shrinkage of Taiwan's air force, that many of \nTaiwan's combat aircraft are F-5 aircraft which America has previously \nsold to Taiwan but which are now becoming older and more obsolete as \ntime goes by, as well as French Mirage 2000 aircraft. As this chart \nindicates, around roughly 2020, maybe even before, these aircraft are \ngoing to become completely obsolete, and we will see the huge cliff \nand, in fact, exacerbate the disparity between Communist China and our \ndemocratic ally Taiwan.\n  This F-16 sale would be an export-driven job machine for our country \nat a time when unemployment is at 9 percent and when the No. 1 issue on \nAmerica's agenda is job creation. People without jobs can't pay their \nmortgages, and they lose their homes due to foreclosure. Why in the \nworld, when this sale would support jobs in 32 different States and the \nDistrict of Columbia, would anyone object to this amendment? Indeed, as \nI indicated, I believe there is strong bipartisan support for it. This \nsale would support more than 60 job-years of employment and generate \nsome $8.7 billion in economic output. It would also generate $768 \nmillion in taxes for the Federal Government.\n  As I indicated, Taiwan's air force is facing a looming fighter \nshortfall. The fact is, this falls squarely in Congress's wheelhouse. \nThe Taiwan Relations Act that I referred to earlier was, in 1979, \nsigned by President Jimmy Carter with bipartisan support. It requires \nthe U.S. Government to provide Taiwan, our friend and ally, with the \ndefense articles necessary for them to defend themselves against \nCommunist Chinese aggression, and it instructs the President and the \nCongress to determine the nature and quantity of such defense articles \nbased on their judgment of the needs of Taiwan.\n  Forty-seven Democrats and Republicans in the Senate--almost half--\nhave signed a letter to the President of the United States supporting \nthis sale. In the House of Representatives, 181 Democrats and \nRepublicans have signed a letter to the President supporting this sale.\n  As my colleagues will recall, in September the Senate voted on an \namendment like this in the trade adjustment authority assistance bill, \nwhich ended up in a 48-to-48 tie. Although the bill had strong \nbipartisan support, some of my colleagues said they preferred not to \noffer that amendment on that particular legislative vehicle but said \nthat if I came back on an appropriate legislative vehicle, they would \nsupport it. And if there is a more appropriate legislative vehicle than \nthe Defense authorization bill, I hope someone will point that out to \nme. This is the appropriate vehicle. This is the appropriate time. This \nis the right thing to do for job creation in America. It is the right \nthing to do in terms of our national security and stability in Asia. \nThat is why I believe this is an appropriate time for us to take up \nthis amendment.\n\n[[Page S8094]]\n\n  I was advised by the Parliamentarian that my original amendment as \ndrafted would not be germane postcloture. However, in consultation with \nthe Parliamentarian, we have come up with a technical modification \nwhich essentially would strike what are called the findings that would \nsupport the need for the legislation. In essence, it strikes the A \nsection and the B section and leaves only the C section remaining. \nThis, of course, at this point in the proceedings would require \nunanimous consent.\n  In consultation with Senator McCain, the ranking member of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee, I am advised that our friends across the \naisle will not grant unanimous consent for us to modify what is really \na technical modification for this amendment so we can get a vote on it. \nI realize that at this point we are in morning business and it is not \nappropriate, perhaps, for me to ask unanimous consent, but I will ask \nunanimous consent at a later and appropriate time because I would like \nto get an explanation from the distinguished chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee as to why in the world there would be an objection \nto an amendment that enjoys such broad bipartisan support on a clearly \nappropriate legislative vehicle.\n  Madam President, I see the distinguished chairman on the floor. So I \nwould at this time, if it is appropriate, ask unanimous consent to \nmodify my pending amendment, to strike the findings under section A and \nunder section B, and to leave section C, which states in full:\n\n       Sale of aircraft. The President shall carry out the sale of \n     no fewer than 66 F-16 C and D multirole fighter aircraft to \n     Taiwan.\n\n  We have been advised by the Parliamentarian that this section is \nindeed germane and would be eligible for a vote with that modification. \nSo I ask unanimous consent to so modify my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, there is objection on this side, and I \nwill attempt to bring together Senator Cornyn and the objectors so he \ncan hear from them why they object, but in the meantime I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I am disappointed, but more than \ndisappointed, I look forward to that explanation. I hope there will be \nan opportunity to have a colloquy and a discussion here on the floor so \nthe American people can see why a piece of legislation that enjoys such \nbroad bipartisan support can't even get a vote.\n  When people watch what is happening in Washington these days, I think \nthey are tempted to avert their gaze because they ask the question of \nme--and I am sure, when the Presiding Officer is back in North \nCarolina, of her as well--why can't people get anything done? Well, it \nis because, unfortunately, of things like this. These are technical \nobjections that are not based on the substance or the merit of the \nlegislation.\n  I respect the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, who says \nthere is an objection on the Democratic side, and he personally is not \nmaking that objection but is on behalf of some unnamed other party. I \nhope that person will be named. I hope they will come to the floor. I \nhope they will explain to the American people and to our Democratic \nallies in Taiwan why it is they object to a vote on this amendment.\n  I believe that if we are able to get a vote on the Defense \nauthorization bill, this has a high likelihood of passage, and I think \nit would send a strong message to our friends and allies around the \nworld that, yes, you can count on your friend and ally, the United \nStates of America. Conversely, if we are thwarted in our attempt to try \nto get this amendment voted on and passed, then this will send a \ncountervailing message--that you cannot depend on America--and it will \nembolden bullies around the world.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

            Amendment No. 1125\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 30 \nminutes of debate on the Feinstein amendment.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, before we begin the debate, and with the \nSenator from California on the floor, for the benefit of our colleagues \nand the chairman, there are two pending Feinstein amendments, as I \nunderstand it. The Senator from California has agreed to the half hour \nequally divided as the chair just said, and then I understand the \nSenator from California has agreed to the second amendment at 4 p.m.; \nis that correct?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. So prior to that, I would ask my friend the chairman if \nwe could have an hour of debate starting at 3 o'clock equally divided \nbefore the vote at 4:00 on the second Feinstein amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, I just want to know if the \nSenator from California understands that\n\n[[Page S8096]]\n\nthe vote on the second Feinstein amendment would be at 4:00 and that \nthe debate would begin at 3:00, with that hour equally divided.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I do. I have a four corners meeting on the Energy and \nWater appropriations bill. That is my problem. So the later it is, the \nbetter it is for me.\n  Mr. LEVIN. So is a 4 o'clock vote after an hour of debate acceptable?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes. My understanding is the House chairman only has \nuntil 3 o'clock, but I anticipate we will take all that time. So I \ncan't change that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. So it is agreeable, then, that there will be an hour of \ndebate on the second amendment starting at 3 o'clock with a vote at 4 \no'clock?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I also ask unanimous consent that there be no second-\ndegree amendments to the Feinstein amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If we can then--obviously, we can call a vote at any \nparticular time. So I would suggest again that we try to dispose of \nother amendments after the vote on the first Feinstein amendment, and \nthen we will try to dispose of additional amendments between the \ndisposition of the first Feinstein amendment and the second one, with \nthe hour of debate equally divided, and Senator Feinstein can begin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise to ask my colleagues to \nsupport amendment No. 1125, which will limit mandatory military custody \nto terrorists captured outside the United States. This amendment is \ncosponsored by Senators Leahy, Durbin, Udall, Kirk, Lee, Harkin and \nWebb.\n  This is a very simple amendment. It adds only one word--the word \n``abroad''--to section 1032 of the underlying bill. I strongly believe \nif it is not broke, do not fix it. The ability to have maximum \nflexibility in the United States is very important, and I totally \nsupport the Executive having that flexibility.\n  This bill creates a presumption that members or parts of al-Qaida or \nassociated forces will be held in the military system. That is what \nconcerns me because the military system has not produced very well over \nthe last 10 years.\n  I want to take a moment to contrast some cases.\n  On this chart, we have sentences--five of them from military \ncommissions and five or six from Federal courts. The Federal courts \nhave actually convicted over the last 10, 11 years not 300 people but \n400 people.\n  Military commissions are limited to some six convictions. Let's take \na look at what they are.\n  A very famous one is Salim Hamdan because he brought a Supreme Court \ncase. He was bin Laden's driver. He was acquitted of conspiracy and \nonly convicted of material support for terrorism. He received a 5-month \nsentence by the military commission and was sent back to his home in \nYemen to serve the time before being released in January of 2009.\n  No. 2: David Hicks entered into a plea on material support for \nterrorism and was given a 9-month sentence, mostly served back home in \nAustralia.\n  Omar Khadr pled guilty in exchange of an 8-year sentence, but he will \nlikely be transferred to a Canadian prison.\n  Ibrahim Ahmed Mahmoud al-Qosi pled guilty to conspiracy and material \nsupport to terrorism. His final sentence was 2 years pursuant to a plea \ndeal.\n  Noor Uthman Muhammed pled guilty to conspiracy and material support \nto terrorism. His final sentence will be less than 3 years pursuant to \nhis plea agreement.\n  Ali Hamza al-Bahlul received a life sentence after he boycotted the \nentire commission process.\n  On the other hand, you have sentences from the Federal courts.\n  You have Richard Reid, the Shoe Bomber--life in prison.\n  ``Blind Sheik'' Omar Abdel Rahman--life in prison for the plot to \nbomb New York City.\n  Twentieth Hijacker Zacarias Moussaoui--life in prison.\n  Ramzi Yousef--life in prison for the 1993 World Trade Center bombing \nand the Manila Air plot.\n  Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab--probably life in prison; will be sentenced \nin January 2012.\n  Najibullah Zazi--potential life in prison. This is the man, with \nconspirators, who was going to bomb the New York subway.\n  There is definitive evidence that is irrefutable that the Federal \ncourts have done a much better job than the military commissions.\n  Why this constant press, that if it is not broke we are going to fix \nit anyway, I do not understand. Why the constant push to put people in \nmilitary custody rather than provide the flexibility so that evidence \ncan be evaluated quickly? This person will get life in a Federal court \nversus an inability or a problem in a military commission or vice \nversa. I think the Executive should have that.\n  I think the last 10 years have clearly shown that this country is \nsafer than it has ever been. Terrorists are behind bars where they \nbelong and plots have been thwarted, so the system is working.\n  This amendment would make clear that under section 1032, U.S. Armed \nForces are only required to hold a suspected terrorist in military \ncustody when he is captured abroad. All the amendment does is add one \nword--that is the word ``abroad''--to make clear that the military will \nnot be roaming our streets looking for suspected terrorists. The \namendment does not remove the President's ability to use the option of \nmilitary detention or prosecution inside the United States.\n  The administration has threatened to veto this bill, and has said:\n\n       [It] strongly objects to the military custody provision of \n     section 1032 [because it] would tie the hands of our \n     intelligence and law enforcement professionals.\n\n  Perhaps, most importantly, addressing the issue of this amendment \nspecifically, on November 15, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta wrote \nthis:\n\n       The failure of the revised text to clarify that section \n     1032 applies to individuals captured abroad . . . may \n     needlessly complicate efforts by frontline law enforcement \n     professionals to collect critical intelligence concerning \n     operations and activities within the United States.\n\n  The Director of National Intelligence, Jim Clapper, also wrote a \nletter on November 23, to say that he opposes the detainee provisions \nof this bill because they could--and I quote--``restrict the ability of \nour nation's intelligence professionals to acquire valuable \nintelligence and prevent future terrorist attacks.''\n  The administration suggested this change to the Armed Services \nCommittee, but it was rejected. So the administration has had to \nthreaten a veto on the bill. Who knows whether they will. I certainly \ndo not know. This amendment limiting mandatory military custody to \ndetainees outside the United States is a major improvement to the bill, \nand I ask my colleagues to support it.\n  I have a very hard time because I have watched detainees carefully as \npart of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and we are doing a study on \nthe detention and treatment of high-value detainees. This has been \ngoing on for 2 years now. It is going to be a 4,000-page document, and \nit is going to be classified. But it will document what was actually \ndone with each of the high-value detainees and what was learned from \nthem. It shows some very interesting things. But the upshot of all of \nthis is that we should keep military custody to people arrested abroad \nand have the wide option in this country, which is the case now, and \nnot mandate--mandate--that military custody and military commission \ntrial must be for everyone arrested in the United States.\n  You will hear that anyone who comes to the United States who carries \nout a criminal act, a terrorist act under the laws of war, should be \nsubject to military custody. The problem is, 10 years of experience has \nnot worked. How many years' experience do we need? How many sentences--\nsix cases--and this is all there is in 10 years.\n  I know the other side got very upset when Abdulmutallab was \nMirandized. The fact of the matter is, every belief is Abdulmutallab is \ngoing to do a life sentence in a Federal prison, put away somewhere in \na place where he cannot escape and where the treatment is very serious.\n\n[[Page S8097]]\n\n  I have, again, a hard time knowing why if it is not broke we need to \nfix it, and why we need to subject everybody who might be arrested in \nthis country to a record that is like this: 5-month sentence, 9-month \nsentence, 8-year sentence, 2-year sentence, 3 years pursuant to a plea \nagreement, and one life sentence, when you have 400 cases that have \nbeen disposed of in a prompt way in a Federal court, who are serving \nlong sentences in Federal prison.\n  I wish to hold the remainder of my time and have an opportunity to \nrespond to the distinguished chairman and ranking member.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I wish to yield----\n  Mr. LEVIN. Before the Senator yields time to the Senator----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator refrain for 1 minute? While Senator \nFeinstein is here, I understand it is now preferable from our leader \nthat the vote be at 2 o'clock, not immediately following this half-hour \ndebate.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If that is possible, that would be helpful. But it is \nwhatever Senators want.\n  OK. All right.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Does the Senator want to unanimous-consent that?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote, \nwhich was previously scheduled to occur at the end of the half hour of \ndebate on this amendment, now be rescheduled for 2 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, relative to the time between that half \nhour and 2 o'clock, that time, hopefully, would be used. It will be by \nme for my remarks on this amendment, by the way, because after the 30 \nminutes, if it is used totally, I would want an opportunity to speak \nduring that time, if necessary in morning business. But there are other \namendments we believe can be voice voted during that period of time, I \nbelieve my friend from Arizona would agree. So that time will be \nfruitfully used. But the time now is 2 o'clock for the vote on that \nfirst Feinstein amendment.\n  I thank my friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, the vote will be at 2 o'clock. The \nSenators from New Hampshire and South Carolina wish to speak. I do not \nknow if the chairman wishes to be before or during that or in between. \nBut, also, it does not change the agreement we have, which has not been \nagreed to but we have agreed we will attempt to have a vote on the \nsecond Feinstein amendment at 4 o'clock still. Is that correct? We will \nattempt to do that?\n  Mr. LEVIN. It will continue to be our intent. It was objected to \nbefore. But we hope that objection will be removed. If it is not \nremoved, we will have to have all these votes at the end of the day \ninstead of during the day.\n  Mr. McCAIN. So beginning at 3, whether we have a unanimous consent \nagreement--because the Feinstein amendment is very important--I would \nask, informally, if we do not have a unanimous consent agreement, that \nwe have an hour equally divided beginning at 3 so we can debate the \nsecond Feinstein amendment.\n  In the meantime, as the chairman said, we will try to dispense with \nvoice votes and other agreed-upon amendments, and perhaps even maybe a \nrecorded vote if necessary on one of the amendments.\n  I would remind my colleagues, we run out of time at 6 o'clock this \nevening, and we would rather do it in a measured fashion, allowing \nrecorded votes or debate before those recorded votes, because those \npending amendments will be voted on after 6 p.m. tonight.\n  I hope I did not say anything the chairman does not agree with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. No. I agree with what the Senator said and what the intent \nis here; that, hopefully, we could have an hour debate starting at 3 \no'clock. We will try to lock that in at a later time, after giving \nfolks notice. But if there is objection to votes before the time runs \nout, the 30-hour clock runs out, then we will have to have all those \nvotes after the 30-hour clock runs out, and it does not make any sense \nto do that. But if there is going to be an objection, then that is the \nway it will have to be.\n  What Senator McCain is saying--and I totally agree with him--is, even \nif we are put in that position, which I hope we are not, that at least \nwe could use the time between now and then for debate on those \namendments which we would have to vote on at a later time. I totally \nagree with my friend from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from \nNew Hampshire and 8 minutes to the Senator from South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Madam President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \noffered by the Senator from California, amendment No. 1125. I would \nstart with this: We have heard repeatedly--not only from the Senator \nfrom California but also from the Senator from Illinois--about the \nnumber of cases in our civilian system where we have tried terrorists \nversus the number of military commissions.\n  I think there is one thing that needs to be clarified upfront here; \nthat one of the first acts the President took when he came into office \nwas to actually suspend all military commissions for about 2 years. So \nto compare the number of cases in our civilian system versus the number \nof military commission trials we have had is a false comparison when we \nsuspended these trials for over 2 years. I want to say that upfront.\n  But I think the chart the Senator shows actually misses the point of \nwhy we have this amendment before us; that is, we need to gather \nintelligence. When we have captured a member of al-Qaida who is \nplanning an attack against the United States of America, the first goal \nhas to be, obviously, getting that person away from where he can \nthreaten us again to kill Americans, but also, just as importantly, to \ngather intelligence to protect America. The criminal justice system is \nset up to see that justice is served in a particular case, not to see \nthat we have the maximum tools in the hands of our intelligence \nofficials to gather information.\n  Yet it seems to me that if you look in the context of Senator \nFeinstein's amendment 1126 that we have already talked about on the \nfloor, she wants to limit the administration. The case law of our \nSupreme Court that is going back to World War II would take us before \n9/11. And heaven forbid if we had an American citizen who was one of \nthe participants in an incident such as we had occur on our soil on 9/\n11. Our military would not be permitted to hold that person and to \nquestion them to get the maximum amount of information and protect our \ncountry.\n  With respect to this amendment she has pending before the Senate, \n1125, I want to point out that the amendment would lead to a very \nabsurd result. Essentially what it would say is if you are a member of \nal-Qaida, planning or committing an attack against the United States of \nAmerica, a foreigner, and you make it to our soil, as the 9/11 \nconspirators did who committed that horrible attack on our country, \nthen you cannot be held in military custody. There is no mandatory \nmilitary custody under those circumstances. Yet we will hold you in \nmandatory military custody if you are found overseas. So, in other \nwords, please, their goal is unfortunately to come to the homeland, to \ncome to our country to attack us here, and in our country we need the \nauthority to, in the first instance--the presumption should be to hold \nthose individuals in military custody so that we are not reading them \nMiranda rights. To tell a terrorist: You have the right to remain \nsilent is counter to what we need to do to protect Americans and make \nsure that--for example, I will use the Christmas Day Bomber as an \nexample because it has been cited so many times here on this floor.\n  That day, when he was found on the plane, after 50 minutes of \nquestioning, he was read his Miranda rights and he invoked his Miranda \nrights and remained silent. It was only 5 weeks later after we tracked \ndown his parents and convinced him to cooperate that he actually \nprovided more information.\n\n[[Page S8098]]\n\n  We are very fortunate that he was only involved in one event, that it \nwas not a 9/11-type event where there were multiple events on American \nsoil planned. But what if after that 50 minutes we waited 5 weeks to \nget more information, yet there had been more events coming that day? \nThat is what is at issue here. Let's bring ourselves back to September \n11. What if we had caught the individuals who were on one of those \nplanes before it took off on 9/11? What if in that instance we would \nnot hold those members of al-Qaida in military custody that instant to \nmake sure that we could get the maximum amount of information from them \nto hopefully, God forbid, prevent the lifting off of the other flights \nand what happened on that horrible day in our country's history?\n  I have to believe that if we were standing here immediately after the \nevents of 9/11, I do not think we would be debating this amendment, \ndeciding whether if you make it to our homeland we will not hold you in \nmilitary custody in the first instance, to find out how much \ninformation you have, to make sure you are not part of multiple attacks \non the United States of America.\n  If the amendment of the Senator from California passes, what kind of \nmessage are we sending to members of al-Qaida, foreigners who are \nplanning attacks against the United States of America? We are laying \nout, unfortunately in my view, a welcome mat to say: If you make to it \nAmerica, you will not be held in military custody. But if you attack us \noverseas, then you will be held in military custody. Why would we \ncreate a dual standard where we should be prioritizing protecting our \nhomeland, protecting the United States of America? This leads to an \nabsurd result.\n  I would hope my colleagues would reject the Senator's amendment to \nsay that only those members of al-Qaida who do not make it to our \nhomeland to attack us right here on our soil will be held in the first \ninstance in mandatory military custody. Because our goal has to be here \nto protect Americans and to make sure we do not create a dual standard \nwhere if you are captured over there, we are going to hold you in \nmilitary custody, but if you are captured and if you make it here, you \nare going to be getting greater rights, we will process you in the \ncivilian system, and we will tell you you have the right to remain \nsilent. We should not be telling terrorists they have the right to \nremain silent. We should be protecting Americans. If we were to pass \nthis amendment, it would create an absurd standard where you get \ngreater rights when are you here on our soil. I think that makes us \nless safe.\n  I would urge my colleagues to reject both of the Senator's \namendments, both 1126 that would deny the executive branch the \nauthority to hold them----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 seconds \nto wrap up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Madam President, I would ask my colleagues to reject 1126 \nas well, which would take away the authority of the executive branch as \nallowed by our Supreme Court and would make us less safe in this \ncountry as well as 1125. We have to protect America and make sure we \nget the maximum information to prevent future attacks on this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes remaining of the \noriginal 30 minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Not on my time. On the Senator's time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. On my time. Quick question. After the 30 minutes expires, \nbecause we are not going to have a vote now, there would be additional \ntime should the Senator need it after that 30 minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I appreciate it. I may well use it.\n  Madam President, I object to the statement just made that this will \nmake the United States of American less safe. Ten years of experience \nhas shown it has not. Plot after plot after plot has been interrupted. \nI have served on the Intelligence Committee for 11 years now. We follow \nthis closely. This country is much more safe because things have \nfinally come together with the process that is working.\n  The FBI has a national security division with 10,000 people. There \nare 56 FBI offices. The military does not have offices to make arrests \naround this country. This constant push that everything has to be \nmilitarized--they were wrong on Hamdi, they were wrong on Hamdan. And \nit keeps going. And that it is terrible to protect people's rights. I \ndo not think that creates a safe country. This country is special \nbecause we have certain values, and due process of law is one of those \nvalues. So I object. I object to holding American citizens without \ntrial. I do not believe that makes us more safe. I object to saying \nthat everything is mandatory military commission and military custody \nif anyone from abroad commits a crime in this country. The \nadministration has used the flexibility in a way that they have won \nevery single time. There have been no failures.\n  The Bush administration as well used the Federal courts without \nfailure. They have gotten convictions. The military commissions have \nfailed, essentially; 6 cases over 10, 11 years. I pointed out the \nsentences. So to say that what we are doing is to make this country \nless safe may be good for a 30-second sound bite, but it is not the \ntruth.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I say to my good friend from California, you are a \npatriot. You are here for all of the right reasons. We just have a \nstrong disagreement about where we stand as a nation.\n  Nobody interrupted the Christmas Day Bomber plot. The people on the \nplane attacked the guy before he could blow it up. There was no FBI \nagent there. There was no CIA agent there. We are lucky, thank God, the \npassengers did it. So there is nothing to suggest that our intelligence \ncommunity does not need as many tools as possible because the guy got \nthrough the system. We are lucky as hell the bomb did not go off.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The Times Square Bomber, nobody interrupted that plot. \nThe guy did not know how to set the bomb off. We are lucky as hell the \nbomb did not go off. So do not stand here and tell me that we have got \nit right, because we have not. And here is the point: We never will \nalways get it right. I am not saying that as criticism. Because we are \ngoing to get hit again. We cannot be right and lucky all of the time.\n  To those who are trying to defend us, the one thing I do not want to \ndo is micromanage the war. Here is the political dynamic. You have got \npeople on the left who hate the idea of saying ``the war on terror.'' \nIf you left it up to them, they would never, ever use the military, \nthey would always insist that the law enforcement model be used because \nthey do not buy into the idea of we are at war. So you have got one \npart of the country, a minority, that wants to criminalize the war. If \nwe ever go down that road, woe be unto us.\n  You have got people on my side--the Senator is right about this. They \nhave gone the other way. If you left it up to people on my side, there \nwould be a law passed tomorrow that you could never, ever read a \nMiranda right to a terrorist caught anywhere in the United States.\n  I do not agree with that way of thinking. To my fellow members of the \nU.S. military, you have not failed at Guantanamo Bay. You have not \nfailed. Because you sentenced someone to 9 months to me validated the \nfact that those who are taking an oath to defend us, when they are put \nin a position of passing judgment on people accused of trying to kill \nus all, will be fair.\n  So when you say a military commission tribunal at Guantanamo Bay gave \na 9-month sentence and that is a failure, I say, as a proud member of \nthe military, I am proud of the fact that you can judge a case based on \nthe facts and the law and not emotion. So I am very proud of the fact \nthat military commissions can do their job as well as the civilian \ncourts.\n\n[[Page S8099]]\n\n  I say to our Federal prosecutors and our Federal juries and our \nFederal judges, I am proud of you too. We should be using an ``all of \nthe above'' approach. There are times that Federal courts are better \nthan military commissions. There are times that military commissions \nare better than Federal courts.\n  The 1032 language has nothing to do about what venue you choose. This \nprovision is simple in its concept. It is a compromise between those on \nthe left who say you must criminalize this war; we are not at war; you \nare going to have to use the law enforcement model; you can neither \ngather military intelligence, who do not believe that the military has \na role on the homeland to gather intelligence, which is an absurd \nconcept, never acknowledged before in any other war.\n  When American citizens helped the Nazis, collaborated with Nazis to \nengage in sabotage, not only were they held as enemy combatants during \nWorld War II, they were tried by military commissions. We no longer \nallow American citizens to be tried by military commissions. I think \nthat is a reasoned decision. But what we do not want to do is prevent \nour intelligence community from holding an al-Qaida affiliated member \nand gathering intelligence.\n  If an American citizen went to Pakistan and got radicalized in a \nmadrasah and came back to the United States and landed at Dulles \nAirport and got a rifle and started shooting everyone on the Mall, I \nbelieve it is in our national security interests to give our \nintelligence community the ability to hold that person and gather \nintelligence about: Is another guy coming? What did you do? What future \nthreats do we face? And not automatically Mirandize him. But if they \nchoose to Mirandize him, they can. In this legislation, we presume \nmilitary custody, but it can be waived.\n  That is the point I am trying to make. Senators Levin and McCain have \nstruck a balance between one group that thinks the military can only be \nused and nobody else and another group that says we can never use the \nmilitary. We have that balance. If we upset this balance, we are going \nto make us not only less safe, the Congress is going to do things on \nour watch that we have never done in any other war.\n  A word of warning to my colleagues: If we had a bill on the floor of \nthe Senate saying we are not going to read Miranda rights to terrorists \nwho are trying to kill us all, 70 percent of the American people would \nsay: Heck yes.\n  I don't want this bill to come up. I believe the people who are best \nable to judge what to do is not any politician, they are the experts in \nthe field fighting this war. We are saying we can waive the presumption \nof military custody, we can write the rules to waive it, but we believe \nwe should start with that construct.\n  Let me read to you what the general counsel for the Department of \nDefense said today:\n\n       Top national security lawyers in the Obama administration \n     say U.S. citizens are legitimate military targets when they \n     take up arms with al-Qaida. The government lawyers, CIA \n     counsel Stephen Preston, and Pentagon counsel Jeh Johnson, \n     did not address the Awlaki case. But they said U.S. citizens \n     don't have immunity when they are at war with the United \n     States.\n\n  The President of the United States was right to target this citizen \nwhen he went to Yemen to help al-Qaida. I am glad we took him out. So \nwould it not be absurd that we can kill him, but we cannot detain him? \nIf he came here, we cannot question him for military intelligence \ngathering. So this is a compromise between two forces that are well \nintended but will take us into a bad policy position: the hard left who \nwants to say the military has no role in protecting us on the homeland \nand some people on my side who say the law enforcement community cannot \nbe involved at all.\n  So Senator Levin and Senator McCain have constructed a concept that \nprovides maximum flexibility, gives guidance to the law enforcement \ncommunity, starts with a presumption that I like and can be waived and \nwill not impede an ongoing investigation. That is the part of the bill \nthat was changed.\n  To my good friend from California, we have the balance we have been \nseeking for 5 years. To me, this is what we should be doing as a \nnation--creating legislation that allows those who are fighting the war \nthe tools they need. In this case, we start with the presumption of \nmilitary custody because that allows us to gather intelligence. Under \nthe domestic criminal law, we cannot hold someone and ask them about \nfuture attacks, because we are investigating a crime. Under military \nlaw, when somebody joins the enemy and engages in an act of war against \nthe Nation, our military intelligence community can hold that person \nfor as long as it takes to find out what they know about future \nattacks. If the guy gets off of plane and starts killing people at the \nmall, when we grab him and he says I want my lawyer, we can say: You \nare not entitled to a lawyer. We are trying to gather intelligence.\n  At the end of the day, use military commission trials, use Federal \ncourts, and read Miranda rights when we think it makes sense; but we \ndon't have to because the law allows us to hold people, under military \ncustody, who represent a military threat. The law allows us to kill \nAmerican citizens who have joined al-Qaida abroad. That has been the \nlaw for decades. I hope this compromise that Carl Levin and John McCain \nhave crafted--and I say to Carl Levin, I have been in his shoes. When \nJohn and I were on the floor saying don't waterboard people--gather \nintelligence but don't become like the enemy--a lot of Americans \nbelieved we should waterboard these people, do whatever we need to do \nbecause they are so vicious and hateful. But John McCain knows better \nthan anybody in this body what it is like to be tortured.\n  I wish to protect America without changing who we are. It has always \nbeen the law that when an American citizen takes up arms and joins the \nenemy, that is not a criminal act; that is an act of war. They can be \nheld and interrogated about what they did and what they know because \nthat keeps us safe. If we take that off the table, with homegrown \nterrorism becoming the greatest threat we face, we will have done \nsomething no other Congress has done in any other war.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The original 30 minutes has expired.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I thank Senators Levin and McCain for \ndrafting a compromise that I think speaks to the best of this country. \nTo my colleagues, please don't upset this delicate balance. If you do, \nyou will open a Pandora's box.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I say to both Senators while they are on \nthe floor, if it had not been for their invaluable effort, this \nlegislation would not have come about. I thank them for their \nincredibly important contributions, using the benefit of the experience \nthat both Members have.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I wonder if I might take a few \nminutes to make a couple statements.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I wished to say with respect to \nAbdulmutallab, what was very new there was that an explosive had been \ninvented that could go through a magnetometer without detection. It is, \nto my knowledge, the first time anyone came into the United States--\nthis young Nigerian from a very prominent Nigerian family--wearing a \ndiaper that had enough of this PETN, this new explosive, to blow up the \nplane. He missed in detonation and it caught on fire and the fire was \nput out.\n  There have been other incidents of trying to smuggle this PETN in \ncartridges of computers and they even had dogs going to the airport and \nthey could not smell the explosive inside the computer cartridge. That \nwas in Dubai. It is a very dangerous explosive. It is new, and it has \nbeen improved. It is something we need to be very wary of.\n  I also wish to point out that there is a public safety exception to \nMiranda. We do not have to Mirandize someone or we could continue to \nquestion them, if there is a public safety risk. So Mirandizing an \nindividual is not a point in this argument, in my view, because we can \ncontinue the interrogation.\n\n[[Page S8100]]\n\n  What is a point, in my argument, is that the FBI now has competence; \nthat there is a group of special experts who can be flown to a place \nwhere someone is arrested and do initial interrogation. They are \nspecifically trained and, to the best of my knowledge, they are \neffective at interrogating. My point is, the system is working, and we \nshould keep it as it is.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. While Senator Graham is on the floor, I ask unanimous \nconsent to have a colloquy with him about this section 1032, the \nsection at issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I very much appreciate Senator Graham's remarks. He said \nthe provision provides for military custody as a beginning or starting \npoint. I wonder whether he would agree that not only is it a beginning \npoint, but it is only for a narrow group of people who are determined \nto be al-Qaida or their supporters.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes. It is not only a presumption that can be waived, \nbased on what the experts in the field think is necessary; the waiver \nprovision is incredibly flexible. You do not have to stop an \ninterrogation to get the waiver. The executive branch can write the \nprocedures. Not only is it a presumption that can be waived, it is also \nlimited to a very narrow class of people. It has nothing to do with \nsomebody buying gold. I don't know about Senator Levin, but people call \nme, who are on the right, saying: Don't let Obama put me in jail \nbecause I think he is a socialist or are you going to be able to grab \nme because of my political views? I tell my staff to be respectful and \nread them the language. The only people who need to worry about this \nprovision are a very narrow group of people who are affiliated with al-\nQaida, engaged in hostile acts.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Would the Senator also agree with me that under the \nprovision in the bill, on page 360--we were told that civilian trials \nare preferable to military trials, preferable to the detention of an \nunlawful combatant. Does the Senator agree that every one of those \noptions is open to the executive branch and that there is no preference \nstated, one way or the other, for which approach is taken to people who \nare detained?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Not only would I agree that 1032 and 1031--the compromise \nlanguage about statement of authority to detain and military detaining \nas a presumption--has nothing to do with the choice of venue, there are \npeople on my side who are champing at the bit to prohibit civilian \ncourts from being used in al-Qaida-driven cases; is the Senator \nfamiliar with that?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Yes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I am of the view that we are overly criminalizing the \nwar. I don't want to adopt that policy. There is nothing in this \nlanguage that has anything at all to do with how you try somebody and \nwhat venue you pick. I am in the camp--and I think Senator Levin is \ntoo--of an all-of-the-above approach. I am proud of our civilian courts \nand our military courts. The Senator and I are probably not in the best \nposition to determine that. Let's let the experts do it.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is exactly the point. This language, when it is \ndescribed as language that says somehow or other it works against using \ncivilian courts, is from folks who haven't read our language. The \nlanguage is explicit. On page 360, lines 3 through 14 in the bill, it \nsays the disposition of a person under the law of war may include the \nfollowing--and then they talk about detention under the law of war, \ntrial under title X, which is the military trial, transfer for trial by \nan alternative court or competent tribunal having lawful jurisdiction; \nthat is, article III courts, and transfer or return of custody to the \ncountry of origin. There are no others. There is no preference stated \nfor which of those venues would be selected by the executive branch.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Is this a fair statement: If it was your goal to prevent \nmilitary commissions from ever being used, you didn't get your way in \nthis legislation. If it was your goal to mandate that military \ncommissions are the only venue to be used, you didn't get your way in \nthis legislation because this legislation doesn't speak to that issue \nat all.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is absolutely true. Senator Graham brought to the \nfloor something that was stated this morning by the top lawyer for the \nObama administration. I think everybody ought to listen to this. There \nhas been so much confusion about what is in the bill and what isn't. \nRight now, there is authority to detain U.S. citizens as enemy \ncombatants. That authority exists right now. That is not me saying it, \nthat is the Supreme Court that has said it as recently as Hamdi, when \nthey said there is no bar to this Nation holding one of its own \ncitizens as an enemy combatant. That is current law. That is the \nSupreme Court saying that. Then, the Supreme Court also said in Hamdi \nthat they see no reason for drawing a line because a citizen, no less \nthan an alien, can be part of supporting forces hostile to the United \nStates or coalition partners and engaged in armed conflict against the \nUnited States.\n  Top lawyers for the President, this morning, acknowledged this. I \nwish every one of our colleagues could hear what Senator Graham brought \nto the floor. Top national security lawyers in the administration say \nU.S. citizens are legitimate military targets when they take up arms \nwith al-Qaida.\n  Are we then going to adopt an amendment that says to al-Qaida that if \nyou attack us overseas, you are subject to military detention; but if \nyou come here and attack us, you are not subject to military \ndetention? That is what the first Feinstein amendment says.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. If I may just add--not only is that the effect, that \nwould be a change in law because the Senator agrees with me that in \nother conflicts, prior to the one we are in today, American citizens, \nunfortunately, have been involved in aiding the enemy; is that correct?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am sorry, I was distracted.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Does the Senator agree with me that in prior wars \nAmerican citizens have been involved in aiding the enemy of their time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. They have, and they have been held accountable.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes. And the In re Quirin case, which Hamdi cited and \naffirmed, was a fact pattern that went as follows: We had German \nsaboteurs, some living in America before they went back to Germany--I \nthink one or two may have been an American citizen--who landed on our \nshores with a plot to blow up different parts of America. During the \ncourse of their efforts, American citizens aided the Nazis. The Supreme \nCourt said when an American citizen chose to help the Nazis at home, on \nour homeland, they were considered to be an enemy belligerent \nregardless of their citizenship, and we could detain one of our own \nwhen they sided with the enemy.\n  Mr. LEVIN. There was a naturalized citizen involved in Quirin, who \nwas arrested, as I understand it, on Long Island, and who was charged \nwith crimes involving aiding and supporting the enemy.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Let's talk about the world in which we live today.\n  Mr. LEVIN. And military detention.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Military detention and tried by a military commission.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Exactly. By the way, I think executed.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. And executed. The Senator from Michigan and I have said, \nalong with our colleagues, that military commissions cannot be used to \ntry American citizens.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Our military has said they do not want that authority. \nThey want to deal with enemy combatants when it comes to military \ncommission trials. But our military CI and FBI have all understood \ntheir power to detain for intelligence-gathering purposes is an \nimportant power. It is not an exclusive power.\n  So let's talk about today's threat. The likelihood of homegrown \nterrorism is growing. Does the Senator agree that the homegrown \nterrorist is becoming a bigger problem?\n  Mr. LEVIN. It is an issue, absolutely.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. So in a situation where an American citizen goes to \nPakistan and gets radicalized in a madrasah, gets on a plane and flies \nback to Dulles Airport, gets off the plane and takes up arms against \nhis fellow citizens, then goes to the mall\n\n[[Page S8101]]\n\nand starts randomly shooting people, the law we are trying to preserve \nis current law, which would say if the experts decide it is in the \nNation's best interests, they can hold that American citizen as they \nwere able to hold the American citizen helping the Nazis and gather \nintelligence.\n  That is a right already given. Senator Feinstein's amendment, even \nthough I don't think it is well written, could possibly take that away. \nThat is 1031. But what we are saying is, we want to preserve the \nability of the intelligence community to hold that person under the law \nof war and find out: Is anybody else coming? Are you the only one \ncoming? What do you know? What madrasah did you go to? How did you get \nover? How did you get back?\n  We want to preserve their ability to hold that person under the law \nof war for interrogation. But we also concede, if they think it is \nbetter to give them their Miranda rights, they can. That is what the \nlegislation we create will do. Does the Senator agree with that?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I do. And the top lawyers of the administration \nacknowledged as much this morning when they said U.S. citizens are \nlegitimate military targets when they take up arms with al-Qaida.\n  The provisions we are talking about in section 1032, which Senator \nFeinstein would modify so that it is only al-Qaida abroad who would be \nsubject to this presumption of a military detention, but al-Qaida who \ncome here--and, by the way, American citizens are not even covered \nunder 1032. But the foreign al-Qaida fighters who come here to attack \nus are not going to be subject to that presumption of military \ndetention which, again, can be waived. It has nothing to do with in \nwhat venue they are tried. The administration, the Executive, has total \nchoice on that. It is just whether we are going to start with an \nassumption if they are determined to be al-Qaida, if they are a foreign \nal-Qaida person, they sure as heck ought to be subject to that same \nassumption whether they attack us here or whether they attack us \noverseas.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Wouldn't it be kind of hard to explain to our \nconstituents that our top lawyers in the Pentagon and CIA said today \nthat once an American citizen decides to help al-Qaida they can be \nkilled in a drone attack, but the Congress somehow says, OK, but they \ncan't be detained?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wouldn't want to try to hold that position.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Does the Senator believe America is part of the \nbattlefield in our global war on terror?\n  Mr. LEVIN. It has been made part of the battlefield without any \ndoubt. On September 11, the war was brought here by al-Qaida. How do we \nsuggest that a foreign al-Qaida member should not be subject to an \nassumption to begin with, if they are determined to be al-Qaida, that \nthey are going to be detained--that we should not start with that \nassumption--subject to procedures which the administration adopts. It \nis totally in their hands. It cannot interfere with a civilian \ninterrogation. It cannot interfere with civilian intelligence. We are \nvery specific about it. The procedures are written by the executive \nbranch. They can try them anywhere they want.\n  But if they bring a war here--they bring a war here--we are going to \ncreate an assumption that they can be subject, and are going to be \nsubject, to military detention.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Well, my belief is that most Americans would want our \nmilitary being able to combat al-Qaida at home as much as they would \nabroad. I think most Americans would be very upset to hear that the \nmilitary has no real role in combatting al-Qaida on our own shore, but \nwe can do anything we want to them overseas.\n  Frankly, there are very good people on our side who want to mandate \nthat the military has custody, and no one else, so we never have to \nread Miranda rights. Quite frankly, there are people on the left, \nlibertarians, well-meaning people, who want to prevent the idea of a \nperson being held under military custody in the homeland because they \ndo not think we are at war and this is really not the battlefield.\n  What the Senator and I have done is to start with the presumption \nthat focuses on intelligence gathering because the Senator and I are \nmore worried about what they know about future attacks than how we are \ngoing to prosecute them.\n  Under domestic criminal law, we can't hold someone indefinitely. The \npublic safety law I will talk about in a bit, but I say to my good \nfriend from California, the public safety exception was a very \ntemporary ability to secure a crime scene. It was not written regarding \nterrorism. So our law enforcement officials cannot use the public \nsafety exception to hold an al-Qaida operative for days and question \nthem. The only way to do that legally is under the law of war. In every \nother war we have had that right, and we are about to change that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If I can interrupt, we have that right abroad against \nmembers of al-Qaida. But under this approach we would not be able to \nassume that military detention at home, again, subject to waiver and \nsubject to all the other protections we have.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Right. Well, let's keep talking about it because the more \nwe talk about it the more interesting the whole concept becomes.\n  The last time I looked, there were no civilian jails overseas. So \nwhen we capture a terrorist overseas, the only place we can detain them \nis in military custody. If they make it at home to say the military \ncan't hold a person and interrogate them under the law of war, the only \nway we can hold an al-Qaida operative who made it to America is under \nthe law enforcement model. This is not ``Dragnet.'' We are trying to \nmake sure both systems are preserved, starting with the presumption of \nintelligence gathering.\n\n  Here is the key distinction. To my colleagues who worry about how we \nprosecute someone, that is really the least of my concerns. I am \nworried about intelligence gathering. I have confidence in our civilian \nsystem and confidence in our military system. But shouldn't we be \nconcerned, most of all, Senator Levin, that when we capture one of \nthese operatives on our shores or abroad that we hold them in a humane \nfashion but a fashion to gather intelligence?\n  Imagine if we got one of the 9/11 hijackers. Wouldn't it have been \nnice to have been able to find out if there was another plane coming \nand hold them as long as necessary to get that information humanely? To \nsay we can't do that makes us a lot less safe.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We could do that if we captured them in Afghanistan, but \nhere we are going to be treating them differently. It ought to probably \nbe worse. In other words, people who bring the war here, it seems to \nme, at a minimum ought to be subject to the same rules of interrogation \nas they would be if they were captured and part of al-Qaida in \nAfghanistan.\n  I don't understand the theory behind this. As a matter of fact, when \nwe adopted the authorization for use of military force, it would seem \nto me the first people we would want to apply the authority of that \nauthorization to would be al-Qaida members who attack this country.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. That is the only group subject to this provision; is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. LEVIN. The only group that is protected.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. But this provision we wrote only deals with that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Exactly.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. No one is going to be put in jail because they disagree \nwith Lindsey Graham or Barack Obama. We are trying to fight a war.\n  I would say something even more basic. It is in my political \ninterest, quite frankly, being from South Carolina--a very conservative \nState, great people--to be able to go home and say I supported \nlegislation to make sure these terrorists trying to come here and kill \nus never hear the words ``you have the right to remain silent.'' Most \npeople would cheer.\n  It would have been in my interest years ago, quite frankly, to have \ngone back and said: You know what. I wish the worst thing that could \nhappen to our guys caught by these thugs and barbarians is that they \nwould get waterboarded. They get their heads cut off. Yet we have all \nthese people worried about how we treat them in trying to find out a \nway to protect the country. That would be in my political interest, and \nI am sure it would probably be in your political interest to say: Wait \na minute, we don't want to militarize this conflict.\n  At the end of the day, what I wanted to say about the Senator and \nSenator\n\n[[Page S8102]]\n\nMcCain is that one of you is a warrior who has experienced worse than \nwaterboarding and doesn't want that to be part of his country's way of \ndoing business. The other is someone who has been a very progressive, \nsolid, left-of-center Senator for years. I am a military lawyer who \ncomes from a very conservative State, but I want to fight this war--I \ndon't believe we are fighting a crime--but I want to fight it in a way \nthat doesn't come back to haunt us. I don't want to create a system on \nour watch that could come back and haunt our own people. I don't want \nto say that every enemy prisoner in this war has to go to trial because \nwhat if one of our guys is captured in a future war? Do we want them to \nbe considered a war criminal just because they were fighting for the \nUnited States?\n  So what we are trying to do is to create policy that is as flexible \nas possible but understands the difference between fighting a war and \nfighting a crime.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I understand there are other Senators who \nmay be coming over to speak, and I will be happy to yield the floor \nwhenever that happens because this is the time which is not structured \nbefore the scheduled vote at 2 p.m. But if I can continue, then, until \nanother Senator comes to the floor, I want to just expand on this one \npoint which has been made which has to do with whether there is \nsomething in this section of ours that would allow our military to \npatrol our streets. We have heard that.\n  Well, we have a posse comitatus law in this country. That law \nembodies a very fundamental principle that our military does not patrol \nour streets. There is nothing in section 1032 or anywhere else in this \nbill that would permit our military to patrol our streets.\n  I think Senator Graham is probably more familiar with what I am going \nto say than perhaps any of our colleagues. We have a posse comitatus \nstatute in this country. It makes it a crime for the military to \nexecute law enforcement functions inside the United States.\n  That is unchanged. That law is unchanged by anything in this bill.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Does the Senator know why that law was created?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I think we had a fear a couple hundred years ago that that \nmight happen.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. One of the things you learn in military law school is the \nPosse Comitatus Act, because if a military member or a unit is asked to \nassist in a law enforcement function, that is prohibited in this \ncountry. Why is that? We don't want to become a military state. We have \ncivilian law enforcement that is answerable to an independent \njudiciary.\n  The Posse Comitatus Act came about after Reconstruction, because \nduring the Reconstruction era the Union Army occupied the South. They \nwere the judge, jury, and law enforcement. They did it all because \nthere was no civilian law enforcement. After the South was \nreconstructed, a lot of people felt that was not a good model to use in \nthe future; that we don't want to give the military law enforcement \npower; they are here to protect us against threats, foreign and \ndomestic; law enforcement activities are completely different.\n  Now we have National Guard members on the border. That is not a law \nenforcement function. That is the national security function. But I \nhave been receiving calls that say our legislation overturns the Posse \nComitatus Act. Here is why that is completely wrong.\n  Surveilling an al-Qaida member, capturing and interrogating an al-\nQaida member is not a law enforcement function; it is a military \nfunction. For the Posse Comitatus Act to apply, you would have to \nassume that a member of al-Qaida is a common criminal and our military \nhas no legal authority here at home to engage the enemy if they get \nhere.\n  You talk about perverse. You would be saying, as a Congress, that an \nal-Qaida member who made it to America could not be engaged by our \nmilitary. What a perverse reading of the Posse Comitatus Act.\n  The reason al-Qaida is a military threat and not a common criminal \nthreat is because the Congress in 2001 so designated. I think most \nAmericans feel comfortable with the idea that the American military \nshould be involved in fighting al-Qaida at home, and that is not a law \nenforcement function.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is why we have very carefully pointed this provision \n1032 to a very narrow group of people--people who are determined to be \nmembers of or associated with al-Qaida.\n  Then the question becomes, Well, how is that determination made? What \nare the procedures for that? The answer is it is left up to the \nexecutive branch to determine those procedures. Can there be any \ninterference with the civilian law enforcement folks who are \ninterrogating people that they arrest? If someone tries to blow up \nTimes Square and they are being interrogated by the FBI, is there any \ninterference with that interrogation? None. We explicitly say that \nthere is no such interference.\n  What about people who are seeking to observe illegal conduct? Is \nthere any interference with that? There is none. We specifically say \nthose procedures shall not interfere with that kind of observation, \nseeking intelligence. We are not interfering with the civilian \nprosecution, with the civilian law enforcement at all.\n  The rules to determine whether someone is a member of al-Qaida are \nrules which the executive branch is going to write. They can't say, \nWell, this thing authorizes the interference with civilian \ninterrogation when, as a matter of fact, it specifically says it won't, \nand the procedures to determine whether somebody is governed by this \nassumption are going to be written by the FBI and the Justice \nDepartment and the executive branch. And, on top of that, there is a \nwaiver.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. May I add something. I want to respond to one of my good \nfriends, Senator Paul, who said, Well, that is all good, but sometimes \nin democracies you let in very bad people and I don't want to give \nbroad power to the executive branch that could result in political \npersecution.\n  I would tell you--Senator Levin may find this hard to believe--there \nare people on my side who don't trust President Obama and his \nadministration. Some of them don't think he is an American. Some of \nthem believe that if we pass this law, you are going to give the Obama \nadministration the power to come on and pick them up because they go to \na rally somewhere.\n  All I can say to Senator Paul and others: I share the concern about \nunlimited executive power. I support the Posse Comitatus Act. I don't \nsupport the idea that the military can't fight al-Qaida when they come \nhere. We are not talking about law enforcement functions.\n  But here is what happens: If someone is picked up as a suspected \nenemy combatant under this narrow window, not only does the executive \nbranch get to determine how best to do that--do you agree with me that, \nin this war, that every person picked up as an enemy combatant--citizen \nor not--here in the United States goes before a Federal judge, and our \ngovernment has to prove to an independent judiciary outside the \nexecutive branch by a preponderance of the evidence that you are who we \nsay you are and that you have fit in this narrow window? That if you \nare worried about some abuse of this, we have got a check and balance \nwhere the judiciary, under the law that we have created, has an \nindependent review obligation to determine whether the executive branch \nhas abused their power, and that decision can be appealed all the way \nto the Supreme Court?\n  Mr. LEVIN. That guarantee is called habeas corpus. It has been in our \nlaw. It is untouched by anything in this bill. Quite the opposite; we \nactually enhance the procedures here. The Senator from South Carolina \nhas been very much a part of the effort here.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Much to my detriment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. With all the risks that are entailed of being \nmisunderstood and all the rest. That is something the Senator from \nSouth Carolina has engaged in, to try to see if we can put down what \nthe detention rules are--by the way, ``are''--because as the \nadministration itself said in its statement of administration policy, \nthe authorities codified in this section--authorities codified in \nsection 1031 they are referring to--those authorities already exist.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. In this case where somebody is worried about being picked \nup by a rogue executive branch because they went to the wrong political \nrally, they don't have to worry\n\n[[Page S8103]]\n\nvery long, because our Federal courts have the right and the obligation \nto make sure the government proves their case that you are a member of \nal-Qaida and didn't go to a political rally. That has never happened in \nany other war. That is a check and balance here in this war. And let me \ntell you why it is necessary.\n  This is a war without end. There will never be a surrender ceremony \nsigning on the USS Missouri. So what we have done, knowing that an \nenemy combatant determination could be a de facto life sentence, is we \nare requiring the courts to look over the military's shoulder to create \nchecks and balances. Quite frankly, I think that is a good \naccommodation.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Not only is what the Senator said accurate, but we have \ndone something else in this bill. There is an Executive order that was \nissued some years ago that said there should be a periodic review \nprocess for folks who are being detained under the law of war. Because \nit is so unclear as to when this war ends, there is real concern about \nthat. What do we do about that? So in this bill what we require the \nexecutive branch to do--and I am now quoting from section 1035--is to \nadopt procedures for implementing a periodic review process. Those \nprocedures don't exist now. They are not formalized. So we want to \nformalize them for the very reason that the Senator from South Carolina \naddressed: because we want to make sure that since we don't know when \nthis particular war is going to end, it is kind of hard to define it \nand everyone is concerned about that, you have got to have review \nprocedures. The greatest review procedure of all is habeas corpus. But \nthere are also requirements in the Executive order for a periodic \nreview process of whether somebody is still a threat or not a threat, \nfor instance. The war may still be going on, but the person may no \nlonger be a threat.\n\n  Should there be an opportunity for the person to say that? Well, \nthere should be. There surely should be a regular review process. The \nSenator from South Carolina has been very much involved in this kind of \ndue process. But what we put into our bill--which would have been \neliminated, by the way, if the Udall amendment had been adopted \nyesterday--is a requirement that the Executive order's procedures be \nadopted, because so far we haven't seen that.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I would say why I wanted to do that. I want to be able to \nsay--and not to my political advantage. But I want to be able to tell \npeople post-Abu Ghraib, post-early Guantanamo Bay, we have cleaned up \nour act. We are trying to get the balance we didn't have originally. I \nwant to be able to tell people we no longer torture in America. That is \nwhy you and I wrote the Detainee Treatment Act, with Senator McCain, \nthe War Powers Act that clearly bans waterboarding.\n  I want to be able to tell anybody who is interested that no person in \nan American prison--civilian or military--held as a suspected member of \nal-Qaida will be held without independent judicial review. We are not \nallowing the executive branch to make that decision unchecked. For the \nfirst time in the history of American warfare, every American combatant \nheld by the executive branch will have their day in Federal court, and \nthe government has to prove by a preponderance of the evidence you are \nin fact part of the enemy force. And we did not stop there. Because \nthis could be a war without end, we require an annual review process \nwhere each year the individual's case is evaluated as to whether they \nstill maintain a threat or they have intelligence that could be \ngathered by longer confinement.\n  What I would say to our colleagues is that we have tried to strike \nthat balance. There are a lot of people who don't like the idea that \nyou give these terrorists Federal hearings and lawyers and all that \nother stuff. There are a lot of people who don't like the fact that we \ndo have now humane interrogation techniques. But I like that, because I \nwant to win this war on our terms, not theirs. So I couldn't be more \nproud of this bill.\n  To my colleagues on the right who want to mandate military custody \nall the time and you never can read them their Miranda rights, I am \nsorry, I can't go there. To our friends on the left who want to say the \nmilitary has no role in this war at home, I am sorry, I can't go there. \nMilitary commissions make sense sometimes, sometimes Federal courts \nmake sense.\n  I will end on this note. This compromise that we have come up with I \nthink will stand the test of time. Unfortunately, most likely radical \nIslam as we know it today is not going to be defeated in our lifetime, \nand I hope to have created on my watch as a Senator a legal system that \nhas robust due process, that adheres to our values, but also recognizes \nwe are at threat like any other time in recent memory and allows us to \nprotect ourselves within the values of being an American. I cannot tell \nyou how much I appreciate working with the Senator and Senator McCain, \nand I think we have accomplished that after 10 years of trying.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                     Extension of Payroll Tax Cuts\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I want to speak on these very strange \ndays in Washington, in this Congress.\n  This esteemed body's approval rating is at 9 percent, and I am having \na hard time finding the 9 percent. It seems to me that the only thing \nwe are working hard on is whether we can get the approval rating to \nzero, and I think we seem to be going in that direction.\n  We fight over political solutions that can't pass and, more \nimportantly, won't solve this Nation's great problems. We fight for \npolitical points and mistakenly believe that the American people care \nwho is up or down. But they don't.\n  I didn't come to Washington for the purpose of playing games, taking \nnames, or keeping score. That is not what I was sent here to do. That \nis not what the people of West Virginia want me to do. I came here to \nfix things and to be a part of the solution. I have not come here to \nworry about my next election or whether Republicans or Democrats are up \nor down. I came here to do what I could to improve life for the next \ngeneration. I, for one, am willing to sacrifice my next election so the \nnext generation can win. And if that means losing, so be it.\n  I rise today to speak about the next chapter of this sad state of \naffairs which the American people are forced to witness: whether we \nshould extend and expand the payroll tax cut that will cost more than \n$240 billion in 1 year.\n  Many accusations are being thrown back and forth in the debate over \nthe so-called tax cuts or tax increases, depending on which side of the \nfence you are on. There is one very basic fact that is missing from all \nof this very important conversation: Americans pay for one thing with \nour payroll tax--One. Social Security.\n  Social Security isn't just another government program. It was \nestablished in 1935 to provide economic security for our Nation's \nseniors who worked hard and earned their retirement benefits. They \nworked their whole life to provide our generation and those that will \nfollow with a better and greater America.\n  Yet at the time when our Nation faces a death spiral of debt, when we \nshould be talking about how we can come together to fix a fiscal \nnightmare that will threaten the very programs we care about such as \nSocial Security, instead we are talking about undermining the very \nfoundation of our longest standing retirement program. Right now, \nSocial Security is on a collision course. By 2037, according to the \ntrustees, if we do not do anything, benefits for everyone will have to \nbe cut by 22 percent. Yet we are digging a deeper hole by destabilizing \nits funding with this recommendation. All in return for what? A \ntemporary measure that has already cost nearly $120 billion and has at \nbest created few if any jobs.\n\n  In the real world, when policy doesn't work, we stop and try \nsomething else. Apparently, in Washington we double down. Why would we \ndo this? Why would we double down on a policy that did not work? The \nanswer is simple. For the sake of a short-term political gain, leaders \nof both parties and the President are willing to fight over how we \nshould pay for a failed program that jeopardizes the fundamental way \nthat\n\n[[Page S8104]]\n\nwe pay for our retirement security in this country. That does not make \nany sense to me, and it does not make any sense to the good people in \nWest Virginia.\n  I know in the coming days we are going to hear a lot of political \ntalk about extending the payroll tax. What they are saying sure sounds \ngood: More money in our pockets. In fact, politicians will offer \nassurances that Social Security will not be hurt at all. My good \nfriend, who will be speaking also on this, Senator Kirk from Illinois, \nis going to show a graph that basically shows that to be different.\n  What you will not hear them say, though, is that reducing payroll \ntaxes even temporarily would take more than $240 billion out of Social \nSecurity's funding stream, if we approve the President's proposal. We \ncertainly will not hear them say the way they would repay those \nhundreds of billions of dollars is through our general revenue fund. If \nwe extend the cuts this year, what about the next year and the year \nafter? When does it stop? When do we have the political will to finally \nsay we better start paying again for Social Security.\n  Our approval rating is at 9 percent, and we are rapidly losing the \nsupport of our family members. Just how many Americans really believe \nthat Congress will make sure our general fund is solid enough to live \nup to the responsibility of funding Social Security? If the payroll tax \ncut is extended as it stands this year, the average family in West \nVirginia will pay $14 less per week. For a lot of people that is a lot \nof money. But the few West Virginians who even realize they are getting \nhelp say they would gladly give that up in return for a reliable Social \nSecurity safety net or for a real tax reform that cuts rates across the \nboard and that ensures that every American, especially the wealthy, \nwill start paying their fair share. They would gladly do that.\n  Let me be clear. As a country, we cannot expect that Social Security \nwill remain secure if we keep telling Americans we do not have to pay \nfor it, and that is exactly the conclusion people will reach if we keep \nreducing their contributions. Social Security is one of our highest \npriorities as a country, and we should not let the Federal Government \nundermine Social Security by convincing Americans they do not really \nhave to pay for it.\n  Then, again, there are some in Washington who want us to believe the \nvery act of reducing our contributions to Social Security will spur job \ncreation. Unfortunately, the reality is very different.\n  We tried the payroll tax cut last year, and I supported it. But I \nwill not double down on the failed policy, especially one that \njeopardizes the future of Social Security. Truth be told, over the last \nyear I traveled more than 18,000 miles in my State, and I have yet to \nfind very many West Virginians who even know they are getting a \ndiscount, let alone business owners who say they will hire anybody if \nwe give them a discount for 1 year.\n  What business owners do tell me is that what they want more than \nanything is some certainty and some confidence in this economy; that we \nwill do the right thing and stabilize this economy. Instead, the \nPresident and leadership in both parties are trying to give them more \nof the same failed policies--taking steps that will further undermine \nour finances, worsen our debt crisis, and jeopardize hundreds of \nbillions from Social Security's regular funding stream, all without the \nreality that it will create any jobs.\n  With this great Nation now more than $15 trillion in debt--it will be \n$17 trillion next year and going to $21 trillion by 2021--the enormity \nof this problem is that just servicing the debt by 2021 will be greater \nthan what we spend on our Department of Defense to secure this great \nNation. We cannot afford to continue to double down on failed policies.\n  As for taxes, don't get me wrong. I don't want to see Americans \npaying higher taxes. No way. I simply want a commonsense tax system \nthat ensures everyone pays their fair share, especially the wealthy, \nwho have benefitted the most from this failed tax system we have right \nnow--real tax reform that will lower tax rates for everyone as we close \nthe loopholes, credits, and offsets that allow some corporations and \nsome Americans to avoid paying their fair share. It is time to stop all \nof that.\n  Some will say that it is impossible; it cannot be done. I think they \nare wrong. It requires leadership from the White House to every corner \nof Congress, and it requires each and every one of us to be willing to \nsacrifice our political futures for the Nation's future. I, for one, am \nwilling to do just that.\n  This is our moment. At this critical moment in our history we must \nget our financial house in order and letting Americans believe we do \nnot have to pay for Social Security is wrong. It is dead wrong. It is \nthe wrong policy. It is wrong for our seniors, it is wrong for our \nfuture, and I will not vote for it, period, under any condition. For \nthe sake of the next generation we must get our fiscal house in order, \nand we can do that if we are willing to make difficult decisions.\n  I will not vote for either of these two proposals to extend the \npayroll tax cuts. Looking forward for the sake of our Nation, I hope we \nwill begin to work on a proposal that makes the hard decisions while \nalso protecting the programs and commitments we value as a nation. For \nmyself, and I believe many of my colleagues, there is a bipartisan path \nforward that can help save this Nation, and I have my good colleague, \nthe Republican from Illinois, who is going to speak to it also.\n  I believe the best path forward is based on the framework and \nrecommendations outlined in the Bowles-Simpson proposal. When those \nrecommendations were laid out a year ago today--this is the anniversary \ntoday--I had been a Senator for less than a month--brandnew, less than \n1 month. What I saw in that report gave me great hope. It gave me hope \nthat we could identify our problems, which we did--the fiscal \nresponsibility that we had--and willingly tackle them together. So I \nwas on a high for that one short period.\n\n  As a brandnew Member, I was so encouraged that such a responsible, \nbipartisan group of people, put together by the President, offered a \nno-holds-barred report on our fiscal situation and some pathways to fix \nit. Then the proverbial air came out. Not only did the President and \nhis administration walk away from these bipartisan proposals, but \nleadership in both Chambers of Congress failed to pick up this report \nand run with it.\n  Here we are a year later. If anything, our problems are worse. We are \ngoing to be forced to make deeper cuts than we wanted to, all because \nour leadership would not confront the enormous problems we face with a \ncomprehensive long-term solution. But the Bowles-Simpson plan is still \nthe only proposal that enjoys strong bipartisan support. It started as \na bipartisan commission. It grew in numbers and it is still growing. It \nhas a responsible manner to balance this problem we have.\n  It is not perfect; no plan is. I do not agree with everything it \nproposes. But no plan can be everything to everyone. With today being \nthe 1-year anniversary of the unveiling of that proposal, I am urging, \nand will continue to urge, our President and the leadership of both \nChambers to support any and all efforts--not only to pick up this \nreport, but also to put the resources behind drafting and passing this \nlegislation into law. I ask we all remember the great opportunity we \nhave before us to do what is right.\n  I do not want to be part of the first generation--and I know the \nPresiding Officer doesn't want to be part, and I know my good friend \nfrom Illinois doesn't want to be part of the first generation that \nleaves this Nation in worse shape for the next generation. I don't \nbelieve this President or any Member of Congress wants to fail the next \ngeneration either.\n  With that, I want to turn over my time to my colleague from Illinois.\n  Mr. KIRK. If I could engage the Senator in a colloquy, this is a \nchart that shows the legislation we are considering today. What it \nshows is the tremendous hit to the tax that supports Social Security. \nThis is the Old Age Survivors Disability Act. It is a $240 billion hit \nto the funding to support Social Security. We both are going to vote no \non both pieces of legislation today because we do not think seniors \nshould take this level of hit.\n  In the Casey-Reid legislation--this is where the so-called \nmillionaires' tax comes in--it only refunds what Social\n\n[[Page S8105]]\n\nSecurity needs to the level of 7 percent in 2013. In fact, according to \none analysis, we may trigger the end of the debt limit before the \nelection if we pass this because of the $246 billion we will have to \nborrow temporarily until the long stretch of this revenue comes in.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S8104, December 1, 2011, the Record reads: In the Casey-\nReed legislation--this is . . .\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: In the Casey-Reid \nlegislation--this is . . .\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  We are about to do a chart with the Republican alternative. It has \nthe same long payout there, and tremendous hit to Social Security. In \nthis time of all these political bills, I think Senator Manchin and I \nare both saying let's not do the political thing anymore. We both voted \nfor the payroll tax deduction legislation before because the country \nwas in crisis, and we wanted to try this out. But this is revenue that \nsupports the benefits that Social Security recipients depend on, and we \ncannot continue to try to run this program without that revenue. So I \nthink this holiday should end. I think this revenue should not be \nforegone. I do not think seniors should be faced with a trust-us policy \nthat will pay them back. I would actually say even the political vote \nis to vote against this so you are for Social Security and for making \nsure this payment is continued.\n  I commend the Senator. I think we should exactly follow this policy \nof no on both of these because, if you vote no, you are supporting \nSocial Security.\n  One other thing: I ask AARP to speak more clearly on this issue. AARP \ncurrently told my staff that they are neutral on this. I urge AARP \nmembers to contact AARP and say: Defend Social Security revenues. Make \nsure there is enough in the kitty for our benefits. We know that 10,000 \nAmericans a day are now qualifying for Social Security. We know this is \nan age of no free lunch. We want to make sure the revenues are there \nnot just today but tomorrow because seniors absolutely depend on that.\n  With that, I yield back to my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Let the record show the Senator sought \nrecognition, unanimous consent to proceed to a colloquy and did so \nwithout objection.\n  Mr. KIRK. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I say to my friend from Illinois, what he says is \nabsolutely correct. We have so many people, especially in West Virginia \nand Illinois, who depend on Social Security. In fact, in West Virginia, \nfor 62 percent of the people who receive Social Security it is their \nmajor funding mechanism. It is how they live day to day. They have told \nme: Do not touch our Social Security Program, our core values of Social \nSecurity, what it does for us. If we pass this, not only do we touch \nit, we jeopardize its solvency in the long term.\n  If you believe we are going to be responsible enough to pay for this \nin the 10 years outgoing, then we have some beach-front property in \nWest Virginia we would love to interest you in.\n  Mr. KIRK. I would say, this is a very long payout, both under the \nmajority and minority piece of legislation. I am hoping enough Members \nsay no to both pieces of legislation so we defend Social Security, and \nI commend the Senator.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I think we are very strong in support of the Bowles-\nSimpson, basically, the template that it laid out. It is the only one \nthat is bipartisan. As you can see, it stayed bipartisan with the \nSenator and I, and it will remain bipartisan. It has a tax reform, but \neveryone pays a fair share. The very wealthy who have escaped paying \nbecause of the flawed tax policies would now start paying if we had \nreal tax reform--not increased rates but just their fair share. That is \nwhat we ask.\n  Mr. KIRK. With that, I yield and commend the Senator. We are hoping \nfor two ``no'' votes because we think those are the votes that support \nSocial Security and its continued revenue.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I thank the Bowles-Simpson committee, Mr. Bowles and Mr. \nSimpson, for what they have done a year ago, bringing it to our \nattention, bringing a pathway to fixing the financial problems we are \ndealing with. We are concerned about the next generation more so than \nour next election. That is what we were sent here to do.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1414\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to pass \namendment No. 1414 that I have offered with my distinguished colleague \nfrom Illinois, Senator Kirk, to strengthen sanctions against Iran that \ngo to the heart of the regime's ability to finance its nuclear \nambitions. This is a broad-based effort, a bipartisan effort, and one \nthat needs the Senate's attention and passage.\n  In my view, we have to follow the money, and this amendment does \nexactly that. If we are serious about limiting Iran's ability to \nfinance its nuclear ambitions, this amendment is essential to that \neffort. It is a serious attempt to sanction the Central Bank of Iran, \nwhich is known to be complicit in Iran's nuclear efforts.\n  If we fail to close loopholes and sanction funding mechanisms for \nIran's nuclear development programs, we would be like a rancher who \nleft the barn open and wonders why the horses are gone. To not pass \nthis amendment is leaving the door open to Iran's runaway nuclear \nambitions. We cannot and we must not let that happen.\n\n  I know the administration has expressed their concerns about this \namendment--an amendment which, by the way, has come about as a result \nof the administration asking us to work with them, and a bipartisan \neffort has achieved a narrower, more defined, tailored effort to bring \nthe maximum sanctions upon Iran with the minimum consequence to both \nthe United States and our allies across the globe. But in the absence \nof congressional action over the last 15 years, starting with the Iran \nand Libya Sanctions Act and ending with CISADA, I have to wonder what \nwe would be doing to stop Iran's drive to obtain nuclear weapons, if it \nwere not for the Congress's intercession and actions.\n  I recognize this administration has done more than any prior \nadministration in terms of using those tools the Congress has given \nthem, but in my view, we have not done enough.\n  In a letter from Secretary Geithner today, the administration \nrecognizes that ``Iran's greatest economic resource is its export of \noil. Sales of crude oil line the regime's pockets, sustain its human \nrights abuses, and feed its nuclear ambitions like no other sector of \nthe Iranian economy.'' That is what Secretary Geithner had to say in \nhis letter. That is pretty compelling as to why this amendment needs to \npass, that is why I have worked with Senator Kirk to pass this \nimportant amendment, and that is why we urge our colleagues to pass it.\n  To those who have raised concerns about the impact of the amendment \non our allies and our multilateral diplomacy efforts, I would note that \nthe European nations and the French in particular are already \nconsidering their own Iranian oil embargo. This is not, by the way, an \noil embargo, but they are considering something far more significant--\ntheir own Iranian oil embargo. They recognize that the Iranian nuclear \nprogram has a short fuse. Published reports say it may be as short as 1 \nyear, and the time to act is now. They recognize that the Shahab \nmissile would not only be capable of hitting the State of Israel but \ncould easily hit a European nation--a European nation which obviously \nwould be a NATO ally.\n  As for other countries, frankly, I am not concerned with how the \nChinese feel about our amendment given that they are currently one of \ngreatest violators of our current sanctions regime already. The \nevidence is clear.\n  I have been made aware that several major energy traders continue to \nmake prohibited sales of refined petroleum to Iran. Yet our response \nhas been to sanction the front companies rather than the major figures \nbehind these sales.\n  China also continues to be a major Iranian trading partner and has \nagreements with Iran for nearly $40 billion in investments to develop \nIranian oil fields. China has reportedly directed the China National \nOffshore Oil Corporation and National Petroleum Corporation to slow \ntheir work in Iran, presumably to allow them to make the argument to \nWashington to hold off on sanctions.\n\n[[Page S8106]]\n\n  We must ask, why has the administration been reluctant to sanction \nChinese companies when there is ample evidence that they are violating \nour own existing laws and there is precedent for us sanctioning Chinese \ncompanies for nuclear and weapons proliferation outcomes?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Is it the Senator's impression that action by the United \nNations Security Council is pretty dim given the stated positions of \nRussia and China on this issue?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. The Senator, in my view, is right, considering that \nthey both have veto power at the Security Council. It seems to me that \nthey are not likely allies in helping us pursue this course.\n  Mr. McCAIN. So then it really makes a more compelling argument to \nthose who may be wavering on this amendment that there is a clear \nrecord on the part of China and Russia in the U.N. Security Council \nthat we cannot expect a Security Council vote, but perhaps we could \nexpect other nations to follow suit once the United States leads on \nthis issue.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I believe the Senator is right.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. The November 8 IAEA report underscores the need for \nthis amendment. It undeniably confirms that there is a military \ncomponent to Iran's nuclear program; that Iran has not suspended its \nIranian enrichment and conversion activities at declared facilities and \nis seeking to develop as many as 10 new enrichment facilities; that \nthere are undisclosed nuclear facilities in Iran; that Iran is seeking \nback channels to acquire dual-use technology and materials; that Iran \nis experimenting and testing detonators and initiation systems critical \nto creating a nuclear weapon; and that Iran may be working on an \nindigenous design for a nuclear weapon, including a nuclear payload \nsmall enough to fit on Iran's long-range Shahab missile, a missile \ncapable of reaching Israel. These public revelations have led to an \nincrease in multilateral sanctions on the Iranian regime, which I \napplaud, but given what appears to be a shortening timeline until Iran \nhas a potential nuclear weapon, it would seem we are not doing enough \nfast enough.\n  Iran has adapted to CISADA and has negotiated workarounds to \nconstraints on its financial transactions and its ability to acquire \nrequisite materials to advance its clandestine program. This amendment \nwill prevent those workarounds. It will impose sanctions on those \ninternational financial institutions that engage in business activities \nwith the Central Bank of Iran--particularly in the pursuit of petroleum \nproducts--with the exception of transactions that include medicine and \nmedical devices.\n  It is a timely amendment that follows the administration's decision \nlast week designating the entire Iranian banking sector as a primary \nmoney laundering concern and a threat to government and financial \ninstitutions, noting Iran's illicit activities, including its pursuit \nof nuclear weapons, its support of terrorism, and its efforts to \ndeceive responsible financial institutions and evade sanctions. In \nfact, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the Department of the \nTreasury wrote:\n\n       The Central Bank of Iran, which regulates Iranian banks, \n     has assisted designated Iranian banks by transferring \n     billions of dollars to those banks in 2011. In making these \n     transfers, the CBI attempted to evade sanctions by minimizing \n     the direct involvement of large international banks with \n     both CBI and designated Iranian banks.\n\n  The Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial \nIntelligence, David Cohen, wrote:\n\n       Treasury is calling out the entire Iranian banking sector, \n     including the Central Bank of Iran, as posing terrorist \n     financing, proliferation financing, and money laundering \n     risks for the global financial system.\n\n  I don't know how much more compelling even the administration's own \narguments are. As I have said on this floor, Iran's conduct threatens \nthe national security of the United States and its allies. The \ncomplicit action of the Central Bank of Iran, based on its facilitation \nof the activities of the government, its evasion of multilateral \nsanctions directed against the Government of Iran, its engagement in \ndeceptive financial practices and illicit transactions, and, most \nimportant, its provision of financial services in support of Iran's \neffort to acquire the knowledge, materials, and facilities to enrich \nuranium and to ultimately develop weapons of mass destruction, \nthreatens regional peace and global security.\n  This amendment will starve the beast. It requires the President to \nprohibit transactions of Iranian financial institutions that touch U.S. \nfinancial institutions. To ensure that we don't spook the oil markets, \ntransactions with Iran's Central Bank in petroleum and petroleum \nproducts would only be sanctioned if the President makes a \ndetermination that petroleum-producing countries other than Iran can \nprovide sufficient alternative resources for the countries purchasing \nfrom Iran and that the country declines to make significant decreases \nin the purchases of Iranian oil.\n  This bipartisan amendment has been carefully crafted to ensure the \nmaximum impact on Iran's financial infrastructure and ability to \nfinance terrorist activities and to minimize the impact on global \neconomy. It has the best chance of helping us achieve a peaceful \nsolution to this threat. I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I ask one additional question?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I would be happy to do so. I know we have a vote in 5 \nminutes, and I want the distinguished Senator from Illinois to have an \nopportunity to speak.\n  Mr. McCAIN. These questions are for either Senator.\n  Is it true that in this legislation, there is a national security \nwaiver, that the President can waive the provisions of this bill if he \nfeels it is in the national interest? Also, how do you respond to the \nargument being put forward that this could destroy the world's \nfinancial system if this legislation would be put into effect?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. The answer is, yes, there is a national security \nwaiver, and, no, we do not believe the world's financial system will be \ndestroyed. The fact is, as my distinguished colleague from Illinois has \nsaid, it is a choice between a $300 billion economy in Iran and a $14 \ntrillion economy in the United States. I think that choice would be \nvery clear for countries as they choose to do so, and the Europeans are \nalready on a march on their own because they understand the risk to \nthem.\n  I yield the floor, and I hope to hear from my colleague from \nIllinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. KIRK. I rise in very strong support of the Menendez-Kirk \namendment.\n  I wish to compliment the Senator from New Jersey for an outstanding \nperformance in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today in which he \ncalled on the representatives of our government to move quicker on \nthis.\n  We saw the Baha'is radicals of Iran overrun the embassy of our allies \nin the United Kingdom. We saw the British Prime Minister just announce \nthat he was removing all Iranian diplomats from the United Kingdom. We \nsaw the Government of Italy announcing that they were suspending some \ndiplomatic activities. We have seen a whole number of actions by the EU \nnow to join with us on sanctions.\n  I will just say with regard to this amendment that it has now been \ncosponsored formally by 46 Senators: Menendez, Kirk, Barrasso, \nBlumenthal, Blunt, Boozman, Brown of Massachusetts, Brown of Ohio, \nCardin, Casey, Collins, Coons, Crapo, Feinstein, Franken, Gillibrand, \nGraham, Hatch, Heller, Johanns, Klobuchar, Kyl, Lautenberg, Lee, \nLieberman, Manchin, Merkley, Mikulski, Moran, Murkowski, Nelson of \nFlorida, Nelson of Nebraska, Portman, Pryor, Risch, Roberts, Schumer, \nSnowe, Stabenow, Tester, Thune, Toomey, Vitter, Warner, Whitehouse, and \nWyden. These 46 Members are on the shoulders of the 92 who signed the \nKirk-Schumer letter in August. When in these partisan times do we have \nall but eight Senators agreeing on a policy?\n  I will just note, as Senator Menendez and Senator McCain pointed out, \nthe administration is somewhat worried about this amendment, but \nSenator Menendez correctly provided flexibility to the administration \nby saying,\n\n[[Page S8107]]\n\nNo. 1, if the energy information agency says oil markets are tight and \nissues a report on the affected oil markets, these sanctions could be \nsuspended for a time. On top of that one waiver, there is a second \nwaiver for the national security of the United States that the \nPresident could have that kind of flexibility.\n  So with flexibility, with bipartisan support, with outrageous \nactivity by Iran, in the face of the IAEA report, moving toward a \nnuclear weapon, with the danger we see from that government and \nHezbollah and Hamas against our allies in Lebanon and Israel, with the \nplot announced by the Attorney General of the United States to blow up \na Georgetown restaurant in an effort to kill the Saudi Arabian \nAmbassador, with the plight of 330,000 Baha'is oppressed by that \ncountry, with someone like Nasrin Sotoudeh, the lawyer for Shirin \nEbadi--the Noble Prize laureate's lawyer was thrown in jail just for \nrepresenting that client--for all these reasons, this is the right \namendment, at the right time, sending the right message in the face of \na very irresponsible regime.\n  I yield back and thank the Senator for offering this well-timed \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 1093 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. On behalf of Senator Inhofe, I ask to withdraw amendment \nNo. 1093.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, very briefly I would like to thank the \nSenators for their leadership on this issue. There is a threat to the \nsecurity of the world posed by the Islamic nation of Iran. This is much \nneeded legislation.\n  I think it is important to note, as they did, that there is a \nnational security waiver given to the President of the United States, \nand also we cannot expect a lot of help considering the membership of \nthe United Nations Security Council and Russia and China's \nunwillingness to act on behalf of reining in this path that Iran is on \nto the acquisition and the possibility and the capability for the use \nof nuclear weapons.\n  I congratulate both sponsors of the amendment, and I hope we can get \na recorded vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1125\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I wanted to rise at this time \nin support of the Feinstein amendment No. 1125, which would modify the \nrequirement that the Armed Forces detain suspected terrorists by adding \nthe word ``abroad'' to ensure that we aren't disrupting domestic \ncounterterrorism efforts. And I would like to correct the record \nbecause some of the opponents of the amendment have stated that by \ninserting the word ``abroad,'' we would be preventing the military from \ndetaining al-Qaida terrorists on U.S. soil, and that is simply not \ntrue.\n  The President knows and my colleagues know that I am not comfortable \nwith the detention provisions in this bill because I think they will \nundermine our fight against terrorism. But this would be an important \nchange, a narrowly focused change in the provisions that have already \nbeen put on the floor.\n  Mr. President, is the vote imminent?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). It is.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise in support of the \nFeinstein amendment No. 1125, which would modify the requirement that \nthe Armed Forces detain suspected terrorists by adding the word \n``abroad'' to ensure we are not disrupting domestic counterterrorism \nefforts. I wish to correct the Record, because some of the opponents of \nthis amendment have stated that by inserting the word ``abroad'' we \nwould be ``preventing the military from detaining al Qaeda terrorists \non U.S. soil.'' This is simply not true.\n  I am not comfortable with the detention provisions in this bill \nbecause I think they will undermine our fight against terrorism. While \nsection 1031 of this legislation will authorize the military to detain \nterrorists, section 1032 requires that the military detain certain \nterrorists even if the FBI or local law enforcement is in the middle of \na larger investigation that would yield the capture of even more \ndangerous terrorists.\n  This may disrupt the investigation, interrogation, and prosecution of \nterrorist suspects by forcing the military to interrupt FBI, CIA, or \nother counterterrorism agency operations--against each of these \norganizations' recommendations, including the military's. This would be \nan unworkable bureaucratic process that would take away the ability to \nmake critical and split-second decisions about how best to save \nAmericans lives. That is why the director of the FBI and the director \nof National Intelligence have strongly opposed the underlying \nprovisions.\n  The Feinstein amendment would simply provide the needed flexibility \nfor the FBI and other law enforcement agencies to work to fight and \ncapture terrorists without having to stop and hand over suspects to the \nmilitary. However, even with the Feinstein modification, with the \nauthorization in section 1031 the military could still detain a \nsuspected terrorist but would not have to step in and interrupt other \ndomestic counterterrorism operations.\n  In other words, the Feinstein amendment would do nothing to prevent \nthe military from acting, it would simply take away the mandate that \nthey interrupt other investigations. I still do not believe we should \nenshrine in law authorization for the military to act on U.S. soil, but \nto argue that adding ``abroad'' to section 1032 would take away from \nthe authority given in this bill is just wrong.\n  Clarifying that the military is only required to detain suspected \nterrorists abroad is the best approach to address the FBI's concerns \nabout this legislation, and it is the best approach for our national \nsecurity. What we are doing is working. We should not take away the \nflexibility that is necessary to keep us safe.\n  Passing this amendment would be welcome news to Secretary of Defense \nPanetta, Director of National Intelligence Clapper, FBI Director \nMueller, and CIA Director Petraeus--who oppose the intrusive \nrestrictions on their counterterrorism operations that the underlying \nbill would create.\n  The other side has argued that this is fundamentally about whether we \nare fighting a war or a crime. I think that is a false choice and it \ndoes a disservice to our integrated intelligence community that is \nfighting terrorism successfully using every tool it possibly can. We \ncan debate this in theoretical, black-and-white terms about whether \nthis is a war or a crime. Or we can get back to the business of taking \non these terrorists in every way we know how, including by using our \nvery effective criminal justice system. At the end of the day, it is \nabout protecting Americans, protecting this country. Why on Earth would \nwe want to tie our hands behind our back?\n  Our national security leadership has said the detention provisions in \nthis bill could make us less safe. We should listen to their concerns \nand pass this amendment to preserve the U.S. Government's current \ndetention and prosecution flexibility that has allowed both the Bush \nand Obama Administrations to effectively combat those who seek to do us \nharm.\n  Again, I encourage my colleagues to support the Feinstein amendment, \nto keep faith with the Directors of the FBI, the DNI, the Secretary of \nDefense, and our Attorney General, who say these provisions could \ncreate unwanted complications in our fight against terrorism.\n  Let's adopt the Feinstein amendment. It will help us win the war \nagainst terror.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to a vote on the Feinstein amendment No. 1125.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 45, nays 55, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 213 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--45\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bennet\n     Bingaman\n     Blumenthal\n     Boxer\n\n[[Page S8108]]\n\n\n     Brown (OH)\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Conrad\n     Coons\n     Durbin\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Johnson (SD)\n     Kerry\n     Kirk\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Lee\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Paul\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Tester\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--55\n\n     Alexander\n     Ayotte\n     Barrasso\n     Begich\n     Blunt\n     Boozman\n     Brown (MA)\n     Burr\n     Casey\n     Chambliss\n     Coats\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Enzi\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Hatch\n     Heller\n     Hoeven\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Johnson (WI)\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lugar\n     Manchin\n     McCain\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Moran\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Portman\n     Pryor\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Rubio\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Thune\n     Toomey\n     Vitter\n     Wicker\n  The amendment (No. 1125) was rejected.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the 2012 \nNational Defense Authorization Act, the critical piece of legislation \nwe are now working on that will strengthen our national security, \nprovide for our troops and their families, and improve oversight of \nAmerican taxpayer dollars.\n  Over the last half century, the Senate has successfully passed a \ndefense authorization bill without fail every year. This strong \ntradition of bipartisanship continues today under the joint leadership \nof Senators Levin and McCain.\n  As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I thank the chairman and \nranking member, as well as the majority and minority staff, for their \ndedicated and tireless effort as we work to bring this important \nlegislation to the floor.\n  Throughout this yearlong process, our committee takes on extremely \ndifficult and contentious security issues, and at times we have our \ndifferences. However, we take on these disagreements in a respectful \nand openminded fashion, driven by a strong commitment to cooperation \nand compromise. Bipartisanship has never been easy, but it works, as \nthe Armed Services Committee has proven year in and year out. I hope \nall of our committees in the Senate can work in this kind of \ncooperative fashion, especially these days when budget constraints are \nso difficult.\n  No department of the Federal Government is immune from the severe \nfiscal challenges facing our Nation. That includes our Department of \nDefense. We are cutting $27 billion from the President's budget request \nin this bill, nearly $43 billion from the last year's authorization. We \nneed to find ways to maximize our investments in defense by \naggressively eliminating unneeded and underperforming programs and we \nneed to streamline our business practices and invest strategically in \nfuture technology.\n  The bill before us helps ensure that our troops, especially the \n96,000 serving in Afghanistan as well as their families, continue to \nreceive the care and support they deserve. It provides hard-earned pay \nraises for all uniformed military personnel, funding for critical \nequipment, and training required for our men and women to succeed on \nthe battlefield.\n  The Defense authorization bill before us makes important investments \nin defense, science, and technology. As I know the Chair agrees, we \nneed to do more to prepare the next generation of scientists and \nengineers who will be so important to maintaining our Nation's superior \ntechnological edge. The current bill makes a small downpayment on this \nimportant effort, and I intend to continue to fight for more investment \nas we move forward.\n  The bill also includes a number of provisions that will enable the \nDefense Department to lead in the creation of a more secure energy \nfuture for our military and for our country. As the single largest \nconsumer of energy in the world today, the U.S. military has taken some \ninitial steps on energy efficiency, energy mitigation, and the use of \nrenewable and clean energy alternatives. But we still have a very long \nway to go. I look forward to continuing to work with the Department of \nDefense to take advantage of more energy savings opportunities in the \nfuture.\n  This year's Defense authorization bill also includes significant \nresources to fight nontraditional threats, including the proliferation \nof nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and the growing challenge \nposed by cyber warfare. In addition, I am pleased a number of \nprovisions I have been working on are currently included in the bill.\n  First, we are extending the Small Business Innovation Research \nProgram for the next 8 years. This is critical to keep our defense \nmanufacturing base and our small business innovators strong and \ncompetitive. This is a provision I have worked on. I commend Senators \nLandrieu and Snowe for their leadership in the Small Business Committee \nfor working on this effort and for working so hard to get this \nextension, a long-term extension, into the Defense authorization bill.\n  The bill also includes a version of the National Guard Citizen \nSoldiers Support Act, which will go far in providing our National Guard \nmembers with the unique services and support they need when they return \nhome from the fight.\n  We also have a Navy shipyard modernization provision that has been \nintroduced by Senators Snowe and Collins and Senator Ayotte and I, from \nNew Hampshire. It also includes a $400 million cut to an unnecessary \nand underperforming weapons program that I have worked closely with \nSenators McCain and Begich to include.\n  In addition, I was pleased to cosponsor Senator Leahy's National \nGuard Empowerment Act, which gives a stronger voice to our 450,000 \ncitizen soldiers in our National Guard.\n  Although we have a good bill before us, I believe it could be better, \nand I have introduced several additional amendments, two of which are \ndesigned to provide the nearly 214,000 women serving in our Armed \nServices with the reproductive health care they are currently denied \nunder the law. Unfortunately, we were not able to get a vote on those \namendments. But I hope to continue to work closely with the chairman \nand ranking member to address these important concerns.\n  In addition, I have worked closely with Senators Collins and Casey on \nan amendment to address unsecured and looted stockpiles of tens of \nthousands of shoulder-fired missiles in Libya. If these weapons fall \ninto the wrong hands, they pose a serious threat to civil aviation \nworldwide and to our deployed forces abroad.\n  I wish to thank the committee for including this provision in the \nlegislation. I also wish to address, briefly, some of the concerns that \nhave been raised with respect to the detainee provisions in the bill. \nThe underlying legislation which I supported is an attempt to provide a \nstatutory basis for dealing with detained members of al-Qaida and its \nterrorist affiliates.\n  In committee, we made some difficult choices on this extremely \ncomplex issue. But we did that in order to strike a bipartisan \nagreement to both protect our values and our security. I understand, \nsimilar to all the Members of this body, the concerns that have been \nraised on both sides of these issues.\n  Again, as a general principle, I believe our national security \nofficials should have the flexibility needed to deal with the \nconstantly evolving threat. But I also believe that clear, transparent \nrules of procedure are a bedrock legal principle of our constitutional \nsystem. I believe the military detention language in this bill includes \na significant amount of flexibility for the executive branch, including \na national security waiver and broad authorities on implementation.\n\n[[Page S8109]]\n\n  Although I support the goals of the chairman and ranking member's \nunderlying legislation, I also believe we can improve those provisions. \nI supported Senator Feinstein's amendment that we just voted on which \nwould restrict required military custody to only those terrorist \nsuspects captured abroad.\n  I hope that despite the disagreements, we will continue to chart a \nbipartisan path forward with respect to these detainee provisions in \nthe years ahead. We need to give our national security officials at \nhome and abroad a clearly defined but yet flexible system which \nprotects our constitutional rights and our national security.\n  In conclusion, I believe the 2012 Defense authorization bill before \nus will strengthen our national security, maintain our military power, \nkeep our defense businesses competitive, help cancel and roll back \nwasteful spending, and support the men and women who defend our Nation \nevery day. I hope the full Senate will quickly come to an agreement on \nthe pending amendments and pass this important piece of legislation so \nit can go to the President's desk as soon as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I call for the regular order with respect \nto the Merkley amendment No. 1174.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. That amendment is \nnow the regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Is it necessary to lay aside the pending amendment so I \nmay engage in a colloquy?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no need to do that.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1206\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Senator Levin and Senator McCain, I wish to thank you \nvery much. Before we engage in a colloquy, I simply want to show one \nchart which tells a story as to why Senator Grassley and I are so \npleased the Senators are willing to accept this by voice vote.\n  If I could ask Senator Levin to take a peek at this because I think \nthis tells the story. This is what our military leadership makes, about \n$200,000. This is what the President of the United States as the \nCommander in Chief makes every year. This is what we have limited, and \nthat was a reform, the top five defense contractors to--almost \n$700,000. But all the rest of the contract employees have absolutely no \nlimit and can make $1 million a year. This is from the taxpayers.\n  Senator Grassley and I feel, particularly in these times, but just as \na matter of equity, we can fix it. We are very grateful to the two \nSenators for their willingness. So I would like to enter into a \ncolloquy with Chairman Levin and, of course through him, Ranking Member \nMcCain.\n  I greatly appreciate their willingness to accept the Boxer-Grassley \namendment No. 1206 that limits contractor employees' salaries to no \nmore than the salary of the Commander in Chief, who is, of course, the \nPresident of the United States.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator from California, my great friend, Mrs. Boxer, \nis correct. We are willing to accept the Boxer-Grassley amendment by \nvoice vote.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, there currently is no cap at all on the \namount taxpayers will reimburse contractor employees for compensation \nexcept for just a handful of executives, and that limit is already too \nhigh at $693,951. That is far above what the chief executive of the \nU.S. Government gets paid at $400,000 a year.\n  So that is why we would cap it at no more than what the President can \nget. I presume the Senator from Michigan is aware of that and willing \nto help us on that process by adopting this amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Where would the congressional and staff salaries fit on \nthat?\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is a good question. We would be well below. We would \nbe about here.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. LEVIN. In response to Senator Grassley's question, I am very much \naware of what he referred to.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Senator.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, just in conclusion, did the Senator from \nIowa and I have word from the Senator from Michigan that during \nconference negotiations with the House of Representatives regarding \nthis bill, he will work to ensure that contractor employees are covered \nby a reasonable limit so taxpayers are not on the hook for excessive \nsalary reimbursements?\n  Mr. LEVIN. You do, indeed.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chairman.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I say thank you to the managers of the bill for helping \nus with this very important amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator from California and the Senator from \nIowa for their efforts in this area.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1145\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, first, I wish to start by thanking \nChairman Levin and Senator McCain for their continued dialog on a \nmatter of overseas basing priorities. I very much appreciate their \nefforts to work to get at least the first steps in place for a thorough \nreview of our overseas basing needs and finally getting some answers on \nthe costs of these bases.\n  I also wish to especially thank my colleague from Texas, Senator \nHutchison, for her continued leadership on this issue and for joining \nme on amendment 1145, a bipartisan effort to establish an overseas \nbasing commission.\n  I realize there are concerns that this is not the right time to \nestablish such a commission. However, I think it is the perfect time. \nSo let me reiterate one point I mentioned yesterday. The commission \nwould be charged with saving taxpayers money by identifying potential \nsavings from reevaluating and potentially realigning our overseas \nmilitary base structure and investments.\n  It is time we take some commonsense steps to identify and cut \noverseas military facilities and construction projects that have \nminimal negative impacts on our national security and military \nreadiness. There is no better time than the present to begin this work. \nIn a spirit of compromise and understanding that establishing a \ncommission is not currently acceptable to some, I have worked with my \ncolleagues to include an independent assessment of our overseas basing \nin this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent to speak now as in morning business for 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Payroll Tax Holiday\n\n  Mr. TESTER. What I would like to speak on now is regarding the \npayroll tax votes that we are going to be taking later today or \npossibly even this evening. I wish to tell you exactly why I am going \nto vote against both of these proposals. I believe they are gimmicks, \ndesigned more for political posturing than what Congress ought to be \ndoing right now; that is, working together to create jobs on a long-\nterm basis; to create long-term certainty for businesses throughout \nthis country, Montana included, while we work to cut our deficit.\n  The Democrat's proposal is the same included in the President's \nAmerican Jobs Act, which I voted against several weeks ago. My reasons \nfor voting against that proposal have not changed. It would temporarily \nextend the Social Security payroll tax holiday through 2012 and pay for \nit by raising taxes on the wealthy. Although I support making sure \nmillionaires and corporations pay their fair share in taxes, I do not \nbelieve this particular proposal will create jobs or give our economy \nthe boost it needs right now.\n  A small 1-year temporary tax cut will not give Main Street businesses \nthe long-term certainty they need to grow and hire.\n  The proposal by the Senate Republicans also temporarily extends the \npayroll tax holiday but only by cutting certain Medicare benefits and \ncutting jobs and extending a current pay freeze for our folks who serve \nin public service. Neither of these proposals is right for Montana and \nneither will earn my vote.\n  I want to take you back to a few weeks ago, in November, when \nCongress unanimously passed my veterans jobs bill, called the VOW to \nHire Heroes Act. The President has already signed it into law. I \nbelieve Congress has a responsibility to spend more time passing \nlegislation such as that--real solutions that create real jobs, and not \npolitical theater.\n\n[[Page S8110]]\n\n  I know we can do it. It was appropriate for us to work together for \nthe veterans. It is also appropriate for us to work together to create \njobs for all Americans.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1126\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the second \nFeinstein amendment, No. 1126, I believe. I have the privilege as \nserving as vice chairman on the Intelligence Committee with Chairman \nFeinstein. We have a good working relationship and agree on most every \nissue that comes before the committee. I know the diligence and \nseriousness with which she takes every issue but particularly this one.\n  We have had a number of discussions about the fact that we have a \nlack of a detainee and interrogation policy in this country now, and I \nknow she is concerned about that and is trying to make the situation \nbetter. I remain committed to work with her on a solution.\n  Unfortunately, I am going to have to oppose her amendment today \nbecause of my concerns about the limitation it imposes on the authority \nto detain Americans who have chosen to wage war against America. My \nfirst concern is that it appears, from the debate yesterday, that there \nis confusion among some Members about what this amendment does. For \nexample, my colleague and friend from Illinois, Senator Kirk, argued \nthat he is in favor of robust and flexible U.S. military action \noverseas, including against American citizens such as Anwar al-Awlaqi. \nSenator Kirk said he supports the Feinstein amendment, however, because \nhe believes in a zone of protection for citizens inside the United \nStates.\n  But the Feinstein amendment does not apply to only those American \ncitizens who commit belligerent acts inside the United States; it would \nalso prohibit the long-term military detention of American terrorists \nsuch as Anwar al-Awlaqi, who committed terrorist acts outside the \nUnited States. As a result, this amendment would have the perverse \neffect of allowing American belligerents overseas to be targeted in \nlethal strikes but not held in U.S. military detention until the end of \nhostilities. That makes no sense whatsoever.\n  I am also concerned about the ambiguity in the amendment's language \nand the uncertainty it will cause our operators, especially those \noverseas. The amendment exempts American citizens from detention \nwithout trial until the end of hostilities. But short of the end of \nhostilities, the amendment appears to allow detention without trial. Is \nit the Senator's intent to allow for some long-term detention of \nAmericans without trial?\n  This is troubling because we don't know how the prohibition will be \ninterpreted by our operators or the courts that will hear inevitable \nhabeas challenges. Would the military be permitted to hold a captured \nbelligerent for a month, a few months, or a few years, as long as it \nwas not until the end of hostilities? Or would the military interpret \nthe amendment as a blanket prohibition against military detention of \nAmericans for any period of time? If the military rounded up American \nterrorists such as Adam Gadahn or Adnan Shukrijumah among a group of \nterrorists, would they have to let these Americans go because the \nmilitary would not be permitted to detain them? Would more American \nbelligerents be killed in strikes if capture-and-detain operations were \nperceived to be unlawful? I don't believe we can leave our operators \nwith this kind of uncertainty.\n  Finally, we should all remember the provisions of the National \nDefense Authorization Act do not provide for a new authority to hold \nU.S. citizens in military detention. American citizens can be held in \nmilitary detention under current law. Contrary to some claims that were \nmade yesterday and debated on this floor, these Americans would be \ngiven ample due process through their ability to bring habeas corpus \nchallenges to their detention in Federal court. The Supreme Court has \nheld in the Hamdi case that the detention of enemy combatants without \nthe prospect of criminal charges or trial until the end of hostilities \nis proper under the AUMF and the Constitution. Hamdi is a U.S. citizen. \nThis is not a new concept. In reaching its decision, the Hamdi Court \ncited the World War II case, Ex parte Quirin, in which the Supreme \nCourt held:\n\n       [C]itizenship in the United States as an enemy belligerent \n     does not relieve him from the consequences of a belligerency.\n\n  In conclusion, I understand Senator Feinstein's motivation, but I \njust don't believe this amendment does what she wants it to do, and \nthere will be unintended consequences that could seriously hamper \noverseas capture operations. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to \noppose the Feinstein amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     ATF Fast and Furious Operation\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. For anybody interested in how long I might be, I would \nsay roughly 10 minutes.\n  Mr. President, for nearly a year, I have been investigating the \nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives' operation known \nas Operation Fast and Furious. I have followed up on questions from \nthat investigation as the Senate Judiciary Committee held oversight \nhearings over the past few weeks with both Secretary Janet Napolitano \nand Attorney General Eric Holder. Each of them testified about the \naftermath of the shooting of Border Patrol agent Brian Terry. I have \nsought to clarify with facts some of the half-truths that were said \nduring these meetings.\n  Each claimed they were ignorant of the connection between Agent \nTerry's death and Operation Fast and Furious until my letters with \nwhistleblower allegations brought the connection to light. However, \ndocuments that have come to light in my investigation draw those claims \ninto question. I would like to address a couple of those discrepancies.\n  Secretary Napolitano went to Arizona a few days after Agent Terry's \ndeath. She said she met at that time with the FBI agents and the \nassistant U.S. attorneys looking for the shooters. She also said at \nthat point in time that nobody knew about Fast and Furious. Yet \ndocuments show that many people knew about Fast and Furious on December \n15, the day Agent Terry died.\n  Secretary Napolitano referenced the FBI agents looking for the \nshooters. The head of the FBI field division was present at the \nDecember 15 press conference about Agent Terry's murder. At that very \npress conference the FBI head told a chief assistant U.S. attorney \nabout the connection to an ongoing ATF investigation. That same night, \nU.S. attorney Dennis Burke confirmed that the guns tied back to \nOperation Fast and Furious. These connections were made days before \nSecretary Napolitano's visit at that time. The very purpose of her \nvisit was to find out more about the investigation.\n  So a very important question comes up: The Department of Homeland \nSecurity oversees the Border Patrol. Why wouldn't the Phoenix FBI head \nhave told Secretary Napolitano that the only guns found at the scene of \nAgent Terry's murder were tied to an ongoing ATF investigation?\n  Let's not forget the U.S. Attorney's Office. Secretary Napolitano \nsaid she met with the assistant U.S. attorneys looking for the \nshooters. The chief assistant U.S. attorney for the Tucson office, \nwhich coordinated the Terry investigation, found out about the ATF \nconnection directly from our Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n  So a very important question comes up that needs to be answered: Why \nwould they conceal the Fast and Furious connection from Secretary \nNapolitano days later?\n  The Tucson office is overseen by the U.S. attorney for the District \nof Arizona, Dennis Burke, who confirmed to Tucson that guns came from \nOperation Fast and Furious. When Ms. Napolitano served as Governor of \nArizona,\n\n[[Page S8111]]\n\nMr. Burke served as her chief of staff for 5 years. Secretary \nNapolitano acknowledges that she had conversations with him about the \nmurder of Agent Terry.\n  So a very important question comes up: Why would Mr. Burke conceal \nthe Fast and Furious connection from Secretary Napolitano?\n  Even before Secretary Napolitano came to Arizona, e-mails indicate \nMr. Burke spoke on December 15 with Attorney General Holder's deputy \nchief of Staff, Monte Wilkinson.\n  So a very important question is unanswered: Before finding out about \nAgent Terry, Mr. Burke e-mailed Mr. Wilkinson that he wanted to \n``explain in detail'' about Fast and Furious when they talked. In that \nphone call--and this is a very important question--did U.S. attorney \nBurke tell Mr. Wilkinson about the case's connection to a Border Patrol \nagent's death that very day?\n  The next day, the Deputy Director of the ATF made sure briefing \npapers were prepared about the Operation Fast and Furious connection to \nAgent Terry's death. He sent them to individuals in Washington, DC, in \nthe Deputy Attorney General's Office at the Justice Department. Within \n24 hours, they were forwarded to the Deputy Attorney General. They were \naccompanied by personal e-mails from one of the Deputy Attorney General \nassistants explaining the situation.\n  Two weeks later, that Deputy Attorney General, Gary Grindler, was \nnamed Attorney General Holder's chief of staff. Yet a month and a half \nafter Agent Terry's death, Attorney General Holder was allegedly \nignorant of the Operation Fast and Furious connection to the murder of \nAgent Terry.\n  So a very important question is unanswered: Why wouldn't Mr. Grindler \nbring up these serious problems with Attorney General Holder, either as \nhis Deputy Attorney General or as his chief of staff?\n\n  It is clear that multiple highly placed officials in multiple \nagencies knew almost immediately of the connection between Operation \nFast and Furious and Agent Terry's death.\n  The Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security \nhave failed to adequately explain why Attorney General Holder and \nSecretary Napolitano allegedly remained ignorant of that connection. \nWhether it is the Attorney General or the Secretary or members of their \nstaff, somebody wasn't doing their job. Somebody wasn't serving their \nhigher-ups as they should have been, as proper staff people.\n  In the case of Secretary Napolitano, either she was not entirely \ncandid with me and others or this was a gross breach on the part of \nthose who kept her in the dark. The Border Patrol and the Department of \nHomeland Security lost a man--Agent Terry being murdered. It was their \nright to know the full circumstances surrounding that from people who \nserved under them.\n  No one likes the unpleasant business of having to fess up, but the \nFBI, ATF, and U.S. Attorney's Office owed it to Agent Brian Terry and \nhis family to fully inform the leadership of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. This was the death of a Federal agent involving weapons \nallowed to walk free by another agency in his own government.\n  Let me explain ``walking guns.'' The Federal Government operates \nunder the rule of law, just like all of us have to live under that rule \nof law. There are licensed Federal gun dealers, and Federal gun dealers \nwere encouraged to sell guns illegally to straw buyers and, supposedly, \nfollow those guns across the border to somehow arrest people who were \ninvolved with drug trafficking and other illegal things. Two of these \nguns showed up at the murder scene of Agent Terry. So it is a very \nserious situation that we need to get to the bottom of.\n  If what I have just described, with all these unanswered questions, \nis not enough to brief up to the top of the Department, then I don't \nknow what is. In other words, staff people ought to be doing their job \nor, if staff people were doing their job, then the Congress, in our \nconstitutional job of oversight, is being misled.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from Rhode \nIsland.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n             PAYROLL TAX CUT AND UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION\n\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nextend and expand the payroll tax cut and to fully extend unemployment \ncompensation insurance immediately. The payroll tax cut and full \nextension of unemployment insurance are two of our best tools for \nstrengthening our economic recovery. We must work without let-up to \npass this legislation before year's end.\n  Democrats are doing everything we can to create jobs and solve our \nunemployment crisis. Millions of Americans are still out of work, \nhowever, and looking for a job in the toughest economy since the Great \nDepression. Jobless benefits, which have been essential to millions of \nAmericans as they search for a job, are set to expire at the end of \nthis year.\n  Congress has never failed to extend benefits when unemployment is \nthis high. Unfortunately, right now, Republicans are refusing to fully \nextend unemployment insurance, despite our Nation's 9 percent \nunemployment rate. In extending benefits, we should not do any less for \nthe recently unemployed than we did for those who were unemployed in \nthe last year or two. That is why I introduced the Emergency \nUnemployment Compensation Extension Act of 2011, which fully extends \nFederal support for unemployment insurance through 2012.\n  Extending benefits doesn't just make sense for a person who has been \nlaid off, it makes sense for the economy as a whole. In fact, during \ntoday's hearing in the Senate Banking Committee, a business operator \nrecognized that failing to extend unemployment insurance would have a \nnegative impact on their business. Its was hard for him to quantify, \nbut the sense he has, from operating a very dispersed convenience store \noperation throughout this country, is there would likely be a negative \nimpact.\n  Those impacts will be magnified and multiplied throughout our \neconomy. It will, ironically, cause not just those without jobs to lose \nbenefits, it will also probably lead to further reductions in jobs as \ndemand falls off and the need for employees, particularly in retail \nestablishments, might lessen.\n  That is why, if Congress truly wishes to help strengthen our economy, \nwe need to extend unemployment insurance now. The reason we must fully \nextend unemployment insurance is simple: If people don't have jobs, \nthey can't spend money. If people can't spend money, businesses go \nunder. If businesses fail, more people lose their jobs, and the \ndownward spiral continues.\n  Extending unemployment insurance is not just the right thing to do, \nit is a wise investment with a strong rate of return that will provide \na much needed economic boost to every State across the country.\n  Unemployment is, regrettably, a national crisis. This program will \naddress a nationwide problem, and it will do it in an extraordinarily \ncost-effective way. The CBO has calculated that this has one of best \nreturns on the dollar. The reason we must fully extend unemployment \ninsurance is quite simple. People who are receiving unemployment \nbenefits need that money to pay for groceries, to put some gas in the \ncar, to take care of those immediate expenses. So, as the economists \nwould say, their marginal propensity to consume--i.e., their \nwillingness to take the dollar in and spend it out--is very high. As a \nresult, this program not only helps families who are struggling, it \nalso immediately injects dollars and demand into the economy. These \nprograms have a real benefit.\n  We understand what we have to do to address our unemployment crisis \nand that is to grow the economy, and that means we must create jobs. \nAgain, this program will help stimulate demand, will help keep people \nat work and perhaps even--we hope--put more people to work.\n  When it comes to the efficacy of this program, the bang for the buck, \nit is among the most effective. I referred earlier to some economists--\nin specific terms--Alan Blinder and Mark Zandi\n\n[[Page S8112]]\n\nhave estimated that for every dollar spent on extending unemployment \nbenefits, the economy grows by $1.61. The Economic Policy Institute has \nestimated that failing to extend UI benefits for a year could result in \nthe loss of $72 billion in economic activity for 2012, which impacts \n560,000 jobs across the country. The country cannot afford this hit. We \ncannot afford to miss the opportunity to maintain or create over \n500,000 jobs. We cannot ignore the fact that, in this very critical \nbudget situation, this is one of the most cost-effective ways to \ncontinue to stimulate demand and grow jobs in our country.\n  We also have to understand that we are dealing with a situation that \nis getting to be critical because we are running out of time. These \nbenefits will expire at the end of the year, and we must move forward.\n  I think we can also do something else, and that is to improve this \nprogram. One way to improve it is to adopt a program that is very \neffective in my State of Rhode Island and several other States across \nthe country, and that is work sharing. Work sharing is a voluntary \nprogram that prevents layoffs, it keeps people on the job, it helps \nemployers retain skilled workers, and it strengthens the unemployment \ninsurance system.\n  Over 20 States are utilizing this program. They estimate they saved \n100,000 jobs in 2010 alone. Essentially what it does is it allows an \nemployer--for example--to keep people on the job for 3 out of 5 days of \nthe week, and the other 2 days are compensated for by the Unemployment \nInsurance Fund. The fund saves money, and the employer keeps these \npeople in the workplace with all their skills and all their \ncontributions to the firm. It is a win-win, and it is something over 20 \nStates across this country have embraced. I think it should be \nnational, and we have provisions in legislation I've introduced that \nwould help extend it nationally.\n  Again, we cannot delay. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in \ntaking the needed steps to help our economic recovery and extend our \nunemployment compensation insurance program before the end of this \nyear.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I rise to speak in regard to several \namendments to the Defense authorization bill. First is in regard to the \nnuclear triad and the important role it plays in defense of our Nation \nand security of the world and also in regard to the Global Hawk \nunmanned aerial systems program and the important role it has for our \nforces, both today in our efforts around the world and what it means to \nus in the future.\n  First, in regard to amendment 1279 and the nuclear triad, this \namendment was cosponsored by Senator Tester, Senator Enzi, Senator \nBlunt, Senator Vitter. Also, I ask unanimous consent that my colleague \nfrom North Dakota, Senator Conrad, be included as a cosponsor of the \namendment, as well as Senator Baucus of Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. The amendment declares that the United States should \nmaintain a triad of strategic nuclear delivery systems which includes \nmissiles, bombers, and submarines. It also declares that it is the \nsense of the Senate that the President should budget for the \nmodernization of those systems and the weapons they deliver.\n  Over the past couple of years, numerous statements have been made in \nsupport of the triad. The 2010 Nuclear Posture Review concluded that \nthe United States needs the nuclear triad. The Senate, in its \nresolution of ratification for the New START treaty, declared that the \nUnited States needs the nuclear triad. And President Obama last \nFebruary certified that he intends to modernize the nuclear triad. \nHowever, the administration is now currently conducting a further \nreview of the role nuclear weapons play in defending U.S. national \nsecurity--a miniature Nuclear Posture Review. It is important that the \nSenate reaffirm its commitment to the nuclear triad once again.\n  I am particularly concerned by statements that we can reduce our \nnuclear arsenal significantly below the requirements laid out in the \nNew START treaty. Given the threats we face and the responsibility we \nhave to the American people and to our allies, I believe we must retain \nthe nuclear triad. The reasons are clear and compelling. We need \nmissiles to provide a persistent, dispersed, and cost-effective \ndeterrent. We need submarines to provide an invisible, mobile, and \nsurvivable deterrent. And we need bombers to provide a visible, long-\nrange, recallable deterrent.\n  The bottom line is that the triad provides us with a safe, credible, \nreliable nuclear deterrent that renders any effort to eliminate or \nsidestep our retaliatory capabilities completely meaningless. And those \nbenefits accrue not only to the United States but to our allies as \nwell. The Congressional Strategic Posture Commission, the resolution of \nthe ratification to the New START agreement, and the 2010 Nuclear \nPosture Review all concluded that the United States needs to maintain \nthe triad.\n  The triad was developed out of a need to counter an immense threat \nfrom the Soviet Union, but it now gives us the flexibility to adapt to \nan ever-changing international security environment. And supporting a \ntriad means supporting a program to maintain and enhance the weapons \nand a delivery system that make up the triad.\n  It is very important to point out--particularly given our fiscal \nsituation--that the costs of updating and maintaining the weapons in \nthe triad will not take up a very big percentage of the defense budget, \nparticularly relative to the tremendous security advantages it \nprovides. In fact, General Kehler, the head of Strategic Command, \nrecently indicated his strong support for efforts to preserve the triad \nand modernize each of the associated delivery systems.\n\n  It is tempting to assume that because the Cold War is over, we don't \nneed the nuclear arsenal anymore. In fact, people who defend the \nnuclear arsenal are often accused of being stuck in a cold war mindset. \nThe truth is just the opposite. Only in a cold war mindset would we \nassume Russia is the sole reason we preserve our nuclear arsenal. \nToday, our nuclear deterrent counters a variety of threats that did not \neven exist during the Cold War, and it hedges against the emergence of \nnew nuclear threats.\n  The decades following the end of the Cold War have made nuclear \ndeterrence far more complicated than the old superpower confrontation \nof last century. We must now counter nuclear threats from multiple \nactors around the world.\n  First, consider China. China's military modernization program is \nbuilt on a foundation of a large and growing nuclear arsenal. \nIntelligence estimates suggest that the number of warheads atop Chinese \nICBMs capable of reaching the United States could more than double \nwithin the next 15 years. Recent reports indicate that China is \nfielding four different new nuclear-ready ballistic missiles. China is \nprioritizing the development of mobile land-based ICBMs and submarine-\nlaunched ballistic missiles. China's nuclear posture is also troubling. \nChina has not defined what it would consider a minimum nuclear \ndeterrent, making it difficult to understand the motivations behind \nChina's nuclear force expansion and their modernization efforts.\n  Second, new nuclear powers such as North Korea and Pakistan further \ncomplicate how we calculate our need for deterrence. North Korea has \npursued nuclear weapons using both plutonium and uranium and continues \nto develop long-range ballistic missiles that can threaten the United \nStates. North Korea's nuclear arsenal forces our allies in East Asia--\nespecially South Korea and Japan--to put a premium on the U.S. nuclear \ndeterrent. Pakistan's nuclear weapons greatly complicate the security \nsituation in central Asia and create a serious risk of nuclear \nproliferation. The emergence of these two nuclear powers is a \ncautionary tale about the unpredictable ripple effects of new players \nin the nuclear game and a strong reason why reductions to U.S. \nstrategic forces should only be made with the greatest caution.\n  Third, nuclear proliferation will remain one of our foremost security \nchallenges in the world. The IAEA reports that Iran has been \nresearching and developing nuclear weapons, and it expressed serious \nconcerns about the military dimensions of Iran's nuclear program. Syria \nwas so serious about developing a nuclear weapon--probably with the \nhelp of North Korea and Iran--that in 2007 Israel had to destroy\n\n[[Page S8113]]\n\na Syrian nuclear site. Terrorist groups and other rogue actors also \nseek the development or the acquisition of nuclear arms.\n  And, of course, fourth, we cannot yet forget about Russia. Under the \nprovisions of the New START agreement, Russia can expand its nuclear \nforce rather than pursue reductions. Russia intends to build a new \nheavy ICBM to be available by 2018. Russia expects to build eight new \nnuclear submarines, and it also plans on designing and building a new \nnuclear bomber.\n  We cannot afford to let our nuclear deterrent atrophy in light of so \nmany nuclear threats. Once we lose our nuclear capabilities, it will be \nextremely hard to reconstitute them.\n  We need a reliable and credible nuclear arsenal. We need it to \ndissuade new nations from acquiring nuclear weapons. We need it to \ndeter nuclear powers from using their weapons. And we need it to hold \nenemy arsenals at risk.\n  People may not always stop and think about the demands placed on \nAmerica's nuclear deterrent, but they are real and they are extensive. \nWe have nuclear weapons as a guarantor of the security of the American \nhomeland. Our nuclear arsenal renders any plan to strike the United \nStates with nuclear weapons sheer folly. The investments made over the \nlast several decades continue to pay dividends by creating the space \nwithin which America can address other security threats.\n  Make no mistake, without a large nuclear arsenal other nations would \nmove plans to strike the United States from the category of unthinkable \nto possibly thinkable.\n  Second, and nearly as important, the United States nuclear deterrent \nreplaces the need for our allies to develop or acquire nuclear weapons, \nkeeping the peace in critical regions around the world. East Asia is a \nparticularly good example. The status of U.S. nuclear posture is a \nmajor concern in Japan. Despite assurances from the United States that \nour nuclear umbrella will continue to protect Japan, Tokyo is worried \nabout even the most subtle changes in U.S. policy. During his most \nrecent trip, Secretary Panetta publicly reiterated the U.S. commitment \nto protect South Korea with our nuclear umbrella and our nuclear \ndeterrent is probably the only reason South Korea has not developed a \nnuclear capability in response to North Korea's nuclear programs.\n  I will conclude on the triad. Our nuclear deterrent has been the \nfoundation of U.S. national security since World War II. The nuclear \ntriad provides an incredible return on our investment and I urge the \nSenate to send a strong signal of support for the nuclear triad as laid \nout in amendment No. 1279.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1358\n\n  Madam President, if I may very briefly also address the importance of \nthe Global Hawk with a brief overview of amendment No. 1358. This \namendment simply states that it is the sense of Congress that the \nSecretary of the Air Force should continue to abide by the guidelines \nset forth in the acquisition decision memorandum issued June 14, 2011 \nfrom the Office of the Secretary of Defense. That memorandum on Global \nHawk, the RQ-4 Global Hawk, found that the Global Hawk UAS is essential \nto national security and that there is no other program that can \nprovide the benefits to the warfighter that the Global Hawk can \nprovide.\n  The Global Hawk is a vital intelligence surveillance and \nreconnaissance asset. The Global Hawk flies at high altitude. It can \nfly at extended ranges and for long periods of time, and it can carry a \nwide array of sensors simultaneously.\n  We have invested a lot of time and a lot of money in this platform \nand it is paying fast dividends. The Global Hawk is flown in a wide \nvariety of missions all over the world in support for things such as \nCENTCOM operations, humanitarian relief efforts in Japan and Haiti, and \nextensively for operations in Libya. For these reasons and many more, \nmy amendment stresses that the Air Force must continue to heed the \nconclusions of the June 14, 2011 acquisition decision memorandum on the \nRQ-4 Program. The RQ-4, which is Global Hawk, remains essential for \nUnited States national security and is irreplaceable.\n  The bottom line is America needs to support and continue the Global \nHawk. Our commanders require as much information about the battlefield \nas they can get. The RQ-4 represents a new generation of ISR aircraft \nwith unprecedented capabilities.\n  Finally, we must invest in this essential capacity precisely because \nbudgets are tight. As the Pentagon concluded in June, the Global Hawk \nrepresents the most cost-effective way to meet the requirements of our \nwarfighters now and in the future.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1274\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I wish to address amendment 1274, \nwhich would clarify what I believe is existing law that the President \nhas authority to continue to detain an enemy combatant under the law of \nwar, following a trial before a military commission or an article III \ncourt, and regardless of the outcome of that trial. Let me explain what \nI mean.\n  As I said yesterday, even under the law of war the President has the \nauthority to detain an enemy combatant, a prisoner of war, a captured \nenemy soldier, a belligerent. The President can detain him through the \nduration of the hostilities. The President is not required--the \nCommander in Chief is not required to release an individual whose sworn \nduty it is to return to his military outfit and commence hostilities \nagain against the United States. That individual could be killed on the \nbattlefield, but if captured, you are not required, under all laws of \nwar that I am aware of and certainly the Geneva Conventions--you can \nmaintain that individual in custody to prevent him from attacking you. \nBut you can also try an individual who has been captured if that \nindividual violated the rules of war.\n  For example, a decent soldier from Germany--many of them were held in \nmy State of Alabama. They behaved well. They made paintings of American \ncitizens, they did a lot of things, and did not cause a lot of trouble. \nThey were in uniform and they complied with the rules of war and they \nwere not tried as illegal enemy combatants.\n  But many of the terrorists today do not wear uniforms, deliberately \ntarget innocent men, women, and children, and deliberately violate \nmultiple rules of war. Those individuals are subject, in addition to \nbeing held as a combatant, as an unlawful combatant. They can be \nprosecuted and they should be prosecuted. In World War II a group of \nNazi saboteurs in the Ex parte Quirin case were let out of a submarine \noff, I think, of Long Island. They came into the country with plans to \nsabotage the United States. They were captured and tried by military \ncommissions. Several were American citizens. A number of them--most of \nthem, frankly--after being tried and convicted, were executed. The \nSupreme Court of the United States approved that procedure.\n  But recent cases demonstrate the potential problem we have today. One \nGuantanamo Bay detainee has already raised the question I have \ndiscussed before the military commission where he is being tried. Abd \nal-Rahim al-Nashiri, the alleged mastermind of the USS Cole bombing, \nwas arraigned before a military commission on November 9. He was held \nnot only as an al-Qaida, or a belligerent against the United States, \nbut he was charged with a violation of the rules of war.\n  This was a group that sneaked into the harbor pretending to be \ninnocent people and ran their boat against the Cole, killing a number \nof U.S. sailors.\n  I remember being at a christening of one of the Navy ships at Norfolk \nnot long after this. I walked out of that area and I heard one of the \nsailors cry out: Remember the Cole. The hair still stands up on my neck \nwhen I hear it.\n  We have an obligation to defend our men and women in uniform. When \nthey are out on the high sea or they are in a neutral port, they expect \nto be treated according to the laws of war and then they are murdered \nby an individual such as this.\n\n  This individual's lawyers filed a motion asking the military judge to \nclarify the effect of an acquittal, should the commission acquit him. \nHe argued that the members of the committee had a right to know what \nwould happen if he were acquitted because they might object to taking \npart in what he called a show trial if it turned out that he would \ncontinue to be detained at Guantanamo Bay.\n\n[[Page S8114]]\n\n  There is another case in which the administration was almost \nconfronted with the problem a year ago, in the case of a former \nGuantanamo detainee, an al-Qaida member named Ahmed Ghailani, who was \nresponsible for the 1998 embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. Most \nof us remember those early al-Qaida bombings against our embassies in \nAfrica.\n  After the Justice Department chose to prosecute Ghailani in an \narticle III civilian court and directed the United States Attorney not \nto seek the death penalty--I am not sure why that ever happened; we \ndon't know--but the jury acquitted him on 284 out of 285 counts. \nLuckily, he received a life sentence on the single count of conspiracy, \nfor which he was convicted.\n  But what if he had not been convicted? What if there was insufficient \nevidence to prove he committed a crime, but not insufficient evidence \nto prove he was a combatant against the United States? Al-Qaida has \ndeclared war against the United States, officially and openly. The U.S. \nCongress has authorized the use of military force against al-Qaida, \nwhich is the equivalent of a declaration of war.\n  What if he had received a modest sentence after being convicted and \nhad credit for time served? What if he had been acquitted on all 285 \ncounts? Would the President have been required to release him into the \nUnited States, if the government could not get some country to take \nhim? That would be wrong. He was at war against the United States. He \nwas a combatant against the United States. Like any other captured \ncombatant, he can be held as long as the hostilities continue.\n  By the way, let me note, military commissions are open. If they \ndecide to try one of these individuals--not just hold him as a prisoner \nof war but hold him and try him for violation of the laws of war--they \nget lawyers, they get procedural rights. The Supreme Court has \nestablished what those rights are. Congress has passed laws \neffectuating what the Supreme Court said these trials should consist \nof, and a mechanism has been set up to fairly try them.\n  But enemy combatants are not common criminals. If a bank robber is \ndenied bail, he remains in jail awaiting a trial, a speedy public \ntrial, with government-paid lawyers. Enemy combatants are not sitting \nin Guantanamo Bay awaiting trial by a military commission, or by an \narticle III court. They are held in military custody precisely because \nthey are enemies, combatants against the United States. They should \ncontinue to be held there as long as the war continues and as long as \nthey do not remain a threat to return to the battlefield against the \nUnited States.\n  This is an important point, considering that 27 percent of the former \nGuantanamo detainees who have been released--161 out of 600--have \nreturned to the battlefield, attacked Americans. This Nation has no \nobligation to release captured enemy prisoners of war when we know for \nan absolute fact that 27 percent of them have returned to war against \nthe United States. How many others have but we do not have proof of it? \nThat is what the whole history of warfare is.\n  Lincoln ceased exchanging prisoners with the South after he realized \nthey had more soldiers in the South. It was not to his advantage to \nrelease captured southern soldiers who would return to the fighting, so \nhe held them until the war was over. Under the laws of war, the \nPresident has the authority to prevent an enemy combatant from \nreturning to the battlefield. That is consistent with all history.\n  This amendment--please, Senators, I hope you would note--would make \nit clear that the President simply has authority to continue to detain \nenemy combatants held pursuant to the rules of war, even though they \nmay have been tried, regardless of where that trial would be held and \nwhat the outcome was, as long as, of course, they could prove they were \nan enemy combatant and violating the rules of war.\n  I would note one thing.\n  I see my friend, the Senator from California, is here and probably is \nready to speak.\n  On the question of citizenship, can a citizen be held in this \nfashion? The Supreme Court has clearly held they may. But the Senator \nis offering legislation that might change that. My amendment does not \nanswer that question. It simply says a combatant should be able to be \nheld under the standard of a prisoner of war, a combatant, even if they \nhad been prosecuted for violation of the laws of war and acquitted.\n  It is common sense. I believe the courts will hold that, but it is an \nissue that is out there. I think Congress would do well to settle it \ntoday.\n  I urge my colleagues to do so.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor. I note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, in a few moments, Senator McCain and I \nwill be seeking unanimous consent that the following pending and \ngermane amendments be considered en bloc, that the amendments be \nmodified with the changes that are at the desk where applicable: Begich \n1114, as modified; McCain 1220; Reed of Rhode Island 1146, as modified; \nLevin 1293, as modified; Boxer 1206; Chambliss 1304, as modified; Pryor \n1151; Nelson of Florida 1236; Blunt 1133; Murkowski 1287.\n  Further, that the amendments be agreed to en bloc--we are not making \nthat request now. We will be making that request in a few minutes. This \nis not the so-called managers' package, by the way. These are the \npending germane amendments which have been before us for some time but \nwhich we believe have now been cleared, and there is no opposition; \nhowever, if there is, there is an opportunity for people to come down.\n  I would yield now to my friend from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, I \nthank my friend. I believe the Senator overlooked Brown of \nMassachusetts amendment No. 1090, I think, was agreed to be a part of \nthat.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That was not on my sheet, but that is fine, and that would \nbe added.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I note the presence of our friend from Texas, who would \nlike to voice his objections to the package of amendments which is \npending which have been agreed by both sides because of his concerns \nabout a particular amendment he had. I would like to hear from him in a \nminute.\n  I would like to say to my colleagues on this side of the aisle, if \nyou have an objection, please come to the floor. We would intend to \nvote--or seek approval of what the distinguished chairman just \nproposed--at 5 after the hour. That gives them 15 minutes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, is there a unanimous consent request \npending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is not.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Thank you for clarification. I just wanted to make sure.\n  Madam President, I discussed with the distinguished chairman of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee and the distinguished ranking member my \nconcerns that earlier I attempted to gain unanimous consent to modify \nmy amendment regarding the sale of F-16s to Taiwan in order to make it \ngermane. I was happy to do that in order to get a vote, but the \nchairman tells me there is an objection to that.\n  I wished to make clear that any amendment that is offered--whether \nnow in this list or subsequently in the managers' package or \notherwise--and is being treated differently than mine is, then I am \ngoing to object to unanimous consent.\n  Through the Chair, I would ask the distinguished chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee are there any amendments on this list that \nwere modified in order to make them germane?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I doublechecked on this. The answer is no, and that is \nabout as directly as I can say it. I checked with staff and the staff \nsays they have been modified--in many cases as I indicated--but none in \norder to make them germane.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I appreciate the direct response from \nthe chairman. I will have no objection to\n\n[[Page S8115]]\n\nany amendment that is being offered that is not being offered as \nmodified in order to make it germane. I hope my point is clear as mud.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I just wish to say I strongly support the amendment by \nthe Senator from Texas, and I will do everything I can to see that this \nissue is raised. I cannot comprehend why we would not want to provide \none of our closest allies with the equipment they need to defend \nthemselves with the growingly aggressive mainland China exhibiting the \ncharacteristics of intimidation and bullying and perhaps threatening \nTaiwan.\n  I wished to state, first of all, my appreciation to both Senators \nfrom Texas, who have been very involved in this issue, and I wish to \ntell them I will do everything I can to make sure this amendment is \nadopted. We do need to send the signal that we support our friends.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I join with Senator McCain in support \nof Senator Cornyn's amendment. Taiwan has been a strong ally of the \nUnited States. Senator McCain said we would provide them military \naircraft, but, in truth, they would buy it. They are our allies. They \nare friends. They are prepared to purchase from an American company \nlegitimate military equipment that they could use to help maintain the \nfreedom they have cherished on the island, and it is hard for me to \nunderstand how that would be objected to.\n  I just wish to say, as someone who has looked at these issues for \nsome time as a member of the Armed Services Committee, I do believe \nSenator Cornyn--also a member of that committee--is correct, and I \nstrongly support the amendment and urge my colleagues to vote for it, \nif and when we can get a vote.\n  I thank the Chair, yield the floor, and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1090\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. I have an amendment that has been \naccepted--almost--sort of kind of accepted--amendment No. 1090, which I \nwould like to discuss briefly.\n  I thank Senators Wyden and Coons for their bipartisan leadership as \ncosponsors of this amendment. I believe we are going to vote on it \nshortly, and I ask that it be accepted, either by vote or by unanimous \nconsent.\n  It is a simple amendment that will make sure the National Guardsmen \nwho get deployed will receive the housing allowances they need and \ndeserve. This is a bipartisan amendment. The Defense Department has \nagreed that the situation needs to be fixed--something that recently \nwas developed.\n  There is a little bit of history behind this, but I don't think it is \nimportant because Senator Wyden and Senator Coons and I have taken the \nlead on this issue, which is critically important to providing the \nfunds that have been taken merely by a change in the regulations. This \nhas happened at a time, quite frankly, when our men and women who are \nfighting need that money.\n  I am offering this amendment as a result of a bill I introduced last \nSeptember, entitled the ``National Guard Basic Allowance for Housing \nEquity Act.'' I introduced this legislation to fix an inequity that \nhurts National Guardsmen who are deployed. Merely as a result of their \ndeployment, they could lose upward of $1,000 per month in their monthly \nhousing allowance.\n  Basic Allowance for Housing, or BAH, is a benefit paid to members of \nthe military to help offset the cost of local housing markets. When a \nservicemember is deployed, for example, BAH is necessary to help offset \nthe cost of a mortgage or rent in a particular geographic area. \nEveryone in the military, especially families, rely on this benefit. \nThis benefit is especially critical when servicemembers deploy because, \nas we know, the spouse is often at home and she or he is responsible \nfor taking care of the bills.\n  What would my colleagues say if I said that because you are ordered \nto deploy to Afghanistan, for example, the Department of Defense is \ngoing to withhold $1,000 or more from your monthly housing allowance, a \nhuge piece of your total household income--upward of $12,000 or more \nper year--because of a new policy interpretation? That is right. It is \nmerely a new policy interpretation.\n  Because of a DOD oversight, over 800 Guardsmen--some even in the \nPresiding Officer's State and 40 in Massachusetts who are deployed to \nAfghanistan right now--are losing, in the middle of the battle, up to \n$1,000 per month in their housing allowance because they were ordered \nto deploy.\n  Title X mandates that full-time Guardsmen, when ordered to Active \nDuty for a contingency operation, even if there is no break in their \nactive Federal service, must revert back to their home-of-record status \nrather than their current duty station. Because of this change in \nstatus, it alters a guardsman's basic allowance for housing on their \nmonthly pay stub. Basically, guardsmen are being punished for being \ndeployed to a war zone.\n  For example, take a full-time guardsman who is from Worcester. He \ncalls Worcester, MA, home and probably votes there, but he is stationed \nin Washington, DC, let's say right down the street at the Pentagon. So \nhe or she earns a housing allowance based on the cost of living in DC \nand, as we all know, it is higher than in Worcester, MA. Sounds pretty \nnormal, pretty straightforward, right?\n  This guardsman is then ordered to Active Duty--to Federal status--for \nthe purpose of deploying overseas. A new housing allowance rate kicks \nin that is based on his home of record back in Worcester, not where he \nor she was actually stationed, here in D.C.\n  As a result, the guardsman and his family immediately start losing up \nto $1,000 per month because of that deployment to serve their country. \nSo full-time guardsmen are entitled to the BAH rate they are receiving \nat the duty station because it is where they and their dependents live, \nand that is often where the spouses will reside until that \nservicemember comes back. Obviously, family members are not going back \nto Worcester while the guardsman is stationed at the Pentagon or here \nin D.C.\n  This is not right. It is something DOD agrees with. Senator Wyden and \nSenator Coons concur, and I appreciate their bipartisanship in moving \nthis forward. I am all about finding savings, but the good thing is \nthat this is no cost to the government. It is already budgeted in the \nDOD budget. I am not into savings that treat our service men and women \nunfairly.\n  So my amendment provides a simple, noncontroversial fix. It is \ngermane. It is relevant. It helps people who are serving our country \nright now. It is bipartisan. It is how we should do things around here.\n  I am glad the DOD has realized this is a problem, and I hope my \ncolleagues will move forward in a manner to make our citizens proud.\n  I wish to thank Senator McCain for his effort in getting this \nimportant matter to our guardsmen who are serving presently overseas. \nIt is a testament to his diligence. I thank Chairman Levin for putting \nup with the problems over the last few days, but it is important to the \npeople. It is not about politics; it is about serving our men and \nwomen.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1206\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, at a time when the national security \nbudget is under immense pressure, it is vitally important that we spend \nour defense dollars more wisely.\n  The Boxer-Grassley amendment will contain runaway spending in \ncontractor salary reimbursements. Notice that I said ``salary \nreimbursements,'' not salaries.\n  Someone not familiar with government contracting might ask why it's \nany of our business what government contractors get paid, and I would \nagree if we're talking about what their company pays them out of its \nown pocket.\n  When most people hire a contractor to renovate their bathroom or re-\nshingle their roof, they find the one that does the best work for the \nleast cost.\n\n[[Page S8116]]\n\n  Having done that, you are not likely to ask or care what their cut is \nor what they pay their crew.\n  To the extent that government contracts work the same way, the same \nprinciple applies. Unfortunately, not all government contracts do work \nthat way.\n  A large proportion of government contracts actually reimburse the \ncontractor directly for the costs they incur, including for the \nsalaries of their employees. These types of contracts are risky because \ncontractors lose the incentive to control costs. They are only supposed \nto be used when a fixed price contract is not possible for instance, if \nthe scope or duration of the work is not possible to determine at the \noutset.\n  Nevertheless, cost-reimbursement type contracts are used extensively \nby Federal departments and agencies.\n  The Defense Department alone accounted for over $100 billion in cost \nreimbursement type contracts in fiscal year 2010.\n  President Obama has criticized the widespread use of these types of \ncontracts and has set a goal of slowing the growth and ultimately \nreducing their use.\n  He has made a little progress. However, we are talking about a small \ndent in a large bucket.\n  It's clear that cost type contracts are going to account for a major \nproportion of the dollars spent on federal contracting for the \nforeseeable future. As a result, we must take steps to limit \nunreasonable expenditures under these types of contracts.\n  Senator Boxer and I worked together to try to head off this problem \nback in 1997.\n  At that time, we proposed capping salary reimbursements at the salary \nlevel of the President of the United States.\n  However, a compromise was ultimately enacted that capped how much the \ntop 5 highest earning contractor executives could charge the federal \ngovernment for their salaries.\n  The cap was set at the median salary of the top five executives at \ncompanies with annual sales over $50 million, which must be \nrecalculated annually.\n  Since that time, the cap has more than doubled from $340,650 to \n$693,951. That's 53 percent faster than the rate of inflation.\n  The House-passed version of the National Defense Authorization bill \nexpands the current cap to all contractor employees, not merely the top \nfive executives, closing a loophole that was being exploited.\n  The version of the DoD Bill before the Senate extends the cap only to \nthe top 10 to 15 executives.\n  However, Senator Boxer and I think it's time to reconsider a fixed \ncap at the level of the President's salary, which I should add was \ndoubled by Congress to $400,000 since our previous proposal.\n  That is more than generous.\n  Surely the taxpayers should not be asked to pay the salary of a \ncontractor more than the President makes, which is twice what any \ncabinet secretary makes.\n  Keep in mind that this cap just limits how much Uncle Sam can be \nbilled for, which is on top of whatever the company chooses to pay its \nemployees out of its own pocket.\n  Not only would our straightforward cap save man-hours in the Office \nof Federal Procurement Policy, which has to gather the data every year \nto determine the current convoluted cap, but it would save millions of \ndollars that need not be spent.\n  Again, we cannot afford to go on wasting our increasingly limited \ndefense dollars.\n  We have to be more aggressive in weeding out waste in defense \nspending and this is one unnecessary expenditure that we can easily \neliminate in favor of higher priorities.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in this commonsense cost cutting \nmeasure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts \nfor his amendment. He has spent a great deal of time in his life \nserving in the National Guard, including spending time in Afghanistan \nrecently. He understands the burdens our National Guard men and women \nbear. I am very grateful for his careful attention to their needs. This \nis clearly an issue that needed to be addressed. We are proud to have \nit as part of our legislation.\n  Again, my thanks to the Senator from Massachusetts as well as to my \nfriend, Chairman Levin, for helping make this amendment possible.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n Amendments Nos. 1114, as Modified; 1220; 1146, as Modified; 1293, as \nModified; 1206; 1304, as Modified; 1151, 1236, 1133, as Modified; 1287, \n                   as Modified; and 1090, as Modified\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    National Flood Insurance Program\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I come to the Senate floor to discuss \nanother very important issue for our economy, which is the National \nFlood Insurance Program.\n  The National Flood Insurance Program is a vital Federal program that \nhelps provide flood insurance for properties all across the country. It \nis absolutely vital to citizens and to our economy, to the real estate \nmarket, to closings which cannot happen without this type of insurance \nin many instances. It is important all across the country. It is \nnowhere more important than in Louisiana, which, unfortunately, has \npretty severe flooding risks.\n  In the last few years, we have extended this necessary and important \nprogram but sometimes with real fits and starts and even lapses of the \nprogram. As you know, Madam President, in 2010, it got worse than ever. \nCongress allowed the National Flood Insurance Program to lapse four \ntimes--for a total of 53 days--for no good reason. It was not a money \nissue; it was not a cost issue; it was not a deficit issue because \ncontinuation of the program along the current structure does not raise \ndeficit and debt. But we had these deadlines that kept approaching, and \nwe let, in many instances--in four instances--the deadline actually \ncome and the program to lapse--four times in 2010, for a total of 53 \ndays.\n  That had enormous negative consequences. Real estate closings that \nwere scheduled to happen had to be canceled. Here we are in the middle \nof a horrendous recession--clearly the worst since World War II--led by \nproblems in the real estate market, and we had good, solid real estate \nclosings which had to be put off and canceled for no good reason. \nReally crazy.\n  We learned a little bit from that experience, and this year, in 2011, \nwe have done better. We have continued the program without lapse. But I \nam afraid we are getting back into this habit of extremely short-term \nextensions, which brings with it the threat of lapses. We extended the \nprogram a few weeks ago, but we only extended it for the duration of \nthe current CR, until this December 16. So, again, the program is set \nto completely expire nationwide this December 16.\n  The ultimate solution is a long-term, full reauthorization of the \nflood insurance program. I support that full 6-year bill, and we have \nvoted out of the Senate Banking Committee a full, long-term, 6-year \nreauthorization bill. However, that is not going to pass into law \nbetween now and December 16, and it is pretty clear it is not going to \npass into law for several months.\n  That is why I am urging all of us to come together in a bipartisan \nfashion in the meantime to pass a clean extension of the program for \nthe remainder of this fiscal year, through September 30, 2012, or for \nsome significantly long time within that year. I think that is needed \nright now to assure the real estate market there will not be \ndisruptions, to take that threat and that uncertainty out of the market \nand out of the line of closings, that we want to encourage, we want to \nbuild, as we try to build up the real estate market and the economy in \ngeneral.\n  Because I believe this is clearly the right path, I have done two \nthings. First, I have filed that extension, that clean extension--a \nbill under my name--through September 30, 2012. This is very similar to \nthe extension we passed in late 2010 to get us through that fiscal year \nto September 30, 2011. That was my bill. We passed it unanimously here \nin the Senate, again, to avoid these deadlines and disruptions, which \nhamper economic recovery. So I filed that bill. That would be a clean \nextension of the program through September 30, 2012.\n  The second thing I did today is write Senator Reid, the majority \nleader, and ask him to focus on this important program and the need for \nthis extension as soon as possible, and to hotline it through the \nSenate, to ask for unanimous consent from both sides, all Members, as \nwe did about a year ago, pass this so we extend this important, vital \nprogram through September 30, 2012, or some similar, significant \ntimeframe.\n  Again, I wrote Senator Reid today to highlight this need. I will be \nfollowing up with him. I have already followed up and talked to many \nother interested Members, starting with those leaders on the Banking \nCommittee under whose jurisdiction this falls.\n  This should be a no-brainer. This should be a completely nonpartisan \nor bipartisan exercise. This is not some big ideological dispute. This \nis simply extending, continuing a vital, necessary program without in \nany way increasing deficit and debt, in a way that we take out \nuncertainty, take out the specter of this necessary program lapsing yet \nagain, as it did four times in 2010, for a total of 53 days.\n  We cannot let this lapse. And, quite frankly, we should not even go \nnear the deadline before we extend it because that in and of itself--\neven if we do not technically allow it to lapse--creates uncertainty \nand chaos in the real estate market and disrupts real estate closings.\n  We need every good real estate transaction we can get. We need every \nbit of additional economic activity we can get in this horrible \neconomy, this recession that was led by a bad real estate market. We \nneed to lead recovery with a recovering real estate market. So let's do \nthis in a simple, straightforward, commonsense, bipartisan way in that \neffort. We did it around my bill in that nearly full-year extension \nabout a year ago. Let's do it again.\n  In closing, I want to underscore I am fully committed to the full, \ndetailed 6-year reauthorization bill. It has come out of the Senate \nBanking Committee. It needs to pass through the Senate. We need to \nresolve differences with the House. We need to pass that into law. But \nthat is not going to happen between now and December 16, and it is not \ngoing to happen for several months. So, in the meantime, let's remove \nthe threat of disruption, of lapses in the program, of uncertainty. All \nof that is extremely harmful in this very fragile economy.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Keystone XL Pipeline\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, yesterday a number of us--I think the \nnumber now is somewhere in the 37-to-38 ballpark of Senators--\nintroduced legislation to expedite consideration of the Keystone XL \nPipeline. What is interesting to me about all of this is that this is a \nproject that has been literally reviewed and analyzed and studied and \nscrutinized now for the better part of 3 years.\n  In fact, they have had two comprehensive environmental evaluations \nand 3 years of study and review. Then, just recently, the Obama \nadministration deferred a decision on the permit until after the 2012 \nelections, essentially putting off the decision for about 18 months.\n  Well, what is ironic and sort of interesting about that is this is a \nproject which--after having been carefully vetted for the past 3 years, \ncarefully reviewed, carefully studied, all of the environmental impact \nanalysis done--would lead to all kinds of economic development for this \ncountry and job creation in many of the States that are impacted.\n  Our State of South Dakota happens to be one of those. The pipeline \ntraverses South Dakota as it heads down to refineries in other places \nin the country. But it would benefit my State by generating significant \namounts of State and local tax revenue, revenue that is much needed by \nmany of the\n\n[[Page S8119]]\n\nlocal jurisdictions: school districts, counties, municipalities in the \nState of South Dakota.\n  So there is a tremendous benefit to the construction of this pipeline \nto the various States that are impacted simply as a result of the \nadditional tax revenue that would be raised by it. Add to that, in my \nState of South Dakota, the hundreds of jobs that would be created, the \nhalf billion dollars of economic activity that it would generate--and \nthis is very clear, from the State of South Dakota's standpoint, which \nis why I believe our Governor has weighed in behind this project, that \nthis is something that ought to at least be decided. There is no reason \nwhy, no rational reason why, no logical reason why this project would \nbe delayed for 18 months simply to get past the next election.\n  All of the work has been done. It seems to me at least there ought to \nbe a decision made. We are talking about a $7 billion investment in \nthis country and partly in Canada to get from where the oil sands are \nto get the oil to the refineries in the United States. If we look at \nthe overall, as I said, economic impact, number of jobs created, it is \npretty impressive--20,000 jobs, I think, is the estimate that it would \ncreate in this country.\n  Those are jobs that, frankly, many of these States could certainly \nbenefit from. Not to mention the fact that we are doing business with \nsomeone who is favorable and friendly to us. Canada is our biggest \ntrading partner. I think we do about $640 billion annually in bilateral \ntrade with Canada. Canada is a country with which we have a very good, \nstrong trading relationship. It strikes me at least that if we are \ngoing to get oil from somewhere, it makes sense to get it from a \ncountry such as Canada as opposed to some of the other countries around \nthe world that are much less friendly to the United States.\n  In fact, the Keystone XL Pipeline would transport daily about 700,000 \nbarrels of oil that would come through that pipeline. That is the \nequivalent of the amount that we get on a daily basis from Venezuela.\n  So if you are thinking about getting 700,000 barrels of oil from \nsomewhere in the world, would it not make more sense to get it from \nCanada as opposed to Venezuela? I think in terms of what it does for \nour energy independence, for our energy security, dealing with a \nfriendly nation, and making it more possible for our country to become \nless dependent upon foreign countries for this energy we need, it \nstrikes me that at least this particular project makes a lot of sense.\n  You have not only the economic impact, in terms of the activity it \nwould create in the various States that would be impacted by it, the \nnumber of jobs created--as I said, 20,000 jobs is the estimate, with a \n$7 billion initial investment--and all the tax revenue generated for \nState and local government along the way, but wouldn't it be nice if \nthe United States got into the situation where we were actually an \nenergy exporter?\n  Believe it or not, this is the first year in the last 62 years--and \nthis is according to a story that ran in the Wall Street Journal \nyesterday--according to data released by the U.S. Energy Information \nAdministration on Tuesday, the United States has sent abroad 753.4 \nmillion barrels of everything from gasoline to jet fuel in the first 9 \nmonths of this year, while it imported 689.4 million barrels. That \nmeans that, for the first time in 62 years, in 2011--if this trend \ncontinues--and it looks as though it will--we will have exported more \nenergy than we imported. We are still a net importer of petroleum, or \noil. Hopefully, we can change that in the future by developing these \nresources we have in this country, one of which is the Bakken Reserve \nin North Dakota, which is generating enormous amounts of oil for this \ncountry. So we are still a net oil importer.\n  In terms of refined gasoline and other products--refined energy--for \nthe first time in 62 years, in 2011, we may be a net exporter of \nenergy. I think that is an amazing data point, and it suggests this is \nsomething that could benefit enormously the American economy. Well, in \norder for that to happen, we have to have those resources we can get \nfrom the oil sands in Canada and bring them into the United States, \nwhere they are refined here and then either used here or sent abroad. \nBut it is a way we can generate additional economic activity and jobs \nfor our economy.\n  This is a quote from the Global Director of Oil, which tracks energy \nmarkets. He said this trend we are going to see this year, 2011--again, \nfirst time in 62 years we will be a net exporter of energy--he says it \nlooks like a trend that could stay in place for the rest of the decade. \nThat is a remarkable change in terms of the flow of energy from this \ncountry. The last time we were a net exporter of energy was during \nWorld War II and shortly thereafter. It has been over 60 years.\n  That is what a project such as this could do for our country--not \njust the immediate impact on those States through which this pipeline \nwould traverse, in terms of the tax revenue that would be generated for \nState and local governments, but you also have the economic activity it \ncreates in those States, the jobs it creates in those States, and what \nit does in order to move us increasingly away from dependence upon \nother countries in the world with whom we have, at best, shaky \nrelationships to start with.\n  Doing business with our largest trading partner--a country with which \nwe do enormous amounts of trade every single year--seems to me at least \nto be a much better solution to this country's energy needs than is \ngetting that same amount of energy from other countries around the \nworld.\n  Madam President, 700,000 barrels a day is what the pipeline would \ntransport into this country. That is the equivalent that we get on a \ndaily basis from Venezuela. This is a project that ought to be decided. \nWhether it is decided affirmatively--obviously, as you can tell, I \nbelieve it should be. There are people in South Dakota who are opposed \nto this. There have been ample opportunities for public forums and \nhearings for people to comment on it. There have been lots of \nopportunities for those opposed to it to weigh in.\n  Notwithstanding that, again, all the analyses have been done, the \nreview done, and the studies are now completed, and they have indicated \nthere is no reason for this not to move forward--particularly given the \nfact that the State of Nebraska has negotiated with TransCanada, the \nbuilder of the pipeline, an agreement that would take it in a different \ndirection through that State. All those hoops have been gone through, \nand the hurdles have been cleared. There isn't a reason why this should \nbe delayed another 18 months until after the next Presidential \nelection--other than, purely and simply, for political reasons.\n  I hope we will be able to get good, strong support in the Senate for \nthis legislation that would allow this to be decided in a more \nimmediate timeframe. As I said, right now, the administration has \npunted until after the next election, 18 months down the road. This \nlegislation would enable this to be decided in the next couple of \nmonths--the next 60 days or so--subject, obviously, to some \nrequirements that are in there--obviously, the strongest environmental \nrequirements. But all that having been reviewed and having been \naccomplished, it is time for a decision on this important project.\n  I hope we can get strong support in the Senate for this legislation. \nIt has been introduced by a number of my colleagues, including the \nSenator from North Dakota, Senator Hoeven, Senator Johanns from \nNebraska, Senator Murkowski from Alaska, and a number of others. I am a \ncosponsor. At last count, I think it has somewhere along the lines of \n37 or 38 cosponsors. Incidentally, it passed in the House of \nRepresentatives already. So there is a vehicle out there that has \npassed one body of Congress. It is my hope we will be able to get \naction here in the Senate, and that it might be something we can do \nthat would have an immediate impact on jobs.\n  We always talk about shovel-ready projects. This is a shovel-ready \nproject. This is ready to go. They are ready to start construction of \nthis project. It has been through in the last 3 years all of the \nprocess this government can require it to go through in order to make \nsure this project should move forward.\n  I think it is important for this body to act on this legislation and \nallow us to get to where we can get a decision on this project that \nwill lead to more\n\n[[Page S8120]]\n\neconomic activity, more economic impact, more jobs for Americans, more \nenergy security for this country, and hopefully, at the end of the day, \na lessening of the dangerous dependence we have on foreign sources of \nenergy, which we want to get away from. I think it is a win-win. I \ncongratulate the sponsors of the legislation for the thoughtful way \nthey have considered this and put this legislation together. I hope it \ngets consideration in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We have endured despite \nthe Civil War, the Great Depression, the two World Wars we have been \nin, the assassination of leaders, and the slaughter of innocents by \nterrorists. This great Nation of ours has confronted racism and civil \nunrest and political scandal at all levels, and always we have endured.\n  In the throes of the Great Depression, the words of President \nRoosevelt reassured most Americans when he said:\n\n       This great Nation will endure as it has endured. It will \n     revive and it will prosper.\n\n  Today, we are once again walking a rugged path, and the most recent \nexample of the failure of the supercommittee has been the latest crash \ncaused by super-rigid ideology and hyperpolitical partisanship. Truth \nbe told, we are in a most difficult time in our Nation's economic \nlife--still facing a decision of how to pay for an enormous debt. We \nowe this money mostly due to the misconduct of the money changers, the \nmisuse of the Tax Code that favors special interests, and years of \nexcessive spending. Yet there are Members of this Congress who propose \nwe should first not address those underlying causes, and that those \nmost responsible should not even have to pay their fair share toward \nreducing the debt.\n  Instead, they propose we first take away from Social Security savings \nand Medicare health coverage for the elderly, and that we pull back the \nhand this Nation compassionately extends to those among us who are less \nfortunate. That would seem somewhat to erase all the progress we have \nmade since those words of President Roosevelt by declaring war not on \npoverty but on the poor, the middle class, and the elderly.\n  Because a host of our citizens face the grim problems of \nunemployment, the loss of their homes, and depletion of their savings, \nthis Congress should fight any measure that unfairly inflicts pain on \nthose least responsible for our present economic condition. The \nAmerican people deserve a lot from their Congress. They deserve \nhonesty. They expect us to work together, and they want action that is \nevenhanded.\n  So as we move forward, I hope all my colleagues in the Senate and in \nthe House will be guided by the words of a young President Kennedy, who \nsaid:\n\n       Let us not seek the Republican answer nor the Democratic \n     answer--but the right answer.\n\n  In this spirit, can't we work to pull our Nation out of its financial \ndoldrums? Can't we just ask: What is the right thing to do?\n  Is it right that household income for the average American is \nactually in decline? Is it right that a hedge fund manager pays a lower \ntax rate than the person who cleans his office? Is it right that an oil \ncompany gets to write off $11 billion on its tax return because it \npolluted the Gulf of Mexico? Is it right that the Congress cannot agree \non a deficit reduction plan because of partisan politics?\n  The American people know what is right and they know what is not \nright. If we could just for 1 minute put all this partisanship aside \nand do what is right, then we might be able to balance our Nation's \nbooks to get this country moving again and to get Americans employed \nand earning again. While we are at it, we might just restore the \nAmerican public's confidence in our government.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask that I be allowed to speak as if in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Financial Crisis\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, our country is facing a very serious \nfinancial crisis.\n  We have seen what happened in Europe. We had some numbers on the \nstock market for a while. But if I understand what happened, there was \na very real crisis facing the Europeans, and at the very last moment \nthey took some action that was received positively.\n  But they are not out of the woods yet and neither are we. Our debt is \nsurging. We have gone from 5 years ago a $161 billion deficit to a $450 \nbillion deficit in President Bush's last year to $1.2 trillion in \nPresident Obama's first year, $1.3 trillion in President Obama's second \nyear, $1.2 trillion this year, and over $1 trillion predicted in \ndeficits next year.\n  We are going to have a proposal that comes before us to provide a \npayroll holiday, and it is sold as avoiding a tax increase. That is \nwhat the President says it is; we are avoiding a tax increase. So we \nought to ask ourselves exactly how that is so and if it is so. Let me \njust say, I don't think that is accurate.\n  Two years ago, there was an employer payroll tax holiday that went \nonly to the employer. It cost the Treasury $7.6 billion. Last year, as \npart of the final compromise, a bipartisan compromise, it was agreed \nthat there would be a 2-percent tax holiday for working persons. So \ninstead of paying 6-plus percent on your withholding tax, you would pay \n4. That cost $111 billion for that year.\n  So the President said: If we don't extend that, we are going to have \na tax increase. But is he accurate? No, not really. This year's \nproposal would be to reduce not the 4 percent but the 3.1 percent, \ncutting the 6.2 withholding to 3.1 for the employer and for the \nemployee, and it would cost in 1 year $265 billion--$265 billion that \nwould not be going into the Social Security trust fund so that those \nwho retire would have the retirement funds they have been promised. It \nwould not go there. It weakens Social Security, the integrity of the \nsystem, in my opinion.\n  But we are told not to worry, the U.S. Treasury will replace this \n$265 billion with Treasury money. But the problem is, the Treasury \ndoesn't have any money. The Treasury is already in debt. The Treasury \nis going to add another $1 trillion to the deficit this year. So now it \nis going to be added to--$265 billion more in one fell swoop, in one \nbill, right here at the end of the session. If you don't vote for it, \nthe President says, you are raising taxes on the American people. That \nis not an accurate statement.\n  In an economic sense, in my opinion, the real essence of this is the \nU.S. Treasury will borrow $265 billion. Then, it will direct the Social \nSecurity Administration to send that money out in the form of a reduced \nwithholding amount to be paid by workers. It is a direct borrow and it \nis a direct delivery of money and it uses Social Security trust fund \nmoneys as a vehicle to transfer the money. In an economic sense, it \nborrows $265 billion to spend.\n  How much is $265 billion? The supercommittee, the committee of 12, \nwas trying to find $1,200 billion in savings over 10 years--not 1 year, \n10 years. This one bill, this one proposal of $265 billion would be \nspent this 1 year.\n  To achieve the committee of 12's goal, they would simply have needed \nto have cut $120 billion a year for 10 years out of the entire Federal \nGovernment. They failed. Immediately now, the President and our \nmajority leader are demanding this Congress pass an expenditure--\nunexpected, not before\n\n[[Page S8121]]\n\ndone; nothing like such a large expenditure ever has come out of Social \nSecurity--to spend another $265 billion. How will we ever get our house \nin order? I wish I could figure out a way to be supportive. I don't see \nhow I can be.\n  I am pleased the Republicans are trying to work up a bill that would \nnot cost as much as $265 billion and some way to pay for it. But, in \ntruth, if we are going to be able to cut spending to pay for any kind \nof new expenditure, wouldn't we be better to do what the committee of \n12 tried to do: cut spending to reduce the debt? Shouldn't we be \nseeking ways, if we are going to raise taxes, to use those taxes to pay \ndown the debt, instead of taking 10 years under the President's plan in \na new tax that takes 10 years of that tax to pay for this 1 year's \nexpenditure? That is what the proposal is.\n  I would say to my colleagues, this goes beyond partisan politics. \nThis gets to the point: Are we in control of the Treasury and the \nspending of the United States of America? Can we defend what we are \ndoing?\n  Don't think that is the only thing that is going to come up. I am the \nranking Republican on the Budget Committee. We look at these numbers. \nThis also will be taken care of in December, count on it: We are going \nto deal with the alternative minimum tax. That is going to cost $50 \nbillion. We are going to deal with unemployment insurance, an \nadditional $70 billion to extend those payments beyond 90-some-odd \nweeks. We are going to fix the doctors payment, because we have to. We \ncan't cut the doctors that much, $21 billion. We are going to extend \nmost, if not all, of the tax extenders we call them, $90 billion. The \ntotal is $500 billion.\n  Some of this we have been expecting to take care of. But we weren't \nexpecting or planning in any way to have a continuation of the payroll \nholiday that is going to cost $265 billion. I just would say to my \ncolleagues, when are we going to think more rationally about it?\n  I just heard: How are we going to pay for the AMT, unemployment \ninsurance, doctors payments, and the tax extenders? Somebody said: We \nare going to count the savings from the war. The Congressional Budget \nOffice will show a decline in expenses for the Iraq and Afghanistan war \nwill be a savings. We can spend that. That is fraudulent, that is a \ngimmick, and it should not be acceptable.\n  Everybody knows the war costs are going to be coming down and we have \nbeen planning for that. We can't assume that money is available to \nspend willy-nilly. We were bringing the war costs down to bring the \ndebt down, not to fund new spending. We need to bring the war costs \ndown to try to reduce our debt and our deficit, not to fund new \nspending. But that is how they are going to do this, I have been told. \nI am not surprised because there is no other way they are going to do \nit.\n\n  I just would share that. We will be voting in a little bit on this \nissue. I don't know what the answer is. I don't know how to fix our \nproblems, but I know one thing. We remain in denial. Our country is in \ngreater debt crisis than we realize. Mr. Erskine Bowles and Alan \nSimpson of President Obama's debt commission say we are facing the most \npredictable financial crisis in our Nation's history as a result of our \ndebt, and we need to get serious about how to fix it.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Freeing Alan Gross\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise to address the human rights issue \nof deep concern.\n  For 2 years, since December 3, 2009, an American citizen and a \nMarylander, Alan Gross, has been imprisoned by the Cuban Government. \nFor 2 years, he has been held by the Cuban authorities.\n  Alan was in Cuba to help the country's small Jewish community \nestablish an Internet and improve its access to the Internet, which \nwould allow the community to go online without fear of censorship or \nmonitoring.\n  After being held for 14 months without charge and then a cursory 2-\nday trial, he was convicted and sentenced to 15 years in prison. His \nappeal to the Cuban supreme court was denied in August of this year.\n  Alan Gross is a caring husband and a father, a devoted man who has \ndutifully promoted U.S. foreign policy interests while serving the \nneeds of thousands of foreign citizens, from Afghanistan to Haiti, over \na career that has spanned more than 25 years of public service.\n  Unfortunately, Alan has been caught in the middle of a conflict \nbetween two nations with a long and difficult relationship. But it is \nentirely unacceptable that his personal freedoms have been violated \nevery day he continues to be incarcerated.\n  Alan's health has deteriorated during his imprisonment. He has lost \n100 pounds and suffers from a multitude of medical conditions, \nincluding gout, ulcers, and arthritis, that have worsened without \nadequate treatment.\n  Last night, I had a chance to talk to his wife Judy, who had a chance \nto visit with her husband in Cuba earlier last month. Judy informs me \nthat Alan Gross's health conditions are deteriorating and that he is in \nneed of adequate health care. In addition, his mother and daughter are \nboth struggling with serious health care issues, and his wife is \nstruggling to make ends meet.\n  The Gross family should not have to suffer through such a trying \nperiod of time without Alan for support. Sentencing Alan Gross to 15 \nyears behind bars also sentences his family to 15 years without a \nhusband, father, and son. There is no reason for the Gross family to \ncontinue to suffer the consequences of political gamesmanship any \nlonger. I urge the Cuban Government to remember that this is a real man \nand a family who are suffering.\n  I have already written the Cuban Government urging them, in the \nstrongest possible manner, to immediately and unconditionally release \nAlan Gross. His continued imprisonment is a major setback in our \nbilateral relations, and it is unlikely any positive steps to improve \nthat relationship can or will happen while he remains in prison.\n  As a Senator and as a Marylander and as a fellow human being, I urge \nthe Cuban Government to see Alan Gross, who has dedicated his life to \nserving others, for who he is--a man who believed he was helping others \nby stepping in when he saw a need. Enough is enough. I call on the \nCuban Government to release Alan Gross immediately and to allow him to \nreturn to his family.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, Mr. Gross has worked with Cuban \ncommunities for many years. In 2009, he was working with USAID to \nassist Cuba's Jewish community by improving their access to the \nInternet. As a former social worker who has worked for 25 years in \ninternational development, he has a long record of helping people \naround the world to improve their lives.\n  He was arrested and held without charge for 14 months and later \nsentenced to 15 years for crimes against the state.\n  Mr. Gross is in failing health. He has lost 100 pounds and suffers \nfrom arthritis. He is being held in harsh conditions on trumped-up \ncharges.\n  His family in Maryland has had very limited contact with him. They, \ntoo, have faced health challenges and are facing significant financial \nhardships.\n  I was hopeful that America and Cuba could move closer together--in \ntrade, in community connections, and for individual families who have \nbeen separated. I thought these links would help open up Cuba, improve \nhuman rights, and enable their country to move toward democracy. Yet \nthe case of Mr. Gross shows that Cuba is not serious about moving \nforward--for its own people or for its relations with the United \nStates.\n  If Cuba wants to improve relations with the United States, they need \nto release Mr. Gross now. I will not support easing restrictions or \nsanctions on Cuba until Mr. Gross is allowed to come home to Maryland. \nI thank my colleagues for joining me in standing up for Alan Gross and \nurge the Government of Cuba to release him immediately.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S8122]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that upon the \nconclusion of the postcloture time, the pending germane Feinstein \namendment, No. 1126, be the pending business; that the Senate proceed \nto vote in relation to the following Feinstein amendments in the order \nlisted: Feinstein amendment No. 1126, Feinstein amendment No. 1456; \nthat there be 2 minutes equally divided in the usual form prior to the \nsecond vote--there will be more time than that prior to the first vote; \nthat no amendment be in order to either amendment prior to the votes, \nand that all postcloture time be considered expired at 6 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, for \nthe benefit of our colleagues, after spirited discussions for a long \nperiod of time we have reached a compromise with the Senator from \nCalifornia on language concerning detainees and there are certain \nMembers on my side who wanted a vote on the original amendment as \nwritten. We modified it, so that there will be a vote on the original \nFeinstein amendment and then on the one which is modified by agreement \namong most of the people involved. There may be some who will still \noppose it, but we have reached an agreement among the Senator from \nCalifornia, the chairman, myself, the Senator from Idaho, the Senator \nfrom South Carolina and others, that I think will be agreeable to the \nmajority of the Members.\n  I suggest to my friend, the chairman, that when the vote starts at 6, \nperhaps we can line up the other remaining amendments, on some of which \nwe hope to get voice votes, some of which will require recorded votes, \nas is the procedure under postcloture.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this has not yet been ruled on. I want to \nmodify very slightly what I said in the unanimous consent request. I \nsaid that the Senate proceed to votes in relation to the following \nFeinstein amendments. I should have said the Senate proceed to votes on \nthe Feinstein amendments in the order listed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request, as \nmodified?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I have two other unanimous consent requests \nbefore we turn this over to the Senator from California. I ask \nunanimous consent that it be in order to make a point of order en bloc \nagainst the list of amendments in violation of rule XXII that is at the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, the points of order are sustained and the \namendments fall.\n  The nongermane amendments are as follows:\n\n       Amendments Nos. 1255, 1286, 1294, 1259, 1261, 1263, 1296, \n     1152, 1182, 1184, 1147, 1148, 1204, 1179, 1137, 1138, 1247, \n     1249, 1248, 1118, 1117, 1187, 1211, 1239, 1258, 1186, 1160, \n     1253, 1068, 1119, 1089, 1153, 1154, 1171, 1173, 1099, 1100, \n     1139, 1200, 1120, 1155, 1097, 1197; as being dilatory: No. \n     1174: as being drafted in improperly: No. 1291\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, in the minutes remaining between now and 6 \np.m. I hope we could roughly divide time on the amendment between the \ntwo sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would hope and I ask the time between now and 6 o'clock \nbe divided between the two sides. We will yield immediately to Senator \nFeinstein.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I have one more unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                Amendments Nos. 1290 and 1256 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that the following amendments be \nwithdrawn: Rubio amendment No. 1290 and Merkley amendment No. 1256.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments are withdrawn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1126\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Presiding Officer and all those who have been \ninvolved in working out this approach that allows us now to vote on two \namendments, the original Feinstein amendment that is pending, plus an \nalternative which I think, hopefully, will command great support.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight minutes on each side.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I wish to give 3 minutes to the Senator from South \nCarolina, preceded by 2 minutes from the Senator from Idaho, and 2 \nminutes for the Senator from New Hampshire if she arrives.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Shall I go first?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to explain what has happened \nthis long afternoon. Originally some of us, namely Senators Leahy, \nDurbin, Udall of Colorado, Kirk, Lee, Harkin, Webb, Wyden, Merkley, and \nmyself, realized that there was a fundamental flaw in section 1031 of \nthe bill. There is a difference of opinion as to whether there is this \na fundamental flaw. We believe the current bill essentially updates and \nrestates the authorization for use of military force that was passed on \nSeptember 18, 2001. Despite my support for a general detention \nauthority, the provision in the original bill, in our view, went too \nfar. The bill before us would allow the government to detain U.S. \ncitizens without charge until the end of hostilities. We have had long \ndiscussions on this.\n\n  The disagreement arises from different interpretations of what the \ncurrent law is. The sponsors of the bill believe that current law \nauthorizes the detention of U.S. citizens arrested within the United \nStates, without trial, until ``the end of the hostilities'' which, in \nmy view, is indefinitely.\n  Others of us believe that current law, including the Non-Detention \nAct that was enacted in 1971, does not authorize such indefinite \ndetention of U.S. citizens arrested domestically. The sponsors believe \nthat the Supreme Court's Hamdi case supports their position, while \nothers of us believe that Hamdi, by the plurality opinion's express \nterms, was limited to the circumstance of U.S. citizens arrested on the \nbattlefield in Afghanistan, and does not extend to U.S. citizens \narrested domestically. And our concern was that section 1031 of the \nbill as originally drafted could be interpreted as endorsing the \nbroader interpretation of Hamdi and other authorities.\n  So our purpose in the second amendment, number 1456, is essentially \nto declare a truce, to provide that section 1031 of this bill does not \nchange existing law, whichever side's view is the correct one. So the \nsponsors can read Hamdi and other authorities broadly, and opponents \ncan read it more narrowly, and this bill does not endorse either side's \ninterpretation, but leaves it to the courts to decide.\n  Because the distinguished chairman, the distinguished ranking member, \nand the Senator from South Carolina assert that it is not their intent \nin section 1031 to change current law, these discussions went on and on \nand they resulted in two amendments: our original amendment, which \ncovers only U.S. citizens, which says they cannot be held without \ncharge or trial, and a compromise amendment to preserve current law, \nwhich I shall read:\n\n       On page 360, between lines 21 and 22, insert the following:\n       Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect \n     existing law or authorities relating to the detention of \n     United States citizens or lawful resident aliens of the \n     United States or any other persons who are captured or \n     arrested in the United States.\n\n  I believe this meets the concerns of the leadership of the committee \nand this is presented as an alternative. There are those of us who \nwould like to vote for the original amendment, which I intend to do, as \nwell as for this modifying amendment. They will appear before you as a \nside-by-side, so everyone will have the chance to vote yea or nay on \nthe original or yea or nay on the compromise. As I said, I would urge \nthat we vote yes on both.\n  This is not going to be the world as we see it postvote, but I will \ntell you this, the chairman and the ranking member have agreed that the \nmodified language presented in the second vote will be contained in the \nconference; that they will do everything they can to contain this \nlanguage in the conference.\n\n[[Page S8123]]\n\n  In the original amendment--my original amendment--which affects only \nU.S. citizens, that is not the case. They are likely to drop that \namendment. So I wish to make the point by voting for both, and I would \nhope others would do the same. I think a lot has been gained. I think a \nclear understanding has been gained of the problems inherent in the \noriginal bill. I think Members came to the conclusion that they did not \nwant to change present law and they wanted to extend this preservation \nof current law not only to citizens but to legal resident aliens as \nwell as any other persons arrested in the United States. That would \nmean they could not be held without charge and without trial. So the \nlaw would remain the same as it is today and has been practiced for the \nlast 10 years.\n  I actually believe it is easy to say either my way or the highway. I \nwant to get something done. I want to be able to assure people in the \nUnited States that their rights under American law are protected. The \ncompromise amendment, which is the second amendment we will be voting \non, does that. It provides the assurance that the law will remain the \nsame and will not affect the right of charge and the right of trial of \nany U.S. citizen, any lawful legal alien or any other person in the \nUnited States. We have the commitment by both the chairman and the \nranking member that they will defend that in conference.\n  There are those who say I wish to just vote for the original \namendment. That is fine. I am not sure it will pass. I don't know \nwhether it will pass, but in my judgment, the modification is eminently \nsuitable to accomplish the task at hand and has the added guarantee of \nthe support of the chairman, the ranking member in a conference \ncommittee with the House, which I think is worth a great deal. They \nhave given their word, and I believe they will keep it. This Record \nwill reflect that word.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1456\n\n  I call up my amendment No. 1456, which is the modification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1456.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  There are others who wish to speak.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On p 360, between lines 21 and 22, insert the following:\n       (e) Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect \n     existing law or authorities, relating to the detention of \n     United States citizens, lawful resident aliens of the United \n     States or any other persons who are captured or arrested in \n     the United States.\n\n  I will yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. How much time is there on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wanted to have a couple minutes. I wonder if Senator \nMcCain is here, if there is an objection to extending this by 10 \nminutes. Is there objection? I am not going to do that without him \nhere.\n  Madam President, if the other side is ready to go, they can start \nusing the time on their side.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. How much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight minutes. You were allotted 3 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Will the Chair warn me when I use 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. To Senator Feinstein, I do believe the second provision \nis where we want to be, at least from my point of view. To my \ncolleagues, I never intended by 1031 to change the law imposing a \ngreater burden on American citizens or more exposure to military \ndetention, nor did I wish to have additional rights beyond what exist \ntoday. The problem I have with Senator Feinstein's amendment is it says \nthe authority in this section for the Armed Forces of the United States \nto detain a person does not include the authority to detain a citizen \nof the United States without trial until the end of hostilities.\n  Here is my concern. When you tell a judge, as a defense attorney: I \nwant my client's rights preserved regarding a civilian trial guaranteed \nin this section--and the end of hostilities could be 30 years from \nnow--Your Honor, if these rights mean anything, they need to attach \nnow--if the civilian rights attach immediately upon detention, what I \nthink would be a problem is that the military interrogation is lost. \nAmerican citizens are not subject to a military commission trial. A lot \nof people on my side didn't like that.\n  I do want to make sure American citizens go into article III courts, \nbut the law has been since World War II, if a person joins the enemy, \neven as an American citizen, they are subject to being detained for \ninterrogation purposes. That is my goal and that has always been my \ngoal. We can detain an American who has sided with al-Qaida, if they \nare involved with hostile acts, to gather intelligence, and that is a \nproper thing to have been doing. It was done in World War II when \nAmerican citizens helped the Nazis. If an American citizen wants to \nhelp al-Qaida involved in a hostile act, then they become an enemy of \nthis Nation. They can be humanely detained, and that is my concern \nabout the Senator's amendment; that it would take that away.\n  We have common ground on the second amendment, and at the end of the \nday, the Senate has talked a lot about different things. This has been \na discussion about something important and I, quite frankly, enjoyed \nit.\n  I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. RISCH. First of all, let me say I think there has been an \nadequate compromise that has been reached, and we are to have a side-\nby-side to vote on which will give everybody the opportunity to express \nthemselves. Let me say that every single one of us on this floor has a \ngoal to protect the rights of U.S. citizens.\n  This country was founded by people who had just gone through some \nvery difficult times with a government that was very oppressive on \nthem, and they wrote the Constitution specifically to protect \nthemselves and to protect individuals from the government. Those \nconstitutional provisions today are as good as they were then. Every \nsingle one of us wants to see that American citizens are protected; \nthat is, protections that take place in the case of criminal cases.\n  In the case of a war, in the case where a U.S. citizen joins enemy \ncombatants and fights against the United States, there is a different \nstandard--although a delicate division--that exists. If we look at the \nprovisions of section 1031, where covered persons are defined, it is \nvery clear it applies only to people who participated in the September \n11, 2001, attack on the United States, and it applies to people who are \npart of it or who have substantially supported al-Qaida and the Taliban \nor its associated forces and have actually committed a belligerent act \nor have directly participated in the hostilities.\n  This is drawn very carefully and very narrowly so a U.S. citizen \ncan--as my good friend from Kentucky always says--be able to file a \nwrit of habeas corpus in the U.S. district court and have the U.S. \ndistrict judge determine whether a person is actually an enemy \ncombatant. If that U.S. district judge turns it down, that person does \nnot necessarily go free. The U.S. Government can then charge them with \ntreason or any one of a number of crimes, but they will be tried in the \nU.S. district court.\n  On the other hand, if they are found to be an enemy combatant by a \nU.S. district judge whose decision is reviewable by the circuit court \nand if the Supreme Court chooses--by the Supreme Court, if they are \nfound to be the enemy combatant, then they will, indeed, be subject to \nthis.\n  So this has been very narrow. People who are watching this and who \nare concerned about the civil liberties of U.S. citizens, as I am, as \npeople in Idaho are, as people in every State in America are, under \nthose circumstances, those people will be well protected. We will have \nthe amendment here that everybody will have the opportunity to express \nthemselves on.\n  I will yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would ask that there be 5 additional \nminutes, evenly divided, so we could have 3 minutes left on our side. I \nwould split that with the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n\n[[Page S8124]]\n\n  Mr. RISCH. We have no objection.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we are soon going to be voting on two \namendments. The first amendment that is proposed, the first Feinstein \namendment restricts the authority that was available and is available \ncurrently to the President of the United States under the laws of war. \nThat authority is if an American citizen joins a hostile Army against \nus, takes up arms against us, that person can be determined to be an \nenemy combatant. That is not me saying that; that is the Constitution. \nThat is the Supreme Court of the United States in the Hamdi case: \n``There is no bar to this Nation's holding one of its own citizens as \nan enemy combatant.''\n  The problem with the Feinstein amendment is that current authority of \nthe President to find and designate an American citizen who attacks us, \nwho comes to our land and attacks us as an enemy combatant would be \nrestricted. We should not restrict the availability of that power in \nthe President. Now we have an alternative. In the second Feinstein \namendment, which I ask unanimous consent to be a cosponsor of--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. In the second amendment, we have an alternative because \nnow it would provide the assurance that we are not adversely affecting \nthe rights of the U.S. citizens in this language. Senator McCain, \nSenator Graham, and I have argued on this floor that there is nothing \nin our bill--nothing which changes the rights of the U.S. citizens. \nThere was no intent to do it, and we did not do it.\n  What the second Feinstein amendment provides is that nothing in this \nsection of our bill shall be construed to affect existing law or \nauthorities relating to the detention of the U.S. citizens or lawful \nresident aliens of the United States or any other persons who are \ncaptured or arrested in the United States. It makes clear what we have \nbeen saying this language already does, which is that it does not \naffect existing law relative to the right of the executive branch to \ncapture and detain a citizen. If that law is there allowing it, it \nremains. If, as some argue, the law does not allow that, then it \ncontinues that way. We think the law is clear in Hamdi that there is no \nbar to this Nation holding one of its own citizens as an enemy \ncombatant, and we make clear whatever the law is. It is unaffected by \nthis language in our bill.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleagues, Senators \nGraham and Levin, and particularly Senator Feinstein for working so \nhard to come to an agreement on section 1031. I was concerned that the \nUnited States would, for the first time in the history of this country, \nwith the original language, authorize indefinite detention in the \nUnited States. But we have agreed to include language in this bill with \nthe latter amendment that makes it clear that this bill does not change \nexisting detention authority in any way.\n  It means the Supreme Court will ultimately decide who can and cannot \nbe detained indefinitely without a trial. To this day, the Supreme \nCourt has never ruled on the question of whether it is constitutional \nto indefinitely detain a U.S. citizen captured in the United States. \nSome of my colleagues see this differently, but the language we have \nagreed on makes it clear that section 1031 will not change that law in \nany way. The Supreme Court will decide who will be detained; the Senate \nwill not.\n  I ask unanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor to the second \npending amendment by Senator Feinstein.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  All time has expired on the majority side.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. How much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 4\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to take the opportunity to \nend what I think has been a very good debate. Senator Feinstein--and I \nknow she is busy--said something on the floor that I wish to reiterate: \nthat the second amendment which Senator Durbin just suggested we have \nreached a compromise on, I am fully committed to making sure it stays \nin the conference report. Some folks in the House may have a problem, \nbut I think it is good, sound law.\n  The goal for me has never been to change the law, to put an American \ncitizen more at risk than they are today. It is just to keep the status \nquo and acknowledge from the point of view of the Congress that the \nObama administration's decision to detain people as enemy combatants \nlies within the President's power to do so. The Court has said in In re \nQuirin and in the Hamdi case that at a time of war the executive branch \ncan detain an American citizen who decides to collaborate with the \nNazis, as well as al-Qaida, as an enemy combatant. They can hold them \nfor interrogation purposes to collect intelligence. We don't have to \ntake anybody into court and put them on trial because the goal is to \nprotect the Nation from another attack.\n  The law also says no one, including an American citizen, can be held \nindefinitely without going to an article III court. Every person \ndetermined to be an enemy combatant by the executive branch has to have \ntheir case presented to an independent judiciary, and the government \nhas to prove to a Federal judge by a preponderance of the evidence that \nthey fall within this narrow exception. The government has lost about \nhalf the cases and won about half the cases.\n  My concern with Feinstein 1 is that it would change the law; that the \nlaw would be changed for the first time ever, saying we cannot hold an \nAmerican citizen who has collaborated with the enemy for intelligence \ngathering purposes. I think homegrown terrorism is growing. If an \nAmerican citizen left this country and went to Pakistan, got \nradicalized in a madrasah, came back and started trying to kill \nAmericans, I think we should have the authority to detain them as with \nany belligerent, just like in World War II, and gather intelligence as \nto whether somebody else may be coming.\n  So that is what I want to preserve. With all due respect to Senator \nFeinstein, I think her first amendment very much puts that in jeopardy. \nIt is going to be confusing, litigation friendly, so let's just stay \nwith what we believe the law is.\n  As to Senator Durbin, he has one view, I have another, but we have a \ncommon view; that is, not to do anything to 1031 that would change the \nlaw. The ultimate authority on the law is not Lindsey Graham or Dick \nDurbin, it is the Supreme Court of the United States. That is the way \nit should be, and that is exactly what we say here. We are doing \nnothing to change the law when it comes to American citizen detention \nto enhance it or to restrict whatever rights the government has or the \ncitizen has. I think that is what we need to say as a nation.\n  One last word of warning to my colleagues, the threats we face as a \nnation are growing. Homegrown terrorism is going to become a greater \nreality, and we need to have tools. Law enforcement is one tool, but in \nsome cases holding people who have decided to help al-Qaida and turn on \nthe rest of us and try to kill us so we can hold them long enough to \ninterrogate them to find out what they are up to makes sense. When we \nhold somebody under the criminal justice system, we have to read them \ntheir rights right off the bat under the law or we don't because the \npurpose is to gather intelligence. We need that tool now as much as at \nany other time, including World War II.\n  Thank you all for a great debate. I hope we can vote no on Feinstein \n1 and have a strong bipartisan vote on Feinstein 2.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. If anybody wishes to speak, speak now.\n  All time is yielded back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \namendment No. 1126 offered by the Senator from California.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Could I just interrupt with a unanimous consent request \nthat prior to each vote there be 2 minutes of debate equally divided in \nthe usual form and that it start with the vote after this one.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n\n[[Page S8125]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 1126.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 45, nays 55, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 214 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--45\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bennet\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brown (OH)\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Coons\n     Durbin\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Johnson (SD)\n     Kerry\n     Kirk\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Lee\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Moran\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Paul\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Tester\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--55\n\n     Alexander\n     Ayotte\n     Barrasso\n     Begich\n     Blumenthal\n     Blunt\n     Boozman\n     Brown (MA)\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coats\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Enzi\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Hatch\n     Heller\n     Hoeven\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Johnson (WI)\n     Klobuchar\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lugar\n     Manchin\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Portman\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Rubio\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Thune\n     Toomey\n     Vitter\n     Whitehouse\n     Wicker\n  The amendment (No. 1126) was rejected.\n  Mr. LEVIN.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay upon the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1456\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. UDALL of Mexico). Under the previous \norder, there will be now be 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior \nto a vote on amendment No. 1456 offered by the Senator from California, \nMrs. Feinstein.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that all votes relating to the \nDefense authorization bill be 10 minutes in duration, including final \npassage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, a number of my colleagues have asked where \nwe are. We are going to have probably three or four more rollcall \nvotes, hopefully including final passage. There is also a package--and \neveryone should listen to this because at least 70 of us are affected. \nThere is a package of about 70 amendments which have been cleared. \nHowever, as of the moment, there is an objection to that package being \nadopted.\n  When I say the package has been cleared, what I am saying is there \nhas been no objection to the substance of any of those 70 amendments. \nIf there was an objection to the substance, they would not be cleared. \nSo there is no objection to the substance of those approximately 70 \namendments, but you should be aware, because most of us have amendments \nin that cleared managers' package, that unless that objection is \nremoved, we cannot get that package adopted tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wonder if I might be able to make a \nfew comments.\n  This amendment is a compromise amendment. I think it is actually a \nvery good amendment. I want to thank the chairman of the committee, the \nranking member, and Senator Graham, who participated in a rather \nlengthy discussion, and this is the result.\n  The amendment--I will read it. It says:\n\n       Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect \n     existing law or authority relating to the detention of United \n     States citizens or lawful resident aliens of the United \n     States or any other persons who are captured or arrested in \n     the United States.\n\n  There is a commitment from both the chairman and the ranking member \nand Senator Graham that they will defend this amendment in conference. \nSo I hope everyone will vote for it because essentially it just \nsupports present law, whether one supports the broad interpretation of \npresent law, or one supports a more narrow interpretation of present \nlaw. There is no change in law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I very much support this amendment, I am a \ncosponsor, and I hope we can all vote for it. This does what we said--\nthose of us who wrote this bill--the bill does and does not do all \nalong. It does not change current law. This amendment reinforces the \npoint that this bill does not change current law relative to this \nsection of this bill. The section of this bill does not change current \nlaw relative to the detention of people in the United States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will not repeat what the chairman said \nexcept that I would like to thank Senator Feinstein for her willingness \nto sit down and negotiate with us, and Senator Durbin, who has been a \npassionate advocate. I would also like to thank all of the people who \ncame to the floor so often. I think the Senate is a better institution \nas a result of the debate, and I am sure the Senate and the American \npeople are much better informed on this very important national \nsecurity aspect of this bill.\n  I thank my colleagues. I urge an aye vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate, equally divided, prior to a vote on amendment No. \n1414, offered by the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Menendez, and the \nSenator from Illinois, Mr. Kirk.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, the Menendez-Kirk bipartisan amendment \nis sponsored by over half of the Members of the Senate. It makes it \nvery clear that the Treasury Department's own determination under the \nPATRIOT Act that the Iranian Central Bank is the central source for \nmoney for Iran's nuclear march toward a nuclear weapon needs to be \naddressed. That is exactly what we do in this amendment. It creates the \nmaximum effort against the Iranians, and it ensures that we do not have \nany oil disruption as a result of those sanctions by giving the \nPresident the opportunity to make a determination that there are \nsufficient oil supplies so as not to create a disruption, and it gives \nhim in addition a national security waiver.\n  This is the maximum opportunity to have a peaceful diplomacy tool to \nstop Iran's march to nuclear weapons.\n  I urge my colleagues to give it a strong bipartisan vote.\n\n[[Page S8126]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I support the amendment. I think this amendment is vital \nat this time to send a strong signal to Iran, which recently tried to \npull off the assassination of the Saudi Ambassador here in Washington, \nDC. It is long overdue, and it is too bad that the United States has to \ndo it by ourselves rather than having the U.N. Security Council act. \nThis is a strong amendment. I think it is very important and, again, I \nstrongly support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, this Menendez-Kirk amendment is a strong, \nbipartisan amendment. Over half of the Senate has formally cosponsored \nit. I urge its adoption, especially after the bomb plot in Washington, \nDC, the IAEA report on nuclear development in Iran, and the overrunning \nof our British ally's embassy site by Iran 2 days ago.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ.

Is all time yielded back?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Our time is yielded back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1209) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 1080 Withdrawn\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote on amendment No. \n1080, offered by the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Senator Leahy authorized me and told me he \nwas withdrawing this amendment relative to military custody because of \nall of the actions which have been previously taken. I am very \nconfident that is what he told me, so I am going to withdraw that \namendment on his behalf.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1274\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote on amendment No. \n1274, offered by the Senator from Alabama, Mr. Sessions.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, this amendment is crafted to simply \nclarify and affirm what appears to be the law, and logic tells us \nshould be the law today.\n  If an individual is apprehended as a prisoner of war, they are \ndetained under the laws of war until the conflict ends. But if, after \nbeing detained or when they are detained, it is determined they have \ncommitted crimes against the laws of war, they can be tried for those \ncrimes.\n  There is a slight ambiguity. I think it is pretty clear the military \nwould have a right to continue to detain them as a prisoner of war if \nthey were not convicted of the much higher burden crime against the \nlaws of war.\n  So the essence of this is simply to say what the judge said in the \ncase involving the African Embassy bombing, the Ghailani case. The guy \nwas acquitted of 284 out of 285 counts, and the judge said: You \nprobably would be detained under the laws of war. So this would clarify \nthat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I think this can be accepted on a voice \nvote. I have great problems with it, but I think there is probably a \nmajority here that will favor it and a distinct minority perhaps that \nwould not. But it is something which basically doesn't add to the \nexisting law, which says this is theoretically possible, and all this \ndoes is say it is possible one could be acquitted of a criminal case \nand still be held as an enemy combatant.\n  Mr. PAUL. I object. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n              The 9,000th Vote of Senator Frank Lautenberg\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the next rollcall vote will be the 9,000th \nvote cast by Senator Frank Lautenberg. Senator Lautenberg, the senior \nSenator from New Jersey, has always been a fighter for his State, for \nprogressive causes.\n  Before coming to the Senate, Senator Lautenberg served his country \nadmirably in World War II, graduated from Colombia Business School, and \nbecame--and this is an understatement--a successful businessman.\n  The determination that made him successful in the private sector \nserved him well in the Senate, where he worked tirelessly on behalf of \nthe State of New Jersey. Frank tried to retire once--in 2000--but he \njust couldn't stay away from serving the State and the Nation and \nreturned to the Senate a little over a year after he had retired.\n  As the top Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee, Senator \nLautenberg negotiated the balanced budget amendment of 1997, which \nrestored fiscal discipline while cutting taxes for students and \nfamilies with children.\n  He has been at the cutting edge of environmental issues in this \ncountry since he came to the Senate. He has worked as a member of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, doing a good job with highways, \nrailways, and runways in New Jersey, and has done that in conjunction \nwith being a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee but \nalso the Appropriations Committee.\n  During his time in the Senate, he has done things that will be a \nlasting mark on his career, his legacy, forever. Our Nation's roads are \nsafer because he was responsible for our passing the 21-year-old \ndrinking age. He established a national drunk driving standard, a \nstandard throughout the country. He banned triple-trailer trucks--so-\ncalled killer trucks--from the roads of New Jersey and many other \nStates. He dedicated his time in the Senate to holding terrorists \naccountable and protecting New Jersey's ports, which are important to \nall of us, not only to New Jersey.\n  Senator Lautenberg has done many things. He authored the domestic \nviolence gun ban--the only significant gun legislation to become law \nsince the Brady bill--which prevents convicted abusers from buying \nguns.\n  The thing I recognize as very important--one of my boys couldn't \nstand the cigarette smoke in airplanes. Even though the airlines tried \nto set up a standard for smoking, you know that if there was smoking in \nthe airplane, the fact that you were someplace else in the airplane \ndidn't matter; everybody got the secondhand smoke. He fought this and \nbanned smoking on airplanes, which I will always remember, and \ncertainly my boy Key will always remember that.\n  For three decades, Frank Lautenberg has left a mark that is very \nimpressive, and his 9,000 votes will be something people will look back \non and determine that Frank Lautenberg is one of the most productive \nSenators in the history of our country.\n  Congratulations, Frank.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would like to associate myself with \nthe remarks of the majority leader and congratulate the Senator from \nNew Jersey on this milestone in his long and very distinguished career \nhere in the Senate.\n  (Applause.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). The Senator from New \nJersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I know we want to hear from our \ncolleague shortly. I wish to join in recognizing over a quarter of a \ncentury of distinguished service from the senior Senator from New \nJersey on this 9,000th vote, which is only emblematic of the type of \nwork he has done, which is with a view toward not the next election but \nthe next generation, whether it is saving lives by raising the drinking \nage; whether it is allowing workers to understand and have the right to \nknow the toxic chemicals they were working with and the community in \nwhich those toxic chemicals were located; whether it is making sure all \nof us don't have to breathe secondhand smoke on an airplane; whether it \nis making sure that those who pilfer the land and contaminated it were \nheld responsible to clean it up in the Superfund or to have cleaner air \nto breathe, Frank Lautenberg's legislation has touched millions of \nlives not only in New Jersey but across the Nation, and we salute him \nfor his tremendous service.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the leader for his kind words \nand the help he has given me to make some of the decisions we labored \nwith. I thank my colleague, the Senator from New Jersey, Bob Menendez, \nwho has worked very hard to do his share in moving legislation and \ndoing the right thing by the people in our State and our country.\n  One of the things that is, to me, pretty important is when I said to \nmy mother in 1982: Mom, I am going to run for the U.S. Senate; I think \nthere is an opportunity there. I was running ADP and in quite good \ncompany at the time. So she said: Frank, what do you need it for? I \nsaid: Mom, I don't need it. On the night of the election, we were \ngathered at my house in New Jersey--and my mother was then committed to \na wheelchair--and she had tears running down her face. I said: Mom, you \nasked me why I needed it. I said: Why are you crying? She said: Because \nI always wanted you to win.\n  The people in New Jersey were very kind over these years, electing me \nfive times to the Senate and giving me the honor and the opportunity to \ngive something back to this country of ours.\n  I came from a family that was a poor family, immigrant family. My \nparents were young when they were brought by their parents to America. \nThey were hoping that maybe good things could happen as a result of \ntheir becoming Americans. So I stand here and I am glad we are not \ntaking a vote on whether I should be commended for this. I might not \nget all the votes you gave me because you didn't ask for unanimous \nconsent, but nevertheless, it passed, and so I thank all of you, even \nthose with whom I might occasionally disagree. It is shocking, but it \ndoes happen here. But I have respect for everybody who is sent here by \ntheir constituents from every State in the country and for their point \nof view. It doesn't mean I agree, but I have respect for the fact that \nwe can say what we want in this free country of ours, say things that \nsometimes maybe we wish we had not said, but we have a chance to speak \nout on the things we believe in.\n  I thank all of my colleagues for their service and for the accolades \ngiven to me this night.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1087\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate on the \nLeahy amendment No. 1087.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the germane \nLeahy amendment No. 1087 be modified with the changes at the desk; \nfurther, that the amendment, as modified, be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Reserving the right to object, could the manager clarify \nexactly what that is?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. There was a provision in the bill relative to the Freedom \nof Information Act which, by agreement, was modified.\n  Mr. THUNE. This doesn't have anything to do with the managers' \npackage.\n  Mr. McCAIN. It is agreeable on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n\n[[Page S8128]]\n\n  Without objection, the amendment, as modified, is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1087), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       Strike section 1044 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1044. TREATMENT UNDER FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT OF \n                   CERTAIN SENSITIVE NATIONAL SECURITY \n                   INFORMATION.\n\n       (a) Critical Infrastructure Security Information.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary of Defense may exempt \n     certain Department of Defense information from disclosure \n     under section 552 of title 5, United States Code, upon a \n     written determination that--\n       (A) the information is Department of Defense critical \n     infrastructure security information; and\n       (B) the public interest in the disclosure of such \n     information does not outweigh the Government's interest in \n     withholding such information from the public.\n       (2) Information provided to state or local first \n     responders.--Critical infrastructure security information \n     covered by a written determination under this subsection that \n     is provided to a State or local government to assist first \n     responders in the event that emergency assistance should be \n     required shall be deemed to remain under the control of the \n     Department of Defense.\n       (b) Military Flight Operations Quality Assurance System.--\n     The Secretary of Defense may exempt information contained in \n     any data file of the Military Flight Operations Quality \n     Assurance system of a military department from disclosure \n     under section 552 of title 5, United States Code, upon a \n     written determination that the disclosure of such information \n     in the aggregate (and when combined with other information \n     already in the public domain) would reveal sensitive \n     information regarding the tactics, techniques, procedures, \n     processes, or operational and maintenance capabilities of \n     military combat aircraft, units, or aircrews. Information \n     covered by a written determination under this subsection \n     shall be exempt from disclosure under such section 552 even \n     when such information is contained in a data file that is not \n     exempt in its entirety from such disclosure.\n       (c) Delegation.--The Secretary of Defense may delegate the \n     authority to make a determination under subsection (a) or (b) \n     to any civilian official in the Department of Defense or a \n     military department who is appointed by the President, by and \n     with the advice and consent of the Senate.\n       (d) Transparency.--Each determination of the Secretary, or \n     the Secretary's designee, under subsection (a) or (b) shall \n     be made in writing and accompanied by a statement of the \n     basis for the determination. All such determinations and \n     statements of basis shall be available to the public, upon \n     request, through the office of the Assistant Secretary of \n     Defense for Public Affairs.\n       (e) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) The term ``Department of Defense critical \n     infrastructure security information'' means sensitive but \n     unclassified information that, if disclosed, would reveal \n     vulnerabilities in Department of Defense critical \n     infrastructure that, if exploited, would likely result in the \n     significant disruption, destruction, or damage of or to \n     Department of Defense operations, property, or facilities, \n     including information regarding the securing and safeguarding \n     of explosives, hazardous chemicals, or pipelines, related to \n     critical infrastructure or protected systems owned or \n     operated by or on behalf of the Department of Defense, \n     including vulnerability assessments prepared by or on behalf \n     of the Department, explosives safety information (including \n     storage and handling), and other site-specific information on \n     or relating to installation security.\n       (2) The term ``data file'' means a file of the Military \n     Flight Operations Quality Assurance system that contains \n     information acquired or generated by the Military Flight \n     Operations Quality Assurance system, including the following:\n       (A) Any data base containing raw Military Flight Operations \n     Quality Assurance data.\n       (B) Any analysis or report generated by the Military Flight \n     Operations Quality Assurance system or which is derived from \n     Military Flight Operations Quality Assurance data.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has \nunanimously adopted my Freedom of Information Act, FOIA, amendment to \nthe National Defense Authorization Act. This measure appropriately \nnarrows the overbroad exemptions to FOIA contained in the bill and will \nhelp ensure that the American public has access to important \ninformation about potential threats to their health and safety at or \nnear Department of Defense facilities.\n  I thank Senator Levin and Senator McCain for working with me on this \nissue and including this language, with our agreed-to modifications, in \nthe managers' package for this bill. I also thank the many open \ngovernment groups from across the political spectrum that support this \namendment, including OpentheGovernment.org, the Liberty Coalition, the \nSunlight Foundation and the American Library Association.\n  For more than 45 years, the Freedom of Information Act has been a \ncornerstone of open government and a hallmark of our democracy, \nensuring that the American people have access to their Government's \nrecords. The addition of this measure to the National Defense \nAuthorization Act will help ensure that FOIA remains a viable tool for \naccess to Department of Defense information that impacts the health and \nsafety of the American public.\n  I am particularly pleased that the language adopted by the Senate \nincludes a public interest balancing test that requires the Secretary \nof Defense to consider whether the Government's interests in \nwithholding critical infrastructure information are outweighed by other \npublic interests. This improvement to the bill will help ensure that \ntruly sensitive information is protected, while allowing the public to \nobtain important information about potential health and safety \nconcerns.\n  This language adopted by the Senate strikes an appropriate balance \nbetween safeguarding the ability of the Department of Defense to \nperform its vital mission and the public's right to know. I am pleased \nthat this measure has been included in this important legislation with \nthe unanimous support of the Senate.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote on the Leahy \namendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1202, As Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate on the \nUdall amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, there is a pending amendment which \napparently the clerk will need to report at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Udall amendment is pending.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \ngermane Udall of New Mexico amendment No. 1202 be modified with the \nchanges at the desk; further, that the amendment, as modified, be \nagreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, the amendment, as modified, is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1202), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle B of title VIII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 827. APPLICABILITY OF BUY AMERICAN ACT TO PROCUREMENT OF \n                   PHOTOVOLTAIC DEVICES BY DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 2534 of title 10, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     subsection:\n       ``(k) Procurement of Photovoltaic Devices.--\n       ``(1) Contract requirement.--The Secretary of Defense shall \n     ensure that each contract described in paragraph (2) awarded \n     by the Department of Defense includes a provision requiring \n     any photovoltaic devices installed pursuant to the contract, \n     or pursuant to a subcontract under the contract, to comply \n     with the provisions of chapter 83 of title 41 (commonly known \n     as the `Buy American Act'), without regard to whether the \n     contract results in ownership of the photovoltaic devices by \n     the Department.\n       ``(2) Contracts described.--The contracts described in this \n     paragraph include energy savings performance contracts, \n     utility service contracts, power purchase agreements, land \n     leases, and private housing contracts pursuant to which any \n     photovoltaic devices are\n       (A) installed on property or in a facility--owned by the \n     Department of Defense;\n       ``(B) generate power consumed by the Dept of Defense and \n     counted toward Federal renewable energy purchase requirements\n       ``(3) Consistency with international obligations.--\n     Paragraph (1) shall be applied in a manner consistent with \n     the obligations of the United States under international \n     agreements.\n       ``(4) Definition of photovoltaic devices.--In this \n     subsection, the term `photovoltaic devices' means devices \n     that convert light directly into electricity.\n       ``(5) Effective date.--This subsection applies to \n     photovoltaic devices procured or installed on or after the \n     date that is 30 days after the date of the enactment of the \n     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 \n     pursuant to contracts entered into after such date of \n     enactment.''.\n       (b) Conforming Repeal.--Section 846 of the Ike Skelton \n     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011 (10 \n     U.S.C. 2534 note) is repealed.\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for \nworking with me on this amendment. I think he gave us a modification \nthat is a good one. This amendment I offer\n\n[[Page S8129]]\n\nwith Senator Schumer and Senator Sanders closes the Buy American \nloopholes, and applies Buy American requirements to solar projects that \nare funded by the Department of Defense to meet energy goals in this \nbill. If American taxpayer funds are used to improve our military \nbases' energy security, then American solar firms should have the \nability to compete.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my full statement be printed in the \nRecord.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, solar power increases energy \nsecurity for American military installations and our troops in the \nfield. With solar power, our military is less dependent on the \nsurrounding electricity grid or fuel supplies for generators. As a \nresult, the Department of Defense is a leader on utilizing solar \npower--not for environmental reasons, but for energy security reasons.\n  However, if we are going to use taxpayer funds to support military \nsolar power--which also qualifies for federal solar tax incentives--we \nmust provide a level playing field for U.S. solar manufacturers in the \ncontracting process. Last year's Defense Authorization bill took an \nimportant step, by clarifying that DOD's Buy American Act requirements \napply to solar.\n  Previously, when solar was installed on DOD property, Buy American \nwould not apply because DOD purchases the power, not the panels. DOD \nuses that arrangement for two reasons--first, it spreads the cost out \nthrough long term power purchase agreements instead of up-front costs; \nsecond, it allows the project to use tax credits DOD cannot use.\n  While last year's bill attempted to fix this situation, it left two \nloopholes. First, the Buy American requirements from last year's bill \nare limited ``to the extent that such contracts result in ownership of \n[solar] devices by DOD.'' The nature of power purchase agreements means \nthat often this requirement is not fulfilled, thus allowing Chinese \nsolar makers to undercut bids for DOD funded solar projects.\n  Second, last year's provision also only applied when ``reserved for \nthe exclusive use'' of DOD for the ``full economic life'' of the \ndevice. Solar power projects may sometimes sell back to the grid, and \nDOD may use them for 20 years, when they are warranted for 25. The \ncombined effect of these loopholes is that Buy American does not \ncurrently apply to DOD-funded solar.\n  The amendment I am offering with Senator Schumer and Sanders closes \nthese loopholes and applies Buy American requirements to solar projects \nthat are funded by DOD to meet the energy goals in this bill.\n  If American taxpayer funds are used to improve our military bases' \nenergy security, American solar firms should have an ability to \ncompete. We know that other nations like China are spending vast \nresources to become leaders in the solar power market. They do not play \nby our trade rules, and they are taking advantage of our taxpayer \nfunds.\n  Think about it this way: China does not spend its tax dollars on U.S. \nsolar panels at Chinese military bases. Why should Congress provide \nmarket access that is not extended to U.S. manufacturers?\n  This amendment halts that practice, while maintaining all existing \nprovisions of the Buy American Act: Nations who are in the WTO are not \ndiscriminated against--``Buy American'' does not bar nations that allow \nreciprocal access to U.S. firms to their government procurement. \nExisting exemptions such as availability and cost still apply, so we do \nnot expect this to harm DOD's procurement in any way.\n  Our amendment is supported by a strong coalition of U.S. solar \nmanufacturers and U.S. workers.\n  I thank Senator Schumer and his staff for working with us, along with \nChairman Levin and his staff, and I urge the Senate's support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I thank Senator McCain, I thank Senator \nLevin, and I appreciate their help on this amendment.\n\n\n      Foreign Subsidiaries of U.S. Parent Companies Active in Iran\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I wish to engage in a colloquy with my \nfriend, the distinguished chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, \nregarding U.S. companies that continue to do business with Iran. I know \nthe chairman shares my concern about Iran's continued violations of \ninternational norms. As the International Atomic Energy Agency's recent \nreport starkly highlights, Iran continues to work to build a nuclear \nweapon despite the current sanctions in place. While we have made great \nstrides in strengthening sanctions on Iran, more work clearly needs to \nbe done to place pressure on Iran to change its behavior. For the past \n7 years, I have been working to close a loophole in current law that \nallows foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies to continue doing \nbusiness with Iran without facing the same penalties that would be \nplaced on the parent company. I have now filed an amendment to the \nNational Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 currently under \nconsideration to try and close this loophole once again. Although I am \nnot going to call for a vote on this amendment at this time, it is time \nwe work to close this loophole once and for all.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I thank Senator Lautenberg for his longstanding \nleadership on this issue. It is timely for him to raise it again now in \nthe wake of the IAEA's recent report on Iran's illicit nuclear \nactivities and in the midst of our efforts in the Banking Committee to \nratchet up the pressure on Iran's leaders through additional sanctions. \nAs President Obama noted last week when he imposed a new round of \nsanctions using the tools Congress gave him, Iran's government has \npersistently refused to abide by its international obligations, and it \nis time to turn up the heat in an effort to persuade its leaders to \ncome clean on their nuclear program. While U.S. sanctions enacted last \nyear, multilateral sanctions, and other efforts have slowed Iran's \nnuclear program and damaged its key revenue-generating energy sector, \nit remains my urgent priority to strengthen sanctions further to ensure \nthat Iran effectively has no choice but to change its current path. \nThat is why we are acting to sanction Iran's Central Bank today as \nwell. On the issue you have raised, I think it is long past time for \nU.S. subsidiaries to withdraw from doing business in Iran. That is \nalready happening due to U.S. and other international pressure on the \nbusiness and financial sectors. Firms realize the huge risks this \nactivity poses, reputationally and otherwise, to their companies. I \nnote that it is already a violation for American subsidiaries to engage \nin sanctionable activity in Iran's energy sector and certain other \nactivities under U.S. sanctions laws. It is also a violation of U.S. \ntrade law for a U.S. firm to do business of any kind in Iran via a \nsubsidiary. What that means is that if a U.S. parent is acting through \nits subsidiary, directing its activity, that violates U.S. law. The \nbalance that has been struck so far is that we have directed our law, \nincluding our trade embargo, to U.S. companies and what U.S. companies \ndo. Foreign subsidiaries are not, by definition, U.S. persons. But I \nagree with you that we can and should do more to stop the foreign \nsubsidiaries of American companies from doing business with Iran, and I \nintend to address this problem in our upcoming legislation to expand \nIran sanctions.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. My amendment would have applied the same penalties \nthat can be imposed on U.S. companies that violate the U.S. trade ban \nwith Iran to foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies. Does the chairman \nagree that this loophole remains an issue that must be addressed?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I agree that we must address the problem of foreign \nsubsidiaries of U.S. companies doing business in Iran not being \npenalized for it under U.S. law. I know that, as in the past, there \nwill be opposition from some in the business community, and elsewhere \nincluding European and other foreign governments who have long objected \nto the extraterritorial application of U.S. laws to reach companies \norganized under their jurisdiction. They will argue that the activities \nof U.S. subsidiaries are not legally U.S. persons, but are rather \nforeign persons organized under other countries' laws, and so should \nnot be reached by U.S. law. But I am committed to working with my \nfriend and with my committee members to address this issue.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the chairman. As we know, Iran funds Hamas, \nHezbollah, and other terrorist\n\n[[Page S8130]]\n\norganizations. We should not allow American-controlled companies to \nprovide cash to Iran so that they can convert these funds into bullets \nand bombs to be used against us and our allies. It is inexcusable for \nAmerican companies to engage in any business practice that provides \nrevenues to terrorists, and we have to stop it. I look forward to \nworking with Chairman Johnson to close this loophole.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to respond to a colloquy \nyesterday that occurred between Senators Ayotte, Lieberman, and Graham \nregarding amendment No. 1068 offered by Senator Ayotte to the Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  Senator Ayotte's amendment would eliminate measures that provide our \ninterrogators with the guidance and clarity they need to effectively \nsolicit actionable intelligence while upholding American values. In \ndoing so, the amendment would override the better judgment of our \nmilitary and intelligence professionals in a manner that will harm, not \nimprove, our short- and long-term security.\n  Yesterday, Senator Lieberman said on the Senate floor that he wants \nprisoners taken captive by the United States to be ``terrified about \nwhat is going to happen to them while in American custody.'' He also \nsaid he wants ``the terror they inflict on others to be felt by them.'' \nI believe that such statements are antithetical to fundamental American \nvalues. I firmly believe that America will not and cannot lower itself \nto the level of terrorists. To do so would be to abandon our most \ncherished principles and what our country stands for.\n  There was also discussion of abuses at Abu Ghraib, which diminished \nAmerica's standing and outraged the American public.\n  As chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence, I can say that \nwe are nearing the completion a comprehensive review of the CIA's \nformer interrogation and detention program, and I can assure the Senate \nand the Nation that coercive and abusive treatment of detainees in U.S. \ncustody went beyond a few isolated incidents at Abu Ghraib.\n  Moreover, the abuse stemmed not from the isolated acts of a few bad \napples but from fact that the line was blurred between what is \npermissible and impermissible conduct, putting U.S. personnel in an \nuntenable position with their superiors and the law.\n  That is why Congress and the executive branch subsequently acted to \nprovide our intelligence and military professionals with the clarity \nand guidance they need to effectively carry out their missions. And \nthat is where the September, 2006 Army Field Manual comes in.\n  However, Senator Ayotte's amendment would require the executive \nbranch to adopt a classified interrogation annex to the Army Field \nManual, a concept that even the Bush administration rejected outright \nin 2006.\n  Senator Ayotte argued that the United States needs secret and \nundisclosed interrogation measures to successfully interrogate \nterrorists and gain actionable intelligence. However, our intelligence, \nmilitary, and law enforcement professionals, who actually interrogate \nterrorists as part of their jobs, universally disagree. They believe \nthat with the Army Field Manual as it currently is written, they have \nthe tools needed to obtain actionable intelligence from U.S. detainees.\n  Further, in 2009, after an extensive review, the intelligence \ncommunity unanimously asserted that it had all the guidance and tools \nit needed to conduct effective interrogations. The Special Task Force \non Interrogations--which included representatives from the CIA, Defense \nDepartment, the Office of the Director of Intelligence, and others--\nconcluded that ``no additional or different guidance was necessary.''\n  Since 2009, the interagency High Value Detainee Interrogation Group \nInterrogation Group has assured the Senate Intelligence Committee that \nit has all the authority it needs to effectively gain actionable \nintelligence.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S8130, December 1, 2011, the Record reads:There was \nalso, discussion of abuses at Abu Ghraib, which diminished \nAmerica}s standing and outraged the American public, and there was \ndiscussion about how there were a few isolated incidents at Abu \nGhraib. . . . detainees in U.S. custody was far more systematic \nand widespread than we thought. . . . their missions. And that is \nwhere the Army Field Manual comes in.Since 2009, the interagency \nHigh Value Detainee Interrogation Group has briefed the Select \nCommittee on Intelligence numerous times. The group has repeatedly \nassured the Committee that they have all the authority they need \nto effectively gain actionable intelligence. As a consummate \nconsumer of the intelligence products they produce, I agree.\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: There was also, \ndiscussion of abuses at Abu Ghraib, which diminished America}s \nstanding and outraged the American public . . . detainees in U.S. \ncustody went beyond a few isolated incidents at Abu Ghraib. . . . \ntheir missions. And that is where the September, 2006 Army Field \nManual comes in. . . . Interrogation Group has assured the Senate \nIntelligence Committee that it has all the authority it needs to \neffectively gain actionable intelligence.\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  Unfortunately, amendment No. 1068 would overrule the judgments of \nthese professionals--who have served under both the Bush and Obama \nadministrations--and impede their important work.\n  If our intelligence community is telling us that the current \nguidelines and interrogation techniques are effective, why would we add \nsecret interrogation methods?\n  Senator Ayotte's amendment would muddy the waters on what is and \nisn't permissible in interrogating U.S. detainees. Her amendment would \noverturn not only the Executive order on lawful interrogations but also \nroll back the McCain amendment passed in 2005--which the Senate \napproved in a 90-to-9 vote--by allowing some interrogators, including \nsome military interrogators, to evade established interrogation \nprotocols.\n  In creating unnecessary exceptions to existing interrogation \nguidance, Senator Ayotte's amendment would deprive our military and \nintelligence professionals of the clarity they deserve and threaten to \nreopen the door to secret techniques and other abuses of U.S. \ndetainees.\n  While Senator Ayotte has insisted that her amendment would continue \nto prohibit cruelty, the colloquy on the floor suggests otherwise. When \nSenator Graham asked her if the amendment was needed to bring back \nenhanced interrogation techniques--techniques we now know included \ninduced hypothermia, slapping, sleep deprivation, and forced stressed \npositions she responded in the affirmative.\n  We cannot have it both ways. Either we make clear to the world that \nthe United States will honor our values and treat prisoners humanely or \nwe let the world believe that we have secret interrogation methods to \nterrorize and torture our prisoners.\n  The Ayotte proposal also ignores the dangerous practical implications \nfor our intelligence and military partners overseas.\n  The colloquy between the Senators yesterday suggests they believe the \nUnited States will have some advantage by having a secret list of \ninterrogation techniques and that this will have no negative \nimplications, aside from giving interrogators more options.\n  Last year, GEN David Petraeus said it best when he unequivocally \nasserted that we should not return to so-called ``enhanced'' techniques \nbecause they ``undermine your cause'' and ``bite you in the backside in \nthe long run.''\n  Current U.S. law and policy makes clear that America is committed to \nfundamental humane treatment standards. By overturning the status quo, \nthe Ayotte amendment would create dangerous pockets of uncertainty to \nthe detriment of our international standing, our intelligence \ncollectors, and our national security.\n  Should this amendment ever come to the floor of the Senate, I urge my \nfellow Senators to oppose it.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to express my deep concerns with the \npayroll tax alternative that our colleagues have proposed. Their \nalternative would be paid for by extending the current pay freeze for \nFederal employees through 2015 and requiring each agency to cut its \nworkforce by 10 percent.\n  I strongly oppose putting the entire cost on the backs of two million \nmiddle class Federal employees, who already have contributed to deficit \nreduction through a 2-year pay freeze. These men and women are working \nharder than ever with tighter budgets and, in many agencies, continued \nstaffing shortages. If adopted, these provisions would hamper \ninvestments in national defense, homeland security, veterans' services, \nfood safety inspection, and other critical areas for a short-sighted \napproach that does little to address our current fiscal challenges and \ndoes nothing to create jobs. In the end, these policies would cost the \ngovernment more, by harming the Federal Government's ability to recruit \nand retain highly-skilled workers and increasing our reliance on high-\ncost contractors.\n  Arbitrary caps on Federal employees often lead to waste, fraud, and \nabuse as contracting expands without investment in oversight. Already, \nover the past decade, Federal contracts have nearly doubled in size, \nbut the acquisition workforce charged with overseeing our Federal \ncontracts has remained constant. We should not be adding to this trend, \nbut working to reverse it.\n  While I agree it is important that all Americans share the sacrifice \nin these\n\n[[Page S8131]]\n\nchallenging economic times, I believe Federal workers have already done \nso. The 2-year Federal pay freeze enacted as part of the Budget Control \nAct of 2011 will save approximately $60 billion over the next 10 years. \nIt is important to remember that a pay freeze affects employees much \nlonger than just the years it is in place; future salaries will build \nfrom a lower base throughout employees' careers. The pay freeze will \nalso reduce future retirement benefits, because they are calculated \nusing the high three years' of earnings.\n  Nearly two thirds of our 2 million Federal employees are employed by \nthe Departments of Defense, Veterans Affairs, or Homeland Security--and \naccording to the Office of Personnel Management, 4 out of 5 jobs filled \nsince President Obama took office have been to these same agencies. \nThese employees do critical work to keep our Nation safe and care for \nour veterans.\n  Approximately 85 percent of Federal employees work outside of the \nWashington, DC area, and they are our neighbors and constituents in \neach of our States. Like the rest of our constituents, they are \nstruggling with the deepest recession since the Great Depression. \nAlthough fortunate to have more job security than most workers, many \nhave unemployed spouses and adult children, their home values and \nretirement savings have fallen dramatically, and like everyone else \nthey face high health care, college, and other costs. Contrary to what \nyou might hear from our colleagues, Federal employees are not overpaid. \nThose guarding our airports and borders, and working at our naval \nshipyards, may start at less than $30,000 per year. Many make less than \nwhat they could in the private sector, but they work for the American \npeople because they love their country and they are committed to \nservice. Further cuts to Federal pay and benefits will not only hurt \nthese individual families, but will hinder the larger economic \nrecovery.\n  At a time when close to half our Federal workforce will soon be \neligible to retire, I worry that extending the pay freeze could further \nharm our ability to recruit the best and brightest to government \nservice. As chairman of the Federal workforce subcommittee, I have been \nworking with my colleagues to adopt policies to ensure that the Federal \nGovernment is viewed as the employer of choice in this country. \nGuaranteeing fair and competitive pay for its civilian workforce should \nbe part of our commitment to the American people that the Federal \nGovernment has the right people, with the right skills to run their \ngovernment in an effective and efficient manner.\n  Our Federal civil service is made up of hard working, talented people \nwho have dedicated their lives to serving this country. These honorable \nmen and women provide many essential services to the American people, \nincluding keeping our Nation safe, caring for our wounded warriors, \nensuring our food and drugs are safe, and responding to natural \ndisasters. America's public servants deserve our gratitude and respect. \nI thank them for their dedication, and I urge my colleagues to support \nthem by opposing these efforts to freeze Federal pay and hiring.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, earlier this week, the Senate adopted an \namendment to the bill we now consider that would, among other things, \ngive the Chief of the National Guard Bureau a seat on the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff. I was a strong supporter of this amendment, as I was its two \nlegislative predecessors, the Guardians of Freedom Act and the National \nGuard Empowerment and State-National Defense Integration Act.\n  Since then, I have actively lobbied my colleagues to support the \nmeasures, and I am glad that this week, so many of them came together \nto support it. With more than 70 cosponsors from across the political \nspectrum and ultimately, the unanimous consent of this body, the deep \nbipartisan support shown for the National Guard this week is not only \nindicative of the immense respect the brave citizen soldiers of this \nNation have earned, but of the extraordinary potential they have for \nenhancing our national security.\n  A National Guard in one form or another has served our Nation bravely \nand honorably for 375 years. Their courage is no less respected, their \nfamilies no less concerned for their well-being. They have done \nextraordinary work these last 10 years in in Operation Enduring \nFreedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and in Operation New Dawn. But that \nis not what this amendment was about. This amendment was not about \nrewarding what has been done in the past.\n  Rather, it was about recognizing what we need to do for our future in \norder to keep our country safe. That is the key here: bringing to bear \nevery resource we have for the defense of this Nation.\n  The Joint Chiefs of Staff are the top military advisers to the \nPresident and to the Secretary of Defense. They are responsible for \nmaking sure our military is prepared for every threat to our national \nsecurity, but as those threats tilt toward the asymmetric, so must our \nmilitary planning.\n  The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have begun a fundamental \ntransformation of our military, shifting away from a posture designed \nto counter Soviet aggression in Europe toward a posture that confronts \nasymmetric threats to American lives and interests.\n  Writing in a report for the Center for New American Security last \nyear, retired General Gordon Sullivan described the National Guard as \nat a crossroads: ``Down one path lies continued transformation into a \n21st-century operational force and progress on the planning, budgetary \nand management reforms still required to make that aspiration a \nreality. Down the other path lies regression to a Cold War-style \nstrategic force meant only to be used as a last resort in the event of \nmajor war.''\n  There was a clear choice, and this week the Senate made it, taking \nwhat I believe is a significant step toward strengthening our national \nsecurity.\n  When national defense solely meant fighting our enemies abroad, the \ncurrent organizational strategy made sense. But now that we are more \nlikely to have to defend against threats to America's national security \nhere on American shores at the same time, we need the National Guard to \nhave a seat at the table. We need the National Guard's resources and \ncapabilities to be a first-line consideration that matches their first-\nline mandate.\n  In my home State of Delaware, the 31st Civil Support Team is the tip \nof the spear of the military response to a chemical, biological, \nradiological, or nuclear attack by terrorists. Following closely behind \npolice, fire, and EMS services, our CST would diagnose the threat, \ninform and update the chain of command, and prepare the affected area \nto receive a response by larger units, coordinating as far up the chain \nas U.S. Northern Command.\n  When the Joint Chiefs sit down to plan for a biological attack on \nthis country, they need someone at the table who fully understands the \nmission of units like the 31st Civil Support Team, whose members are \nfull-time Guard, but not Active Duty military.\n  One area that needs more thought by the Joint Chiefs, and that I hope \nGeneral McKinley and his successors will help them focus on, is the \nimportant role the Guard can play in cyber security, an area where most \nthreats are decidedly asymmetric.\n  The Delaware Air National Guard's 166th Network Warfare Squadron is \nalready playing a key role in our nation's defensive and offensive \ncyber capability working with U.S. Cyber Command, but its potential as \na bridge between the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security, \nbetween Federal and State governments, and between the public and \nprivate sectors has barely been considered outside of a few circles. \nDetermining what unique role the Guard can play in cyber security to \ncreate a more robust, more flexible defense-in-depth is just one of the \nnew ideas I believe the Chief of the National Guard Bureau can bring to \nthe planning process.\n  The men and women of the National Guard bring extraordinary \ncapabilities to our Armed Forces, and because of the action we have \ntaken here this week, I know that our military will be better prepared \nfor new and emerging threats to our Nation.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to reiterate my support for \nsection 526 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. \nSection 526 prohibits Federal agencies including the Department of \nDefense--from contracting for fuels that have higher\n\n[[Page S8132]]\n\n emissions than conventional petroleum.\n  This is not only an issue of clean energy and a better environment \nbut, more importantly, our Nation's security and ability to fight. The \nDepartment of Defense is the world's biggest energy consumer, using \n300,000 barrels of oil every day. Given our reliance on foreign sources \nof oil, this is a formidable security challenge for our country.\n  The efforts underway at the Department to increase efficiency and \nexpand the use of renewable energy and alternative fuel sources are \ncritical to both the bottom line of Pentagon and to increase the safety \nof our warfighters. As you know, a record number of casualties in Iraq \nand Afghanistan have occurred while units transport fuel and supplies \nin military convoys. Increasing our energy and fuel efficiency not only \nreduces the overhead costs of the military, but it will also decrease \nthe need to move as much fuel and supplies, lessening the risks posed \nby these convoys to our troops.\n  This is an important and timely issue because while the National \nDefense Authorization Act we are considering on the Senate floor does \nnothing to affect section 526, the House version of NDAA repeals this \nimportant law.\n  The Department of Defense supports this existing law and has said \nthat it does not prevent them from purchasing the fuel it needs to meet \nits current mission needs. Hundreds of veterans who served in the Armed \nForces from World War II through the Iraq and Afghanistan wars have \nasked the Senate to oppose repeal of section 526.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with the Department and our veterans to \nsupport this law.\n  I also applaud the work the DOD has done to date to move toward \nhomegrown, renewable fuel sources, including the Navy's commitment to \nreduce petroleum use in its fleet by 50 percent through programs such \nas the Green Fleet.\n  To help the DOD realize its goals and to increase the security of our \ntroops, we must dramatically scale up advanced biofuels production in \nthe United States. Companies here in the United States have already \ndeveloped technologies to produce ``drop-in'' ready fuels, so no new \ninfrastructure or engine modifications are needed. These fuels are \nbased on plants like camelina, jatropha, and algae--plants that can be \ngrown all over the country in a variety of climates.\n  I believe section 526 has laid the foundation for this needed scale \nup of advanced biofuels, and it is time to take the next step toward \nensuring that the DOD has access to a greater range of energy options \nthan foreign sources of fossil fuels. That is why I have been working \nwith my colleagues, Senator Cantwell, Congressman Inslee, and others, \nto put in place multiyear contracting authority for the purchase of \nbiofuels.\n  We have introduced legislation in both the Senate and the House to do \njust that, and while that legislation in not included in this bill, I \nam pleased that we were able to include language that will require the \nDepartment to clarify its existing authorities for multiyear contracts \nfor the purchase of advance biofuels and what additional authorities \nare needed for the Department to enter into such contracts going \nforward.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure \nthe final NDAA bill keeps the Department moving forward on securing and \nsupporting renewable energy and fuel alternatives.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Merkley's \ncalling for the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan. I \nsupport bringing our troops home for two reasons: First, we can't \nafford what we are spending today in Afghanistan. Second, we need to \nfocus on nation building here at home.\n  We are spending $10 billion per month in Afghanistan. Every dime of \nit is deficit spending. We should listen to the former Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mullen. He said our debt is the top \nsecurity threat facing the United States. We can't continue down this \npath.\n  Our troops continue to serve heroically on some of the toughest \nmissions imaginable. They have done everything we have asked of them--\nand we have asked a lot through weekends and holidays, over frigid \nmountains and hot deserts. The service of the men and women of the \nmilitary has been nothing short of remarkable.\n  It is now time to hand over the responsibility of this war to the \nAfghans. Afghan President Hamid Karzai recently held a Loya Jirga, or \ngrand assembly, among leaders and elders from across Afghanistan.\n  The assembly approved a resolution calling for the Afghans to take \nthe lead role of the war effort. Let's take them up on their offer. \nLet's not have American men and women doing the work that Afghans want \nto do for themselves.\n  For years we have been putting war spending on our national credit \ncard. In 2003, I joined Senators Biden and Conrad in offering an \namendment to the Iraq supplemental appropriations bill that would have \noffset the war spending.\n  Instead of adopting the amendment, Congress elected to pay for the \nwar with deficit spending. Over the past decade, we have grown our debt \nby $1.3 trillion due to war spending alone. The President's budget \nprojects $500 billion dollars in war spending in the coming decade. \nThis spending is in addition to the trillions we will spend on the \ndefense base budget. This endless deficit spending is simply not \nsustainable.\n  During our work on the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, \nevery member of the panel came to a better appreciation of the \ndifficult financial decisions we face as a nation. There is no choice: \nwe have to balance our books.\n  But how we balance our books will reflect who we are as a nation, \nwhat our values are, what our goals are. Most important, these choices \nwill determine whether the 21st century will be the American century or \nwhether we will cede our leadership to countries such as China.\n  In the year ahead, Congress will make a number of hard choices, and \nwe must be strategic about these choices. We will choose among \nessential investments in education, infrastructure, health care for our \nveterans and seniors, and maintaining the best military in the world.\n  And every month we spend $10 billion dollars in Afghanistan will \nlimit what we can do at home. Every dollar we send to Afghanistan is \none less dollar we have for health care for our seniors or education \nbenefits for our veterans.\n  The tough choices must be made at a time when the world is changing \nrapidly. During his final press conference as the U.S. Ambassador to \nJapan on November 14, 1988, Mike Mansfield said:\n\n       [Japan and the United States] will work together in the \n     next century which will be the Century of the Pacific.\n       Our two nations working together will be able to compliment \n     and guide the rest of the world as it moves into this area, \n     into the [Pacific] basin, because we both realize that it is \n     in that Basin where it all is, where it is all about, and \n     where our joint future lies.\n\n  Looking back 23 years later, his remarks seem prescient. According to \nthe World Bank, China's average annual GDP growth rate since 2001 has \nbeen 10.4 percent. Asian developing nations collectively had an average \ngrowth rate of 9.1 percent. The United States has seen an average \ngrowth of just 1.7 percent.\n  The 21st century will not be the American century if we don't change \ncourse. During the first decade of this century, we spent $5.9 trillion \ndollars on defense spending, much of it in Iraq and Afghanistan. During \nthat same decade, China spent $1.1 trillion. Now, which nation's power \nincreased more during that period?\n  China is flexing muscles abroad not with shiny new weapon systems but \nwith their growing financial power. China is now the second-largest \neconomy in the world, and it continues to grow.\n  We are seeing our influence wane around the world not because we are \nshort an aircraft carrier but because some have begun to question \nAmerican resolve, the ability of American political process to solve \nbasic problems and to govern.\n  Meanwhile, millions of Americans are out of work and struggling to \nmake ends meet. Last year, I asked the Congressional Budget Office to \nprepare a report on income inequality in this country. The statistics \nare sobering. The top 1 percent of earners in the United States more \nthan doubled their\n\n[[Page S8133]]\n\nshare of income in the past 30 years. The wealthiest fifth of the \ncountry earned more than the other four-fifths combined.\n  These are only but a few of the great challenges we face at home, and \nto overcome these challenges we have to work together. To compete and \nwin in today's world, we need to balance our budget, grow our economy, \nand invest in education and infrastructure. We can't afford another \nyear of spending tens of billions of dollars on nation building \noverseas.\n  For the 21st century to be the American century, we are going to have \nto make some changes. We need to bring our troops home from Afghanistan \nand focus on nation building here at home. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport Senator Merkley's amendment.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, another amendment that I filed to S. 1867, \nthe Senate's Fiscal Year 2012 National Defense Authorization bill, \nwould have advanced new clean energy opportunities and enjoyed \nbipartisan support. The amendment's cosponsors included Senators \nShaheen, Portman, Gillibrand, Merkley, and Kerry. Unfortunately, we \nwere not able to offer it this week because of a disagreement over \nscoring. It was an important opportunity missed so I wanted to take a \nmoment to note what this amendment entailed.\n  Amendment No. 1265 would have confronted a critical long-term \nchallenge facing our Nation's military: the spiraling cost of its \nreliance on petroleum. As we look for ways to save taxpayer dollars and \nreduce our Nation's dependence on foreign oil, utilizing more electric \nvehicles should become a priority for the Defense Department and the \nentire Federal Government.\n  Investment in clean energy technology is an investment in America's \nenergy security. Liquid petroleum accounts for three-quarters of our \nArmed Forces' energy consumption, and approximately 60 percent of that \ncomes from abroad. The Defense Department has explicitly cited the \noperational risk inherent to our dependence on foreign oil and has \ncommitted itself to aggressively reducing energy consumption.\n  Senate Amendment No. 1265 would allow the Defense Department and \nother Federal agencies to purchase electric vehicles and charging \ninfrastructure under Energy Savings Performance Contracts, ESPC. ESPCs \nthemselves aren't new: the government has used ESPCs for years to pay \nfor energy efficiency upgrades. It has been enormously successful and \ncosts the government nothing up front. That's right, ESPCs are paid \nfor, financed, performed and guaranteed by the private sector with the \ngovernment paying back the private sector through guaranteed energy \nsavings over time. Our amendment would have made electric vehicles and \ncharging infrastructure eligible for the program.\n  Energy efficiency is about more than turning the lights off when you \nleave a building. It is about the appliances you buy, the tools you \nuse, and the vehicles you drive.\n  The Federal Government is America's largest energy consumer and \nwithin the government, the Defense Department is the biggest energy \nconsumer. One out of every three vehicles owned by the Federal \nGovernment is owned by the Pentagon, which is why we raised this \namendment this week.\n  Amendment No. 1265 would have helped increase the share of the \ngovernment-owned fleet that is cost-efficient, energy-efficient \nelectric vehicles. On top of that, it would not add a dime to the \nFederal deficit. By buying these vehicles in through ESPCs, the \ngovernment does not put up any money up front. Rather, it enters an \nagreement with a private-sector contractor--a job-creating private-\nsector contractor--where the agency pays the contractor over an agreed-\nupon period of time--as many as 25 years.\n  What they are paying each month, though, is the net savings achieved \nby using the electric vehicle instead of a conventional vehicle. This \nis an unconventional, but creative and cost-efficient way to save \nmoney, reduce our dependence on foreign oil, and even to help support a \ngrowing private industry.\n  This amendment would have simply provided the Defense Department with \na new tool for acquiring cost-efficient electric vehicles, which is \nwhat they are asking us to do. They want to add electric vehicles to \ntheir fleets. The Defense Department has already done extraordinary \nwork in leveraging energy efficiency to reduce its costs and reduce its \ndependence on foreign oil. We want to help them do more.\n  This is a challenging economic time for our country, and our military \nneeds every advantage it can get as it confronts dangerous threats to \nour national and energy security. By empowering the Pentagon to buy \nmore of these energy-efficient, cost-efficient electric vehicles, we \nare saving taxpayer dollars and reducing our dependence on foreign oil. \nInvestment in clean energy technology is an investment in America's \nenergy security, and energy security is, without a doubt, an \nincreasingly important, and increasingly fragile, aspect of America's \nnational security.\n  This is a common-sense policy that unfortunately cannot be considered \nat this point because of a technicality in how the Congressional Budget \nOffice scores ESPCs. It has been going on for 10 years and, as I \nunderstand, it has provided endless frustration to my colleagues on the \nSenate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and several other \ncongressional committees, and this problem reaches beyond the electric \nvehicle option alone.\n  A key point to make here is that whenever Congress tells the Federal \nGovernment to become more efficient but does not provide appropriated \nfunding for the purpose, a score is triggered because the government \nmight use ESPCs to meet the mandate. Effectively, Congress cannot tell \nthe Federal Government to save money through efficiency. Further, while \nESPCs are scored by the CBO rules, OMB does not score them because the \ngovernment does not incur any costs through their use. This specious \nscore has essentially limited our ability to reduce appropriated \ndollars and achieve energy efficient simultaneously using private \nsector expertise and funding.\n  This amendment is something that is important to me. I am hopeful it \nis something that we will be able to pass down the road. In the \nmeantime, it is an opportunity lost, to help our military prepare for \nthe threats facing our nation.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my \ndisappointment that the Senate was not able to reach agreement to \nconsider an important amendment on the Defense authorization bill that \nwould allow women in the military access to the same health care \ncoverage as civilian women.\n  There are almost 214,000 women currently serving in our Armed Forces. \nMany of these brave women are risking their lives for our national \nsecurity. Despite the sacrifices these women make to protect our \nfreedom, they are not given the same rights as civilian women when it \ncomes to their reproductive health care.\n  If a service woman becomes pregnant as a result of rape or incest, \nher insurance will not cover an abortion if she decides to seek one; \nthe law as currently written expressly prohibits it. This is \nunconscionable. To correct this injustice, I offered an amendment to \nthe bill that we are currently debating that would allow a service \nwoman the ability to receive insurance coverage for an abortion if her \npregnancy is the result of rape or incest. Unfortunately, because there \nare some in this body who do not want this unfair law changed, we were \nnot able to bring this amendment to the floor for a vote.\n  Women currently serving in the armed services are victims of \ndiscrimination. They do not have access to the same critical--and \nlegal--reproductive health care as the civilians they protect.\n  Bans on abortion coverage exist for millions of women who receive \ntheir health care through government programs, but in most cases these \nbans allow for coverage of such care if the pregnancy is the result of \nrape or incest. Women receiving their health care through Medicaid, \nMedicare, the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, and the Indian \nHealth Services all have access to the care they need if the pregnancy \nis a result of rape or incest. Even women serving time in our Federal \nprisons can get abortions covered in the case of rape. Sadly, this is \nnot the case for our Nation's women in uniform.\n\n[[Page S8134]]\n\n  I believe that every woman should have the reproductive health care \ncoverage she needs wherever she is and whenever she needs it. I do not \nthink that any ban on abortion is appropriate. However if Federal bans \ndo exist, they should at least be consistent.\n  My amendment is simple. It would permit a service woman to have an \nabortion covered by her military health insurance if the pregnancy is \nthe result of rape or incest. Repealing the current ban on such \ncoverage will simply bring the Department of Defense in line with most \nother federal policies.\n  I recently met a woman who was a victim of rape during her military \nservice. She was stationed in Korea and was unable to receive the \nhealth care she needed and deserved. Her story was heartbreaking. \nBecause of her unwanted pregnancy, she had to leave the service and \nreturn home.\n  The reality is that women in the military, especially those posted \noverseas, have few safe or legal reproductive health care options when \nthey cannot rely on the military. Without access to these services, \nsome women will be forced to resort to unsafe care or delay the health \nservices they need. Women who give their lives for our country deserve \nbetter.\n  While the bill we are considering today will move forward without \nthis important change, I pledge to all the women in our military who \nare victims of this law that I will continue my fight to bring the \nDepartment of Defense in line with other Federal agencies to allow \ncoverage for critical reproductive health care.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I commend Chairman Levin and Ranking Member \nMcCain, our distinguished Armed Services Committee leaders, for their \namendment regarding the problem of counterfeit parts, Senate amendment \n1092, which was agreed to, as modified, last Tuesday. The amendment \nestablishes a prudent framework for countering the dangerous \ninfiltration of counterfeit parts into our defense supply chain. I also \nwant to commend Senator Whitehouse for his work on this important \nissue.\n  The amendment would create criminal penalties for those trafficking \nin counterfeit parts so as to ensure that our Armed Forces have the \nbest equipment from trusted suppliers in order to carry out their \ncritical roles and missions. It would also significantly strengthen our \nsupply-chain management to detect and prevent surreptitious attempts to \nsupply our Armed Forces with counterfeit parts and components.\n  I have followed the hearings in the Senate Armed Services Committee \nregarding these matters. I wanted to take time today to raise in \nrelation to the amendment a problem that I believe could complicate its \nenforcement. If we truly intend to grow our economy through exports, \nthen we ought to pay attention to any risks that may stem from \nliberalizing our present export controls so as to ensure that our \nindustrial base benefits--and not those who deal in counterfeit parts \nand components in other nations.\n  A person who commits an offense under this amendment may be punished \nif that person ``had knowledge that the good or service is falsely \nidentified as meeting military standards or is intended for use in a \nmilitary or national security application.''\n  I am concerned that the amendment may be undermined by the export \ncontrol initiatives of the administration. The administration is \nengaged in an effort to remove most, if not all, of the military-grade \nparts and components controlled on the U.S. Munitions List. Many of \nthese will be decontrolled altogether for export and import purposes. \nOthers will be placed under the Commerce Department's Export \nAdministration Regulations. Hundreds of thousands of military-grade \nparts, components and systems are involved.\n  The reasons why this agenda presents significant challenges to \ndealing with counterfeit parts center on the relatively liberal legal \nand policy considerations that govern our commercial trade with China. \nSenators Levin and Whitehouse pointed to the many problems emanating \nfrom counterfeit Chinese parts in their remarks on the floor. As we \nknow from the hearings and studies to date, Chinese suppliers play the \nmajor role in the unauthorized supply of counterfeit parts.\n  We also know from the Commerce Department's January 2010 report on \ncounterfeit electronics, which was commissioned by the Navy Department, \nthat the counterfeit electronics infiltrating the Defense Department \nsupply chain and affecting weapon system reliability are predominantly \ncommercial and industrial grade parts--so-called commercial off-the-\nshelf, COTS, technology.\n  The drawings and specifications needed to produce those parts can \nbe--and are--freely exported to China under the Commerce Department's \nExport Administration Regulations, EAR. There is no legal bar to \nexports of such drawings and parts to China and, in all but rare cases, \nthey may be sent to China without an export license. The same holds \ntrue for the import of such parts into the United States after they are \nproduced in China.\n  In contrast, there has been a much lower incidence to date of \ncounterfeit parts specifically designed for military use. Such parts \nare currently controlled on the U.S. Munitions List. Maintenance of the \nU.S. Munitions List is authorized by the Arms Export Control Act, AECA, \nand it is administered by the State Department in consultation with the \nDefense Department. The Foreign Relations Committee has unique \njurisdiction over these matters in the Senate.\n  The reasons for the lower incidence of counterfeit military-grade \nparts are threefold: One, it is illegal to export any drawings or \nspecifications to China that are controlled on the U.S. Munitions List, \ndue to the statutory arms embargo imposed on China following the \nTiananmen Square massacre; two, it is illegal under the International \nTraffic in Arms Regulations, ITAR--the State Department's regulations \nwhich contain the U.S. Munitions List--to import any defense article \ninto the United States from China; and three, willful violations of the \nITAR and the AECA are vigorously enforced by U.S. courts, with the \nmajority of convictions resulting in prison sentences, while the \nmajority of willful violations involving illegal exports of industrial \nor commercial products result in probation. The latter are currently \nenforced under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act because \nthe Export Administration Act has lapsed.\n  Unfortunately, all of the deterrents inherent in control on the U.S. \nMunitions List could go away if and when the administration's export \ncontrol reform initiatives are implemented.\n  I congratulate and welcome the efforts of Senator Levin, Senator \nMcCain and other Senators to close down the infiltration of counterfeit \nparts into our defense supply chain, but I remain concerned that the \nadministration's agenda for export control reform will increase these \nproblems in the future and frustrate enforcement of this amendment.\n  In addition, it is my understanding that the administration not only \nplans to remove nearly all the military-grade parts and components from \nthe U.S. Munitions List, but also to redefine those few categories of \nhigh-end parts and components remaining on the Munitions List in a way \nthat would seriously complicate enforcement of the amendment.\n  We will continue to consult with the administration on its reform \nagenda in the Foreign Relations Committee.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to ask for the attention of \nmy colleagues on two amendments that I have filed to S. 1867, the \nNational Defense Authorization Act of 2012.\n  Each of these amendments relates to the Navy's proposal to build a \nnew nuclear pier facility to support East Coast aircraft carriers. With \nannual recurring costs, this new project would likely cost just shy of \na billion dollars.\n  At a time when our Nation is in a severe fiscal crisis the Navy \ncannot pay to maintain the infrastructure it currently owns. As Admiral \nMullen has said, the greatest challenge to our national security is our \nmounting debt.\n  Together, these amendments would save nearly $30 million for an \nunnecessary Navy military construction project at Naval Station \nMayport, Florida. We are awaiting completion of an independent GAO \nassessment of the strategic risks to our carrier fleet which include \nmanmade and natural disasters. The study would also consider the cost \nand benefits of what\n\n[[Page S8135]]\n\nother measures we can take to mitigate risk.\n  This is not a small project. The Navy estimates its homeporting plan \nwill cost nearly $600 million, but those costs could rise to up to $1 \nbillion over the next eight years. Tack on to that more than $25 \nmillion in annual maintenance costs currently estimated for an \nadditional homeport and we are signing the taxpayer up for a big bill, \nmuch of which is not funded. It's in the ``out years'' as they say.\n  The justification for a new homeport is the mitigation of the risk of \na terrorist attack, accident, or natural disaster occurring at the \nnuclear handling facility at the existing carrier homeport at Norfolk, \nVA.\n  However, the current Navy plan fails to take into account the two \nadditional East Coast carrier capabilities facilities at Newport News, \nVA, and the Naval Shipyard. Each of these facilities maintains separate \nnuclear handling sites located many miles apart. If there were damage \nto the existing Naval base, the Navy could simply disperse the carriers \nto other piers. That is a lot cheaper and more efficient than building \na new, duplicative facility.\n  Additionally, recent Navy briefings indicate there is a 50 percent \ngreater chance of a major hurricane hitting Mayport than Norfolk. Why \nwould we want to build a new facility at a higher risk location?\n  The Navy has also identified unfunded priorities totaling $11.8 \nbillion dollars. These priorities are in critical areas including \nshipbuilding, military construction, maintenance, and acquisition \nprograms--programs which are critical to both our current and future \nreadiness.\n  We must maintain our existing infrastructure properly before pursuing \na duplicative homeporting project. It is more fiscally responsible for \nthe Navy to reduce its current unfunded requirements, which total tens \nof billions of dollars.\n  We have had some recent developments that I want to highlight that \ncast more doubt on the wisdom of embarking on this enormous \nexpenditure. Responding to a letter I wrote, along with other \ncolleagues in the Virginia delegation, the Navy's new CNO, Admiral \nGreenert has said that it is time to take a fresh look at the costs of \nthis project, given the current fiscal constraints. Admiral Greenert \nwrote the Navy will be making a ``comprehensive strategic review, \nexamining every program element, including the funding required to \nhomeport a CVN in Mayport.'' I agree with Admiral Greenert. With the \nserious fiscal issues facing our Nation, the prudent course of action \nis to focus on taking care of the infrastructure we already have \ninstead of buying new infrastructure which we do not need and cannot \nafford.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I want to discuss the \namendment to the pending Defense authorization bill negotiated between \nmy two Banking Committee colleagues, Senators Menendez and Kirk, \ndesigned to address the deceptive and fraudulent practices, sanctions \nevasion, facilitation of proliferation, and other illicit behavior of \nIran's Central Bank.\n  Ten days ago, President Obama issued an Executive order designed to \nfurther isolate and penalize Iran for its refusal to live up to its \ninternational obligations regarding its nuclear program. As he noted, \nfor years the Iranian Government has failed to abide by its obligations \nunder the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, violated repeated U.N. \nSecurity Council resolutions, and ignored its legal commitments to the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency. In the face of this intransigence, \nthe world has spoken with one voice--at the IAEA, at the U.N., and in \ncapitals around the world--making it clear that Iranian actions are a \nthreat to international peace and stability and will only further \nisolate the Iranian regime.\n  The President targeted, for the first time, Iran's petrochemical \nsector, prohibiting the provision of goods, services, and technology to \nthis sector and authorizing penalties against any person or entity that \nengages in such activity. He also designated for sanction a group of \nindividuals and entities for assisting Iran's prohibited nuclear \nprograms, including its enrichment and heavy water programs. And he \nescalated the financial and economic pressure by using provisions of \nthe USA PATRIOT Act to identify the entire Iranian banking sector--\nincluding Iran's Central Bank--as a threat to governments and financial \ninstitutions that do business with Iran.\n  I strongly support enhanced sanctions on Iran, including its Central \nBank, and have been working with my ranking member, Senator Shelby, on \nanother sanctions measure to expand and reinforce the Comprehensive \nIran Sanctions and Accountability Act, CISADA, enacted last year. That \nlegislation will be marked up soon in our committee. But as in all \nareas of complex sanctions law, it is important to craft these \nprovisions with an eye to ensuring that they do not have negative \nunintended consequences for the United States and American consumers in \nterms of substantially increased oil and gas prices; for our allies, \nwhose cooperation is crucial in further isolating Iran; for central \nbanks around the world. We also want to avoid the result--if this \nmeasure is not further refined and then implemented by the White House \nin close consultation with our allies--that Iran itself could benefit \nfrom an oil price premium we in the West would pay if notoriously \nvolatile world oil markets respond negatively and if non-Iranian oil \nsupplies are not sufficient to fill the gap caused by countries that \nseek their oil elsewhere than from Iran.\n  The amendment seeks to address that concern by providing for a lag \ntime of 6 months for oil markets to prepare and providing for a \nPresidential certification on oil price and supply availability before \nthe petroleum sanctions would become effective. But that may not be \nsufficient, given the complexity of oil markets, which I am told by the \nEnergy Department tend to pull such dates forward, anticipating oil \nprice supply shortfalls--and oil price increases--and building them \ninto oil traders' assumptions well before sanctions actually take \neffect.\n  I have heard a number of concerns about this amendment in its current \nform from senior officials at the Treasury Department charged with \nimplementing it. First, Treasury officials have indicated that they \nhave concerns about how this amendment could affect our close allies, \nincluding foreign central banks of those governments that have worked \nwith us in recent years to sanction Iran and that hold large reserves \nin the United States but who have thus far decided they cannot, because \nof their current dependence on Iranian oil, completely and relatively \nquickly withdraw from purchasing its oil. We must avoid having these \ncentral banks begin to pull their reserves from the United States out \nof fear that enforcement of this amendment might limit their access to \nthe U.S. financial system. That is why the signals sent by the Treasury \nSecretary and the President about implementing this provision are so \nimportant.\n  The administration also has concerns regarding effective \nimplementation of this amendment, especially its requirement that the \nPresident prohibit accounts outright instead of, as elsewhere in U.S. \nlaw, allowing discretion to impose strict conditions on accounts--on \ntrade finance limits, on the nature or size of transactions, on \npreapproval of transactions and about the timelines it presents, the \nconfusing and seemingly conflicting interaction of some of its \nprovisions, its lack of an exception for countries that are closely \ncooperating with the United States on sanctions enforcement, and \nothers. I ask consent to print in the Record following my statement a \ncopy of a letter from Secretary Geithner indicating his strong \nopposition to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, so ordered (see Exhibit 1).\n  Mr. JOHNSON. We all agree that interactions by the international \nfinancial community with Iran's financial system should be severely \nreduced, not least because such interactions pose serious risks for the \ninternational banking system. But we do not want to do it in a way that \ncould have negative consequences for some of our closest allies or for \nourselves. We want to be careful that we don't end up shooting \nourselves in the head and Iran in the foot.\n  I know my colleagues have worked in the last week, including over the \nThanksgiving holidays, to make the provision more effective and to \nprovide for additional targeting by the President, building in a \nnational security\n\n[[Page S8136]]\n\nwaiver, a lag period for implementation of the crude oil sanctions, and \nother measures. But I think the provision could use further refinement. \nThat is why I had hoped to be able to address this issue through the \nmore deliberative committee process.\n  Even though I have concerns about some of the effects of this \namendment in its current form, I will support it as a signal of my \nsupport for tightening the financial and economic noose around Tehran \nand for further isolating its government as a means of prompting it to \nturn aside from its current path and come clean on its nuclear program. \nEven so, these implementation issues should be addressed in conference \nprior to the legislation being finalized.\n  Finally, I want to remind my colleagues that the Banking Committee is \nworking expeditiously to adopt new comprehensive sanctions legislation \nand I hope will be ready to bring that legislation to the full Senate \nsoon. It will complement and reinforce the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions \nand Accountability Act, CISADA, enacted a little over a year ago, and \ninternational diplomatic efforts led by the President to further \nisolate Iran and ratchet up the pressure on its leaders. I think all of \nus would agree that the most effective sanctions are those that are \nimposed and enforced by a coalition of nations, and the \nadministration's success in building and sustaining a coalition to do \nprecisely that is to be commended. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues on that effort.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                   Department of the Treasury,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 1, 2011.\n     Hon. Carl Levin\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Levin: I am writing to address amendment 1414 \n     to S. 1867, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal \n     Year 2012, regarding the imposition of sanctions on foreign \n     financial institutions that conduct business with the Central \n     Bank of Iran (CBI).\n       The Obama Administration's determination to prevent Iran \n     from acquiring nuclear weapons is unwavering. We are resolved \n     to build and sustain as much pressure as necessary to bring \n     Iran to meet its international obligations and address the \n     international community's grave concerns with its nuclear \n     program. I know that you and your colleagues in the Senate \n     share this commitment.\n       We understand that this amendment was offered in this \n     spirit. However, I am writing to express the Administration's \n     strong opposition to this amendment because, in its current \n     form, it threatens to undermine the effective, carefully \n     phased, and sustainable approach we have undertaken to build \n     strong international pressure against Iran. In addition, the \n     amendment would potentially yield a net economic benefit to \n     the Iranian regime.\n       We have steadily increased the pressure on Iran by \n     tightening sanctions, closing loopholes, and encouraging \n     other countries to do the same. Congress has been absolutely \n     critical in providing some of the tools that we have used to \n     accomplish that goal, and we are seeing genuine results. The \n     collaborative approach the U.S. has taken with our \n     international partners has led many to impose sanctions on \n     Iran that were not even contemplated three years ago, \n     including on Iran's energy sector.\n       Iran's greatest economic resource is its oil exports. Sales \n     of crude oil line the regime's pockets, sustain its human \n     rights abuses, and feed its nuclear ambitions like no other \n     sector of the Iranian economy. We are committed to doing as \n     much as possible to reduce Iran's oil revenue while \n     concurrently working to stabilize global oil markets. Today, \n     the United States does not permit the import of Iranian \n     crude. Other countries have already begun to reduce their \n     consumption of Iranian crude and the Administration is \n     working hard to discourage anyone from taking advantage of \n     the responsible policies of these countries. Our closest \n     allies are seriously considering curtailing their own crude \n     purchases altogether in the near future and we are doing \n     everything possible to encourage them to make the right \n     decision.\n       However, as currently conceived, this amendment threatens \n     severe sanctions against any commercial bank or central bank \n     if they engage in certain transactions with the CBI. This \n     could negatively affect many of our closest allies and \n     largest trading partners. Rather than motivating these \n     countries to join us in increasing pressure on Iran, they are \n     more likely to resent our actions and resist following our \n     lead--a consequence that would serve the Iranians more than \n     it harms them. Further, there is a substantial likelihood \n     that this amendment, particularly if passed into law at this \n     time and in its current form, could have the opposite effect \n     from what is intended and increase the Iranian regime's \n     revenue, literally fueling their suspect nuclear ambitions. \n     The Administration is prepared at your convenience to share \n     the details of our analysis on this point, in a classified \n     briefing.\n       The Obama Administration strongly supports increasing the \n     pressure on Iran significantly, including through properly \n     designed and well-targeted sanctions against the CBI. The \n     Administration has several legislative proposals to both \n     enhance and expand the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, \n     Accountability, and Divestment Act (CISADA) and to strike at \n     the CBI that we would like to discuss with you and your \n     colleagues. We intend to work with our partners to achieve \n     the objectives of this amendment, but in a fashion that we \n     believe will have a greater and more sustainable impact on \n     Iran. We ask that you continue to work with us on ways to \n     improve this amendment and to consider other, more immediate \n     and more effective steps that we can take to accomplish our \n     shared goals while we work with our partners to bring about \n     the effects this amendment is intended to achieve.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Timothy F. Geithner.\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I rise today to protect \nthe families of our men and women in uniform. While these brave members \nof our community put their lives on the line to protect our freedoms \nabroad, courts here are using their service against them when making \nchild custody determinations.\n  Although I did not submit my amendment due to concern expressed by \nthe Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, it is important that the \ncommittee take up this issue to ensure that servicemembers have a \nuniform standard of protection when determining the best interests of \ntheir children.\n  Servicemembers risk their lives in support of the contingency \noperations that keep our Nation safe. The amendment prohibits courts \nfrom permanently altering custody orders during a parent's deployment, \nand requires pre-deployment custody to be reinstated unless that is not \nin the best interest of the child.\n  This language of my amendment has enjoyed widespread support in the \nHouse for the past five years and was recently endorsed by the \nDepartment of Defense. Earlier this year Secretary Gates stated that he \nwanted to work with Congress to pursue the creation of a Federal \nuniform standard. In his letter of support dated February 15th, 2011, \nSecretary dates stated: ``I have been giving this matter a lot of \nthought and believe we should change our position to one where we are \nwilling to consider whether appropriate legislation can be crafted that \nprovides servicemembers with a federal uniform standard of \nprotection.''\n  Our men and women in uniform sacrifice a great deal to serve our \ncountry. We owe it to them to provide uniform legal standards regarding \nchild custody. Servicemembers should never be in the position of having \nto choose between their country and their family.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, tonight the Senate will vote overwhelmingly \nto support our men and women in uniform, including the more than 1,100 \nNevadans serving overseas, as they continue to put their lives on the \nline. I congratulate Senators Levin and McCain for their stewardship of \nthis bill and for working through several difficult issues.\n  There is still work to be done in conference to perfect parts of this \nbill, including the provisions dealing with military detainees and \nefforts to improve key elements of TRICARE.\n  I am pleased that today an overwhelming, bipartisan majority agreed \nthat protecting our national security is more important than partisan \npolitics. Today we came together to support our troops, and ensured \nthat this Nation does everything in its power to keep America safe from \nthose who would do us harm.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield back the 1 minute of time remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided on the bill, as amended.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we are going to be making a unanimous \nconsent request. I am not even going to use my 1 minute on this other \nthan to say thanks to everybody who has been so heavily involved, which \nis just about everybody in this Senate.\n\n[[Page S8137]]\n\n  I want to particularly thank Senator McCain. His staff and my staff \nhave been utterly incredible. We have had hundreds of amendments we had \nto get through. We have done the best we can, and I want to tell my \nfriends this so we can prepare a path for a unanimous consent \nagreement. It is not prepared yet, so I cannot read it, but it is going \nto be something like this. For those amendments which were germane, not \nbecause of modification, but were germane--\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Will the Senator from Michigan yield? I \ndon't think we disposed of the Udall amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I believe we did.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Udall amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reluctantly.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Let me describe what this is about so we can be thinking \nabout it before it is offered. There were 71 amendments, approximately, \nwhich were cleared. We spoke about those before. If anyone had an \nobjection, they were not cleared. So by definition there is no \nobjection on the substance of these amendments. However, there is \nobjection for other reasons, one of them being that if an amendment was \nmodified to make it germane, there would be an objection on that basis.\n  So what Senator McCain and I are talking about--and we will put it in \na unanimous consent proposal and then you all can decide if you want to \nagree to this--is that we would work--we pass a bill tonight and do all \nthe other things we need to do because that has to be done. We have to \nget to conference.\n  In the next couple of days Senator McCain and I, working with the \nParliamentarian, would go through the 71 amendments, or whatever the \nnumber is. The Parliamentarian would then advise us as to which of \nthose amendments is germane and were germane--and these are all cleared \namendments. And for that group, whatever the number is, that we are \ninformed by the Parliamentarian is germane and were germane, we would \nthen put in a bill which would be introduced next week. If we can get \nthat done, then the unanimous consent request would have that bill \nintroduced, read a third time, and passed. That would be the most we \ncould ask for.\n  It would seem to me if we could pass this tonight, we could do the \nsame thing with a bill--providing Senator McCain and I agree after \ntalking to the Parliamentarian--that the only amendments that would be \nin that bill would be amendments which were germane.\n  How do we get that bill into the conference report? We have not \nfigured that out yet, but we are working on that piece as well. At \nleast we can get the bill passed so we can go to conference and show \nthe Senate passed these X number of amendments. This is the best we \ncould do. It is the cleanest we could do. The Parliamentarian did not \nlike the different idea that we proposed, and I don't blame him and \nher, but that is what we are going to be offering in a few minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I have nothing more to add. I wish to vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. If I may be permitted to thank the distinguished chairman \nfor that offer. It is unclear to me how it will actually be executed--\nand all of this could have been avoided, from my perspective, if a \nsimple unanimous consent request had been allowed to modify an \namendment that I had that was not germane to make it germane so we \ncould have a simple up-or-down vote, something that was in the nature \nof a technical correction, which I would think as a matter of custom \nand courtesy would be allowed. But apparently that is not the way \nthings are operating.\n  All of these convulsions are being engaged in simply to avoid an \nobjection to a unanimous consent request to modify an amendment to make \nit germane. It could all be avoided and we could have taken care of \nthis in 10 or 15 minutes. I don't understand if the distinguished \nchairman is actually making that unanimous consent request at this time \nor is merely explaining what his intentions are. I will try to work \nwith him, but I am not yet sure this is going to work as he hopes it \nwill. My objection will remain that any amendment that was not germane \nwhen filed but could be made germane by modification, as mine could, \nwould not be permitted to be in this managers' package or passed by \nunanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. It sounds simplistic, and the hour is late and we need to \nvote, but the fact is there were 382 amendments that were submitted. \nThere were hundreds of amendments that were waiting, and the fact is \nthat initially the Cornyn amendment was not agreed to, so it is a \nlittle more complicated than that. There were literally 400 or 500 \namendments that were filed, and we had to at some point cut off the \nprocess. For next year's bill we will try to get a situation where it \nis far more inclusive and far more informative. When you are dealing \nwith 500 amendments, I know that each is important, but there is no way \nyou are going to be able to get through the authorization bill with \nthat many amendments that are filed, and that is just a fact. We are \ndoing the best we can to accommodate the Senator from Texas and the \nSenator from Oklahoma and every other Senator who didn't get their \namendment voted on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that upon passage \nof S. 1867, the Armed Services Committee be discharged from further \nconsideration of H.R. 1540 and the Senate proceed to its consideration; \nthat all after the enacting clause be stricken and the text of S. 1867, \nas amended, and passed by the Senate, be inserted in lieu thereof; that \nH.R. 1540, as amended, be read a third time, passed, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table; that the Senate insist on its \namendment, request a conference with the House on the disagreeing votes \nof the two Houses; and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on \nthe part of the Senate, with the Armed Services Committee appointed as \nconferees; that no points of order be considered waived by virtue of \nthis agreement; and all with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank everybody and I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as a Senator, I have no greater \nresponsibility than to work to ensure the security of the United \nStates, and I believe the military should have all the tools they need \nto keep our Nation safe. I\n\n[[Page S8138]]\n\nsupport the vast majority of the Defense authorization bill. However, \nbecause I believe we can protect our national security without \ninfringing on critical constitutional values, I could not support this \nbill. The bill fails to clarify that under no circumstance can an \nAmerican citizen be detained indefinitely without trial. And it \nmandates for the first time that suspects arrested in the United States \nwill be detained by the military rather than domestic and civilian law \nenforcement, who since 9/11 have successfully convicted in civilian \ncourts over 400 terrorists. Finally, the bill would make it more \ndifficult to close the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, for which I \nhave long fought because the detention facility is a stain on our honor \nand a recruiting tool for terrorists around the world.\n  Not only do these provisions violate the core values upon which our \nfreedom rests, but they won't make us safer. The Pentagon, CIA Director \nPetraeus, Intelligence Director Clapper, and FBI Director Mueller all \nsaid these provisions will needlessly hurt, rather than help, our \nnational security.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator from \nMichigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will be very brief for obvious reasons. \nBut this is a golden moment for us. The proud tradition of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee has been maintained every year since 1961 and \ncontinues with the Senate's passage of the 50th consecutive national \ndefense authorization bill. It always takes a huge amount of work to \nget a bill of this magnitude done. It could not happen without the \nsupport of all the Senators on the committee. I will not thank each and \nevery one--the subcommittee chairs, the ranking members, our staff, the \nfloor staff here, who do extraordinary work. But the bipartisanship of \nthis committee dominates again, and we hope that flavor will continue \nto dominate forever in the committee and hope it will permeate this \nSenate.\n  We always have to work long and hard to pass this bill and no two of \nthese bills are alike. But it's worth every bit of effort we put into \nit because it is for our security, for our troops, and for their \nfamilies. I thank all Senators for their roles in keeping our tradition \ngoing.\n  Our committee's bipartisanship also makes this moment possible. I am \nproud to serve with Senator McCain and grateful for his partnership and \nfriendship. I also want to thank our very dedicated and capable Senate \nfloor staff on both sides of the aisle--Gary Myrick, Trish Engle, Tim \nMitchell, and Meredith Mellody on the Democratic side and David \nSchiappa, Laura Dove, Ashley Messick, and Patrick Kilcur on the \nRepublican side. They have all helped us get this bill across the \nfinish line and we are very grateful to them and all others here on the \nfloor and in both cloakrooms.\n  Finally, I thank all our committee staff members for their \nextraordinary drive and many personal sacrifices to get this bill done. \nLed by Rick DeBobes, our committee's staff director; Peter Levine, our \ngeneral counsel; and Dave Morriss, our minority staff director, our \nstaff really has given their all to get this bill passed. So to all of \nyou and to all your families, thank you for your hard work. Take a few \nminutes to celebrate this moment and then put all your talents to work \nin conference with the House so we can bring a conference report back \nto the Senate before the holidays.\n  Mr. President, they all deserve recognition and, as a tribute to \ntheir professionalism and as a further expression of our gratitude, I \nask unanimous consent that all staff members' names be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       Richard D.

I thank the chairman. One of the things I look back on \nwith great nostalgia and appreciation is the relationship we have \ndeveloped over many years. I must say that we have had spirited \ndiscussions from time to time, but they have been educational, \nenlightening, and entertaining.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \n     next two votes be 10 minutes in duration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. As the order that is now before the Senate indicates, I \nhave the ability to designate who will be the speakers. We have 1 \nminute on one and 1 minute on the other.

Under the previous order, there is 2 minutes \nequally divided prior to a vote on the motion to proceed to S. 1917.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, this Middle Class Tax Cut Act is very \nsimple. It does two things for employers and also helps employees.\n  Last year, the Senate came together in a bipartisan bill. We passed a \ntax bill that, among other things, reduced payroll taxes for employees. \nThis legislation expands that. Instead of just saying we are going to \nhave a reduction of 2 percent of the payroll tax, this legislation cuts \nit in half. So you are cutting the payroll tax in half. That is\n\n[[Page S8139]]\n\ntake-home pay, $1,500 in the pockets of the average working family in \nAmerica.\n  Secondly, it allows us to provide a cut as well for businesses, \ncutting in half the payroll tax for businesses. It is good public \npolicy. It will create lots of jobs at a time when the American people \nare telling us, with one voice, they want us to do one thing here: \ncreate jobs or create the conditions for job creation so small \nbusinesses can hire. At the same time, they want us to come together in \na bipartisan way.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, there are a lot of Republicans here who \nagree with one of the basic principles in the Democratic bill; that is, \nthere is no reason why people ought to suffer even more than they \nalready are from the President's failure to turn this job crisis \naround.\n  What the Republicans have proposed is an alternative to this bill \nthat ensures that no one sees a tax hike this year. The biggest \ndifference is that the Republican proposal ensures that no one's taxes \nget raised in a down economy.\n  There is simply no reason that preventing a tax hike in this bad \neconomy needs to be paid for by raising taxes on the very employers \nwhom we are counting on to help jolt this economy back to life, which \nis exactly what the Democrats have put forward. So the Republican \nproposal would ensure that no one sees a tax increase next year. It \navoids the gratuitous hit on job creators, and, even better, our plan \nreduces the Federal deficit by more than $111 billion.\n  This is a dramatic expansion of this particular provision, which we \ncannot afford when we already have a $15 trillion debt. There is a \nright way and wrong way to do this. This is the wrong way in the \nDemocratic proposal. The Republican proposal is the right way.\n  I urge our colleagues to vote against this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.

Mr. President, the Senate today has an opportunity to put \naside some of the partisan differences and come together and do \nsomething that will benefit all Americans. The legislation I propose is \na solution, and I support solutions which Republicans, Democrats, and \nIndependents can all support.\n  By supporting my legislation and imposing tax increases on employers, \nCongress can also preserve opportunity for job growth in the future. \nIncreasing taxes on small businesses will not help my State overcome \nthe highest unemployment rate in the Nation. By asking millionaires and \nbillionaires to pay higher premiums for government health care, my \nproposal asks the richest Americans to do more, just like my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle ask that they should.\n  Lastly, this proposal is the only one that has a chance of passing \nthe House of Representatives and be signed into law. I urge all of my \ncolleagues to support this piece of legislation and this effort to help \nAmericans already struggling to make ends meet.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, the problem with this proposal--and I hope \nwe are reaching the point where we are actually coming together in a \nbipartisan way--is that it does not help small business. What we should \nbe doing is cutting the payroll tax in half for employees and cutting \nit in half for employers so we can help small businesses.\n  This bill does not do that. All it does is take the existing cut in \nthe payroll tax and keep that in place.\n  We like that part of it. We should expand the tax cut for workers and \nalso have a separate cut in the payroll tax for employers, so 160 \nmillion workers and lots of businesses can get the benefit of this \npayroll tax cut to put money in people's pockets, grow the economy, and \nmove the economy forward.

I urge all of my \ncolleagues to support this piece of legislation and this effort to help \nAmericans already struggling to make ends meet.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, the problem with this proposal--and I hope \nwe are reaching the point where we are actually coming together in a \nbipartisan way--is that it does not help small business. What we should \nbe doing is cutting the payroll tax in half for employees and cutting \nit in half for employers so we can help small businesses.\n  This bill does not do that. All it does is take the existing cut in \nthe payroll tax and keep that in place.\n  We like that part of it. We should expand the tax cut for workers and \nalso have a separate cut in the payroll tax for employers, so 160 \nmillion workers and lots of businesses can get the benefit of this \npayroll tax cut to put money in people's pockets, grow the economy, and \nmove the economy forward. I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, just a few moments ago we cast several \nvotes in regard to the so-called payroll tax holiday. I opposed both \nthe Republican amendment and the Democratic amendment.\n  There were significant differences between these two versions of this \nlegislation; in part, the differences at least included the way that \nthe provisions were paid for. While I may support the pay-fors, I \nobjected to what the pay-fors are paying for.\n  I support freezing the pay of Members of Congress, the elimination of \ncertain benefits to millionaires, and reducing the Federal workforce. \nBut wouldn't we be better using the proceeds of these reductions in \nspending to reduce the debt and deficit rather than a short-term change \nthat reduces the revenues going to the Social Security and Medicare \ntrust funds? When are we going to admit we are broke?\n  I am reminded of a plan approved by Congress just several years ago \nwhere we borrowed money to give citizens a $600 rebate, all in the name \nof a stimulus. We wanted to stimulate the economy and, in my view, what \nwe did was we stimulated little and increased the debt a lot.\n  Many of us have expressed support for the concepts contained in the \nBowles-Simpson deficit reduction plan. Their recommendations are very \nimportant and we have paid a lot of attention to them and expressed our \ndesire to proceed in that way. Many times we have said that. But the \nlegislation we just voted on uses many of their suggested reductions in \nspending, not for deficit reduction but for another stimulus plan. The \nBowles-Simpson plan has been hijacked once again in the name of \nstimulating the economy.\n  These proposals also undermine the foundation of Social Security. We \nare reducing the payments into the trust fund. We should leave the \ntrust fund alone and cut spending and use those savings to pay down our \nannual deficits and live within our means. Once again, we are putting \noff difficult decisions and leaving it up to our children and \ngrandchildren to pay for our irresponsibility.\n  Finally, let me, once again, on this floor make the case for \ncertainty in our Tax Code. Congress is tinkering tonight with the Tax \nCode, creating greater uncertainty. In almost every conversation I have \nwith a business owner, they ask for certainty in the Tax Code and \ncertainty in the regulatory environment. But instead, tonight we are \nchanging or attempting to change the Tax Code one more time, for a \nshort period of time, claiming some benefit for doing so. Instead, we \nshould focus on long-term tax policy and a Tax Code that is simpler and \ncertain. Certainty is something that will create jobs.\n  I expect there to be some criticism of the votes I just cast, and I \ncan hear the campaign sound bites. But we have to get beyond the next \nelection and get to the next generation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/01/senate-section/article/S8140-6", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8140-S8142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, tonight, I voted against final passage of \nthe Defense authorization bill, and I rise now to explain why I voted \nagainst it and the considerable concerns I have about the vast \nexpansion of the powers of detention of American citizens that were \ncontained in that bill.\n  These provisions related to the detention of American citizens--\nwithout the standard rights of the fifth and sixth amendment--have been \nan object of intense debate on the floor of the Senate over the last \nseveral days.\n  As a Senator who has now been here 3 years, I can say unequivocally \nthat this debate was extremely valuable. Folks came from both parties \non both sides of this issue and shared their insights, both from their \nlife experiences, from their scholarly knowledge of the law, and \ncertainly from their philosophy, and I commend all who participated in \nthat debate. I listened to a great deal of that debate on both sides. I \nthought this was extraordinarily important; issues surrounding our Bill \nof Rights and the rights of American citizens, protection from the \nabuse of power.\n  Some came to this floor and said that essentially the detention \nprovisions in this bill simply clarify existing law and will enhance \nour national security, and they did so with sincere hearts and sharp \nminds. Others came, equally sincere, equally learned, and argued the \nopposite side; that the detention provisions in this bill constitute a \ndevastating circumvention of the fifth amendment right to due process \nand the sixth amendment right to a speedy trial by impartial jury, as \nwell as a sixth amendment right to confront the witnesses against him \nor her. Maybe it is useful to take a look at what the fifth and sixth \namendments actually say.\n\n  One of the last clauses of the fifth amendment notes that:\n\n       No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property \n     without due process of law.\n\n  I think we all grow up in this country absolutely believing in this \nfundamental value that the government cannot take from you your life, \nyour liberty or your property without the process of law.\n  The sixth amendment notes that, in prosecutions, the accused shall \nenjoy the right to a speedy and public trial--and I emphasize public \ntrial--by an impartial jury of the state. It goes on to note that the \naccused shall be able to confront the witnesses against him and to have \nthe assistance of counsel. So these basic issues of speedy and public \ntrial, an impartial jury, the assistance of counsel, and the ability to \nconfront\n\n[[Page S8141]]\n\nthe witnesses against you, all of these are contained in the sixth \namendment and all relevant to this debate over detention.\n  Most of this conversation is about a section of the bill called \nsection 1031, subtitle D, and it is referenced subtitle D, ``Detainee \nMatters.'' I will just read the title of the section to give a sense of \nwhat this is all about.\n\n       Section 1031. Affirmation of authority of the Armed Forces \n     of the United States to detain covered persons pursuant to \n     the authorization of the use of military force.\n\n  It uses this fancy word ``covered persons,'' and it is what is \nreferred to in everyday speech as enemy combatants. So section 1031 is \nabout the ability of the Armed Forces to detain enemy combatants.\n  The reason this is framed this way is that there is a historical \nexception under constitutional findings of the Supreme Court to \namendment five and amendment six of the Constitution. That exception is \nthat if an individual is fighting on the side of the enemy against the \nUnited States, they do not have the same rights because they are now an \nenemy combatant in time of war, and they can be detained for the \nduration of that conflict. This was adjudicated in World War II over \nindividuals who assisted with sabotage in New York, and it was found \nthat the standard rights of speedy public trial, trial by jury, right \nto counsel do not apply if you are an enemy combatant. Instead, you are \nput into the framework of a war setting to be treated as a member of \nthe opposing army.\n  So this exception has historically been extremely narrow. You are on \nthe battlefield or you are directly working as a member of the enemy \nforce against the United States. It should be extremely narrow, and it \nshould be substantial hurdles for the State to be able to simply claim \nthat you are an enemy combatant and thereby strip you of your fifth and \nsixth amendment rights.\n  But what we have in this bill, in section 1031, is not this narrow \nset of provisions based on the historical understanding of an enemy \ncombatant. Instead, we have a definition that says ``a person who was a \npart or substantially supported al-Qaida, the Taliban, or associated \nforces, engaged in hostilities against the U.S. or coalition partners, \nincluding any person who has committed a belligerent act or has \ndirectly supported such hostilities in aid of enemy forces.''\n  On first reading, it may sound as if that individual is directly \ninvolved in combat, but listen to the words embedded in this. First of \nall, it says ``a part of,'' with no conception of what ``a part of'' \nmeans. Did you write one sympathetic e-mail in your lifetime? Does that \nmake you ``a part of''? We have no standard here.\n  ``Substantially supported'' is understood to mean material support, \nbut no contingency for intent. If you donated money to a charity and \nthat charity used it to support Taliban activities somewhere in the \nworld or some other group that had an association with the Taliban, you \nhave substantially supported, under this conversation.\n  Then it says ``the U.S. or its coalition partners.'' Who are these \ncoalition partners? What is the definition of that? A few weeks ago, \nyou might have noticed in the news that there were a lot of protests \ngoing on in Bahrain. We have a military facility in Bahrain. Is Bahrain \na coalition partner since we utilize a partnership with them to supply \nour forces in the Middle East? Yes, probably so, because there is no \ndefinition of ``coalition partner.'' With individuals who were standing \nup for human rights and got into a battle with police in a public \nsquare, they are engaging in a belligerent act against a coalition \npartner.\n  I hope you can start to see that the standard understanding that has \nbeen constitutionally established over time is completely taken apart \nin this simple paragraph. That should be of grave concern to all \nAmericans who care about our constitutional rights to a fair hearing.\n  What happens when the government suspects you have done something? I \nwant to take you to a case in Oregon. We had a case regarding an \nindividual named Brandon Mayfield. Brandon Mayfield was born in Kansas. \nBrandon Mayfield got his law degree in Topeka, KS. Brandon Mayfield is \nan Army veteran. Brandon Mayfield is married with three children and \nlives with family in a Topeka suburb.\n  Brandon Mayfield is a Muslim convert, and in 2004 FBI agents raided \nhis law office, his home, and his family farm to collect evidence, \nbelieving he was a terror mastermind behind the Madrid bombings. The \nreason why is an FBI agent concluded that a partial fingerprint matched \nBrandon Mayfield's fingerprint. Under this framework, the government \nnow labels him an enemy combatant, and what right does Brandon Mayfield \nhave to contest this? Basically, no rights. The law provides only that \nthere will be a hearing; that the rules of the hearing will be set by \nthe executive branch--by the President, if you will; that the attorney \nwill be assigned by the executive branch; that the rules of evidence \nwill be determined by the executive branch; that this hearing will \noccur sometime--but when? We don't know. There is no right to a speedy \ntrial, there is no commitment that it will be public; in other words, \nno protections from the force of the State whatsoever--completely the \nopposite.\n  This gateway around the fifth and sixth amendments is very loosely \ndefined rather than tightly defined. The entire process by which an \nindividual might try to say ``You are wrong, that was not me, I was not \nthere'' is extraordinarily without powers for the defendant.\n  I find that outrageous because once that hearing occurs, possibly in \nsecret without an attorney that the individual would like to employ, \nwithout rights to evidence, without an ability to confront the \nwitnesses against him or her--without any of these rights, that person \ncan now be locked away forever under this law. There is no right to \nappeal, no right to contest, and therefore this completely works \nagainst the principles we hold dear. Those principles were set up--the \nfifth amendment and sixth amendments were set up to defend us against \nthe overreach of an executive branch. Yet tonight we have stripped away \nthose protections.\n  A lot of the conversation over the last few days has noted that there \nwas a historical gate through which you did not have the fifth and \nsixth amendment but also recognized how narrow that was. What we have \ndone today changes that.\n  I hope this continues to receive substantial attention. I would have \nhoped there would be hearings about this phenomenal change in U.S. law \nadopted tonight because this sort of thing should not be done lightly. \nIt should not be placed at the last second into a Defense authorization \nbill without extensive consideration, extensive testimony by experts on \nall sides of this issue.\n  There is another feature of this bill that I think deserves \nattention, and that is that it creates a presumption for certain types \nof crimes to be tried in military tribunals rather than in civilian \ncourts. Many of my colleagues are much more familiar with this than I \nam, but they have come to the floor and noted that 300 individuals who \nhave been accused of terrorist-related crimes have been tried in \ncivilian courts and found guilty, versus 6 in military courts. They \nhave noted that because the FBI is immersed in the process of getting \nevidence out of individuals, they are masters at it, which helps to \nexplain these 300 convictions versus the 6 in military courts. But the \nlaw tonight creates a presumption that they can be tried in a military \ncourt under an argument that several of my colleagues have made that \nsimply the military is better at it. But there is not one shred of \nevidence brought that the military is better and lots of evidence about \nthe sophisticated, experienced, systematic, and successful efforts of \nthe FBI.\n  Mr. President, I would like to conclude by summarizing that all that \nwe hold dear as Americans in this Constitution about our fair rights as \ncitizens has been trampled on tonight. This has happened twice before \nin this Chamber, and the Supreme Court has thrown it out twice before. \nI hope they will find a case that this will put before the Court again \nbecause it is the responsibility of the Court to keep taking us back to \nthis document, this Constitution, when we waver from the course it lays \nout. There should not be a situation that the government can simply \nassert that the President, no matter what President it is--this\n\n[[Page S8142]]\n\nPresident or any future President, whether it be President Bush, \nwhether it be President Obama, whether it be the next President of the \nUnited States or one of five Presidencies into the future--they should \nnot be able to say: You, Joe American, I am calling you an enemy \ncombatant. I am locking you up. I am assigning your defender--your \ncourt attorney if you will. I am deciding the rules of evidence. I am \ndeciding if it is going to be secret. And after I conclude that there \nis enough evidence because of a partial fingerprint, I am locking you \nup forever, and there is not a damned thing you can do about it.\n  Brandon Mayfield was locked up, and he might have been locked up \nforever if this law had been in place. But the FBI made a mistake. The \nFBI completely botched the fingerprint comparison. It was Spain that \nbrought it to our attention. Spain kept saying: America, you have the \nwrong guy. America, you have the wrong fingerprint. And it was Spain \nthat found the right match, and it was finally our own system that \nsaid: Yes, we made a mistake, and we are setting Brandon Mayfield free. \nBut under what was done tonight, he may never have seen the light of \nday outside of his prison. That is not right. It is not, absolutely not \na contributor to the security of this country to strip away fair rights \nof due process, to summon the evidence, to confront your accusers and \nmake sure that a just decision occurs.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/01/senate-section/article/S8142-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8142-S8143]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNIZING WORLD AIDS DAY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today is World AIDS Day, a time for us to \nreflect on one of the worst plagues the world has experienced. This \nyear also marks the 30th anniversary of the first appearance of the \ndisease in the United States.\n  For three decades this preventable disease has devastated families \nand communities around the world. It has killed over 25 million people. \nBut there has been a strong global response from the research \ncommunity, governments, health workers, and patient advocates to fight \nthis disease and save lives. This battle has yielded notable victories, \nand I am proud of the leadership the United States has demonstrated in \nthe fight against AIDS.\n  The number of newly infected people in the world is steadily \ndeclining. Successful antiretroviral treatments have saved 2.5 million \nlives in developing countries. Advancements have been made in HIV \ntesting and prevention, and biomedical innovations have created \npowerful drugs that can transform AIDS from a death sentence into a \nmore manageable chronic disease. Most recently, promising tests in gene \ntherapies and vaccines are giving researchers renewed hope for a way to \nprevent the spread of HIV. Some scientists are becoming optimistic \nabout the possibility of a cure.\n  Despite this considerable progress, however, an estimated 34 million \npeople in the world are still suffering from AIDS--5 million more than \nin 2002. Only about half of them have access to ongoing medical \ntreatment that is essential to making HIV/AIDS a manageable disease.\n  Today President Obama announced two new initiatives that will enable \nus to build on our successful efforts to combat HIV/AIDS here in \nAmerica. First, the United States will commit $15 million to the Ryan \nWhite program, which supports HIV clinics around the country. In \naddition, we will commit $35 million to State AIDS drug assistance \nprograms.\n  I commend the President and his administration on these critical new \ncommitments.

Mr. President, today is World AIDS Day, a time for us to \nreflect on one of the worst plagues the world has experienced. This \nyear also marks the 30th anniversary of the first appearance of the \ndisease in the United States.\n  For three decades this preventable disease has devastated families \nand communities around the world. It has killed over 25 million people. \nBut there has been a strong global response from the research \ncommunity, governments, health workers, and patient advocates to fight \nthis disease and save lives. This battle has yielded notable victories, \nand I am proud of the leadership the United States has demonstrated in \nthe fight against AIDS.\n  The number of newly infected people in the world is steadily \ndeclining. Successful antiretroviral treatments have saved 2.5 million \nlives in developing countries. Advancements have been made in HIV \ntesting and prevention, and biomedical innovations have created \npowerful drugs that can transform AIDS from a death sentence into a \nmore manageable chronic disease. Most recently, promising tests in gene \ntherapies and vaccines are giving researchers renewed hope for a way to \nprevent the spread of HIV. Some scientists are becoming optimistic \nabout the possibility of a cure.\n  Despite this considerable progress, however, an estimated 34 million \npeople in the world are still suffering from AIDS--5 million more than \nin 2002. Only about half of them have access to ongoing medical \ntreatment that is essential to making HIV/AIDS a manageable disease.\n  Today President Obama announced two new initiatives that will enable \nus to build on our successful efforts to combat HIV/AIDS here in \nAmerica. First, the United States will commit $15 million to the Ryan \nWhite program, which supports HIV clinics around the country. In \naddition, we will commit $35 million to State AIDS drug assistance \nprograms.\n  I commend the President and his administration on these critical new \ncommitments. They represent the next step in America's first-ever \nNational HIV/AIDS Strategy, which the President introduced in 2010. \nThey remind us that AIDS doesn't just affect people in developing \ncountries--1.2 million people are currently living with HIV/AIDS in the \nUnited States, and over 600,000 people here have died from this deadly \nvirus.\n  Thirty years into this epidemic, the burden of the disease in America \ncontinues to be disproportionately borne by gay and bisexual men and \npeople of color.

Mr. President, just as a building needs a foundation, \nevery community needs pillars--people who provide strength, \ninspiration, guidance, and leadership, people to rally around in tough \ntimes. Today, the city of Flint, MI, is missing one of its pillars.\n  Bishop Odis Floyd of New Jerusalem Full Gospel Baptist Church died \nthis week at the age of 71 after a long illness. For more than four \ndecades, he was the spiritual leader of the church he helped his \ngrandfather found. At an imposing 6-foot-6, with a powerful preaching \nand singing voice, he became known around the country for his stirring \nsermons and appeared on a number of gospel music albums. Whether in \nquiet conversation with a church member or in powerful preaching from \nthe pulpit, he was a spiritual giant.\n  His faith taught him to reach out beyond his church, not just with \nspiritual guidance but to lend a hand to those in need. The church's \ncharitable and outreach efforts under his leadership have had an \nenormous impact. They include programs to provide a safe and welcoming \nplace for children; educational efforts; assistance to those who need \nmedical care, food, and clothing; counseling and social work services, \nand much more.\n  Bishop Floyd also was a valued adviser to business and community \nleaders in Flint, in Michigan, and beyond. I was fortunate to visit \nwith him on many occasions, and I valued those visits for his knowledge \nof the community and the quality of his counsel. His love and concern \nfor Flint ran deep, and no matter the challenge, he was always at the \nforefront of those looking for solutions. His commitment to his \ncommunity was profound and provided a shining example to others.\n  Whether it was in preaching the gospel he felt so deeply or in \nreaching out to help others, one word sums up the gift Bishop Floyd \nbrought to those around him: hope. ``People need hope,'' he once told \nan interviewer, ``and that's always what I want to give them.''\n  His loss has deprived the community he loved of a strong and steady \npillar. It now falls to all those who care about Flint to take up where \nhe left off and to continue his work to improve the city and lives of \nits citizens.\n  Many will miss him, but none more than the family he loved: his wife \nand partner, Brenda; son Anthony; daughters, Nikki and Toyia, who \nserved admirably as an intern in my office; and five grandchildren. \nBarbara and I send our condolences to them, to the members of New \nJerusalem Full Gospel Baptist Church, and to the thousands who have, in \nways great and small, been touched by Bishop Floyd's strength, \ngenerosity, and faith.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/01/senate-section/article/S8143-2", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8143]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO ANDY SWAPP\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this past August I had the opportunity to \nvisit Beaver County, Utah, where I met an educator who is working \ntirelessly to prepare our Nation's youth for success in our \ntransformative economy. This rural area of southwest Utah is home to my \nState's major energy initiatives, including the largest wind farm in \nUtah.\n  In 2001 a local shop teacher, Andy Swapp, observed that Milford, UT \ncould capitalize on the powerful winds in the area. Inspiring his \nstudents to learn about renewable energy, the class applied to Utah's \nanemometer loan program to erect a 20 meter meteorological tower. As \nthe students collected and analyzed the wind data, they attracted the \nattention of a wind prospector named Curtis Whittaker. Mr. Whittaker \nwas impressed with the preliminary data but more so with the \ndedication, enthusiasm and accomplishments of eighth grade students. He \nsent a 50 meter tower to Milford High School for Mr. Swapp and students \nto construct in the wind-swept desert. Mr. Swapp used the real world \nproject to teach students about wind turbines and power outputs, \ninspiring students to apply their classroom lessons to developing \nsolutions for affordable, abundant energy. As the commercial wind farm \ndeveloped, Mr. Swapp's classes were continually relied upon for data \ncollection while receiving training in wind farm maintenance \noperations. Over the last decade, Mr. Swapp's students participated in \nall phases of completing Utah's largest commercial wind farm.\n  Mr. Swapp's dedication to fostering student learning and success is \nnot limited to wind power. His classes at Milford High School won a \nRocky Mountain Power ``Bluesky'' grant to install a 10 kilowatt array \nof solar panels on a dual axis tracker on the front lawn of the school, \nand a roof top mounted solar array. The students were allowed to work \nwith the contractor, helping install the $125,000 system. The students \nare now monitoring the energy production to compare the dual axis \ntracker with the standard technology. His classes also participate in \nnational electric race car construction contests.\n  To broaden the education of his students, Mr. Swapp organized the \nMilford Renewable Energy Fair. With support from South West Applied \nTechnology College, the fair has grown to include secondary schools \nfrom all over the State and major vendors in the industry. Milford High \nSchool is also home to the Southwest Renewable Energy Center, which Mr. \nSwapp helped devise to promote the energy-rich area of Beaver County \nand Southwest Utah. It is a collaboration of secondary schools, \ntechnical colleges, 4-year universities, State-wide economic \nadvancement districts, research and development partnerships and \ntechnology commercialization firms. This center connects students to \njobs, internships, and scholarships.\n  Mr. Swapp is an outstanding example of educators bringing learning to \nlife and helping students envision a sustainable future. Mr. Swapp's \nstudents have enrolled in energy and engineering programs at Southern \nUtah University and Southwest Applied Technology College. They have \nsecured high-skill, high paying jobs in their hometown. Their paths \nhave been inspired by the curiosity, creativity and dedication of their \nteacher.\n  Prior to becoming an educator, Mr. Swapp served our country as a \ncareer infantry Sergeant in the U.S. Army. Following his service, he \nreturned to Utah to offer rural students the very best in education, to \nexpand their horizons, and to foster a positive attitude for their \nfuture. Mr. Swapp has been an example to his students by completing an \nAssociate of Science, AS, from Dixie State College, a Bachelor of \nScience from Southern Utah University, and a Master of Science from \nUtah State University.\n  Mr. President, I was really impressed with what I experienced in \nmeeting Andy. I wanted to highlight the important, innovative work of a \nsuccessful educator engaged in leading our Nation into the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/01/senate-section/article/S8143-3", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8143-S8144]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             WORLD AIDS DAY\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, musicians Bono and Alicia Keys \nare in Washington, DC, today to meet with Presidents Obama, Clinton, \nand Bush about what is next in the global battle against AIDS. They \nnote that we are reaching a tipping point on combating HIV/AIDS \nworldwide, which is why they and many others, including myself, believe \ncontinued U.S. leadership is critical.\n  It is fitting that this gathering is taking place today--World AIDS \nDay. We all should remember that HIV/AIDS has claimed the lives of more \nthan 550,000 Americans so far, while 1.1 million others are living with \nthe disease.\n  Florida has been hit particularly hard: about 100,000 people are \nliving with HIV/AIDS. Florida has the longest waiting list of low-\nincome residents waiting for assistance with the high cost of \nlifesaving medications. More than 3,000 Floridians are on that list; \nand, alarmingly, the number could grow as the State considers cutting \nmore than 1,600 who already are in the government-backed program.\n  Federal, State, and local governments must understandably tighten \ntheir belts. But focusing on such short-term savings is horribly \nshortsighted. For several reasons, these cuts will only lead to higher \ncosts to taxpayers in the long run--cases will become more difficult to \nmanage, transmission rates are likely to increase, and patients will \nmore frequently need expensive care in emergency rooms and hospitals.\n  We must also remain committed to the goals of the President's \nEmergency Plan for AIDS Relief globally. Among the goals are to prevent \nmore than 12 million new HIV infections and provide\n\n[[Page S8144]]\n\ncare for more than 12 million people, including 5 million orphans and \nchildren around the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/01/senate-section/article/S8144-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8144]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING DR. SUSAN M. DANIELS\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to a much respected \nand beloved leader in America's disability community, the late Dr. \nSusan Daniels.\n  Dr. Daniels acquired her disability at a very young age. Though she \nspent much of her early years in rehabilitation institutes and \nhospitals, her parents advocated for her full inclusion in school and \nin the life of her local community. As a consequence, Susan attended \nregular elementary and secondary schools. She went on to graduate summa \ncum laude from Marquette University, and to earn her master's degree at \nMississippi State University and her Ph.D. from the University of North \nCarolina. And I would note that she achieved these things before the \ndays of accessible campuses.\n  While still in her twenties, Dr. Daniels served as chair of the \nDepartment of Rehabilitation Counseling at Louisiana State University \nMedical Center. There, she developed an innovative program to train \nindividuals to work directly in community-based settings with people \nwith developmental disabilities. This program became a core element in \nLouisiana's efforts to deinstitutionalize people with disabilities.\n  Throughout her adult life, Dr. Daniels was a passionate advocate for \npeople with disabilities. She served as Associate Commissioner of the \nRehabilitation Services Administration in the U.S. Department of \nEducation, and as Associate Commissioner of the Administration on \nDevelopmental Disabilities, ADD, in the U.S. Department of Health and \nHuman Services. While at ADD, she developed the Home of Your Own \nProgram to assist people with developmental disabilities in their quest \nto become homeowners in their communities. It is one of Dr. Daniels' \nliving legacies that this Home of Your Own Program is now operating in \n27 States.\n  Perhaps Dr. Daniels' greatest accomplishment was her leadership in \npassing the Ticket to Work and Work Incentive Improvement Act of 1999. \nAppointed by President Clinton to serve as Deputy Commissioner for \nDisability and Income Security Programs at the Social Security \nAdministration, she worked tirelessly to lay the groundwork for this \nlegislation. The Ticket to Work Act created employment incentives and \nhealthcare provisions for workers with disabilities, and removed many \nof the systemic barriers that often required citizens with disabilities \nto make a stark choice between working or retaining their health \ncoverage. Two of the most important provisions of this legislation are \nthe authorization for a State Medicaid buy-in program to allow \nindividuals to maintain health coverage after returning to work, and a \ncontinuation of Medicare coverage for individuals who are working.\n  Dr. Daniels was also very active in the fight for disability rights \ninternationally. She addressed many conferences and research forums in \nAfrica, Europe, and Asia. And she advised governments on the best ways \nto set up social insurance programs for individuals with disabilities. \nShe served as president of the U.S. International Council on \nRehabilitation, and was Rehabilitation International's deputy vice \npresident. In 1998, she played a lead role in convening the \nInternational Women with Disabilities Leadership Forum.\n  Dr. Daniels was the recipient of many awards for her work, including \nthe prestigious Henry B. Betts Award, which honors individuals who have \nmade transformative differences in the lives of people with \ndisabilities.\n  Dr. Daniels played leadership roles in a wide range of national and \ninternational organizations, but she also worked for change at the \nindividual level, mentoring and sponsoring countless young men and \nwomen with disabilities both in the U.S. and abroad.\n  Susan's husband, John Watson, and many other family members, friends, \nand colleagues will gather for a memorial service in her honor at the \nNational Press Club here in Washington on December 4. I will be with \nthem in spirit as they celebrate a determined advocate and a truly \nbright light, a woman who was and is an inspiration to people with \ndisabilities around the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/01/senate-section/article/S8144-2", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8144]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO HALEY BARTON\n\n Mr. BARRASSO.

Thanks to the Pease Greeters, \nservice men and women returning from, and traveling to, Iraq, \nAfghanistan, and other deployments have arrived at Pease and found \nsmiling faces and a warm welcome--along with good food and a phone to \ncall home.\n  As a cofounder of the Pease Greeters, Mr. Nichols helped launch a \nvery special Seacoast tradition that sets the standard for how we ought \nto recognize our service members. I join citizens across New Hampshire \nand Maine in expressing my gratitude for Mr. Nichols' service to our \ncountry, his commitment to supporting America's troops, and his \ncontributions to the life of the Seacoast Region.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/01/senate-section/article/S8145-4", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8145]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 MARKING THE RETIREMENT OF BOB CONNERS\n\n Mr. BROWN. Mr. President. I rise today to honor Bob Conners, \nthe retiring long-time voice on radio for thousands of Ohioans in \nCentral Ohio, who broadcasted his final show on WTVN on November 30, \n2011.\n  Bob and I have not always agreed on the issues, but he has always \nbeen the consummate professional. He is fair and dignified in \ndiscussions ever since he took to the airwaves back in 1964. And he is \nalways armed with a quick wit. I spoke with Bob earlier this week. He \ntold me that during his retirement he plans to learn a foreign \nlanguage. When I asked which one, he said he wanted to master English \nfirst. That endearing sense of humor earned him the trust of listeners \nacross Central Ohio. And as those who have listened to him over the \nyears know, he has not only mastered English, he has mastered morning \nradio.\n  Growing up in St Marys, PA, Bob first wanted to become a radio actor, \ninspired by the Lone Ranger and encouraged by his father. He got his \nstart on the airwaves when he was in high school, earning $45 per month \nas a radio deejay. After graduating from high school, Bob worked in \nErie, Buffalo, San Diego, and Pittsburgh. He served our nation and \nvolunteered for the Army in 1956.\n  By 1964, he joined WTVN in Central Ohio. Bob cemented his loyal \nfollowing in the afternoons transitioning from music to a talk radio \nformat. Some memorable stories of his time on air relate to his beloved \nOhio State Buckeyes football team, led at the time by the famed Woody \nHayes.\n  ``The Morning Monarch,'' as he would be known while hosting the Bob \nConners Show beginning in 1978, he brought in more listeners and would \neventually range 33 years, six U.S. presidents, and five Ohio State \nfootball coaches. And as much as he enriched the lives of his \nlisteners, he also served his community away from the microphone, \nvolunteering with the Boys and Girls Clubs of Columbus and the Charity \nNewsies.\n  Bob Conners had the ear of his listeners because they could trust \nhim, whether they agreed or disagreed with him. It is that admirable \ntrait we will miss with his retirement. But it is that endearing \nquality that's earned him this retirement and no more 3 a.m. wake-up \ncalls.\n  Bob, I wish you and Linda all the best in your retirement. Thank you \nfor all that you have done for your listeners and for our great \nState.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/01/senate-section/article/S8145-5", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8145]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO ED STRICKFADEN\n\n Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and pay \ntribute to an outstanding public servant, Ed Strickfaden. Today, the \nIdaho State Police will be naming a building after Ed, who served as \nthe director of the Idaho State Police and was a 35-year veteran of the \ndepartment. He is very deserving of this honor, and I congratulate him \non this special day.\n  Ed Strickfaden graduated from Council High School, located in a small \nrural town in southwestern Idaho. He honorably served in the U.S. Air \nForce before beginning his career with the Idaho State Police. In 1967, \nhe was hired as a port of entry officer, and from there he worked his \nway up the ranks, serving in almost every region of the State.\n  In 1980, he was promoted from a patrolman in the Lewiston area to a \nsergeant in Twin Falls. By 1984, he was district commander in Idaho \nFalls, then moving to the district commander position in Coeur d'Alene \nthe following year.\n  He served in the headquarters office beginning in 1991, first as a \nmajor in charge of field operations, then as a deputy superintendent of \nthe Idaho State Police. He was appointed ISP superintendent by Gov. \nPhil Batt and served 4 years in that position prior to his appointment \nas director of the Department of Law Enforcement by Gov. Dirk \nKempthorne in January 1999.\n  Colonel Strickfaden undertook a major reorganization of the Idaho \nState Police, streamlining its functions and enhancing training \nthroughout the department. He even initiated the name change to Idaho \nState Police, effective July 1, 2000.\n  With his years of service, rising through the ranks and serving in \nall parts of Idaho, Colonel Strickfaden understood more than most what \nwas needed and how to do it. He was a man of uncompromising integrity \nand had the utmost respect of those he led and the respect of the \nstate's elected officials.\n  Today, the Idaho State Police and the people of Idaho honor this \nhumble man by putting his name on the building at ISP headquarters. It \nis a fitting tribute to a great leader and a wonderful human being. We \nare all very grateful for the many years of exemplary service Colonel \nEd Strickfaden has provided to our great State.\n  I would be remiss if I did not also mention Colonel Strickfaden's \nwonderful family and especially his wife Barbara for her strong support \nthroughout Ed's career. Together, they have served the people of Idaho \nwith great distinction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/01/senate-section/article/S8145-6", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8145-S8146]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to\n\n[[Page S8146]]\n\nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/01/senate-section/article/S8146-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8146]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/01/senate-section/article/S8146-2", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8146]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:36 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 3094.

 By Mrs. HAGAN (for herself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Kirk, \n        and Mr. Akaka):\n  S. 1935. A bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint \ncoins in recognition and celebration of the 75th anniversary of the \nestablishment of the March of Dimes Foundation; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce the March of \nDimes Commemorative Coin Act.\n  For almost 75 years, the March of Dimes has fought to combat and \nprevent diseases that strike our youngest children, while also \nsupporting mothers-to-be and families with infants in intensive care. \nThe March of Dimes was founded in 1938 by President Franklin Roosevelt \nas the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, at a time when \npolio was on the rise. The Foundation established a polio patient aid \nprogram and funded research for vaccines developed by Jonas Salk, MD, \nand Albert Sabin, MD. These vaccines effectively ended epidemic polio \nin the United States.\n  Today one in 33 babies born in the United States is affected by a \nbirth defect, and tragically, more than 5,500 infants die every year \nbecause of a birth defect. Moreover, an additional 500,000 children are \ndiagnosed with developmental disabilities each year.\n  Almost 13 percent of babies born in America are born prematurely--an \nincrease of 36 percent since the early 1980s. In 2003, the March of \nDimes took on the cause of reducing the number of infants who are born \nprematurely. And thanks to the great work of the March of Dimes and \nothers, after three decades of increase, the pre-term birth rate has \nnow dropped for the third year in a row.\n  You would be hard pressed to find someone today who doesn't have a \nfriend, a family member, a neighbor or a coworker who's had a baby born \nprematurely or born with some kind of birth defect. A month ago, I had \nthe pleasure of meeting the 2011 March of Dimes National Ambassador: \nLauren Fleming, and her parents, Nikki and Densel from Marvin, NC. \nLauren was born three and a half months early and weighed just 2 \npounds, 1 ounce. She spent the first 5 months of her life in the \nintensive care unit, being treated for respiratory distress and \nundergoing multiple surgeries. In part, because of the research and \nsupport provided by the March of Dimes, Lauren is now an adorable, \nvivacious 7-year old, and a hero to young children and their families \nthroughout the country.\n  Although some progress has been made over the past several decades on \nreducing and preventing birth defects and prematurity, we need \norganizations such as the March of Dimes to continue to push for more \nresearch, more innovation and more prevention efforts.\n  The March of Dimes makes a difference. By investing millions of \ndollars to study premature births, birth defects, and infant mortality, \nincluding $5.6 million in North Carolina over the past 5 years, the \nMarch of Dimes is helping to ensure that we can reduce these \noccurrences.\n  But we can do more. That is why today I am introducing the March of \nDimes Commemorative Coin Act of 2011. This bill would mint coins in \nrecognition and celebration of the March of Dimes' 75 anniversary in \n2014. Proceeds from the commemorative coin will be used to support the \nMarch of Dimes' Prematurity Campaign, an intensive multi-year campaign \nto raise awareness among health professionals and the general public \nand find the causes of prematurity.\n  Not only will the Commemorative Coin raise awareness of the March of \nDimes' efforts, but it will also help raise more funding for their \nefforts. I cannot think of a more appropriate way to honor the March of \nDimes than to mint actual ``dimes'' celebrating their work.\n  I want to thank my Republican colleague, Senator Susan Collins, as \nwell as Senators Schumer, Kirk, and Akaka for joining me in \ncosponsoring this measure.\n  I urge my other colleagues to join us in supporting this important \nbill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 1938. A bill to amend chapter 6 of title 5, United States Code \n(commonly\n\n[[Page S8152]]\n\nknown as the Regulatory Flexibility Act), to ensure complete analysis \nof potential impacts on small entities of rules, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Regulatory \nFlexibility Improvements Act of 2011. Originally introduced in the \nHouse by Representative Lamar Smith of Texas, this targeted regulatory \nreform bill would amend the Regulatory Flexibility Act, RFA, the \nseminal legislation enacted in 1980 that requires Federal agencies to \nconsider the cost and impact of proposed regulations on small \nbusinesses if such regulation would significantly affect a substantial \nnumber of small entities.\n  As a steadfast proponent for regulatory reform, I have been deeply \ntroubled by this chamber's unwillingness to act on an issue so critical \nto our Nation's job creators. In stark contrast, our House counterparts \nare poised to pass this legislation, offering relief to our Nation's \nsmall business job creators. I encourage my colleagues in the Senate to \nseize this opportunity and support this legislation.\n  If anyone believes this is a solution in need of a problem, there is \nample evidence to the contrary. In fact, an October 24 Gallup poll of \nAmerican small business owners revealed that the number one problem \nthey face is ``complying with government regulations.'' What I find \nincreasingly frustrating is that although small businesses repeatedly \nexpress their concerns, the Senate continues to sit idly by, failing to \ntake serious action!\n  At a time when unemployment stands at an unacceptable nine percent, \nand small businesses are struggling to create jobs, the imperative to \nfocus our attention on regulatory reform couldn't be clearer. \nUnfortunately, small businesses, which historically create two-thirds \nof all new jobs, face an unequal federal regulatory burden. A September \n2010, study commissioned by the Small Business Administration, SBA, \nOffice of Advocacy found that small firms with fewer than 20 employees \nbear a disproportionate burden in complying with federal regulations. \nThey pay an annual regulatory cost of $10,585 per employee, which is 36 \npercent higher than the regulatory cost facing larger firms.\n  This must change, and the Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act of \n2011 aims to do just that. This bill reforms the flawed rulemaking \nprocess to ensure that federal agencies consider small business impact \nbefore a rule is promulgated, not after. For example, one provision of \nthis legislation would expand the small business review panel process \nto apply to all agencies. These panels currently only apply to the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, EPA, Occupational Safety and Health \nAdministration, OSHA, and, thanks to an amendment that I included in \nthe Wall Street Reform legislation, the new Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau, CFPB. These panels have worked well at EPA and OSHA \nsince 1996. Why not apply this stipulation to every Federal agency, so \nsmall businesses are considered at the forefront of the rulemaking \nprocess?\n  Another provision would require agencies to consider foreseeable \n``indirect'' economic effects when determining whether a rule will have \na significant impact on a substantial number of small businesses. \nCurrently, only ``direct'' economic impacts are considered in the \nanalysis. The RFA has already saved billions for small businesses by \nforcing government regulators to address the direct impact of proposed \nrules on small firms. If billions of dollars can be saved by filtering \nout overly cumbersome or duplicative direct regulatory mandates upon \nsmall business while improving workplace safety and environmental \nconditions, even more can be saved by filtering out unnecessary or \nburdensome costs to those small businesses indirectly impacted by \nregulation.\n  This type of commonsense reform is why the Regulatory Flexibility \nImprovements Act enjoys the support of more than 150 small business \nadvocacy organizations, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the \nNational Federation of Independent Business, NFIB.\n  President Obama himself has identified government regulations as \nharmful to job creation. In a January 18 Wall Street Journal op-ed, he \nwrote that, ``[s]ometimes, those rules have gotten out of balance, \nplacing unreasonable burdens on business--burdens that have stifled \ninnovation and have had a chilling effect on growth and jobs.'' More \nrecently, my friend, former Democratic Senator Blanche Lincoln, \npartnered with NFIB President Dan Danner to write an open letter to \nPresident Obama calling for sensible regulatory reform.\n  Winston Churchill once said, ``If you have 10,000 regulations, you \ndestroy all respect for the law!'' And certainly, looking at the \nexpanding universe of rules waiting on the horizon, and the vast \nlabyrinth of existing ones, we should ponder how business can dedicate \nany time and resources to their principal mission of creating products, \noffering services, innovating and growing.\n  Consider that, since President Obama took office, his administration \nhas approved 613 Federal rules, 129 of which have an economic impact \ntopping $100 million. In fact, the President's health reform \nlegislation alone mandates 41 separate rulemakings, at least 100 \nadditional regulatory guidance documents, and 129 reports, according to \nthe U.S. Chamber of Commerce. How can our Nation's small businesses \ncompete in a global economy when Washington, DC agencies continue to \nsaddle them with overwhelming regulatory burdens year after year? How \ncan entrepreneurs grow their companies when the regulatory environment \ndissuades them from investing in new equipment or hiring additional \nworkers?\n  While members of both parties are now calling for small business \nregulatory reform, the United States Senate remains regrettably \ndisengaged. I urge my colleagues to change course and put the interest \nof small business, our Nation's economic engines, ahead of petty \npolitics at a time when more than 14 million Americans are unemployed \nand have been so for the longest time since World War II.\n  The days of working together to craft innovative solutions for the \ngood of the American people do not have to be over. It is well beyond \ntime for this body to pass small business regulatory reform and I urge \nmy colleagues to support this critical legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na letter of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1938\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Such determination \n     shall be made without regard to whether the agency performed \n     an analysis under section 604. The purpose of the review \n     shall be to determine whether such rules should be continued \n     without change, or should be amended or rescinded, consistent \n     with the stated objectives of applicable statutes, to \n     minimize any adverse significant economic impacts or maximize \n     any beneficial significant economic impacts on a substantial \n     number of small entities.

Research from a 2010 study released by the \n     Small Business Administration (SBA) Office of Advocacy \n     illustrates that the small business community is \n     disproportionately affected by burdensome federal \n     regulations. This legislation addresses that small business \n     challenge directly.\n       H.R. 527 gives the SBA Office of Advocacy additional \n     authorities and requires the office to establish standards \n     for conducting a ``regulatory flexibility analysis'' during \n     the rulemaking process. It improves transparency and ensures \n     that agencies thoughtfully consider the impact of regulations \n     on small businesses.\n       The legislation would also improve the accuracy of benefit-\n     cost analysis by requiring agencies to consider the indirect \n     impact of regulations on small business.\n       Finally, the legislation's provisions on periodic review of \n     rules are in line with President Obama's Executive Order \n     13563, which requires agencies to conduct a retrospective \n     analysis of existing rules to identify and modify rules in \n     need of reform.\n       The legislation strengthens the regulatory process and \n     builds upon the intent of Congress when the Regulatory \n     Flexibility Act was originally enacted in 1980.\n\n[[Page S8156]]\n\n       Thank you for your support of small business and we urge \n     you to cosponsor the Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act \n     of 2011, H.R. 527.\n           Sincerely,\n       Alabama Restaurant Association;

Con Res. 33\n\n       Whereas in 2009, 12 percent of all people in the United \n     States reported having some disability;\n       Whereas in 2008, 16.9 percent of veterans, amounting to \n     more than 13,000,000 people, reported having a service-\n     related disability to the Department of Veterans Affairs;\n       Whereas according to the Current Population Survey of the \n     Bureau of the Census, the number of people in the United \n     States that report having a disability is at a 20-year high;\n       Whereas the Act entitled ``An Act to insure that certain \n     buildings financed with Federal funds are so designed and \n     constructed as to be accessible to the physically \n     handicapped'', approved August 12, 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4151 et \n     seq.), referred to in this preamble as the ``Architectural \n     Barriers Act of 1968'', was enacted to ensure that certain \n     federally funded facilities are designed and constructed to \n     be accessible to people with disabilities and requires that \n     physically handicapped persons have ready access to, and use \n     of, post offices and other Federal facilities;\n       Whereas automatic doors, though not mandated by either the \n     Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 or the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.), provide a \n     greater degree of self-sufficiency and dignity for people \n     with disabilities, and the elderly, who may have limited \n     strength to open a manual door;\n       Whereas a report commissioned by the Architectural and \n     Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (referred to in this \n     preamble as the ``Access Board''), an independent Federal \n     agency created to ensure access to federally funded \n     facilities for people with disabilities, recommends that all \n     new buildings used by the public should have at least 1 \n     automated door at an accessible entrance, except for small \n     buildings where adding such a door may be a financial \n     hardship for the building owners;\n       Whereas States and municipalities have begun to recognize \n     the importance of automatic doors in improving accessibility;\n\n[[Page S8157]]\n\n       Whereas the laws of the State of Connecticut require \n     automatic doors in certain shopping malls and retail \n     businesses, the laws of the State of Delaware require an \n     automatic door or calling device for newly constructed places \n     of accommodation, and the laws of the District of Columbia \n     have a similar requirement;\n       Whereas the Facilities Standards for the Public Buildings \n     Service published by the General Services Administration \n     requires automation of at least 1 exterior door for all newly \n     constructed or renovated facilities managed by the General \n     Services Administration, including post offices;\n       Whereas from 2006 to 2011, 71 percent of the complaints \n     received by the Access Board regarding the Architectural \n     Barriers Act of 1968 concerned a post office or other \n     facility of the United States Postal Service;\n       Whereas the United States Postal Service employs \n     approximately 596,000 people, making it the second-largest \n     civilian employer in the United States;\n       Whereas approximately 7,000,000 people per day visit 1 of \n     the more than 36,400 post offices in the United States; and\n       Whereas the United States was founded on principles of \n     equality and freedom, and these principles require that all \n     people, even those people with disabilities, are able to \n     engage as equal members of society: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the immense hardships that people with \n     disabilities in the United States must overcome every day;\n       (2) reaffirms its support of the Act entitled ``An Act to \n     insure that certain buildings financed with Federal funds are \n     so designed and constructed as to be accessible to the \n     physically handicapped'', approved August 12, 1968 (42 U.S.C. \n     4151 et seq.), commonly known as the ``Architectural Barriers \n     Act of 1968'' and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 \n     (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.), and encourages full compliance \n     with such Acts;\n       (3) recommends that the United States Postal Service and \n     Federal agencies install power-assisted doors at post offices \n     and other federally funded facilities, as applicable, to \n     ensure equal access for all people of the United States;

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 2192, which was received \nfrom the House and is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2192) to exempt for an additional 4-year \n     period, from the application of the means-test presumption of \n     abuse under chapter 7, qualifying members of reserve \n     components of the Armed Forces and members of the National \n     Guard who, after September 11, 2001, are called to active \n     duty or to perform a homeland defense activity for not less \n     than 90 days.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in 2008, I was proud to join Senator Durbin \nin support of the National Guard and Reservists Debt Relief Act, which \nPresident Bush signed into law. This last week I have been able to \narrange on behalf of the Senate Judiciary Committee for expedited \naction on the bill's extension, and that the Senate is passing \nunanimously. I commend Chairman Lamar Smith and the House Judiciary \nCommittee for moving this legislation, and Representative Cohen, the \nbill's author, for his leadership and attention to the issue. Without \nthis measure, the authority we provided to help our Guard and Reserve \nfamilies would expire. By taking this action we preserve the assistance \nthis authority provides.\n  It is a privilege to work on behalf of the men and women who serve in \nthe Vermont National Guard. They have and continue to make all \nVermonters proud. I cannot say enough about the men and women who serve \nin the National Guard and Reserve. They and their families deserve the \nfull support of Congress for the sacrifices they make. Especially now, \nwhere multiple conflicts have demanded even more of them, when so many \nhave been called into active service, we need to keep them foremost in \nour thoughts.\n  Extending the protections of the National Guard and Reservists Debt \nRelief Act for another 4 years is the right thing to do. The bill the \nSenate passes today will exempt qualifying members of the Guard and \nReserve from the harsh means test imposed in our bankruptcy laws a few \nyears ago. As a result of Congress's enactment of a 2005 bankruptcy \nmeasure, passed at the behest of large banks and credit card companies, \nAmericans who must make the difficult decision to seek the protection \nof the bankruptcy court now face onerous requirements to demonstrate \nthat they are experiencing sufficient hardship to enter chapter 7 \nbankruptcy. Under the National Guard and Reservists Debt Relief \nExtension Act, qualifying members of the Guard and Reserve will be \nprotected against the burden of this requirement for another 4 years.\n  In my view, no American, particularly in times of such economic \nhardship, should have this burdensome requirement of the so-called \nmeans test imposed upon them. The bankruptcy system was established to \nprotect Americans and give them a fresh start. The 2005 enactment \nturned the law on its head. I opposed this provision in the Senate in \n2005, and continue to have serious misgivings about a policy that \npresumes that Americans facing extreme financial hardships are abusing \nthe bankruptcy process.\n  Passage of the National Guard and Reservists Debt Relief Extension \nAct is a step forward toward correcting our current policy.\n  I also note that passage of this legislation is another example of \nthe good cooperation that exists between the Senate and House Judiciary \nCommittees operating across the aisle and across the Capitol. Last \nnight, the Senate passed H.R. 394, the Federal Courts Jurisdiction and \nVenue Clarification Act, a bill sponsored by Chairman Smith to bring \nclarity to the operation of Federal jurisdictional and venue statutes, \nthereby helping to reduce wasteful litigation over these issues. This \nbipartisan bill was cosponsored in the House by Representatives by \nHoward Coble, ranking member John Conyers, Jr., and Hank Johnson of \nGeorgia. Companion legislation was introduced in the Senate by Senator \nKlobuchar, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on \nAdministrative Oversight and the Courts, and was cosponsored by Senator \nSessions, the ranking member on the subcommittee.\n  These two bills are just the most recent examples of legislation I \nhave worked with Chairman Smith to enact. Of course, we worked together \nto enact the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act to revitalize our patent \nlaws. We worked together on authorizing the extension of the term of \nFBI Director Mueller, which required a statutory exception, and on \nreauthorizing the USA PATRIOT Act.\n  Other examples include H.R. 368, Representative Hank Johnson's bill \nto clarify removal provisions for matters filed in State courts against \nFederal agencies and officers; H.R. 398, Representative Lofgren's bill \nto toll certain time periods for those in active service to our \ncountry; S.1637, Senator Klobuchar's bill to clarify how time is \ncalculated under the Federal Rules; and H.R. 2944, Chairman Smith's \nbill to extend the authority of the U.S. Parole Commission.\n  In addition to these nine measures, we are continuing to work on a \nnumber of additional bills, including: S. 1639, Senator Tester's bill \nto amend the American Legion charter; and S. 1541, Senator Bennet's \nbill to revise the Blue Star Mothers' charter.\n  I look forward to our continued collaborative relationship. Our \nsuccessful efforts across the aisle and across the Capitol show that \nthe partisan gridlock\n\n[[Page S8159]]\n\nthat has become all too prevalent these days does not govern \neverywhere.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate, and any statements related \nto the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 2192) was ordered to a third reading, was read the \nthird time, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/01/senate-section/article/S8159-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8159]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY.
