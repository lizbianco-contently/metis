Mr. President, tens of thousands of bridges--70,000, to be \nexact--and millions of miles of roads across the country are in a state \nof disrepair. But rather than putting Americans to work fixing these \nroads and bridges--and, of course, repairing the crumbling train \ntracks, highways, and sidewalks across this country--House Republicans \nare pandering to the tea party. They cannot do a bill. They cannot do a \nbill. They have tried. They cannot do a bill. They are now not fighting \nus, they are fighting among themselves. As if putting the tea party \nahead of efforts to repair our Nation's crumbling infrastructure was \nnot bad enough, House Republicans are risking almost 3 million jobs in \nthe process.\n  I was very disappointed last week to hear that the House Republican \nleaders hope to pursue a 3-month extension of the highway bill. That \nis, at this stage, without any suggestion that they would go to \nconference with us. It would seem to me that is the most practical \nthing to do--have a short-term extension and during the process work to \nsee what we can come up with, working together. I know this is foreign \nlanguage to what has gone on in the House in the last year and a half, \nbut that would be a good idea--to try that, to work together to come up \nwith a bill, a 2-year bill, a 3-year bill. Working together, we could \ndo that on a bipartisan basis, as we did here. Their short-term bandaid \nbill is no solution. Communities and contractors need certainty--\nespecially going into the summer construction season. We want to make \nsure projects do not grind to a halt in 3 months because the House once \nagain refuses to act.\n\n[[Page S2010]]\n\n  The American people certainly know at this stage whom to blame \nbecause of the problems over there. It is a crisis. It is a chaotic \nplace we find over there. They are looking to cost us 3 million jobs. \nOne week remains until these projects around the country lock their \ngates and lay off their workers. It is time for House Republican \nleaders to do what is responsible: take up the Senate-passed \nTransportation bill and pass it.

Mr. President, while House Republicans are squandering \nprecious time and risking American jobs, the Senate will now move \nforward with a bill to repeal billions in subsidies to big oil \ncompanies.\n  Last year, Big Oil raked in $137 billion in profits--more than ever \nbefore--but still received billions in taxpayer-funded giveaways. It \ndoes not make sense. Even with domestic oil production at its highest \nlevel in almost a decade, prices at the pump are rising. Oil companies \nare making money hand over fist.\n  When the price of a gallon of gas goes up by a single penny, \nquarterly profits for the five major oil companies go up $200 million. \nI heard on the news this morning that the price of gas in the last \ncouple weeks has gone up 12 cents. Well, that is more than $2 billion \nfor the oil companies.\n  This country continues to give taxpayer dollars to some of the most \nprofitable corporations in the world--not some of the most profitable, \nthe most profitable. They are doing better than Google and Microsoft \nand all of them. They are the No. 1 profitable corporations in the \nworld. It is time to end this careless corporate welfare.\n  The only real way to bring down prices at the pump is to reduce U.S. \ndependence on foreign oil. That will take additional responsible \ndomestic oil production and smart investments in clean energy \ntechnology.\n  The Senate will vote this evening to advance the Repeal Big Oil Tax \nSubsidies Act. This legislation ends more than $2 billion a year in tax \nbreaks for Big Oil, and it invests the savings in the clean energy \nindustry, where it will grow our economy and create jobs.\n  Repealing wasteful subsidies will not cause oil prices to go up. \nRepealing wasteful subsidies, I repeat, will not cause oil and gas \nprices to rise. But reducing America's dependence on foreign oil will \ncause prices to fall for sure. But if Republicans continue to follow in \nlockstep to the drums of oil companies making record profits, one thing \nwill be obvious: Republicans care less about bringing down gas prices \nthan about helping oil companies that do not need help. Congress should \npass this legislation and do it quickly before another taxpayer dollar \nis spent on wasteful handouts to Big Oil.\n  How do the American people feel about this? Of course, by an \noverwhelming margin, they agree with us.\n  The Senate must also quickly move to reform our postal system, and in \nthe coming weeks, we also must reauthorize the Violence Against Women \nAct, pass additional job-creation measures, and take up the crucial \ncybersecurity bill.\n  The Pentagon says passing cybersecurity legislation is the single \nmost important action Congress can take to improve national security. \nThat is why I will bring a bill to the floor very soon. Bipartisan \nefforts to craft comprehensive cybersecurity legislation have been \nongoing for years. It is now time to act. It is time for Republican \ncolleagues who have been involved in this effort from the start to sit \ndown and help us move this matter forward. We are going to move this \nbill onto the floor. We have had hard work done by Senator Lieberman \nand Senator Collins. It is a bipartisan bill. I would hope both parties \nwould agree this legislation is a priority. I hope so.\n  As always, Mr. President, I hope Democrats and Republicans will be \nable to work together to forge a path forward on these most important \nissues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/26/senate-section/article/S2010-2", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2010]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise today to once again speak about a \ntopic I have spoken to many times over the last 2 years; that is, the \nhealth care law.\n  Today I would like to focus on a number of aspects of the health care \nlaw, but to start I would point out that this law actually enacted the \nlargest expansion of Medicaid since its inception in 1965. The law \ndramatically increases government spending, it ties the hands of \nStates, it is going to bankrupt State budgets, and it traps nearly 26 \nmillion more Americans in a broken system.\n  Last week's Medicaid Actuary report indicates that 25.9 million more \nAmericans will be dumped on Medicaid under the new law. The week \nbefore, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office pointed out that \nFederal spending on Medicaid will increase by $168 billion. That is \njust compared to last year's projection. That means this expansion \nalone is projected to cost the Federal taxpayers $795 billion through \n2021.\n  That is at a time when not only our Federal budget is struggling, but \nin addition to that our State budgets are in trouble. Added up, the \nFederal Government will spend $4.6 trillion on Medicaid over the next \n10 years, a staggering number--$4.6 trillion.\n  Medicaid spending is projected to increase 35 percent once the law is \nfully implemented. So with our national debt now approaching $16 \ntrillion and compounding exponentially, as we borrow 42 cents of every \n$1 we spend every day, instead of reining in costs, the health care law \nis doubling down with spending.\n  But the Medicaid expansion did not stop with wrecking Federal \nbudgets. It hammers State budgets as well. This program already \nconsumes 24 percent of State budgets. The law's Medicaid expansion will \nforce $118 billion in additional unfunded mandates on our States \nthrough 2023. The National Governors Association has weighed in on this \nissue. They said: ``Spending on Medicaid is expected to consume an \nincreasing share of State budgets and grow much more rapidly than State \nrevenue growth, resulting in slow or no growth in education, \ntransportation, or public safety.''\n  The Nebraska impact tells the story. The Governor commissioned a \nstudy in Nebraska to see what the impact would be on the health care \nlaw on the State budget. Nebraska will spend an additional $526 million \nto $766 million over the next 10 years on its Medicaid Program. The \nexpansion could add up to 145,000 Nebraskans to the Medicaid Program \nover the next decade.\n  Currently, one in nine Nebraskans is enrolled in Medicaid. The new \nprovisions of the law will expand eligibility to one in five \nNebraskans, 20 percent. Governor Heineman addressed this issue. He \nsaid: This unfunded and unparalleled expansion of Medicaid is an unfair \nand unsustainable mandate on Nebraska and other States. The Federal \nhealth care law is an extraordinarily large and excessive unfunded\n\n[[Page S2011]]\n\nmandate for States. It is potentially devastating to our State budget.\n  Today, with me on the floor, I am joined by two former Governors. All \nthree of us have had to deal with balancing budgets, and we had no \nchoice but to make sure that at the end of our legislative sessions, \nour budgets were, in fact, balanced.\n  Senator Alexander was vocal in speaking out against this policy \nduring the health care debate. He has a rather unique perspective \nbecause not only is he a former Governor, he is a former U.S. Secretary \nof Education. I would like the Senator to take a few minutes and \nexplain how this law is going to effect the health care system, our \neducational system, our States, and for that matter our country.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator. He has a unique perspective \nhimself as a former Cabinet member, Governor, and now Senator. But all \nthree of us here today, including the former Governor of North Dakota, \nhave wrestled with this business of the rising costs of Medicaid, paid \nfor partly by the States, according to rules set in Washington, and how \ndo we deal with public education, especially higher education.\n  I remember during the debate two years ago, I suggested to our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle who were supporting the \nhealth care law, which I thought was an historic mistake because it \nexpanded a health care delivery system we already knew was too \nexpensive, instead of taking steps to reduce it. I suggested to them \nthat they go home and run for Governor. They ought to be sentenced to \ngo home and run for Governor if they vote for it and see whether they \ncan implement it over an 8-year-period of time.\n  Here is what the Senator from Nebraska is suggesting. Let me try to \nbe very specific on the effect of the health care law on higher \neducation in the States. This is not all President Obama's fault. Some \n30 years ago, when I was a young Governor, I was still struggling with \nsaying: We get down to the end of the budget process and we have money \neither to put in higher education or into Medicaid, and the rules from \nWashington say it has to go to Medicaid.\n  I remember going to see President Reagan and saying: Why do we not \njust swap it, Mr. President? You take all of Medicaid. Let the States \ntake elementary and secondary education. I wish we had done that. But \nwe did not do it. Gradually, the increasing Washington-directed costs \nhave distorted State budgets until, as the Senator from Nebraska said, \n24 percent of the State budgets go to the Medicaid program.\n  Now we are in a process where because of the health care law, we are \ngoing to add 25.9 million more Americans onto Medicaid, according to \nthe Medicaid Chief Actuary. Employers are going to decide: I would \nrather pay my $2,000 penalty and allow my employees to go into the \nexchange or, if they are lower income, into Medicaid. Then the costs to \nStates are going to go up.\n  The Senator from Nebraska talked about what the current Governor of \nNebraska said. Our former Governor, Governor Bredesen, a Democratic \nGovernor, estimated that between 2014 and 2019 it would be $1.1 billion \nin new costs for the State of Tennessee from the Medicaid expansion.\n  What most people do not realize is the effect this has on higher \neducation and student tuition. I hear a lot of talk about let's see if \nwe can lower student tuition. One way we can lower it is not take money \nfrom student loans and spend it to pay for the health care bill. Most \npeople are not aware we spent $8.7 billion of so-called profits the \ngovernment makes when it borrows money at 2.8 percent and loans it to \nstudents at 6.8 percent. The government took some of that money and \nspent it to pay for the health care bill.\n  If it did not do that, it could lower the interest rates on student \nloans, according to the Congressional Budget Office, to 5.3 percent and \nsave $2,200 per student over 10 years on the basis. So the health care \nlaw is costing students who borrow money more on their loans.\n  In addition, and I will close with this example, it is raising \ncollege tuition. You say: How could the health care law cause tuition \nto go up in California or Tennessee? If in Tennessee, as last year, the \nincrease for Medicaid went up 15.8 percent. That is how much more State \ntax dollars it had to go up. Spending for the University of Tennessee \nand community colleges went down 15 percent. Then the result of that \nwas tuition went up in our State by about 8 percent. That was true all \nacross our country.\n  So the effect--and I will come back to this later if we have more \ntime--is that the health care law mandates that the States spend more \nmoney on Medicaid, and, as a result, the State cuts the money it is \nspending for the University of Tennessee or Nebraska or North Dakota. \nIn order to keep the quality of education up, tuition goes up. So \nstudents are paying more for tuition and they are paying more for \ninterest rates on their student loans directly because of the health \ncare law.\n  President Obama should not be blamed for the last 30 years of rising \ncosts of Medicaid. But he should be held responsible and this health \ncare law should be held responsible for making it worse.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Senator Alexander has raised some excellent points there \nbecause Governors only have so much revenue they can deal with; they \ncannot invent it, if you know what I am saying. So Governors have to \nfigure out what the needs of the State are. If the Federal Government \nis taking that decision away from Governors by forcing them into \nexpanding their Medicaid, there is going to be less money available for \nprograms such as K 12 education, higher education.\n  Let me, if I might, turn to our colleague Senator Hoeven. He was a \nGovernor for 10 years in the State of North Dakota. Will the Senator \nplease explain the impact Medicaid expansion would have on budget \ndecisions as a Governor and the impact the health care bill is going to \nhave on the Senator's State.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I thank Senator Johanns. It is good to be with him. Also, \nto Senator Lamar Alexander from the great State of Tennessee, it is \ngreat to be with him as well. We share, I guess, the common experience \nof serving as Governors and certainly bring that perspective to our \nwork in the Senate.\n  As Senator Alexander just said, there is no question ObamaCare is \nmaking the health care challenge in the United States worse, is making \nit worse. We have to find a way to empower our people. In our roles as \nGovernors, before serving in the Senate, that is what we tried to do. \nWhen it came to Medicaid, when it came to health care, it was how do we \nempower our people, whether it is health care or anything else, in a \nway that not only makes their lives better but that makes sure we are \nfulfilling our responsibility as good stewards of the State's treasury \non behalf of the citizens of our respective States.\n  Last week was the second anniversary of the Obama health care \nlegislation--the second anniversary. The fact is, since that law was \npassed--and just 1 minute ago, Senator Alexander expressed some of the \nthings he talked about when that debate was had in the Congress. But \nsince that law was passed, over the past 2 years, Americans have become \nmore unhappy with the legislation. The Obama health care legislation \nhas actually become more unpopular over the last few years as time has \ngone by because, quite simply, Americans do not want government-run \nhealth care. Americans do not want government-run health care. That is \nwhat ObamaCare is.\n  Americans want to be free to choose their own health care provider, \ntheir own doctors, their own hospitals. They also want to be able to be \nfree to choose their own health care insurance. Frankly, they are going \nto do a lot better job than having the Federal Government do it for \nthem. That is just a fact. Of course, that is very much at issue now \nwith the Supreme Court deliberations, the judicial review they are \nundertaking now on the constitutionality of the individual mandates in \nthe Obama health care legislation.\n  Of course, the question is, Is that individual mandate \nconstitutional? If it is, if they find that individual mandate is \nconstitutional, then is there any limit to the government's ability to \nintrude into the lives of our citizens? This is a huge question. If so, \nwhat happened to the concept of limited government, which was so \ncarefully developed by our Founding Fathers in our Constitution?\n\n[[Page S2012]]\n\n  It seems to me that concept of limited government is gone. That is an \nincredible problem for all of us that extends far beyond health care. \nAs former Governors, we understand the need to limit government, \nwhether it is the local level--and the Senator was a mayor. Senator \nJohanns was a mayor in Lincoln, NE, before he was the Governor of \nNebraska, now a Senator from Nebraska, and he understands that one of \nthe fundamental responsibilities of a mayor, of a Governor, of a \nSenator is to make sure we honor the Constitution and we limit the \npower of government, at the local, the State, and the Federal level, to \nintrude into the lives of our citizens. That is exactly what our \nFounding Fathers were striving to do in the Constitution, the whole \nconcept of checks and balances.\n  We have a legislative branch and a judicial branch and an executive \nbranch because that creates checks and balances on the respective \npowers of each branch. Why? To protect our citizens, to limit the reach \nof government. We have a bicameral Congress, the House and the Senate, \nto make it harder to pass laws, not easier--to make it harder to pass \nlaws. Again, it is to protect the people of this country.\n  We have the 10th amendment that reserves powers to the State not \nexpressly provided to the Federal Government; again, to limit the power \nof government and protect the people of this great country. Of course, \nthat is what we have in our Bill of Rights. That is what it is all \nabout.\n  So we have ObamaCare; it raises taxes by $\\1/2\\ trillion. It raises \ntaxes $500 billion. It cuts Medicare $\\1/2\\ trillion, $500 billion. \nYet, at the same time, it places huge costs, a huge burden on the \nStates. The CBO now estimates that over the next 10 years it will cost \nthe States $118 billion. That is $118 billion in costs to the States \nwho are trying to balance their budgets. They are already facing \nchallenges in doing that, and we will put that kind of huge cost on \nthem.\n  At the same time, think of what it does to our small businesses. \nAgain, as a Governor, I know how it was in my State. I think it was \ntrue when the Senator from Nebraska was Governor and when Senator \nAlexander was Governor of Tennessee. We understood that job creation \nwas job one. We had to make sure businesses were able to work \neffectively, to compete, and to employ people. That is the engine that \ndrives our economy, the small businesses.\n  When we look at ObamaCare, we look at what it does to the States--the \n$118 billion over 10 years--and look at the costs it creates for small \nbusinesses and look at the confusion it creates in trying to comply \nwith all of this. What do small businesses do? The Senator from \nNebraska talked a minute ago about, OK, what does the small business \ndo?\n  Well, either, A, they try to comply, and that drives up their costs \nor, B, they cancel their insurance and default to the government-run \ninsurance. But it not only creates a problem for them in determining \nwhether they are going to continue health care for their employees--and \nour citizens have shown they want the employer to continue doing that, \nand it goes to whether they hire more people.\n  Here we are with 8.3 percent unemployment, 13 million people looking \nfor work, and we are going to make it harder for small businesses to \nput them to work because they don't know if they can comply with \nObamaCare, let alone withstand the cost. That affects every single \nAmerican.\n  We need to change the approach. That is what we are talking about \ntoday. We are talking about an approach where we can empower people to \nchoose their own health insurance and provider, an approach that \nencourages competition, which will help bring costs down, giving our \nconsumers more choice. We are here to talk about how we work with \nStates and small businesses to reduce costs, reduce fraud, waste, and \nabuse.\n  The President of AARP, Barry Rand, estimates that $100 billion is \nlost annually in waste, fraud, and abuse under Medicaid. Think what our \nStates could do on behalf of their citizens in all 50 States if we in \nthe Congress, working with an administration that will work with us, \nwould empower the States to go after that waste, fraud, and abuse by \ngiving their citizens more say over their health care and by \nencouraging competition among insurance companies to provide more \nchoice, access, and to go after that waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  There are so many things we can do, but it is not through a big, \nmonolithic, government-run insurance program that puts costs on the \nStates and costs on its citizens. That is what we need to change. We \nneed to change it now.\n  Again, I thank Senator Alexander for being here and for his work to \nempower our people when it comes to health care. Also, I particularly \nthank Senator Johanns for calling us together to discuss this very \nimportant issue on behalf of the people of America.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Hoeven for his comments. \nHe mentioned that job one for every Governor is job creation. Before I \nturn to Senator Alexander, let me congratulate Senator Hoeven. Whatever \nhe did in that capacity worked. He has the lowest unemployment rate of \nany State. I am proud to say Nebraska is No. 2 in that regard.\n  I will guarantee one thing you learn: You don't create jobs by \nputting a big wet blanket of more regulations on the job creators. I \nworry that all these rules and regulations are going to have a very \ndamaging impact on job creation.\n  I would like Senator Alexander to talk about that, what he sees as \nthe impact of this health care bill on job creation in our States.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator. I listened with interest to the \nformer Governor of North Dakota and the former Governor of Nebraska. \nLet me give a specific example. In response to the question, after the \npassage of the health care law, I met with a number of representatives \nfrom chain restaurants. Chain restaurants are the kind at which we go \nout to dinner for a modest cost. They are among the largest employers \nin America. They employ largely low-income and young people--people who \nare the waiters and waitresses we see when we go into Ruby Tuesday or \nO'Charley's or one of these other places, and usually it is someone \nwith a part-time job or somebody who is working his or her way up.\n  Many of those companies offer some health insurance to their \nemployees. At one of the companies, Ruby Tuesday, headquartered in \nTennessee, the chief executive officer told me the cost of the health \ncare law to his company would equal the profit of the company that \nyear. This is a company with several billion dollars in revenue.\n  One of the companies that is even more successful than Ruby Tuesday \nin terms of profit, and is larger, told me their goal was to have 90 \nemployees per store. But after the health care law, they said they \nwould have 70 employees per store in order to comply with the cost of \nthe health care law. This not only raises the cost of business, but it \nreduces employment in the United States.\n  Unfortunately, I am afraid what we may find is these restaurant \ncompanies, after 2014--we are about 1 year away from a ticking time \nbomb for State budgets and businesses and also for people with employer \nhealth insurance. I am afraid these companies will look at the penalty \nand say they would rather pay $2,000 per employee and let them find \ntheir way into one of these State exchanges or into the Medicaid \nProgram.\n  Millions of Americans, because of the health care law, are going to \nlose their employer-sponsored insurance, and millions of Americans will \nnot have as many jobs because of the costs imposed on businesses such \nas these restaurants.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. The Senator raises a good point. I am mindful of our \ntime limit. I am going to take a minute or two to wrap up. I do think \nSenator Alexander and Senator Hoeven both raised very good points.\n  I look at the health care law and I often think, whoever wrote this \nlaw, who were they talking to? They certainly were not talking to our \nsmall- and medium-sized businesses across this country. Why? Because \njust as Senator Alexander points out, there is going to be a point \nwhere that business owner, large or small, and in each and every spot \nin between, will look at the penalty of $2,000 per employee and say it \nis vastly cheaper for them to drop coverage and pay the penalty. In \nfact, we figured out what that savings would\n\n[[Page S2013]]\n\nbe for a large retailer in the United States. It was over $1 billion a \nyear.\n\n  Does anybody believe for a moment that they are not going to do what \nis right by their shareholders and pay that penalty and save $1 billion \na year by dropping health care coverage? Once that dam breaks, the dam \nbreaks.\n  Then do you remember that promise so often made--47 times? The \nPresident said, ``If you like your plan, you are going to be able to \nkeep it.'' Well, people are not going to be able to keep it. They will \nlose their plans.\n  They certainly were not talking to Governors when they wrote this \nbill. Any Governor would tell us that Medicaid is a broken system. It \nis literally bankrupting State budgets under current circumstances. \nThen when we add 26 million more people to Medicaid, we begin to \nrealize they are going to have a serious access problem.\n  Forty percent of doctors do not take Medicaid patients. Where are \nthey going to find their health care? As many of us pointed out, it is \nlike saying to someone: Here is your bus ticket, travel anywhere you \nwant--oh, by the way, there are not enough buses to haul all the people \nwe have given tickets to.\n  That is what we are going to be facing--a growing access problem. \nThen, with the cuts to Medicare, they sure could not have been talking \nto Medicare providers because when they start cutting reimbursement \nrates, which is exactly what they are doing with $\\1/2\\ trillion cut \nout of Medicare, they are going to have access problems there too.\n  All of a sudden senior citizens cannot find a doctor. Don't believe \nmy statement on that. Read the reports from Richard Foster, the Chief \nActuary at CMS, who studied this and said these are the consequences of \nthis legislation.\n  At the end of the day it is pretty clear to all of us that this is a \nfailed policy that was quickly put together, rammed through to roll \nover the minority and get this done. We ended up with a very failed \npiece of legislation.\n  The American people do not like this legislation any better than the \nday it was passed. In fact, they like it less. The more they learn \nabout this legislation, the less they like it.\n  I will wrap up with one thought. We all know the Supreme Court is \nhearing arguments on this case these days. It is my hope the Supreme \nCourt will intervene and decide that this law is in fact \nunconstitutional, and then we can build a health care law the way it \nshould be done--a step at a time, consulting with medical providers and \nGovernors all across this country to build a policy that makes sense \nfor the health care system and our citizens. That is what should have \nbeen done in the first place. That is what we need to do.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we are reading in the news about the \nviolence in countries all around the world and are reminded about the \ntremendous sacrifice of American troops as they protect and preserve \nthe interests of our Nation. These men and women serve with courage and \nhonor and it is our duty to honor and stand for those who have stood \nfor us.\n  Today, I am here to pay my respects to SSG Jerry Reed II, an Arkansas \nsoldier who sacrificed his life for the love of his country while in \nsupport of Operation Enduring Freedom.\n  Staff Sergeant Reed graduated from Russellville High School in 2000 \nand enlisted in the Army. He served 4 years and then reenlisted in 2008 \nand served in Iraq, Germany, Korea, and Afghanistan. Staff Sergeant \nReed served as a tank driver and gunner with the Army's 28th Infantry \nBrigade, 2nd Battalion, A Company at Grafenwoehr, Germany.\n  His sister Katherine, in an interview with the Russellville Courier, \nspoke of how he loved the military and planned to make it a career. \nStaff Sergeant Reed's family and friends describe him as a man who \nwould have had no trouble fitting into the military, for he was one who \nfaced danger head on. He was a protector and looked out for his \nfriends. He loved being outdoors and fishing and spending time with his \nfamily.\n  On February 16, 2012, Staff Sergeant Reed passed away while serving \nin Afghanistan. Staff Sergeant Reed made the ultimate sacrifice for his \ncountry. He is a true American hero.\n  I ask my colleagues to keep his family and his friends in their \nthoughts and prayers during this very difficult time, and I humbly \noffer thanks to SSG Jerry Reed for his selfless service to the security \nand well-being of all Americans.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the British statesman Edmund Burke said:\n\n       All government--indeed every human benefit and enjoyment, \n     every virtue, and every prudent act--is founded on compromise \n     and barter.\n\n  Compromise and barter. That means give-and-take in order to work \nthings out.\n  I want to apply Burke's famous aphorism to the two leaders of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, the chairman, Senator Barbara \nBoxer of California, and the ranking member, Senator Jim Inhofe of \nOklahoma--one of the Senate's leading liberals and one of the Senate's \nmost dyed-in-the-wool conservatives.\n  While Senators Boxer and Inhofe openly acknowledge there is much they \ndo not agree on, they both agree transportation infrastructure is a \nsmart investment in America's road safety and jobs. So they worked hard \nto craft a consensus highway bill that three-quarters of the Senate \ncould agree to support. I have always believed this kind of cooperation \nis the key to success. We can do great things for this country when we \nwork together.\n  When I had the honor of leading the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, I also had the truly distinct pleasure of working with \nSenators from both parties who understood Burke's principle of barter \nand compromise, such as John Warner of Virginia and John Chafee of \nRhode Island. So it is very gratifying to know that tradition on the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee continues to be strongly upheld \nby the chairman and the ranking member today.\n  In working to craft the highway bill, both of these leaders faced \npressures not to compromise. Each had ample opportunity to give into \nthose pressures and give up on the bill. But instead of drawing lines \nin the sand and pointing fingers, they chose to reach out their hands \nand meet in the middle. They talked to each other and, more \nimportantly, they listened. They opted for pragmatism over ideology. \nThey disagreed without being disagreeable. They worked closely with \nSenator Vitter and myself to incorporate the best ideas from all sides. \nUltimately, those good-faith efforts prevailed when the committee \nreported our highway bill title with unanimous support.\n  We continued working together to meld that product with contributions \nfrom the Banking Committee and the Commerce Committee, along with a \nfiscally responsible plan to pay for this investment from the Finance \nCommittee.\n  Earlier this month, 75 percent of the Senate came together to pass a \nhighway bill that will create or sustain approximately 1.8 million \nAmerican jobs each year. That is according to the Department of \nTransportation. What a tremendous achievement reached by working \ntogether--creating or sustaining 1.8 million jobs a year. For my State \nof Montana, this bill will create or sustain 14,000 jobs each year, and \nit cuts through redtape to put people to\n\n[[Page S2014]]\n\nwork on those jobs even faster. It gives the State of Montana and our \nlocal communities the flexibility they need to fund the alternative \ntransportation projects that work best for them. It invests in the Land \nand Water Conservation Fund and continues a vital program to support \nour timber communities. It does it all without adding one single dime \nto the Federal deficit.\n  Simply put, this bill is an investment in jobs we can't afford to \npass up. That is why this weekend Montana's largest newspaper, the \nBillings Gazette, called on the House to pass the Senate bill, and I \njoin that call today.\n  The current highway bill expires at the end of this month, and the \nconstruction season is starting soon. As the Gazette notes, a short-\nterm extension doesn't provide the certainty we need to get highway \nprojects off the ground and workers on the job. We cannot afford to put \nthese jobs on hold by kicking the can down the road--especially when we \ndon't have to, and, also, especially when we don't have much more road \nto kick the can.\n  The Senate bill is the product of months of debate and cooperation, \nof give-and-take from all sides, carefully crafted into a bipartisan \ninvestment we can all be proud to support. It has already passed the \ntest of overwhelmingly bipartisan support in the Senate, and there is \nno reason the House should not take up this bill and pass it right \naway.\n  The House should understand that we need to work together to achieve \nsolutions upon which the American people can rely. Edmund Burke \nunderstood that. Thankfully, Senators Boxer and Inhofe clearly \nunderstand it too. I thank them for that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/26/senate-section/article/S2014-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2014-S2015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, President Truman once said, ``Healthy \ncitizens constitute our greatest national resource.''\n  Two years ago last week we passed the affordable care act. We passed \nit to help give every American access to quality affordable health \ncare.\n  People such as Cece Whitney from Helena, MO, know exactly how much \nhelp this law provides. Doctors diagnosed Cece with cystic fibrosis by \nage 7. By high school she carried an oxygen tank. By the end of college \nshe received a double lung transplant. Even with insurance coverage \nCece and her family paid tens of thousands of dollars out of pocket. \nBut things looked even worse when she hit an arbitrary coverage limit, \nand if she had lost her insurance before health reform she might not \nhave been able to find any insurance coverage at all.\n  Insurance companies could have turned her away simply because she was \nborn with cystic fibrosis. But now, thanks to the affordable care act, \nCece will always be covered. She will always have access to the care \nshe needs.\n  A year ago, on the affordable care act's first anniversary, Cece \nshared her story about seeing health reform signed into law with her \nlocal newspaper. She said she cried tears--tears of extreme joy. She \nwrote:\n\n       I knew that I no longer had to worry about losing or being \n     denied coverage because of my `preexisting condition.' And I \n     no longer was going to be denied coverage for exceeding \n     arbitrary caps set by insurance companies.\n\n  Cece's story is not unique. Health reform is working for people in \nMontana and across the country, and it is saving them money. The law \nimproved our health care system and enabled it to focus on prevention \nand keeping Americans healthy. We have reforms to pay for quality of \ncare rather than quantity of services. In just 2 years, health reform \nhas lowered costs for millions of Americans. Parents can now afford to \ncover their entire family, including children up to the age of 26. More \nthan 2.5 million young adults have been able to stay on their parents' \nplan thanks to health reform.\n  Prescription drugs are now cheaper for seniors because of the act. \nAlready more than 5 million Medicare beneficiaries have saved more than \n$3 billion on drugs. Again, that is $3 billion saved by seniors on \ndrugs, and health reform eliminates the so-called Medicare prescription \ndrug doughnut hole. This puts dollars back in seniors' pockets--dollars \nthey can use for groceries or electricity bills.\n  Seniors now receive free annual wellness visits and free screenings. \nThis focus on prevention leads to better health outcomes, and it keeps \nthem healthier. It saves money by allowing seniors and their doctors to \ncatch conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes before they \nbecome serious and costly.\n  Health reform also helps those who wish to retire early to afford \ninsurance until they qualify for Medicare. The law has provided almost \n$4.5 billion in aid to businesses to give early-retiree coverage to \nthese employees. Let me repeat that. The law has provided almost $4.5 \nbillion in aid to businesses to enable them to give early-retiree \ncoverage for their employees.\n  Health reform is also saving Americans money through new consumer \nprotections. It is ending insurance company abuses. Medical loss ratios \nis one that comes to my mind. Because of health reform, parents can now \nkeep their kids who have preexisting conditions on their plan, and \ninsurance companies can no longer exclude these children. Insurance \ncompanies can no longer place lifetime and restrictive yearly limits on \ntheir health coverage that can cost Americans such as Cece Whitney tens \nof thousands of dollars, and insurance companies can no longer go back \nand scrutinize applications for tiny errors as a way to deny payments \nafter a customer gets sick.\n  Health reform has also created the Medicare and Medicaid Innovation \nCenter to put good ideas from the private sector into action. The \ncenter is already working with more than 7,100 organizations--\nhospitals, physicians, consumer groups, and employers included--to \nreduce costly hospital readmissions.\n  Health reform provides law enforcement with new tools and resources \nto protect Medicare and Medicaid from fraud and abuse. These efforts \nrecovered more than $4 billion last year. New antifraud provisions in \nthe act, in the health care bill, helped recover more than $4 billion \nin fraud last year. Just a few weeks ago, Federal agents made the \nlargest Medicare fraud bust in U.S. history. Ninety-one people were \ncharged with defrauding taxpayers for nearly $300 million.\n  More parts of the affordable care act that will help consumers will \nstart in the year 2014, including the State-based affordable insurance \nexchanges. On these exchanges people will be able to save money. How? \nBy shopping for an insurance plan that is right for them. It is like \ngetting on Expedia or Orbitz: you just get on and shop around and find \nthe one that is best for you.\n  For too long, individuals and small businesses shopping for insurance \non their own have had very limited options. The plans that were \navailable were often too expensive. Now, for the first time, insurance \ncompanies will have to compete against each other for business on a \nlevel playing field. That will mean lower premiums, better coverage, \nand more choices.\n  Health reform has also reduced government costs by dramatically \nslowing the growth in spending. According to our nonpartisan \nscorekeeper, the Congressional Budget Office, health reform slowed the \ngrowth in health spending by 4 percent. That will save taxpayer dollars \nand help get our deficit problem under control.\n  We need to let the law keep working to save families and taxpayers \nmore money. The Congressional Budget Office tells us that repealing the \naffordable care act--repealing it now--would increase the Federal \ndeficit by nearly $143 billion over the next decade. Repeal would cost \nthe Federal deficit $143 billion over the next decade according to the \nCongressional Budget Office, and it would increase the deficit by more \nthan $1 trillion in the decade after that.\n  Repealing health reform would also leave tens of millions of \nAmericans without insurance. Studies have shown this would cost every \nAmerican family an extra $1,000 a year. That is something we cannot \nafford. The affordable care act has already saved millions of Americans \nmoney and helped them get affordable health care, and millions more \nwill gain access in the coming years. Healthy citizens are, indeed, the \ngreatest asset our country has. We need to let health reform keep \nworking for all Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

In a recent column in the Arizona Republic, my friend Bob \nRobb laid out a very thoughtful contrast between President Obama's \nbudget and the alternative put forth by House Budget Committee chairman \nPaul Ryan, which the House of Representatives will be acting on this \nweek. In his column Robb notes that the Ryan budget would get the \nFederal deficit below 3 percent of GDP by 2015 and after a decade would \nreduce our debt-to-GDP ratio from today's 100 percent to about 87 \npercent or just under the share many economists believe affects private \nsector economic performance and casts doubt on the government's ability \nto even repay its obligations. Robb explains that ``despite the \ncaterwauling of critics, Ryan doesn't achieve this through brutal \nbudget cuts. Quite the contrary.'' He explains why the Ryan budget \nwould allow spending to increase about 3 percent each year, compared to \nthe Obama budget's about 5 percent annual increases, and he concludes \nthat low interest rates are currently muting the effects of our growing \ndebt on the economy, but it could change overnight. ``And if it \nchanges, the federal government will have to take action much more \ndrastic and quicker than the relatively gentle and gradual pathway \nprovided by the Ryan budget.''\n  I hope Senators will take a few moments to review this column in its \nentirety. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Arizona Republic, Mar. 23, 2012]\n\n                   Ryan Has a Less-Painful Debt Plan\n\n                            (By Robert Robb)\n\n       Critics of Rep. Paul Ryan's proposed budget resolution are \n     almost universally unserious about getting federal debt and \n     deficits under control. The country will be very lucky if it \n     gets a chance to implement as gentle and gradual a path to \n     fiscal sobriety as the Ryan plan outlines.\n       Economists believe there are two red lines for debt and \n     deficits. If accumulated debt exceeds 90 percent of GDP, it \n     begins to affect private-sector economic performance and \n     raise questions about the ability of the government to pay it \n     back. And annual deficits of more than 3 percent of GDP are \n     regarded as a sign of a government that has lost control of \n     its finances.\n       Right now, total federal debt exceeds 100 percent of GDP. \n     The deficit is 8.5 percent of GDP. And that's the lowest it's \n     been in four years.\n       The Ryan budget would get the annual deficit below 3 \n     percent of GDP by 2015. At the end of the 10-year planning \n     horizon, total federal debt would be an estimated 87 percent \n     of GDP, barely out of the red zone.\n       Despite the caterwauling of critics, Ryan doesn't achieve \n     this through brutal budget cuts. Quite the contrary.\n       Under Ryan's budget, federal spending would increase from \n     $3.6 trillion today to $4.9 trillion 10 years from now. \n     That's an average annual rate of increase of around 3 \n     percent. Hardly a starvation diet.\n       What is the alternative to Ryan's plan to get the federal \n     government out of the red zone on debt and deficits? It \n     certainly isn't President Barack Obama's budget.\n       Under Obama's budget, the annual deficit wouldn't get under \n     3 percent of GDP until 2017. That would mean eight \n     consecutive years of exceeding the deficit speed limit. \n     That's not a country in control of its finances.\n       Under Obama's budget, the country would never get below 100 \n     percent of GDP in terms of total debt. After 10 years, the \n     country would still be deep in the red zone.\n       Rather than increase federal spending to $4.9 trillion over \n     10 years, Obama would increase it to $5.8 trillion--or nearly \n     5 percent a year, compared with Ryan's 3 percent.\n       Obama's tax increases aren't really to reduce the deficit, \n     as he claims. They are to support his higher rate of growth \n     in spending.\n       Right now, there's not a political urgency to do something \n     meaningful about debt and deficits because the federal \n     government can borrow a seemingly unlimited amount of money \n     at very low interest rates.\n       But that could change. And it could change overnight. And \n     if it changes, the federal government will have to take \n     action much more drastic and quicker than the relatively \n     gentle and gradual pathway provided by the Ryan budget.\n       The most controversial parts of the Ryan budget--tax reform \n     and Medicare reform--are actually irrelevant to the task of \n     getting out of the red zone for debt and deficits. The tax \n     reform is intended to be revenue-neutral. The Medicare reform \n     doesn't kick in until after the 10-year planning horizon of \n     the budget resolution. It's intended to reduce the debt \n     problem of the future, not get us out of our current hole.\n       If Democrats were serious about doing something about debt, \n     there would be room for discussion about changes to the Ryan \n     blueprint. The Simpson-Bowles Commission proposed tax reform \n     similar to what Ryan advocates, lower rates on a broader \n     base, but in a way that increases revenues to the government. \n     Ryan proposes spending $440 billion more on defense over 10 \n     years than does Obama. The relative allocations within the \n     Ryan spending limits are certainly arguable.\n       But Democrats aren't serious, so the Ryan budget is the \n     only current alternative to just waiting for the credit \n     markets to start saying no. If that day arrives, the Ryan \n     plan will look awfully lovely in retrospect.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/26/senate-section/article/S2015-3", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2015-S2017]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, as we know, today the Supreme Court began \nhearing arguments about the constitutionality of the affordable care \nact. It is one of the most critically important Supreme Court cases of \nour time. A Wall Street Journal editorial noted last Friday:\n\n       Few legal cases in the modern era are as consequential, or \n     as defining, as the challenges to [this law]. . . . The \n     powers that the Obama administration is claiming change the \n     structure of the American government as it has existed for \n     225 years. . . . The Constitutional questions the Affordable \n     Care Act poses are great, novel, and grave.\n\n  The editorial, entitled ``Liberty and ObamaCare,'' lays out the \nconstitutional problems with the affordable health care act and focuses \non the bill's centerpiece: the individual mandate to purchase health \ninsurance. As the editorial notes, the case against this provision is \nanchored in ample constitutional precedent, and I quote their \nconclusion:\n\n       The Commerce Clause that the government invokes to defend \n     such regulation has always applied to commercial and economic \n     transactions, not to individuals as members of society. . . . \n     The Court has never held that the Commerce Clause is an ad \n     hoc license for anything the government wants to do.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to read this article, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [The Wall Street Journal, Mar. 22, 2012]\n\n                         Liberty and ObamaCare\n\n       Few legal cases in the modern era are as consequential, or \n     as defining, as the challenges to the Patient Protection and \n     Affordable Care Act that the Supreme Court hears beginning \n     Monday. The powers that the Obama Administration is claiming \n     change the structure of the American government as it has \n     existed for 225 years. Thus has the health-care law provoked \n     an unprecedented and unnecessary constitutional showdown that \n     endangers individual liberty.\n       It is a remarkable moment. The High Court has scheduled the \n     longest oral arguments in nearly a half-century: five and a \n     half hours, spread over three days. Yet Democrats, the \n     liberal legal establishment and the press corps spent most of \n     2010 and 2011 deriding the government of limited and \n     enumerated powers of Article I as a quaint artifact of the \n     18th century. Now even President Obama and his staff seem to \n     grasp their constitutional gamble.\n       Consider a White House strategy memo that leaked this \n     month, revealing that senior Administration officials are \n     coordinating with liberal advocacy groups to pressure the \n     Court. ``Frame the Supreme Court oral arguments in terms of \n     real people and real benefits that would be lost if the law \n     were overturned,'' the memo notes, rather than ``the \n     individual responsibility piece of the law and the legal \n     precedence [sic].'' Those nonpolitical details are merely \n     what ``lawyers will be talking about.''\n       The White House is even organizing demonstrations during \n     the proceedings, including a `` `prayerful witness' \n     encircling the Supreme Court.'' The executive branch is \n     supposed to speak to the Court through the Solicitor General, \n     not agitprop and crowds in the streets.\n       The Supreme Court will not be ruling about matters of \n     partisan conviction, or the President's re-election campaign, \n     or even about health care at all. The lawsuit filed by 26 \n     states and the National Federation of Independent Business is \n     about the outer\n\n[[Page S2016]]\n\n     boundaries of federal power and the architecture of the U.S. \n     political system.\n       The argument against the individual mandate--the \n     requirement that everyone buy health insurance or pay a \n     penalty--is carefully anchored in constitutional precedent \n     and American history. The Commerce Clause that the government \n     invokes to defend such regulation has always applied to \n     commercial and economic transactions, not to individuals as \n     members of society.\n       This distinction is crucial. The health-care and health-\n     insurance markets are classic interstate commerce. The \n     federal government can regulate broadly--though not without \n     limit--and it has. It could even mandate that people use \n     insurance to purchase the services of doctors and hospitals, \n     because then it would be regulating market participation. But \n     with ObamaCare the government is asserting for the first time \n     that it can compel people to enter those markets, and only \n     then to regulate how they consume health care and health \n     insurance. In a word, the government is claiming it can \n     create commerce so it has something to regulate.\n       This is another way of describing plenary police powers--\n     regulations of private behavior to advance public order and \n     welfare. The problem is that with two explicit exceptions \n     (military conscription and jury duty) the Constitution \n     withholds such power from a central government and vests that \n     authority in the states. It is a black-letter axiom: Congress \n     and the President can make rules for actions and objects; \n     states can make rules for citizens.\n       The framers feared arbitrary and centralized power, so they \n     designed the federalist system--which predates the Bill of \n     Rights--to diffuse and limit power and to guarantee \n     accountability. Upholding the ObamaCare mandate requires a \n     vision on the Commerce Clause so broad that it would erase \n     dual sovereignty and extend the new reach of federal general \n     police powers into every sphere of what used to be individual \n     autonomy.\n       These federalist protections have endured despite the \n     shifting definition and scope of interstate commerce and \n     activities that substantially affect it. The Commerce Clause \n     was initially seen as a modest power, meant to eliminate the \n     interstate tariffs that prevailed under the Articles of \n     Confederation. James Madison noted in Federalist No. 45 that \n     it was ``an addition which few oppose, and from which no \n     apprehensions are entertained.'' The Father of the \n     Constitution also noted that the powers of the states are \n     ``numerous and infinite'' while the federal government's are \n     ``few and defined.''\n       That view changed in the New Deal era as the Supreme Court \n     blessed the expansive powers of federal economic regulation \n     understood today. A famous 1942 ruling, Wickard v. Filburn, \n     held that Congress could regulate growing wheat for personal \n     consumption because in the aggregate such farming would \n     affect interstate wheat prices. The Court reaffirmed that \n     precedent as recently as 2005, in Gonzales v. Raich, \n     regarding homegrown marijuana.\n       The Court, however, has never held that the Commerce Clause \n     is an ad hoc license for anything the government wants to do. \n     In 1995, in Lopez, it gave the clause more definition by \n     striking down a Congressional ban on carrying guns near \n     schools, which didn't rise to the level of influencing \n     interstate commerce. It did the same in 2000, in Morrison, \n     about a federal violence against women statute.\n       A thread that runs through all these cases is that the \n     Court has always required some limiting principle that is \n     meaningful and can be enforced by the legal system. As the \n     Affordable Care Act suits have ascended through the courts, \n     the Justice Department has been repeatedly asked to \n     articulate some benchmark that distinguishes this specific \n     individual mandate from some other purchase mandate that \n     would be unconstitutional. Justice has tried and failed, \n     because a limiting principle does not exist.\n       The best the government can do is to claim that health care \n     is unique. It is not. Other industries also have high costs \n     that mean buyers and sellers risk potentially catastrophic \n     expenses--think of housing, or credit-card debt. Health costs \n     are unpredictable--but all markets are inherently \n     unpredictable. The uninsured can make insurance pools more \n     expensive and transfer their costs to those with coverage--\n     though then again, similar cost-shifting is the foundation of \n     bankruptcy law.\n       The reality is that every decision not to buy some good or \n     service has some effect on the interstate market for that \n     good or service. The government is asserting that because \n     there are ultimate economic consequences it has the power to \n     control the most basic decisions about how people spend their \n     own money in their day-to-day lives. The next stops on this \n     outbound train could be mortgages, college tuition, credit, \n     investment, saving for retirement, Treasurys, and who knows \n     what else.\n       Confronted with these concerns, the Administration has \n     echoed Nancy Pelosi when she was asked if the individual \n     mandate was constitutional: ``Are you serious?'' The \n     political class, the Administration says, would never abuse \n     police powers to create the proverbial broccoli mandate or \n     force people to buy a U.S.-made car.\n       But who could have predicted that the government would pass \n     a health plan mandate that is opposed by two of three voters? \n     The argument is self-refuting, and it shows why upholding the \n     rule of law and defending the structural checks and balances \n     of the separation of powers is more vital than ever.\n       Another Administration fallback is the Constitution's \n     Necessary and Proper Clause, which says Congress can pass \n     laws to execute its other powers. Yet the Court has never \n     hesitated to strike down laws that are not based on an \n     enumerated power even if they're part of an otherwise proper \n     scheme. This clause isn't some ticket to justify inherently \n     unconstitutional actions.\n       In this context, the Administration says the individual \n     mandate is necessary so that the Affordable Care Act's other \n     regulations ``work.'' Those regulations make insurance more \n     expensive. So the younger and healthier must buy insurance \n     that they may not need or want to cross-subsidize the older \n     and sicker who are likely to need costly care. But that \n     doesn't make the other regulations more ``effective.'' The \n     individual mandate is meant to offset their intended \n     financial effects.\n       Some good-faith critics have also warned that overturning \n     the law would amount to conservative ``judicial activism,'' \n     saying that the dispute is only political. This is reductive \n     reasoning. Laws obey the Constitution or they don't. The \n     courts ought to defer to the will of lawmakers who pass bills \n     and the Presidents who sign them, except when those bills \n     violate the founding document.\n       As for respect of the democratic process, there are plenty \n     of ordinary, perfectly constitutional ways the Obama \n     Democrats could have reformed health care and achieved the \n     same result. They could have raised taxes to fund national \n     health care or to make direct cross-subsidy transfers to sick \n     people. They chose not to avail themselves of those options \n     because they'd be politically unpopular. The individual \n     mandate was in that sense a deliberate evasion of the \n     accountability the Constitution's separation of powers is \n     meant to protect.\n       Meanwhile, some on the right are treating this case as a \n     libertarian seminar and rooting for the end of the New Deal \n     precedents. But the Court need not abridge stare decisis and \n     the plaintiffs are not asking it to do so. The Great \n     Depression farmer in Wickard, Roscoe Filburn, was prohibited \n     from growing wheat, and that ban, however unwise, could be \n     reinstated today. Even during the New Deal the government \n     never claimed that nonconsumers of wheat were affecting \n     interstate wheat prices, or contemplated forcing everyone to \n     buy wheat in order to do so.\n       The crux of the matter is that by arrogating to itself \n     plenary police powers, the government crossed a line that \n     Justice Anthony Kennedy drew in his Lopez concurrence. The \n     ``federal balance,'' he wrote, ``is too essential a part of \n     our constitutional structure and plays too vital a role in \n     securing freedom for us to admit inability to intervene when \n     one or the other level of government has tipped the scale too \n     far.''\n       The constitutional questions the Affordable Care Act poses \n     are great, novel and grave, as much today as they were when \n     they were first posed in an op-ed on these pages by the \n     Washington lawyers David Rivkin and Lee Casey on September \n     18, 2009. The appellate circuits are split, as are legal \n     experts of all interpretative persuasions.\n       The Obama Administration and its allies are already \n     planning to attack the Court's credibility and legitimacy if \n     it overturns the Affordable Care Act. They will claim it is a \n     purely political decision, but this should not sway the \n     Justices any more than should the law's unpopularity with the \n     public.\n       The stakes are much larger than one law or one President. \n     It is not an exaggeration to say that the Supreme Court's \n     answers may constitute a hinge in the history of American \n     liberty and limited and enumerated government. The Justices \n     must decide if those principles still mean something.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Finally, continuing on the point about the argument on \nObamaCare and referring to a different piece that appeared in the Wall \nStreet Journal, I wanted to talk just a little bit in more detail about \nthe justification of this mandate to purchase health insurance, the \nrequirement that every individual in the United States be the recipient \nof a specifically defined policy by the U.S. Government.\n  The rationale the government has provided is that if we do not do \nthis, then free riders or people who do not have insurance but might \nget sick will end up shifting all of the burden of their care onto the \nrest of us, and therefore the government needs to regulate that by \nforcing everybody to buy insurance. On March 20 the Journal published a \npiece by Douglas Holtz-Eakin and Vernon Smith, a former CBO Director \nand an economics professor, respectively, which I think really debunks \nthis argument on the merits. It explains the real reason this mandate, \nas well as a dramatic expansion of Medicaid, is unconstitutional. I \njust wanted to highlight the points they make.\n  First, Holtz-Eakin and Smith address this individual mandate \nquestion. States, of course, have general police power to regulate the \nconduct of their citizens, but Federal power, by contrast, is very \nlimited over individuals.\n  The authors make the important point that heath care policy has \ntraditionally been a State function. Health\n\n[[Page S2017]]\n\ncare needs relate to individuals and vary from person to person and \nregion to region. As a policy matter, States have a better \nunderstanding of what kind of improvements to health care access are \nneeded.\n  Here is what they wrote:\n\n       The administration's attempt to fashion a singular, \n     universal solution is not necessary to deal with the \n     variegated issues arising in these markets. States have taken \n     the lead in past reform efforts. They should be an integral \n     part of improving the functioning of health-care and health-\n     insurance markets.\n\n  If the States have the legal power to address health issues and are \nbetter equipped to do so, then where does the justification for Federal \njurisdiction come from? The authors note that the administration's \nargument is that the Federal Government mandate is needed to address \nthe cost-shifting, the thing I talked about before. But they note that \nthis is a red herring. ``In reality,'' the authors write, ``the mandate \nhas almost nothing to do with cost-shifting.'' That is because, in \nactuality, the young and the healthy--the people who are not buying \nhealth insurance--aren't imposing much of a burden on the system \nbecause they do not get sick that often. They do not need as much \ninsurance because they do not need as much health care. The authors say \nthat ``the insurance mandate cannot reasonably be justified on the \nground that it remedies costs imposed on the system by the voluntarily \nuninsured.'' In other words, as I said, there is not that much free-\nriding going on.\n  The authors conclude that the real purpose of the mandate is not to \ndecrease the costs of uncompensated care, it is meant to force the \nyoung and the healthy to buy health insurance at rates far above the \namount and scope of coverage they actually need because they are \ngenerally healthy individuals. But this extra money will help fund \nhealth insurance companies and therefore offset the huge increased \ncosts imposed upon them by ObamaCare's many new regulations. This is \nthe real reason for the individual mandate. In fact, as an amicus brief \nby over 100 economists points out, ``The [Affordable Care] Act is \nprojected to impose total net costs of $360 billion on health insurance \ncompanies from 2012 to 2021.'' With the mandates, however, ``insurance \ncompanies can be expected to essentially break even.'' This is no \ncoincidence.\n  If this is the real justification for the mandate to purchase health \ncare, I submit it should have been done through an enumerated power--\nperhaps under the tax power of the Federal Government, which is at \nleast one of the powers the Constitution explicitly provides.\n  In any event, this individual mandate cannot be justified to regulate \ninterstate commerce. The supporters of the mandate have therefore \nintroduced a second argument. They say health care is just different \nfrom all other commerce. It is bigger. Everybody has to have health \ncare--as if they did not have to have food on the table or shelter over \ntheir head or clothes on their back and so on. In any event, they say \nhealth care is different and somehow this difference gives Congress the \nright to force people to buy government-mandated health insurance under \nits power to regulate interstate commerce. But the argument that ``this \nparticular market is just different'' is beside the point even if it \nwere true because it does not articulate a constitutional limitation \nthat is judicially enforceable.\n  The question before the Court is whether there is any limit to \nCongress's power to regulate commerce. Obviously, the Framers would \nnever have countenanced a Federal requirement to purchase a product so \nthat the government could then regulate it. So what limit on \nconstitutional power is suggested by the health care market? None. That \nis precisely the point. The government cannot draw a line, and, as a \nresult, it would have to argue that there is no limit to its powers, \nand that, of course, would run counter to the reason the Framers put \nlimitations into the Constitution.\n  The individual mandate is not the only provision in ObamaCare that is \nconstitutionally impermissible. The Medicaid expansion is also \nviolative. While Congress has well-established power to use its purse \nstrings to encourage the States to adopt certain Federal policies, it \ncannot force them or compel them to do so. ObamaCare's Medicaid \nexpansion essentially coerces the States into complying with new \nMedicaid policies.\n  This occurs in two different ways. First, if a State does not comply \nwith the ObamaCare eligibility expansion, it would lose all of its \nFederal Medicaid funds--even for patient populations that the State had \nalready covered long before ObamaCare was passed. Few if any States \nwould be able to continue their existing Medicaid Programs if they lost \nall of this Federal funding.\n  An amicus brief signed by over 100 economists examined Medicaid data \nto determine the economic impact of States losing all of their Medicaid \nfunds, and it found that if States were forced to absorb Federal \nMedicaid expenditures into their own State budgets, ``the State's total \nbudgetary expenditures would jump by 22.5 percent.'' In other words, \nthere is no real choice. The options for States are to do as the \nFederal Government says or leave Medicaid, which by now is so engrained \nin the care for the indigent that unwinding it, in effect, \ndisentangling it from existing Federal-State relationships, would be \nvirtually impossible and would obviously jeopardize care for the \npopulation without other health coverage. This is coercion, plain and \nsimple. It is unconstitutional.\n\n  Second, ObamaCare expands Medicaid eligibility to everyone under 138 \npercent of the Federal poverty level. For individuals who make less \nthan 138 percent of the poverty level, ObamaCare provides no means for \ncomplying with the individual mandate other than enrolling in Medicaid. \nIn their brief to the Supreme Court, the States suing over the Medicaid \nexpansion said it best:\n\n       When Congress mandates that Medicaid-eligible individuals \n     maintain insurance, but provides no alternative means for \n     them to obtain it, it is impossible to label the States' \n     participation in Medicaid voluntary.\n\n  If it is the only way someone can get it, it is not voluntary.\n  Well, ObamaCare, as a whole, cannot survive without these \nunconstitutional provisions, and these are the reasons I believe it \nwill and can be struck down as unconstitutional.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/26/senate-section/article/S2017-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2017-S2018]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MISSILE DEFENSE\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the last subject I would like to comment on \nis an unrelated subject. It has to do with comments the President was \noverheard making in a meeting he was holding with Russian President \nDmitri Medvedev at the Nuclear Security Summit in South Korea. He had a \nhot mike which captured comments he was making privately to President \nMedvedev. He requested a little space, as he put it, in negotiations \nover missile defense issues until after the election when he said he \nwould have more flexibility.\n  Well, obviously, this presents a problem that is going to have to be \ndiscussed with the Congress because if the President is, in effect, \nsaying he would like to make a deal to limit U.S. missile defenses now, \nbut he would be accountable to the American public if they became aware \nof it before his reelection bid, it would be very difficult for him to \nmake the kind of concessions that President Medvedev wants. But if the \nRussian President would just wait until after the next election, then \nthe President will have more flexibility to work with the Russians on \nwhat they want.\n  Well, President Medvedev very helpfully said: I will pass this on to \nVladimir.\n  Here are a few things we know: We know President Obama canceled plans \nto station antiballistic defense systems in Poland and the Czech \nRepublic. We know the President supported language in a new START \ntreaty to link missile defense to nuclear reduction. We know the \nadministration is sharing information with Russia, including plans to \ndeploy missile defenses in Europe. We know the President has \nsignificantly reduced funding for and curtailed development of the U.S. \nnational missile defense system, undermining our ability to effectively \nintercept long-range ballistic missiles, and we know the President has \ndoubled down on efforts to reduce our nuclear arsenal while failing to \nhonor his promises to modernize the aging nuclear weapon complex.\n  What we don't know is what President Obama has in mind for working\n\n[[Page S2018]]\n\nwith the Russians after his reelection when he would--as he put it--\nhave some flexibility in negotiating with them.

Mr. President, as Americans filled up their cars with \ngas this weekend, I am sure a lot of them wondered how much higher gas \nprices could actually go. Well, today the Democratic-controlled Senate \nplans to send these folks a message: If they had their way, gas prices \nwould be even higher.\n  Today Democrats will propose raising taxes on America's energy \nmanufacturers, something common sense and basic economics tell us will \nlead to even higher prices at the pump. This is the Democratic response \nto high gas prices, and, frankly, I cannot think of a better way to \nillustrate how completely and totally out of touch they are on this \nissue. That is why Republicans plan to support moving forward on a \ndebate over the legislation because it is a debate the country \ndeserves.\n  We are going to use this opportunity to explain how out of touch \nDemocrats are on high gas prices and put a spotlight on the commonsense \nideas Republicans have been urging for years--ideas that reflect our \ngenuine commitment to the kind of ``all of the above'' approach the \nPresident claims to support but actually doesn't.\n  Look, this isn't terribly complicated. Americans from Maine to \nCalifornia are frustrated at high gas prices. What do they see in \nWashington? They see Democrats pushing legislation that even they admit \ndoesn't have a thing to do with lowering gas prices. At least seven \nDemocrats are on record saying this bill doesn't do a thing to lower \ngas prices. Last year its own sponsor said nobody has made the claim \nthis is about reducing gas prices--all of which raises an obvious \nquestion: What are we doing it for? How does this help the American \npeople now?\n  Of course it doesn't. In response to record-high gas prices, \nDemocrats in Congress want to raise taxes on the very people who \nproduce it. Meanwhile the President is blocking a pipeline that would \ndecrease our dependence on Middle East oil and create literally \nthousands of American jobs.\n  Americans see the Democratic response to high gas prices to make them \neven worse. That is the Democrats' response to high gas prices, to make \nthem even worse. They are starting to wonder if this might as well be \nthe Democrats' official slogan: Vote for us, and we will make things \nworse. Because whether it is jobs or debt or spending or gas prices, \nthat is the Democratic record, which leads me to health care.\n  Today, as we all know, the Supreme Court began hearing arguments on \nthe President's health care law. Among other things, the Court will \nconsider whether the mandate at the core of this law is constitutional. \nAs one of the many public officials who filed a brief before the Court \nopposing this law, I believe strongly the law is, in fact, \nunconstitutional, and I hope the Court agrees.\n\n  Even if the Court ends up disagreeing with me, the case for repeal \nbecomes increasingly difficult to refute. The President was right to \nseek reform, but the bill he gave us and the Democrats forced through \nCongress on a party-line vote is not working. Instead of lowering \ncosts, it is increasing them. Instead of strengthening Medicare, it \nraided Medicare. Instead of helping States, it has created financial \nburdens they cannot even bear. Instead of lowering insurance premiums, \nit has caused them actually to go up.\n  When it comes to jobs, some have called the law the single biggest \ndetriment to job creation in America right now, and most Americans \nbelieve it is unconstitutional. This law is a mess, an absolute mess, \nand regardless of what the Court decides, it needs to be repealed and \nreplaced with commonsense reforms that actually lower costs and that \nAmericans really want.\n  So we will keep one eye on the Supreme Court this week, and we are \nbasing our opinion on something simpler than the legal arguments we \nwill hear this week. We are looking at whether this law helped or hurt. \nOn that question the verdict is already in, just like so much else this \nPresident has done over the past few years.\n  Look, we need health care reform, but this law has made things worse. \nOn that basis alone it should be repealed and replaced. That is what \nAmericans want, and that is what we plan to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/26/senate-section/article/S2018-3", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2018-S2020]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         OIL MARKET SPECULATION\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, once again, oil prices have spiked to high \nlevels threatening our economic recovery. Prices are now nearing $110 a \nbarrel, up nearly 30 percent since October 2011, only 5 months ago. For \nyears now the commodity markets have taken the American people on an \nexpensive and damaging roller coaster ride with rapidly changing prices \nfor crude oil.\n  In 2007, a barrel of crude oil started out costing $50 a barrel. By \nthe end of the year, the price had nearly doubled. In 2008, oil prices \nshot up in July to nearly $150 a barrel, and then by the end of the \nyear crashed to $35. In the beginning of 2011, oil prices took off \nagain, climbing to over $110 per barrel in May. Then they began \nfalling. In October oil traded at $75 per barrel, a drop of more than \n30 percent over 4 months.\n  Now 5 months later oil prices are back up to nearly $110 a barrel. \nThis unpredictable and incessant price volatility is burdening American \nconsumers and businesses with both uncertainty and expense.\n  Some in the media are blaming recent events in the Middle East for \nthe latest oil price spikes, but Middle East instability cannot explain \nthese large gyrations. We have seen uncertainty, unrest, and armed \nconflict in that region for more than 50 years without seeing this same \npattern of extreme price volatility in oil prices. That volatility has \nbecome a feature of U.S. oil markets over the last 7 years.\n  There is something else at work behind the spikes and sudden drops in \nthe price of oil and other commodities in recent years, and we have \nstrong evidence showing what it is. It is the increasing role of market \nspeculators betting on price swings.\n  For years now the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I \nchair, has been digging into the problem of excessive speculation in \nthe commodity markets. Since 2002, the subcommittee has conducted a \nseries of investigations into commodities pricing, in particular \nfocusing on how speculators have changed the game. Our investigations \nhave used specific case histories involving oil, natural gas, and wheat \nprices to show how excessive speculation in the futures and swaps \nmarkets have distorted prices, overwhelmed normal supply-and-demand \nfactors, and pushed up prices at the expense of consumers and American \nbusinesses.\n  For example, in 2006 the subcommittee released a report that found \nthat billions of dollars of commodity index trading by speculators in \nthe crude oil market had helped push up futures prices in 2006, causing \na corresponding increase in cash prices and was responsible for an \nestimated $20 out of the then $70 cost for a barrel of oil. Since then \neven more speculators have entered the commodities markets. Today we \nhave commodity index traders, exchange-traded products, even mutual \nfunds betting billions of dollars on crude oil prices on a daily basis.\n  Speculators have now come to dominate our futures and swaps markets, \noverwhelming the commercial users and producers who use and need these \nmarkets to set fair prices and hedge risks.\n  At a November hearing before my subcommittee, the Chairman of the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission, Gary Gensler, testified that over \n80 percent of the outstanding futures\n\n[[Page S2019]]\n\ncontracts for crude oil are now held by speculators. That fact is new, \nit is significant, and we cannot ignore it.\n  It used to be that prices were determined primarily by fundamental \nmarket forces of supply and demand for physical commodities. When \ncommodities were tight and demand high, prices generally went up. In \ncontrast, when supplies were ample and demand low, prices generally \nwent down. Nowadays that relationship is largely absent.\n  Here are some startling facts from recent press and government \nreports that show how U.S. crude oil prices today have become \ndisconnected to supply and demand. First is the fact that the United \nStates has ample oil supplies in the neighborhood of 350 million \nbarrels in storage, which is toward the higher range since 2008. World \nsupplies are also adequate with the Saudi Arabian oil minister recently \nstating that world supplies are stronger today than they were 4 years \nago in 2008.\n  In addition, the United States is producing more domestic oil than it \nhas in years. In 2010, U.S. domestic crude oil production increased to \n5.5 million barrels per day, up from 5.1 million barrels in 2007, and \nis still climbing. In 2011, overall U.S. refining capacity also \nincreased. Perhaps most surprising of all in 2011, for the first time \nsince 1949, the United States exported more gasoline, diesel, and other \npetroleum products than it imported. The United States is projected to \ndo the same in 2012 and 2013. At the same time U.S. oil supplies stayed \nsteady and production increased, U.S. demand went down. In 2011, U.S. \nfuel consumption actually sank and oil demand in North America \ncontracted by 0.5 percent. Some of that drop was due to lower economic \nactivity, some to greater energy efficiencies, and some to higher \nenergy costs.\n\n  For example, U.S. demand for gasoline sank nearly 3 percent last \nyear. More broadly, in 2011, total U.S. demand for all types of oil \nproducts fell to 18.8 million barrels a day, from 20.8 million barrels \na day in 2005. That is a drop of 10 percent. The end result is that \nover the last year oil demand was down and supply was up in the United \nStates. Under normal economic conditions, both factors should have led \nto lower oil prices. Instead, despite steady or improving oil supplies \nand steady or dropping demand, U.S. crude oil prices became more like a \nroller coaster than ever.\n  What explains the price volatility and escalation? The answer is \npretty clear to me after 10 years of investigations by our \nsubcommittee: It is the large amount of speculation in oil markets \nwhich is a major contributing factor to high prices. Speculators who \nnow comprise more than 80 percent of the U.S. futures oil market are \nbidding on contracts, speculating on price swings, and helping to drive \nup price volatility and crude oil prices. Higher crude oil prices \ntranslate directly into higher gasoline prices. According to a February \n27, 2012 article in Forbes magazine citing a recent report by Goldman \nSachs, oil speculation ``translates out into a premium for gasoline at \nthe pump of 56 cents a gallon.'' In other words, speculation is adding \n56 cents to the price of each gallon of gas bought at the pump.\n  Here is a Reuters chart that uses CFTC data. It focuses on the crude \noil holdings of speculators, the group of traders that the CFTC refers \nto as ``managed money'' and which includes commodity index funds, hedge \nfunds, commodity pool operators, and commodity trading advisers. The \nchart uses CFTC data to track the ratio of their long to short crude \noil futures holdings over time. Last month, there was a spike, way over \nhere to the right. Speculators held more longs than shorts by a 12-to-1 \nratio, the largest recorded difference in 5 years. That same week, U.S. \ncrude prices hit a 9-month high of $110. And it is no surprise that \nwhen more than 80 percent of the market suddenly bets 12 to 1 on prices \ngoing up, oil prices do just this.\n  As we can see from this chart, these spikes occurred in the last year \nor two. Before that, we did not have the spikes. Before this, there was \nthis huge amount of speculation in the oil futures market and we did \nnot have these large spikes which we have had in the last few years.\n  The reality is that oil prices again are not just affected by \nphysical supply and demand but by speculative pressures on prices. That \nmeans if we are to get a handle on oil prices, excessive speculation \nmust be curbed. There is a lot we can do to combat excessive \nspeculation, and I will spell out some of these steps.\n  Congress has already taken the first steps. In July 2010, Congress \nenacted the Dodd-Frank Act which, in Section 737, directed the CFTC to \nestablish speculative position limits on energy and other previously \nexempted commodities, and broadened CFTC authority to apply those \nlimits to all types of commodity-related instruments, including \nfutures, options, and swaps. The Dodd-Frank Act also required all large \ncommodity traders to begin reporting their trades in real time to a \ncentral repository, increasing transparency, producing new detailed \ntrading data, and strengthening regulatory oversight.\n  In November 2011, in compliance with the Dodd-Frank requirements, the \nCFTC issued a new position limits rule. The rule sets limits that are \nnot as tough as they should be, but the real problem is that they are \nnot yet fully in force. That means this important new tool to clamp \ndown on excessive speculation lies dormant.\n  One big roadblock is that, within a month of the rule's issuance, the \nfinancial industry filed a lawsuit to stop it from taking effect. The \nlawsuit claims Dodd-Frank didn't require the CFTC to impose position \nlimits, although those of us in the Senate who fought for the law know \nposition limits were made mandatory by Dodd-Frank and were regarded as \nvital to curbing excessive speculation. The court is considering the \ncase now and hopefully will not allow the lawsuit to delay or thwart \nthe legal protections needed to stop American families and businesses \nfrom being whipsawed by excessive speculation in oil and other \ncommodities.\n  In the meantime, what should Congress do? First, we should stop \npretending that $110 per barrel of oil is caused solely by Mideast \nunrest or physical supply and demand factors, and acknowledge a major \ncontributing role played by speculators in crude oil prices. Second, we \nought to urge the CFTC to find that current U.S. oil prices, which do \nnot reflect physical supply and demand factors, are evidence of a \nsevere market disturbance. That finding would allow the CFTC to \nexercise its emergency authority, without waiting any longer, to clamp \ndown on excessive speculation in the oil markets. Among other options, \nthe CFTC could tighten position limits for oil traders, make those \nlimits immediately effective in the futures, options, and swap markets, \nstrengthen margin requirements, and take other actions needed to bring \noil prices back into alignment with supply and demand.\n  Third, on a longer term basis, we should revamp the rules that enable \ncommodity index traders, exchange traded products, and mutual funds to \nflood U.S. commodity markets with speculative bets on commodities to \nthe detriment of American families and businesses. Legislation is \nneeded to require the SEC and CFTC to impose joint registration and \nreporting obligations for traders that use securities to gain exposure \nin commodities, joint regulation of hybrid products that combine \nsecurities and commodities trading, and increased margin and capital \nrequirements for risky speculative bets. The Internal Revenue Service \nneeds to stop allowing mutual funds to use phony offshore corporations \nto circumvent a longstanding 10 percent limit on their commodity \ninvestments. Additional restrictions on commodity index trading should \nalso be considered, since it is the largest root cause of modern day \nexcessive speculation.\n  Finally, we should ask more of the President's task force on \ncommodity speculation. In March 2011, a year ago, Senator Jack Reed and \nI sent a letter asking President Obama to convene a task force to \ninvestigate and combat excessive speculation and manipulation of oil \nprices. While the Attorney General did convene a task force, it has \nconcentrated principally on detecting a few cases of alleged criminal \nactivity, instead of tackling the broader issue of excessive \nspeculation cases in which no one is committing a crime, but aggregate \ncommodity trading tactics are driving up prices and price volatility to \nthe point where they damage the U.S.\n\n[[Page S2020]]\n\neconomy. The task force needs to urgently refocus and bring its \nfirepower to the battle to stop excessive speculation.\n  In closing, until we limit excessive speculation in commodity \nmarkets, the American economy will continue to be vulnerable to violent \nprice swings and American consumers and businesses will continue to be \nwhipsawed by oil prices unconnected to actual supply and demand. \nAmerican families cannot afford the current price of oil and gas and \nneither can our economy, which, after 4 years, is beginning to turn a \ncorner toward real growth. Today's prices--$110 for a barrel of oil and \n$4 for a gallon of gasoline--are a clarion call to action that Congress \nand the CFTC ignore at the Nation's peril.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Indiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/26/senate-section/article/S2020-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2020-S2023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, this past Friday marked the 2-year \nanniversary of when the president's health care law, the affordable \ncare act, otherwise known as ObamaCare, was signed in to law. I wasn't \nin the Senate at the time; I was actually in the State of Indiana \ncampaigning to be in the Senate as a representative of that State. As \nsuch, I had spent a considerable amount of time crisscrossing the State \nand talking to Hoosiers about the health care plan. From diners and \nrestaurants all across Indiana to small businesses, large businesses, \nmedium-size businesses, big industrial giants, small mom-and-pop \noperations, medical providers, and ordinary citizens, we in Indiana \njoin the nearly two-thirds--or perhaps even more than two-thirds--of \nthe country that oppose this law.\n  Hoosiers didn't then, and they don't now, want to have a one-size-\nfits-all nationalized health care system. They want a healthier health \ncare system. They want reforms to the current problems and excessive \nrising costs of health care. This is the first of many attempts I will \nmake to discuss why we need to address this law, which is moving toward \never and ever greater implementation and particularly kicks in over the \nnext two years. Hoosiers, as I said, did not want the plan then and \nthey don't want it now. They don't want to have Federal bureaucrats \nmaking their health care decisions for them. They want less government \nintervention and higher quality of care, and they don't want a health \ncare system that increases costs and premiums while hurting job \ncreators with fines and penalties. They want affordable care and good \njob opportunities.\n  Two years after passage of that act, I continue to hear these \nmessages from the people of Indiana and from others as we discover more \nand more information about what is contained in this massive 2,700-page \nbill that was passed in early 2010. I wish to discuss a few of the \nimpacts of the ObamaCare law today. The first is the individual \nmandate, and of course that is one of the issues the Supreme Court is \nhearing right now and will be making a determination on.\n  ObamaCare is the biggest example of government intrusion in the \neveryday lives of Americans, whether by forcing individuals to buy \nhealth insurance, enacting onerous regulations on small businesses, or \nby raising taxes and imposing penalties. The health care law forces \nevery American to purchase a health insurance plan or, if they choose \nnot to do so, to pay the government a fine. This is unprecedented in \nAmerican history. It is the first time the Federal Government is \nforcing citizens to purchase a product or a service they may or may not \nwant or pay a fine for their decision to say no.\n  This administration basically is saying to Americans: We know what is \nbetter for you than you know for yourself. We know what is better for \nyou than what your doctor suggests is needed, and if you don't get a \ngovernment-approved health care plan, we are going to assess you a \nfine.\n  That is a basic, fundamental principle of constitutional law and the \nSupreme Court will be making that determination. But I suggest that \nthis Congress needs to continue to debate this and be prepared to act \ndepending on what the Supreme Court decision is, which will come down \nseveral months from now.\n  The second thing I wish to talk about briefly is the higher costs \nthat emanate from this particular piece of legislation. In addition to \nmandating that all Americans have health insurance, ObamaCare hits \nindividuals and families with increased costs at higher premiums. The \nNation's nonpartisan budget experts at the Congressional Budget Office \nestimate that when fully implemented, this law will increase insurance \npremiums on a family policy by an average of $2,100 a year. Therefore, \nthe affordable care act is hardly affordable and increases the already \nhigh premiums people have to pay for insurance.\n  The President's own Chief Actuary at the Center for Medicare Services \nreported that the law will increase national health care costs by $311 \nbillion in the first 10 years alone--increase is the key word here. The \ngoal of reforming the Nation's health care system initially was to \nreduce the skyrocketing costs for Americans, not increase them. Yet, we \nare now being told by the experts and the President's own people that \nObamacare will increase costs.\n  I also wish to speak about the impact of this law on businesses. I \ntalked to dozens if not hundreds of businesses across the State of \nIndiana, both in the campaign year of 2010 and then last year traveling \nas a Senator throughout the State. The President's health care \nprescription results in bad side effects for American businesses by \nhitting job creators with new taxes and new regulations that they \ndesperately don't need at this point in our struggle to regain economic \ngrowth. Take the employer mandate. The law penalizes businesses that do \nnot provide employees with government-approved health care plans. \nBeginning in 2014, American businesses with more than 50 employees will \nbe fined $2,000 per employee if they do not offer a health insurance \nplan approved by the Federal Government.\n  I have talked to a number of business people who have gone through \npainful negotiations with their workers and with their laborers and \nwith staff. They have put together a health care plan that is accepted \nby both management and by employees who recognize that if they cannot \nmaintain some semblance of control over costs, the jobs might not be \navailable in the future because the company cannot afford to keep \npeople at work. So in recognition of all of this negotiation that goes \non and the contractual obligations that both sides work to achieve, \nunderstanding that if the business is hit with too much tax and too \nmany regulations the business may not survive, those plans now come \nunder the scrutiny of the Federal Government, and the Federal \nGovernment will determine whether those plans are sufficient and \nadequate. If it determines they are not, then a fine is levied against \nthe business.\n  I cannot tell my colleagues how many business people told me: Look, I \nwould rather pay the fine than have the government impose all of these \nnew regulations on us when we are working carefully with each employee \nto make sure they have their basic insurance needs covered. Yet, if we \nare forced into a set plan of set procedures for every employee, then I \nhave two choices, the business people say: I can either refuse to do so \nand pay the penalty of about $2,000 per employee, or I can let people \ngo. The bottom line is, if I can't make my bottom line, I cannot keep \nthese people employed.\n  The arbitrarily fixed basis that small businesses under 50 employees \nwill not be subject to this leaves manufacturers and business people \nwho are slightly below that level--say at 45 or 40 or 35--a dilemma as \nthey are seeking to expand their business. ``As soon as I hire No. 50, \nthen my business is no longer exempt. So what do I do? I freeze out \nhiring more people and look to double up people's salaries or put \npeople on overtime.'' At a time when we have over 12 million people \nlooking for a job and millions of people underworked or working two and \nthree part-time jobs to make ends meet, we are imposing this law on \nthem. It could not have come at a worse time.\n  Then there is a medical device tax and several other taxes that are \nincluded in this bill that we continue to find as we read the fine \nprint.\n  Indiana is a State that is home to a lot of medical device \nmanufacturers. In\n\n[[Page S2021]]\n\nfact, there are over 300 registered medical device manufacturers that \nemploy 20,000 Hoosiers in the State of Indiana and another 28,000 \npeople who benefit from that employment. There are more than 400,000 \nworkers employed nationwide by this industry.\n  So what did the ObamaCare plan propose? Well, we need some pay-fors. \nTo pay for the law, the administration decided to impose a 2.3 percent \ntax on these medical device manufacturers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I sense I am approaching a deadline in \ntime. I am wondering if I could, with the consent of my colleague, ask \nunanimous consent for 5 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  These medical device manufacturers are employing people at an average \nrate of about 41 percent greater than the average worker rate of pay in \nmy State, so these are desired jobs. But, again, employers and \nmanufacturers of medical devices are telling me they are being forced \nto go overseas because of the burden of regulation and a tax that has \nnothing to do with the essential program of the health care plan.\n  That is not the only tax that is imposed in this law. There are many \nhidden taxes here that we are just learning about. Let me name five: \nthe excise tax on charitable hospitals; the drug industry tax, separate \nfrom medical devices; the health insurance industry tax; the insurer \nexcise tax; and a Blue Cross-Blue Shield tax hike.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation found that the health care law \nimposes more than $550 billion in new taxes and penalties, most of \nwhich will fall on the middle class.\n  Third, the impact on the State of Indiana.\n  ObamaCare forces States to expand Medicaid rolls so significantly \nthat it will be imposed--and this has been talked about earlier today--\nupon the States in a way that can cripple their ability to try to find \nsome balance in their budgets. In Indiana, where our budget is in far \nbetter shape than many other States, we still cannot afford the current \nMedicaid Program, let alone the projected new costs that will be \nrequired under the ObamaCare law.\n  An outside group has estimated that $3.1 billion in new costs over \nthe next decade will be imposed on Indiana taxpayers if the 1.5 \neligible Hoosiers enroll in Medicaid as a result of this health care \nlaw. This added expense does not include any payment relief to \nproviders and, therefore, shifts costs to patients by driving up \npremiums for all Hoosiers.\n  In conclusion, we have to ask the question: What is the remedy for \nthis fatal disease called ObamaCare? Well, the remedy may lie with the \nSupreme Court. They are hearing arguments on this today, and will for \nthe next 2 days, and we will have a decision on the constitutionality \nof this law by the summer. But the health care debate also, most \nlikely, will end up back here in Congress one way or another, and that \nleaves us the responsibility of addressing this.\n  From forcing individuals to purchase insurance, to taxing successful \njob creators and burdening State budgets, I believe the health care law \nis so deeply flawed that it must be scratched and replaced with real \nreform, reform that lowers the cost of care, allows the doctor--your \ndoctor, not the government--to decide the kind of medical care you \nneed, and provides flexibility to States.\n  Real health care reform lowers costs, it improves access to quality \ncare, empowers individuals, and preserves personal liberties; and that \nis not what we have in the law that currently is on the books. So \nwhether through congressional legislation or court action, ObamaCare \nneeds to be overturned and replaced with commonsense provisions that \nput patients--not government, not bureaucrats--in charge of health care \ndecisions.\n  ObamaCare has proven to be the wrong prescription, and it is time for \na new treatment. Americans want reform that remedies our ailing health \ncare system, not one that weakens it and drives it deeper and drives us \ndeeper as a Nation into debt.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, since this is the 2-year anniversary of \nthe passage of the health care reform law, the affordable care act, and \nsince the Supreme Court, of course, is meeting across the street \nhearing various arguments attacking the legislation--they heard \narguments this morning; they are going to hear arguments again tomorrow \nmorning; and they are going to hear arguments again Wednesday morning--\nI believe it is a crucial time to remind all Americans why this law was \nneeded, why it still is needed, and how it will benefit families across \nthis country.\n  In my view, there is considerable confusion about what the health \ncare reform legislation will accomplish. And I am not surprised. The \nopponents of the legislation have worked hard in the last couple of \nyears trying to confuse many Americans into thinking the bill contains \nall kinds of nefarious provisions.\n  The Kaiser Family Foundation did a poll, however, that demonstrated \nwhen Americans are asked about the actual provisions that are contained \nin the law, there is strong bipartisan support for those reforms. So I \nwish to take a little time to straighten out what the provisions in the \nlaw are and how I see them impacting on our health care system.\n  Health care reform was needed when it was enacted 2 years ago for two \nimportant reasons. First, before reform--and even today--one in six \nAmericans was uninsured. That number was growing, is still growing. In \nmy home State of New Mexico, the situation was even worse. We had more \nthan one in five people in my State uninsured. That is the second \nhighest rate of any State in the Nation. The large majority of the \nuninsured are working people. They have low incomes. They cannot afford \nto pay the very high cost of health insurance.\n  The second important reason we enacted health care reform was that \nthe cost of health care was continuing to grow at an unreasonable rate.\n  As you can see on this chart I have in the Chamber--this is based on \ndata from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Office of the \nActuary--they estimate that national health expenditures per capita \nincreased from 5 percent of gross domestic product in 1960 to 18 \npercent in 2010. So absent any intervention, this figure was projected \nto exceed 40 percent by 2080.\n  The affordable care act significantly improves the situation. It does \nnot solve all the problems in our health care system, but it \nsubstantially improves the situation. Due to the affordable care act, \nover the next 10 years, the rate of uninsured will be reduced by more \nthan half. That is according to the Congressional Budget Office \nestimate. Low-income families will be able to afford health insurance, \nso they will not have to worry about going broke because they get sick. \nThe rest of America will not see their insurance premiums rise to \nabsorb the cost of expensive hospital care when the uninsured have \nnowhere else to turn.\n  With full implementation of this law, Americans will get higher \nquality health care while at the same time we begin to rein in the \ngrowing costs of health care. The law does so while protecting key \nparts of the health care system, such as Medicare. It extends the \nsolvency of Medicare from 2017--prior to the enactment of this \nlegislation--to 2024. Despite claims to the contrary, these reforms are \nfiscally responsible. They decrease Federal health care spending by \nwell over $1 trillion over the next two decades.\n\n  Stated simply, the law protects the aspects of our health care system \nthat are working well and fixes many of those aspects that are broken, \nand it does so in a fiscally responsible way. It achieves this through \nprovisions that are intended to support three main goals. Let me go \nthrough those briefly.\n  The first of those goals is to expand coverage and ensure health \ninsurance is affordable. The second of those goals is to improve the \nquality of health care. The third is to begin reining in the rapidly \nrising costs of health care and create efficiencies in our health care \nsystem.\n  Let me start with this coverage expansion under the affordable care \nact. Under the law people who need health care can get health insurance \ncoverage.\n\n[[Page S2022]]\n\nThere is financial assistance to those who cannot afford it. According \nto the Congressional Budget Office's most recent projections, 93 \npercent of Americans will have affordable health insurance coverage by \n2016 with full implementation of this act. That is 30 million more \nAmericans who will be covered who are currently uninsured.\n  Some of these provisions have already taken effect and have had a \nsignificant impact. For example, young adults up to the age of 26 can \nnow receive health insurance coverage under their parents' insurance \nregardless of their marital or school or employment situation. Since \nthe implementation of this provision, 2.5 million uninsured young \npeople across the country have gained health insurance coverage. This \nincludes over 21,000 young people in my home State of New Mexico.\n  In addition, 20,000 seniors in my State who are in the so-called \ncoverage gap for prescription drugs under Medicare are now saving on \ntheir prescription drugs because that so-called doughnut hole is \ndecreasing in size as a result of this legislation. This is already \nbenefiting 3.6 million seniors nationwide.\n  Children with preexisting conditions are no longer able to be \ndiscriminated against, and adults with preexisting conditions who \ncannot get insurance have the option for coverage in a high-risk pool. \nWith full implementation of the law, those adults will be in the same \ncircumstance as children with preexisting conditions in that they will \nnot be able to be discriminated against.\n  What is more, the major coverage provisions are still to come. They \nbegin in 2014. Medicaid will be expanded to cover more low-income \nAmericans, those whose incomes go up to 133 percent of the Federal \npoverty level. This is a critical provision since experts tell us the \nexpansion of Medicaid coverage is the most cost-effective way to \nprovide insurance to low-income uninsured individuals and families.\n  Seventeen percent of the nonelderly population nationwide benefit \nfrom the Medicaid expansion and the tax credits in this legislation. In \nNew Mexico, as well as the States of Texas and Louisiana and \nCalifornia, which have high rates of uninsured, the estimate is that 36 \npercent to 40 percent of residents could benefit.\n  Lower and middle-class income families will be eligible for health \ninsurance tax credits to help purchase health insurance. While most \nAmericans will still get health insurance through their employers, \nthose who do not can purchase health insurance through the health \ninsurance exchanges. These will be virtual insurance shopping malls in \neach State that will offer an easy-to-understand menu of options with \nwhich to compare insurance plans. So we will have informed and \nempowered consumers who can choose the plan that is right for them and \ntheir family. The intent of the health insurance exchange is to level \nthe playing field, increase competition among insurers, and thereby \nkeep rates competitive.\n  Contrary to much of the rhetoric we have heard, States will not \nshoulder the fiscal burden of this coverage expansion. Limiting costs \nto States was a priority when we drafted this health care reform \nlegislation. In fact, the Federal Government commits to assume 100 \npercent of the cost of the Medicaid expansion for newly eligible \nindividuals during the first 3 years, beginning in 2014. Federal \ncontributions are going to phase down after that slightly over the \nfollowing years, so that by 2020 the Federal Government will be \nresponsible for 90 percent of the cost of those newly covered \nindividuals.\n  For example, my State of New Mexico is expected to receive $4.5 \nbillion in 2014, 2015, and 2016, as we expand coverage to more \nenrollees. This will allow access to Medicaid for about 180,000 newly \neligible New Mexicans.\n  Let me refer to this chart that is beside me. This shows the \nCongressional Budget Office's estimate of the expansion impact on State \nspending on Medicaid. As we can see, contrary to a lot of the \nstatements that are made on the Senate floor and elsewhere, this \nincrease is less than 3 percent. This is additional spending on \nexpansion. It is a small fraction, 2.8 percent, of State Medicaid \nspending. This is for the period 2014 through 2022.\n  While reform expands Medicaid, it also makes it possible for some \ncurrent Medicaid enrollees to become eligible to participate in the \nhealth insurance exchanges and brings them into the private market. \nAccording to the Urban Institute analysis, the net effect of enactment \nof the affordable care act on State budgets, in the worst case \nscenario, will see States realizing net budgetary savings of at least \n$40 billion during the period 2014 to 2019. It is possible those gains \ncould be as high as $131 billion.\n  With respect to affordability--and I know my colleague who was just \non the floor was talking about affordability--the impact on New Mexico \nfamilies is a good example. On average, families in my State will see a \ndecrease in insurance premiums, perhaps as much as 60 percent. In \naddition, two-thirds of New Mexicans could potentially qualify for \nsubsidies or Medicaid, and nearly one-quarter could qualify for near \nfull subsidies or Medicaid.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I see a colleague who wishes to speak. Therefore, I \nwill ask unanimous consent that the balance of my statement be printed \nin the Record as if read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Does the Senator wish to continue?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, my colleague has said I could proceed \nfor a few more minutes. Let me just----\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of the remarks of the Senator from New Mexico, I be \nrecognized for up to 25 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank my colleague from Oklahoma for his courtesy. \nLet me talk a little about the second and the third goals I outlined \nearlier.\n  The second goal of the affordable care act is to improve the quality \nof care. There is not a lot of discussion about that, but that is a \nmain thrust of this legislation. A strong, well-trained health care \nworkforce is essential if we are going to have quality health care in \nthis country.\n  Many provisions of the bill will strengthen the health care \nworkforce. One obvious question is, What is the need we are trying to \naddress? Let me point out that 25 percent of the counties in the United \nStates are designated as health care professional shortage areas. In my \nState, 32 of the 33 counties are designated as health care professional \nshortage areas. We are absolutely last. New Mexico is absolutely last \nin all States with regard to both access to health care and the \nutilization of preventive medicine.\n  The affordable care act contains key provisions to improve access and \ndelivery of health care services to these areas. We train a great many \nadditional physicians, nurses, pediatric specialists, and other health \ncare providers. There is a major push to improve the quality of care by \nfocusing on outcomes and effectiveness of medical treatments. All this \nis very positive and should have been done many years ago in this \ncountry. I am glad we are finally doing it as part of this health care \nreform legislation.\n  The third and final goal of the legislation, as I mentioned earlier, \nis to begin to rein in costs and eliminate waste and inefficiency. \nExperts agree there is a tremendous amount of waste and inefficiency in \nour health care system. Anyone who has gone to a hospital can see that. \nEstimates indicate that as much as one-third of medical care does not, \nin fact, improve anyone's health. I think this bears repeating. A full \none-third of all dollars spent on health care in this country does not \ncontribute to the overall health of the population.\n  We are trying to deal with that in a variety of ways in this \nlegislation, to get more cost-effective treatment and to get more \nefficiency in our health care system.\n  The law provides for savings by stopping investments in so-called \nCadillac insurance plans. Second, there is new transparency and \naccountability for insurers to justify premium increases. Third, the \nlaw requires that insurers spend at least 80 percent of the premiums \nthey collect on actually providing medical care rather than on CEO \nsalaries and shareholder profits and administrative costs. Fourth, the\n\n[[Page S2023]]\n\naffordable care act increases competition and price transparency \nthrough these health insurance exchanges we established. Fifth, the law \nestablishes an independent body to recommend policies to Congress to \nhelp Medicare lower costs while providing better care. I can go into \nquite a discussion of the advisory board we established to try to \ncontrol growth in the cost of Medicare. I think it is a very \nmeritorious provision and one about which a great deal of bad \ninformation has been provided.\n  In conclusion, the facts demonstrate clearly to me that these reforms \nwill move us forward toward more affordable health care, with greater \nchoice for American families. We will see less waste. We will see less \ninefficiency in our health care system. We will see higher quality of \ncare. We will start to bring rising health care costs under control.\n  These are worthy goals. They are the goals of this health care reform \nlegislation. I look forward to seeing them achieved in the coming \nmonths and years.\n  Again, I thank my colleague for his courtesy in allowing me to \ncontinue longer than was planned.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/26/senate-section/article/S2023-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2023-S2025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 ENERGY\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we are going to have a vote this \nafternoon. It is going to be a procedural vote. Some will be voting \ndifferent ways. There is a substance behind the issue at large.\n  Last week, President Obama visited Cushing, OK. It may have been the \nfirst time he has ever been to Oklahoma. I do not know. He claimed that \nunder his watch, he said, ``America is producing more oil today than at \nany time in the last 8 years.'' It seems that in the midst of $4- to \n$5-a-gallon gasoline, he is trying to convince the American people he \nis not one to blame. Clearly, he is the one to blame.\n  That is why I think it is important to set the record straight. After \nall, it was Obama's Energy Secretary Steven Chu--we cannot forget \nthis--who said: ``Somehow we have to figure out how to boost the price \nof gasoline to the levels in Europe.'' That was his Energy Secretary \nwho was speaking on behalf of President Obama.\n  So the motive is to raise the price of gas. Right now, we are almost \nover halfway there. We all remember the President's statement during \nthe 2008 campaign when he said: ``Under my plan, electric rates will \nnecessarily skyrocket.'' His policy agenda has been in lockstep with \nthis goal.\n\n  President Obama has had a 4-year war on fossil fuels, and now we are \npaying for that at the pump. As to the oil and gas taxes, nowhere has \nthe President been more resolute in stopping oil and gas development \nthan in his tax proposals, every budget since he was sworn in. Now we \nare talking about four budgets this President has presided over. Keep \nin mind, when a budget is designed by a President, whether he is a \nDemocrat or Republican, it is the President, not the Democrats, not the \nRepublicans, not the House, not the Senate, it is the President who is \nresponsible for that budget.\n  In every budget the President has called for the elimination of all \ntax provisions made available to the oil and gas industry. This year \nthese tax increases totaled about $40 billion over 10 years. So while \nthe President was going around the country last week trying to convince \neveryone he is actually pro oil and gas, he laid the groundwork for \nSenator Menendez to push a bill through the Senate to raise taxes on \nthe industry.\n  Senator Menendez's bill, S. 2204, proposes to either modify or \noutright cancel the following tax provisions for major integrated oil \nand gas firms. First, the section 199 manufacturer's tax deduction; \nsecondly, intangible drilling costs, sometimes referred to as IDC; \nthird, the percentage depletion; and, four, the foreign tax credit for \noil and gas firms.\n  Last time we actually had a vote in the Senate on these provisions \nwas in June of 2010. I remember it very well because that was when the \ndistinguished Senator from Vermont Mr. Sanders offered an amendment \nthat would have raised taxes on oil and gas producers by $35 billion \nover 10 years by repealing section 199--same thing he is trying to do--\npercentage depletion and IDC.\n  While the Menendez bill is a little different, it applies to the \nlarger companies, those with substantial production levels. It is \nimportant to point out that the Sanders amendment--and I led the \nopposition to the Sanders amendment--was defeated almost 2 to 1, 35 to \n61.\n  The President insists these tax and accounting provisions are \nactually subsidies, but nothing can be further from the truth. This has \nnot been done yet, to my knowledge--been explained. It is so important \npeople understand what these provisions are.\n  Section 199 is the manufacturer's tax deduction. Section 199 was \nadded to the Tax Code as a part of President Bush's 2004 tax law. It \nwas designed to support domestic manufacturing, and it did this by \nproviding a 9-percent tax deduction for manufacturers, effectively \nlowering their tax rates from 35 to 32 percent.\n  The provision was phased in between 2005 and 2010. But, in 2008, \nsomething strange happened. The oil and gas industry was singled out so \nit could only claim a portion of that deduction. In other words, all \nother manufacturers of all other goods in America could claim that \ndeduction, except oil and gas.\n  The Menendez proposal would repeal section 199 from major integrated \noil companies. In the President's budget, a similar proposal was scored \nat $11.6 billion. I am going to add all these in a minute and let \neveryone know why we are paying so much at the pump. What is most \ninteresting to me about the section 199 tax deduction is that it is \navailable to any company in the United States that creates any kind of \nmanufactured goods here at home.\n  Firms that build and sell refinery equipment, airplanes, washing \nmachines can all claim the deduction. It may be surprising, however, \nthat the deduction is also available for movie producers--not oil and \ngas producers but movie producers. That is right. The American film \nindustry can claim a deduction for making movies. So President Obama \nand Senator Menendez are putting their Hollywood friends and movie \nstars ahead of an industry that makes us less reliant upon oil imports \nfrom the Middle East. There is no surprise there.\n  The next thing is--that was section 199. That is a manufacturer's \ndeduction, applies to all, and benefits all manufacturers to encourage \ndomestic manufacturing.\n  The second thing is intangible drilling costs, IDC. This is a little \nbit more complicated. But the intangible drilling costs are expenses \noil and gas firms incur when they drill and prepare new wells. These \ncosts often total between 60 and 80 percent of a well's cost. They are \ngenerally not recoverable and include things such as site preparation, \nlabor, design.\n  Intangible drilling costs are firmly grounded in sound accounting \nprinciples. Every basic accounting course discusses the principles of \ncost recovery. It is safe that businesses should be allowed to write \noff their expenses from the revenue they earn to account for the cost \nof doing business. That is logical. No one is going to disagree with \nthat.\n  When purchasing substantial capital equipment, depreciation is often \nused to recover the costs of an investment over its useful life. But \nthings such as wages are nearly always deducted immediately because \nonce a company has paid an employee for work, it has no lasting value. \nTo retain the value, they have to keep paying the employee. Hence, it \nis an immediate expense, and it is deducted from the revenue when \ndetermining the net profit.\n  The IDC deduction has been on the books since 1913. This is not \nanything new. We have lived with it for almost a century.\n  Most of the costs associated with the preparation of new wells should \nbe classified as an immediate expense--things such as labor. The \nexpenses of IDCs make sense. To claim it is a subsidy is totally \ndishonest. Every company, regardless of whether it is an oil or gas \nfirm or any other company, is allowed to recover costs associated with \ntheir investments in business operations. If this is going to be \nlabeled a subsidy for the entire economy, then we have big problems.\n  Current law allows most oil and gas firms to write off these expenses \nas an\n\n[[Page S2024]]\n\nalternative to capitalizing their costs into the total value of the \nasset being developed and then depreciated. But at some point along the \nway, the law was changed so that major integrated oil firms are \nrequired to capitalize 30 percent of their IDCs and amortize them over \na 60-month period.\n  The Menendez bill would eliminate this option and require oil and gas \nfirms to capitalize all of their IDCs. A similar proposal was in the \nPresident's budget scored as a $13.9 billion tax increase. We are going \nto add that up in a minute. Together with the repeal of section 199, an \nIDC should compromise 10 percent of America's oil and gas production \ncapacity by 2017. This translates into a potential loss of 59,000 jobs, \n600,000 barrels of oil a day in domestic production, and the loss of \n$15 billion in capital expenditures in 2012, and potentially $130 \nbillion over the next 10 years.\n  Percentage depletion is very similar. It has been with us. Since \n1926, small producers and millions of royalty owners have had the \noption to utilize percentage depletion to both simplify their tax \nfiling and to account for the decline in the value of the minerals \nproduced from their properties. Current law allows small producers to \ntake a 15 percent deduction from the gross income from a given \nproducing property in lieu of a complicated depreciation deduction. \nThis tax provision is particularly important for the production of \nAmerica's nearly 700,000 low-value, marginal wells, making it essential \nto Oklahoma.\n  Even though the small marginal wells only produce about two barrels a \nday, they account for 28 percent of the total production. We are one of \nthe, if not the, largest marginal States out there. These are truly the \nlittle guys, and the President wants to go after them and destroy the \nincentives that keep the older wells producing by repealing percentage \ndepletion. If he were able to do this, it would increase taxes on the \nindustry by $11.5 billion.\n  What is most interesting about the Menendez proposal is that it only \napplies to major integrated oil companies, which are not even allowed \nto claim percentage depletion, proving that 2204 is nothing more than \npolitical theater.\n  As to the modification of the foreign tax credit for dual capacity \ntaxpayers, the United States is one of the only developed--I think it \nis the only developed country in the world that has a global corporate \ntax system. This means the IRS and Uncle Sam reach all over the world \nto tax profits made by U.S. companies outside of our borders.\n  When we combine this with our 35-percent corporate tax rate, which is \none of the largest and highest on Earth, our corporate tax policies are \nthe worst in the world.\n  The global corporate tax system works like this: When a U.S. firm is \noperating overseas, they pay taxes on those profits in the country in \nwhich they are operating. For example, a U.S. company makes a product \nin South Korea, sells it to the South Koreans, and they make a $1 \nmillion profit. Because their corporate rate is 22 percent, as opposed \nto ours at 35 percent, the firm pays $220,000 in taxes. That makes \nsense.\n  If a U.S. firm has made the same product and profit in the United \nStates, it would be subjected to a 35-percent tax, which would be \n$350,000 in corporate taxes. This also makes sense except it is too \nhigh. However, because of our global corporate tax system, if a firm \ndoes this same thing in Korea, they have to pay the differential \nbetween 22 percent and 35 percent when they bring the money back into \nthe United States.\n  Wait, we want to bring the money back. We want to stimulate our \neconomy. Why would they have a disincentive to bring that money to \ninvest in America? In this example, a U.S. firm would have to pay an \nadditional $130,000. They would be doing a great thing for foreign \ncountries but certainly not for us. It doesn't make any sense at all.\n  Senator Menendez's bill makes this awful policy even worse by \nlimiting the ability of major integrated oil firms to account for the \ntaxes they pay in other countries when they calculate what they owe the \nUnited States.\n  The President made a similar proposal in his budget this year, and if \nenacted it would raise taxes by about $10 billion over 10 years. You \nwould pay for more of this at the pump. Instead of making the corporate \ntax system even less competitive than it is today, we should aim to \ncompletely reform it so we move to a territorial system that doesn't \nreach outside our borders to collect more taxes.\n  Those are the major provisions of the Menendez-Obama bill. If they \nwere enacted to the extent proposed by President Obama's budget, they \nwould be a tax hike of $47.1 billion.\n  Again, that relates to the cost of gas at the pump. The President \nclaims he is doing this in the name of forcing the oil and gas industry \nto pay its fair share. He claims it would not harm domestic oil \nproduction. But this claim rejects the well-known process companies \nfollow when making investment decisions. Successful oil and gas \ncompanies, like those in all industries, are faced with seemingly \nendless opportunities. To sort through the opportunities they have to \nhave a way to rationally decide which projects are in the best interest \nof their investors and which are not. Most companies do this by \ndetermining which investments will give the highest rate of return \ngiven the risk.\n  Taxes play an incredibly important role in this matter. If taxes \nincrease, then cash flow from the project decreases. Therefore, taxes \nin the United States increase; the competitiveness of domestic projects \ndecreases significantly relative to the opportunities available abroad.\n  When the rubber meets the road, this means the U.S. oil and gas \nfirms--especially the big ones--targeted by the Menendez-Obama bill \nwill be more likely to select international projects than U.S.-based \nprojects, and this is bad for our economy.\n  As to the other ways Obama is killing oil and gas, the taxes aren't \nthe only thing the President is doing. They are significant. I \nmentioned four of them that are significant. But look at the Keystone \nPipeline.\n  I just got back from Oklahoma, a visit there. It is another example \nof why he was in Cushing, OK, the central part of Oklahoma. For those \nwho are not familiar with it, that is sort of the intersection of all \nof the pipelines. He said he was going to expedite the permitting of \nthe southern leg of Keystone. That would be the leg going from Cushing, \nOK, down to the Houston area. What he didn't say is that this is the \npart he doesn't have any control over.\n\n  In other words, he has no control over the southern half. The reason \nhe does over the northern half is because that crosses a country \nboundary from Canada to the United States. But he doesn't have a say in \nthis. He could not stop it if he wanted to. Obviously, he would want to \nbecause he has demonstrated that. Moreover, his action to block the \nnorthern leg is preventing the immediate creation of over 20,000 jobs \nand up to 465,000 jobs by 2035. I don't think anybody argues with that \nanalysis.\n  The President's effort to stop hydraulic fracturing is another \nexample. Much of today's renaissance in oil and gas production is the \nresult of the advancements in this technology. He has done everything \nhe can to paint a nasty and suspicious picture of it. He has 10 Federal \nagencies, including the EPA, the Department of Energy, and the Bureau \nof Land Management looking at ways to regulate hydraulic fracturing at \nthe Federal level. In addition, he has also kept millions of Federal \nlands off-limits to oil and gas.\n  As far as the hydraulic fracturing, I know a little about that; we \nhad the first hydraulic fracturing that took place in Duncan, OK, in \n1949. There has not been one documented case of ground water \ncontamination using hydraulic fracturing. The only reason he is opposed \nto it is that this is part of his war on fossil fuels. If he can stop \nhydraulic fracturing, he will stop all of these types of production, \nand everybody knows that. We have already done that.\n  So we have the tax problems, the pipeline, and hydraulic fracturing. \nIn addition to that, his attempt has been to stop production on Federal \nlands and make Federal lands off-limits to oil and gas exploration, and \neven through some lease-sales conducted during the Bush administration, \nciting the need for more environmental review.\n  Today--and this is significant--83 percent of Federal onshore lands \nare\n\n[[Page S2025]]\n\ninaccessible or restricted to drilling. No drilling is allowed on the \nentire east and west coasts. No drilling is allowed in ANWR, in Alaska, \nand very limited drilling is in the gulf.\n  Oil and gas production is skyrocketing in States such as North Dakota \nand Texas simply because the President has very little control over the \ndrilling there. That is not Federal land. This is in Texas, Oklahoma, \nand North Dakota. The Congressional Research Service concurs, stating \nin a recent report that about 96 percent of the increase in oil and gas \nproduction since 2007 took place on nonfederal lands. In other words, \nit has happened in spite of the President's efforts. The President \nimposes all of these punitive taxes because he doesn't have control \nover private lands. He tries to say: In my administration we expanded \nproduction. That has happened in spite of his policies.\n  At end of the day, all of President Obama's oil and gas policies make \nit harder for U.S. firms to justify projects at home. This is to the \ndetriment of our economy. Just look at the increase in taxes, the \nkilling of the pipelines, the stopping of hydraulic fracturing, making \ndrilling off-limits. To let you know what States are missing out on, a \nFriday New York Times front-page article ran about oil and gas \ndevelopment going on in west Texas describes how this helped the local \neconomy, saying new-found wealth is spreading beyond the fields in \nnearby towns.\n  Petroleum companies are buying so many pickup trucks that dealers are \nleasing parking lots the size of city blocks to stock their inventory. \nHousing is in such short supply the drillers are importing contractors \nfrom Houston. The hotels are leased out before they are even built. Two \nnew office buildings are going up in Midland, a city of just over \n110,000 people--the first in 30 years--while the total value of \ndowntown real estate has jumped 50 percent since 2008, with virtually \nno unemployment.\n  Restaurants cannot be found. They cannot find people to work because \nthey are fully employed. One of the individuals from Oklahoma, a great \nproducer, went up to North Dakota. He is up there right now. I talked \nto him yesterday and he said: The biggest problem we have is that we \ncannot hire anyone. It is full employment. Things are great.\n  That is what the rest of the country is missing out on. When we make \nthe United States less competitive for U.S. oil and gas firms, as the \nPresident's tax policies propose, this sort of red-hot growth goes to \nplaces such as Azerbaijan and Nigeria instead of Midland, TX, and \nOklahoma City. Rather than help our economy, the President's tax \npolicies make us more reliant on foreign oil imports from unstable \nregions of the world.\n  I don't know about you, but I would rather see pickup truck \ndealerships running out of vehicles to sell in Cushing, OK, than in \nCaracas, Venezuela.\n  The President will not admit this, but we have seen what punitive tax \nhikes do to the oil and gas industry. They hurt our economy. President \nCarter, way back in the early eighties, confirmed this with the \nwindfall profits tax. He was going to punish the bad oil companies. As \na result of that, it decreased domestic production by 3 to 6 percent, \nwhich increased American dependence on foreign oil sources by 8 to 16 \npercent. Almost all of it was from the Middle East. It doubled our \ndependence by putting taxes on the oil industry here. A side effect was \nalso declining, not increasing, tax collections.\n  Since we know what happens when we do this sort of thing, we don't \nneed to try the experiment again. Regardless, the President and most on \nthe left insist that taxpayers are subsidizing oil and gas firms. But, \napparently, they have not been reading the facts.\n  The Tax Foundation recently estimated that between 1981 and 2008, oil \nand gas companies sent more money to Washington and State capitols than \nthey earned in profits for shareholders.\n  The administration's own Energy Information Administration reported \nthat the industry paid about $35.7 billion in corporate taxes in 2009.\n  The oil and gas industry sends $86 million per day to Federal and \nState governments, and their effective income tax rate is over 41 \npercent, which may be the highest of any industry in America. But the \nPresident and congressional Democrats want them to pay more.\n\n  In addition to these tax increases, Secretary Salazar recently told \nCongress his department is planning to raise the onshore royalty rate \nby 50 percent. These are the royalty rates to ensure taxpayers get a \nfair return on the development of oil and gas leases on public lands. \nIf what we are trying to do is raise more revenue, we should get it by \ngrowing the economy.\n  We have used the figure over and over that with each 1 percent \nincrease in economic activity that translates into about $50 billion in \nnew revenue. We can do that by unlocking more domestic supply for \ndevelopment, and this will lower prices at the same time. We have \nplenty of it. The CRS report recently stated we have the largest \ncombined oil, natural gas, and coal recoverable reserves on Earth--more \nthan any other country, more than Saudi Arabia, more than any other \ncountry. This means we have a 50-year supply of oil in present \nconsumption in the United States, for 50 years, just exporting our own \ndevelopment or 90 years' supply of natural gas.\n  At the end of the day, this bill, and the rest of the President's \nproposals, will only make U.S. oil firms less competitive compared to \ntheir international peers. It will raise the cost of energy by \nrestricting global prices. It will force us to become more reliant on \nothers, which will make us more vulnerable from a defense and economic \nsecurity perspective. The only way to resolve this problem and to do \nsomething about reducing the price at the pump is to start developing \nour own resources.\n  A minute ago I talked about what is happening in Midland, TX, and \nNorth Dakota, and what is happening in some areas in Oklahoma. I can \nremember when I was a little kid I worked on cable-and-tool rigs. That \nwas very difficult at the time.\n  A man by the name of A.W. Swift had 18 cable-and-tool rigs. At that \ntime, instead of rotaries, they would pound down. Sometimes I would \nwork two shifts. One night I was working the second shift, and the well \nblew up. The owner had one son named Burt. Burt was killed and I \nwasn't. When I stop to think about the prosperity in those days of the \noil and gas industry in Oklahoma, I think about the nearby town of \nPawhuska, where people had to wait in line to pay their lunch bill. It \nwas full employment and not an empty storefront. But up until we \nstarted producing again in Oklahoma, it was very much almost a ghost \ntown.\n  Now things are coming back, and we can take advantage of that. In \nspite of the tax policies of President Obama, we are coming back, and \nwe can do this throughout the United States. The most important thing \nwe can do is make sure the Menendez-Obama bill to increase taxes on the \noil and gas companies in the United States is defeated. We hope we have \nthe opportunity to do that.\n  With that I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to express \nconcerns about the rising cost of gasoline and the Obama \nadministration's efforts to further increase the American consumers' \npain at the pump.\n  As we all know, the average price of gasoline has now more than \ndoubled since the first week of the President's inauguration in January \n2009, from $1.84 a gallon to $3.86. Furthermore, the Associated Press \nhas reported the typical American household spends about $4,155 a year \nfilling up at the pump--an all-time high--and 8.4 percent of the median \nhousehold income, the highest percentage spent for gasoline since 1981 \nwhen oil prices soared due to the crisis in the Middle East.\n  The Energy Information Administration estimates that 72 percent of \nthe price of a gallon of gasoline is made up from the cost of crude \noil, which is a globally traded commodity. Although some would like to \ndistract from the fundamentals, Congress cannot repeal the law of \nsupply and demand.\n  Indeed, President Obama used to agree with us. Last March, for \nexample, he said ``producing more oil in America will help lower oil \nprices.'' However, his administration has adopted policies that \ndirectly conflict with our goal of lowering gasoline prices. To add \ninsult to injury, with the public outcry, the President is out to \nfurther confuse the facts and actually take credit for increasing \nproduction when those increases have been on private lands outside of \nhis control, and while opposing greater exploration on Federal lands \nunder his purview. At the same time he is even seeking now to push \nprices even higher by raising taxes in his fiscal year 2013 budget.\n  This week the Senate will be debating a bill by Senator Menendez of \nNew Jersey to increase taxes on oil producers. I don't know of anyone \nwho could reach any other conclusion than that by raising taxes on the \npeople who produce oil and gas, it will raise, not lower, the cost of \noil, thus the refined petroleum product known as gasoline. So, \nactually, by punitively and in a discriminatory sort of way raising \nprices on an unpopular sector of the economy, we will actually make \nmatters worse, not better.\n  The Tax Code supports the energy sector by providing a number of \ntargeted tax incentives--or tax incentives only available to the energy \nindustry. In addition to targeted tax incentives, there are a number of \nbroader tax provisions that are available for energy- and nonenergy-\nrelated industries. For example, the section 199 domestic production \ndeduction incentive is available to most domestic manufacturers with \nincome derived from production property that was manufactured, \nproduced, grown, or extracted within the United States.\n  So this section 199 provision applies to a whole host of American \nbusinesses, not just the oil and gas business. Yet the Menendez bill \nand the Obama administration continue to single out oil producers for \ntax increases, even though oil-related activities are already limited \nfrom claiming the deduction compared to other industries.\n\n  Analysis by the Congressional Research Service for the energy \ntargeted tax incentives shows that while the majority of U.S. primary \nenergy production comes from fossil fuels, the majority of energy tax-\nrelated revenue losses are associated with provisions designed to \nsupport renewables.\n  During 2009, 77.9 percent of U.S. primary energy production could be \nattributed to fossil fuels--77.9 percent in 2009. Of the Federal tax \nsupport targeted to energy in 2009, an estimated 12.6 percent went \ntoward fossil fuels. In contrast, in that same year, more than 10 \npercent of U.S. primary energy sources came from renewable fuels.\n  In other words, just to repeat: 10.6 percent from renewable, 77.9 in \nthat same year from oil and gas, but notwithstanding the fact only 10 \npercent of energy produced came from renewable fuels, 77.4 percent of \nenergy targeted Federal tax support went toward supporting renewable \nfuels.\n  If we want to put all these tax provisions on the table, I think we \nshould do that. As a matter of fact, the Simpson-Bowles study \nidentified more than $1 trillion of tax expenditures. But let's not \njust pick out one sector of the economy and, in the process, raise \ntaxes and increase the price of gasoline at the pump as an unintended \nbut clearly likely outcome.\n  We know the Menendez bill is not about tax reform. This is about \nmixing the message and trying to drive a wedge between the American \npeople and the people who actually create jobs. Unfortunately for the \nadministration, raising taxes will, in fact, translate into higher \nprices.\n  It is a fair question to ask whether this administration can defend \nits policies, such as their budget proposal to raise taxes where they \nargued these tax provisions should be repealed because they ``encourage \noverproduction of oil'' and are thereby ``detrimental to long-term \nenergy security.''\n  I am not sure most Americans understand that the official policy of \nthis administration is that tax deductions should be removed because \nthey encourage overproduction of oil in America. I thought the goal--\none of our goals--was to produce more at home so we would depend less \non imported energy from abroad.\n  Then there is the Keystone Pipeline, which is well-known. The \nPresident is the primary obstacle to the completion of that pipeline \nwhich will create more than 20,000 new jobs and produce 700,000 barrels \nof oil at refineries in the United States from a safe and friendly \nsource--the nation of Canada. Because the President is blocking \ncompletion of the Keystone XL Pipeline, they are looking for \nalternative customers. Indeed, the Prime Minister of Canada has visited \nChina to prospect that potential purchase.\n  What is worse, it is not just that the President hasn't acted, it is \nthat the President has actually lobbied in the Senate to defeat efforts \nto bypass his obstruction to the completion of the Keystone XL \nPipeline.\n  Well, the President must be feeling the heat because he showed up in \nCushing, OK, to celebrate and to say he would expedite about one-third \nof the pipeline, which, ironically, doesn't require him to do anything. \nIt certainly doesn't turn on the spigot in Canada to get the oil in \nthat pipeline to come from Canada down to the United States.\n  So we can see our Nation has no coherent energy policy. We see that \nnot only is this an area that has been neglected to the detriment of \nthe American consumer, but actually the sorts of policies being pursued \nby the administration--particularly with regard to the Keystone XL \nPipeline and raising taxes on domestic oil producers--are designed to \nmake matters worse for American consumers at a time when they are \nstruggling to recover from this recession, with historically high rates \nof unemployment and too few jobs.\n  Looking at all the evidence on energy prices, it is hard to come to \nany conclusion other than that high energy prices are part of President \nObama's plan. The policies he has put in place have intentionally \nelevated the price of gasoline, much to the detriment of the American \npeople.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from the State of New Jersey.\n  Mr. PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 2204, which is \nmy legislation to repeal Big Oil subsidies.\n  This bill is pretty simple. We end wasteful subsidies to the big five \noil companies, and we use those proceeds to invest in clean energy, in \ncreating jobs, and reducing the deficit. I think the American people \nare sick and tired of paying ridiculously high gasoline prices at the \npump and then paying Big Oil again with our collective taxpayer \nsubsidies. I think that money is better spent keeping our economy going \nand developing alternatives to oil that will create competition in the \nmarketplace and help to reduce gas prices.\n  We are poised to waste $24 billion over the next 10 years subsidizing \nonly five companies that are poised to make\n\n[[Page S2027]]\n\nover $1 trillion in profits--not proceeds, in profits--over the same \ntime frame. And as we all pay more at the pump, Big Oil rakes in more \nmoney.\n  Exxon boasts in its Securities and Exchange Commission filings that \nfor every $1 increase in the price of oil, their profits rise by $375 \nmillion. For every $1 the price of oil goes up, they boast in their \nfilings that their profits--not proceeds, profits--rise by $375 \nmillion. The American driver's pain is Big Oil's profit.\n  What is Big Oil doing with its profits? Well, the answer is not \nuseful. As you can see in this chart, the profits from the big five oil \ncompanies were $137 billion in 2011. That is an impressive 75-percent \nincrease from 2010. Did they use that extra money to produce more oil, \nas some of my colleagues here would suggest? No, they didn't. They took \nyour money and actually in that time frame didn't produce a drop more \nof oil. As you can see, despite the fact that overall U.S. production \nis higher now than it has been in the last 8 years, last year these \nfive companies actually produced 4 percent less oil.\n  So it is fair to ask: If they did not invest to produce more oil, \nthen what are they doing with this $137 billion in profits, this 75-\npercent increase in profits in 1 year? Well, they spent about $38 \nbillion repurchasing their own stock to enrich themselves, and they \nspent nearly $70 million on campaign contributions and lobbying to \nprotect their billions of dollars in subsidies. As you can see here, it \nwas a pretty smart investment. For every $1 they spent in lobbying, \nthey got about $30 in subsidies. One might say that is not a bad return \non their investment.\n  So instead of giving these subsidies to Big Oil so they can enrich \nthemselves and seek to affect and control our political system, I think \nwe could use some of those funds to reduce the deficit. I think we can \nall agree we need to reduce the deficit, but there seems to be some \nconsiderable disagreement on how to do it. Last week, those on the \nother side of the aisle came out with what I call the Romney-Ryan \nbudget, their proposed budget, and it would drastically cut funding for \nwounded soldiers, for seniors, for students, but it leaves in place \nthese wasteful subsidies even though we have this enormous profit.\n  Through some political sleight of hand they defy reality when they \ntell us with a straight face that we have to make tough choices, and \nthen they cut funding for wounded soldiers, for seniors, and students \nbut won't touch the subsidies for Big Oil.\n  Somehow, in this Republican parallel universe, logic is turned on its \nhead and we are asked to believe that fairness doesn't mean treating \neveryone equally. It means more for the very rich and more for Big Oil. \nBut we don't live in a parallel universe. We live in the real world. \nFairness means that working families should not be the only people \nsacrificing. And we can't lower the deficit while we give taxpayer \ndollars away to Big Oil companies that are making record profits and \nnot producing more energy. It is amazing to me that anybody can come \nand make that argument.\n  What makes these subsidies even more ridiculous is that when we \npressed those who have supported the industry or those who have come \nfrom the industry, everyone seems to admit that oil companies do not \nneed these subsidies. Former President Bush, who was very good with the \noil industry, said that oil companies do not need incentives to drill \nwhen oil hits $55 per barrel. Those were his remarks. Now it is over \n$100 a barrel. So if they didn't need incentives to drill when it was \nat $55 a barrel, how does anybody come to the floor and suggest they \nneed incentives now when it is over $100 a barrel?\n  Then the former CEO of Shell said that subsidies are not necessary \nfor drilling and production. That is pretty much probably clear when \nthey are making $137 billion in that 1 year, and where they will make \n$1 trillion over the next decade.\n  Of the $24 billion we save by cutting these subsidies to the big \nfive, we can use over $11 billion to extend a series of critically \nimportant expiring energy tax incentives. These clean energy \ntechnologies will cut demand for oil, they will drive economic growth, \nwill create jobs, and will allow America to lead the global clean \nenergy market.\n  Despite Big Oil's rhetoric--let me tell you, it is amazing. I see \nthey are spending a lot of that money, all this money here not making \noil, but they are spending it on television to scare everybody and to \nsay that, Oh, if you take any of those subsidies away, somehow prices \nwill rise. Well, we know that, despite Big Oil's rhetoric, cutting \nsubsidies will not raise gas prices. We know that. Why? Because experts \nfrom the U.S. States Treasury Department, from the nonpartisan \nCongressional Research Service, and from oil executive testimony that \ncame before the Finance Committee that I sit on, made it very clear \nthat is not the case.\n  But more than that, some of the most important tax policies that will \nbe extended in this bill will help drive down gas prices by creating \ncompetition for oil as a transportation fuel. These incentives include \nthe one for biofuels such as cellulosic ethanol, biodiesel, also \nincentives for natural gas and propane used as a transportation fuel. \nThere are also incentives for alternative fuel refueling infrastructure \nand for electric vehicles. Taken together, these incentives are laying \nthe groundwork for a truly competitive market where we are not beholden \nto one type of fuel to power our vehicles. But the good news doesn't \neven end there. There are also tax incentives that will help the United \nStates compete for the renewable industries of the 21st century.\n  For example, the section 1603 Treasury grant program has helped \nfinance renewable energy projects around the country. It has leveraged \nover $35 billion in investments to create tens of thousands of energy \nprojects. In my home State of New Jersey alone, 750 grants were given \nfor solar, geothermal, landfill gas, hydropower, wind projects. These \nprojects are worth over $350 million, creating many jobs, and will help \nNew Jersey on energy bills for decades to come.\n\n  Another important renewable energy incentive is the production tax \ncredit for wind. Since the last reauthorization of PTC in 2005, wind \npower capacity has more than tripled. But if that production tax credit \nis not extended, it is estimated that annual installations of wind will \ndrop by more than 75 percent and wind-supported jobs will decline from \n78,000 in 2012 to 41,000 in 2013, and total wind energy investment will \ndrop by nearly two-thirds. So it is time to get back to reality. It is \ntime to tell middle-class families struggling to make ends meet that \nfairness means everyone--everyone--pays their fair share when it comes \nto reduce the deficit. It means ending ridiculous taxpayer giveaways to \nthe five most profitable companies in the world.\n  I cannot understand how the oil industry is spending money on radio \nand other forms of media to say, Oh, my God, If you take any of our \nsubsidies away--and these aren't even all of the subsidies they have. \nThese are just a couple, the $24 billion over 10 years. They are going \nto make $1 trillion over 10 years. So you are telling the American \npeople that when you are going to make $1 trillion over 10 years, we \ncollectively as taxpayers must still give you $24 billion or else \nsomehow $1 trillion minus $24 billion wouldn't be enough for you in \nprofits that you would gouge the consumer at the pump? I don't think \nthe American people are going to accept that.\n  It is time for us to stop wasting taxpayer money on oil subsidies and \nuse this money to invest in clean energy, in jobs, in lowering the \ndeficit. All of that can be done on this opportunity when we vote in \nfavor of moving forward on S. 2204, the Repeal Big Oil Subsidies Act. \nIt is time to put the interests of the American people ahead of the \nmoney interests in this Congress with this vote, and then moving \nforward.\n  I hear my colleagues may very well vote for us today to have a \ndebate--which I more than welcome. I am looking forward to it. I have \ngot a lot more to talk about in this regard--but then won't vote at the \nend to repeal the subsidies. So I guess what we will hear is a chorus \nof voices that will speak about defending Big Oil and defending its $24 \nbillion in subsidies, and justifying that even with $1 trillion in \nprofits they still need to get their hands into the pockets of \ntaxpayers and take another $24 billion in addition to what they get at \nthe pump so they can make even more profits. And, somehow, there will \nbe a justification to that. I hope\n\n[[Page S2028]]\n\nthe American people will be watching, because that type of \njustification is beyond comprehension. I know it as I hear it from \nfamilies in New Jersey.\n  I hope we will have this debate. I hope we will be able to move \nforward. I want to be able to talk about how I hear my colleagues talk \nabout drill, baby, drill. Well, I was incredulously amazed that \nactually we are now exporting from the United States millions of \ngallons of gasoline and refined petroleum products every day to other \nplaces in the world. It seems to me that if we drill it here, \nparticularly on Federal lands and water, we should keep it here because \nobviously the bigger the supply we have, the more we are going to \ncreate downward pressure on prices. But I think most Americans would be \npretty shocked to know that we are actually exporting. They think \neverything that is created here is kept here, which is why I found it \ninteresting--I keep hearing my colleagues talk about the Keystone \nPipeline. Well, there are those of us who said, You know what. If you \nwill make it with materials made in America so that we can ensure \nAmerican jobs are created with it, and if you keep the energy here and \nnot export it someplace around the world, then there are a lot of \npeople who would say: Yes, along with the right environmental \nsafeguards, let's consider it. But overwhelmingly that was voted \nagainst. So so much for American jobs. So much for securing American \nenergy. Because what is the use of a pipeline to bring an energy source \nand then have it sent to other places in the world? That doesn't help \nus.\n  I am a big believer if we are going to drill it on Federal lands and \nwater, we are going to keep it here, we are going to help us lower \nprices. I am a big believer if we are going to do something such as \nKeystone, let's make sure it is made with American materials and made \nwith American hands and, at the end of the day, the energy is kept in \nthe United States. I am a big believer in saying at a time of shared \nsacrifice, it is wrong to ask working families to do more and yet give \nthe oil companies $24 billion, when they will make $1 trillion in \nprofits. It is wrong to say to a wounded soldier we are going to cut \nprograms in his long-term health care that will ultimately help him get \nback on his feet, but we are going to give Big Oil $24 billion. It is \nwrong to tell students who are trying to determine their future and get \naccess to that college education and who will encumber themselves with \nsignificant costs along the way, no, they pay more, but we are going to \ngive Big Oil $24 billion. It is wrong to tell seniors we are going to \nend Medicare as we know it, but we are going to give Big Oil $24 \nbillion. That is beyond my comprehension.\n  I look forward to the debate because it is going to be very \ninteresting to see some of the remarkable ways in which people are \ngoing to have to explain that. I don't think it is explainable to the \nAmerican people. Tonight's vote starts a process: Which side are we on? \nAre we on the side of the American taxpayer or are we on the side of \nBig Oil? I hope an overwhelming number of our colleagues will, starting \ntonight and moving toward final passage, say we are on the side of the \nAmerican taxpayer and the American consumer. If we do that, we can \ncreate some justice in this process. We can help create competition in \nthe energy market to drive down prices, we can reduce the deficit by \nanother $12 billion, and we can be a lot more fair to working families \nin this country. That is the choice before us. That is a choice the \nSenate will make in a positive way.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar).

Madam President, I join with the entire Senate family in \ncongratulating my great friend, the distinguished senior Senator from \nMaryland, Barbara Mikulski, on becoming the longest serving female\n\n[[Page S2029]]\n\nMember of Congress in our Nation's history. She reached that milestone \nrecently, having served in Congress for 12,858 days--more than 35 \nyears--surpassing the previous longest serving Member of Congress, the \nlate Representative Edith Nourse Rogers.\n  Representative Rogers famously quipped, ``The first 30 years are the \nhardest.'' But I dare say that Senator Mikulski has had a somewhat \ndifferent experience. As with other pathbreaking women, she has \nencountered sexism and discrimination. But from her first day in the \nHouse in 1977 right up to today, in her much respected role as dean of \nwomen Senators, Barbara Mikulski has been a singularly formidable and \nforceful public servant. Pity the Representative or Senator who has \nmade the mistake of in any way underestimating this remarkable person.\n  For three and a half decades in Congress, Barbara Mikulski has been \nan outspoken and proud progressive--a tireless advocate for quality \npublic education, access to health care, and a strong safety net for \nthose she calls ``the least of these our sisters and brothers''--\nincluding the elderly, people with disabilities, and the poor. Her \npassion for social and economic justice was nurtured by the nuns who \ntaught her at Catholic school in working-class east Baltimore.\n  Senator Mikulski's legislative accomplishments are too numerous to \ncite here. But I am particularly grateful for the lead role that she \nplayed in early 2009 in passing the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay \nRestoration Act--the very first bill signed into law by President \nObama. This law reversed an outrageous Supreme Court decision that \nallowed discrimination against women to go unpunished. But, as Senator \nMikulski knows all too well, even the Lilly Ledbetter Act leaves in \nplace an outrageous status quo where women are paid only 78 cents for \nevery $1 that their male counterparts are paid. That is why she and I \nhave continued to work closely together to advance the cause of equal \npay. We are the respective leads on the two Democratic equal pay bills \nin the Senate.\n  As chair of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, I \nwant to pay special tribute to the extraordinary role she has long \nplayed on our committee.\n  Senator Mikulski's legislative skills and leadership were critically \nimportant in crafting and passing the Patient Protection and Affordable \nCare Act 2 years ago--an achievement that she calls one of the \n``greatest social justice initiatives'' of our time. She led the team \nthat wrote the quality title in the bill, insisting that higher quality \ncare does not have to be higher cost care. Thanks to Senator Mikulski, \nthe health care reform law includes a whole range of provisions that \nshift the emphasis--rewarding providers not for quantity of service but \nfor quality of service. I would add that throughout the debate on \nhealth care reform and during the many months the bill was being \nwritten, Senator Mikulski was a fierce advocate for women's health and \nfor ending the brazen discrimination against women by health insurance \ncompanies.\n  On the HELP Committee, and also in her role as chair of the \nAppropriations subcommittee that funds the Legal Services Corporation, \nSenator Mikulski has been a great leader on another issue near and dear \nto my heart: legal services for the poor. She has fought hard--and it \nhas always been an uphill struggle--to provide adequate funding so that \npeople without resources are not barred from the courthouse door.\n  Of course, Senator Mikulski has also been one of the Senate's leading \nproponents of national and community service. In 2009, she was the \nSenate manager for the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act, which \nretooled our national service programs for the 21st century and \nprovided expanded opportunities for young people to gain valuable \nskills and experience by helping neighbors in need.\n  Let me share a brief anecdote that illustrates the remarkable role \nthat Senator Mikulski plays in the body and the respect that she \ncommands among her colleagues. We all remember the debate, in late \nFebruary, on the Blunt amendment, which would have allowed employers to \ndeny health insurance coverage for contraception. In my role as chair \nof the HELP Committee, I was invited to attend a press conference in \nthe LBJ Room of the Capitol organized by Senator Mikulski to speak out \nagainst the amendment. Let me tell you, this was a remarkable event. \nSenator Mikulski spoke first, with tremendous power and passion. One by \none, other Senators spoke--women who, over the decades, have been \ncounseled and mentored by Senator Mikulski: Senator Patty Murray of \nWashington, Senators Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein of California, \nand Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire. Senator Mikulski's \nmessage, echoed by the other Senators, was characteristically loud and \nclear: Decisions about medical care should be made by a woman and her \ndoctor, not a woman and her boss. Needless to say, Senator Mikulski \ncarried the day; the amendment was defeated.\n  Other Senators have noted Senator Mikulski's many firsts, including \nthe first woman elevated to a leadership position in the Senate. I \nwould simply add that Barbara Mikulski is also first when it comes to a \nSenator being true to her roots, a fierce and effective champion for \nher State and passionate fighter for social and economic justice. \nAgain, I salute the Senator on reaching the historic milestone as the \nlongest serving female Member of Congress, and I wish her many more \nyears of distinguished service to our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/26/senate-section/article/S2029-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2029]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING GRACE EPISCOPAL CHURCH\n\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, I am very proud to extend my recognition \nand congratulations to the congregation and administration of the Grace \nEpiscopal Church in Plymouth, NC, as this wonderful institution \ncelebrates 175 years of providing spiritual guidance and community \nservice to Washington County and the State of North Carolina.\n  This year marking the 175th anniversary of the founding of Grace \nChurch, we give the citizens of Washington County as well as the State \nof North Carolina the opportunity to pay tribute and homage to a place \nof worship that has impacted many and assisted those in need of \nspiritual guidance.\n  Plymouth, NC traces its historical roots back to the 18th century and \nthe beginnings of our Nation. It has served as a port on the Roanoke \nRiver off the Albemarle Sound for over two centuries, acting as a place \nof trade for much of North Carolina and the United States. By 1837, \nPlymouth had grown into an important port in North Carolina and with \nthat growth came the establishment of the Grace Episcopal Church.\n  Plymouth was one of the ports targeted for blockade by Union forces \nduring the Civil War and in that time it is believed that only 11 \nbuildings survived the war, 1 of them being the Grace Episcopal Church.\n  Grace Episcopal Church has provided the town of Plymouth and the \nsurrounding areas in Washington County spiritual guidance and \nleadership for the last 175 years. This institution has been a beacon \nof light and hope to many people in the region and the world.\n  Grace Episcopal Church has provided many charitable services and \nevents for citizens in need, for example one guild at the church is \ncomprised of a group of knitters and other handcrafters that make goods \nfor distribution to those in need locally and abroad. Grace Episcopal \nChurch has also been an active partner in the Washington County Habitat \nfor Humanity projects, providing financial donations in addition to \ndonating office space for the organization.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to the Grace \nEpiscopal Church in Plymouth, NC for the countless acts of charity and \ngood will this institution has provided and will continue to provide \neastern North Carolina. May their work be recognized and forever \nappreciated by the citizens of North Carolina as well as this Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/26/senate-section/article/S2029-2", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2029-S2030]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO PATRICK DOYLE\n\n Mr. THUNE.
