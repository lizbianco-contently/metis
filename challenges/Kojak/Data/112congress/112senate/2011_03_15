Madam President, this bill is another jobs bill. It is a \nvery important bill. I did a press event yesterday with the chairman of \nthe committee, Senator Landrieu. It was a good meeting. We talked about \nsome of the things that are happening in our States regarding small \nbusiness under this program that was developed during President \nReagan's administration. Some remarkably good things happen in every \nState.\n  As to New Hampshire, I do not know which ones happen there, but there \nare a number of things in every State. In the State of Nevada, \nwonderful things have occurred. One of the things a smart man decided \nis that we should not have 9/11-type incidents where people are trapped \nand cannot get out of high stories. He has an apparatus that goes up \nand brings people down. For an initial grant of some $150,000, he was \nable to do that.\n  We have another--a battery that is now being used by the military--\nfor $180,000. It does all these great things improving batteries in \nvehicles.\n  This did not occur in Nevada, but one of the amazing things is the \nelectric toothbrush came about as a result of one of these small \ngrants.\n  Every State in America has benefited from these grants. The program \nhas worked well for almost 30 years, and we are reauthorizing it. That \nis what we are doing so these programs can continue.\n  We hope people will offer amendments to improve this legislation and \nnot detract from it. We would like to complete this legislation this \nweek. We know we have the CR coming over probably tonight sometime. We \nwill have to deal with that. The next work period is going to be filled \nwith a lot of business. We are going to soon have to reauthorize the \nPATRIOT Act. We have many things to do, but the things we have done so \nfar this year are job creating. Not only the small business legislation \nI just talked about, but the patent bill, the first revision of that in \nsome 60 years, that is 300,000 jobs. We did FAA reauthorization; that \nis 280,000 jobs.\n  I hope the House will complete these measures--we are waiting for \nthem; the President is waiting for these matters--rather than doing \nwhat they are doing, which is not job creating.\n  There is a piece in the Washington Post today about how the \nRepublicans are being so shortsighted. For every\n\n[[Page S1614]]\n\ndollar we spend with the IRS going after people who cheat, we bring in \nmore than $10 to the Treasury. They are cutting the ability of the IRS \nto go after people who cheat on paying their taxes. That makes it more \ndifficult for the people who pay their taxes. I hope they will get off \nthe government bashing program they have been on and focus on job \ncreation.\n  We all know we need to reduce our debt. We are engaged in that, but \nin a way that is smart, not a way that is, as indicated in that \nWashington Post article, penny-wise and very pound-foolish.\n  Will the Chair now announce morning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/15/senate-section/article/S1614-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1614]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, last week, Senator Inouye of Hawaii, the \nchairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, proposed a bill to \nfund the government through the end of this fiscal year. It is hard to \nbelieve we are almost halfway through this year and still haven't \nresolved the basic issue of our budget. Our failure to resolve it, \nlurching from 2 weeks to 3 weeks of funding, may serve some political \npurpose, but it doesn't serve the purpose of good government because \nmany people who have to make critical decisions that involve more than \na momentary glimpse or glance at our fiscal situation are held back.\n  I met a man last night whose business is to supply the United States \nwith vaccine for anthrax, tuberculosis, and similar things. We have an \ninadequate stockpile of vaccine. The government has said to him: We \nwant you to produce more vaccine, but we are only funded for 2 more \nweeks.\n  He said to me: How can I, as a businessman, make a commitment to \nproduce vaccine with an uncertainty as to whether it will be paid for?\n  That is a pretty reasonable question, and it reflects the fact that \nas we move from 2 weeks to 3 weeks of funding, postponements are made \nin decisions which have an impact on the future of our country.\n  This morning, I wish to address, as well, something that goes beyond \nthe obvious--stockpiling vaccine--and looks to some of the other \naspects of the House Republican budget bill and what it will mean to \nAmerica if it is adopted. This is a bill which they proudly boast will \ncut $100 billion in spending. Most people across America, sensitive to \nour deficit crisis, say we should start by cutting spending. That is a \nreasonable request by voters in New Hampshire and Illinois. But there \ncomes a moment when we have to use our best judgment about where cuts \nshould be made and where cuts, when made, would cost us dearly for a \nlong time to come.\n  Senator Inouye, in his bill, tried to balance $51 billion in cuts \nbelow the President's original budget request in a way that would not \nhurt our investment in America's future and economic growth.\n  American innovation has always fueled economic sustainability and job \ncreation. Senator Inouye's bill lays out a wise path toward providing \nmore jobs and less debt--two things we desperately need to do. Under \nhis alternative spending bill, which I supported, the budget for the \nNational Institutes of Health--which is the premier agency for medical \nresearch in America--is frozen at $31 billion, the same amount it \nreceived last year. This means the funds required to perform cutting \nedge breakthrough medical research and new clinical trials for much-\nneeded cures and treatments will be available. It also means that \nnearly 12,000 jobs across the State of Illinois in hospitals, \nuniversities, and medical centers will continue to be supported under \nthe Inouye budget.\n  Under the House Republican budget, the National Institutes of Health \nis cut by $1.6 billion. That is a cut that is severe by any measure. It \nwould cause new construction projects to be halted when it comes to \nmedical research laboratories and put 351,000 U.S. jobs in danger of \nbeing lost. We can't afford these shortsighted cuts when our Nation is \nstruggling but is determined that we will come out of this stronger \nthan we went in.\n  That said, we know that freezing budgets is not going to be enough. \nThoughtful and difficult cuts will have to be made. The Senate \nappropriations bills provide $6.8 billion for the National Science \nFoundation. This is a cut of $573 million from the President's budget, \nbut it is still $284 million more than was provided in the bill passed \nby the House. Under the Democratic Senate alternative, we can continue \nto fund basic research and create jobs and programs that educate the \nnext generation of scientists in America. That is not possible under \nthe House bill.\n  As I travel to research laboratories in my State--Argonne National \nResearch Laboratory, Northwestern University Medical Care Center--I \nmeet some of the best and brightest young people I have ever seen in my \nlife. They are from all over the world, and they come here because this \nis the place to do research and to make the breakthrough findings that \nwill change America and change the world. Thank God for their \nintelligence and their idealism. But they look at me and say: Senator, \nam I going to have a job 6 weeks from now? If I am not, tell me now. I \nhave to make a plan with my life.\n  Maybe they will leave research and go into work for a private company \nand make more money. Maybe they will go back home to another country \nwhere they will be welcomed in their research capacity. So the \ngeneration of scientists affected by this decision are as important as \nthe breakthroughs that might be found in the research itself.\n  The National Science Foundation will continue to provide $8 million \nof innovation research to Illinois small businesses under the Inouye \nbill, but the funding level difference between the House and the Senate \nand what they want to cut and what we want to cut is dramatic.\n  Let me give an example: We are working on a new supercomputer at the \nUniversity of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. It is called Blue Waters. \nWhen it is completed, it will be the fastest computer in the world. \nMost Americans, when asked where is the fastest computer in the world \ntoday, would probably say America; we are the leaders. No, it is in \nChina. But we are trying to devise and invent the next computer.\n  Now, what difference does that make? We know fast computers make \nquick decisions and help us find ways to solve problems we never even \nimagined. We are about to sacrifice many of the economic gains we can \nrealize if we go through with the House Republican budget.\n  The budget for the Department of Energy's Office of Science was also \nexamined and cut by $388 million to $4.7 billion for the year. Now, \nthat is a $200 million cut. It is difficult because the Office of \nScience supports seven of our National Laboratories. University \nresearch centers and private companies use their facilities to create \nnew drugs, biofuels, and solutions to our country's toughest problems. \nResearch done by Abbot Laboratories at the Advanced Photon Source at \nthe Argonne National Laboratory is crucial to the development of an \nAIDS drug--Kaletra--which is now the world's most prescribed drug for \nfighting AIDS and the HIV virus. Cutting back on the funds for Argonne \nNational Laboratory, dismissing one-third of their scientists\n\n[[Page S1615]]\n\nand engineers--as the House Republican budget calls for--cutting back \ntheir research by 40 to 50 percent for the remainder of the year, slows \ndown the use of the Advanced Photon Source, which is utilized by \nvirtually every major pharmaceutical company.\n  The question may be asked: Does it work? Here is living proof--\nKaletra, the most widely prescribed drug for fighting AIDS, developed \nat the Argonne National Laboratory.\n  The House Republicans say: Slow down, stop, we will get back to you \nlater. Can we say that in a world that demands innovation and research \nand that is looking for solutions to problems? If we cut $1.1 billion \nfrom this account, as the House Republican budget suggests, facilities \nat the National Laboratories in my State and across the country will \nshut down and workers will be laid off. That is a simple reality.\n  I am not coming to the floor and engaging in scare tactics. This is \nwhat the Directors of the National Laboratories have told me. If these \ncenters and Laboratories are closed, private companies--Eli Lily, Texas \nInstruments, GE Research, and 3M--have a choice. If our Laboratories \nare closed, they will find labs overseas, outside the United States. \nDoes that help our economy? Does that create jobs in America--to cut \nresearch?\n  The House Republican budget cuts this research and innovation and \nwelcomes these companies to leave and go overseas to create jobs. Could \nwe possibly be envisioning that at a moment when we have so much \nunemployment and we are facing a recession in this country?\n  Japan, China, and Europe are ready to receive these research \nprojects. They are building facilities in the hopes that these \ncompanies will decide they are more reliable than the United States. \nThat is what the House Republican budget threatens. Whether it is in \nmedical research, energy research, or finding new drugs, unless we make \na commitment that people can count on, that research is going overseas \nand jobs will flow with that research to other countries and not to \nAmerica.\n  We need to cut the budget and reduce our deficit, no doubt about it. \nLet's not do so in a way that costs America jobs and cuts off American \ninnovation at the knees. The spending bill before the House of \nRepresentatives is going to cripple our economy at a time when it is \njust starting to recover. Economists tell us the House Republican \nbudget will cost us more than 700,000 jobs. That is not the way to move \nAmerica forward.\n  We can find a way to eliminate tax loopholes and benefits, improve \nthe way we spend money, and thoughtfully--thoughtfully--decrease our \nspending. These are elements of a sustainable plan for reaching the \nbudget balance we are seeking and, equally important, the economic \ngrowth we need. We cannot balance the budget of America with 15 million \npeople out of work. We have to build an economy that creates good-\npaying jobs and people drawing paychecks who pay their taxes. That \nsustains government growth as well as economic growth.\n  I am going to be working with my colleagues in the Senate to come up \nwith a better approach than the House Republican budget, and I \ncertainly believe we can and should.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/15/senate-section/article/S1615-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1615-S1617]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    WESTWOOD COLLEGE AND THE GI BILL\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I have come to the Senate floor a number \nof times over the past year to speak about my concerns about the rapid \ngrowth of for-profit colleges. I believe some for-profit colleges are \nquality institutions, but I also believe many are taking advantage of \nFederal taxpayer dollars and doing more harm than good for unsuspecting \nstudents. In no area is this issue more important than when it comes to \nour veterans.\n  A few years ago, I proudly joined Senator James Webb of Virginia, who \nsaid to me when he came to the Senate 5 years ago: I want to pass a new \nGI bill. It is my No. 1 priority. And he did it. Thank goodness, he \ndid. This is a man--a veteran of the Vietnam conflict who served in the \nU.S. Marines and later as Secretary of the Navy--who knows what he is \ntalking about when it comes to veterans. He helped put together the \nmodern GI bill, and I am proud to have voted for it, as many of us did.\n  When we passed that bill, we provided veterans with improved benefits \nto go to college. Veterans can receive up to $17,000 a year to cover \nthe cost of tuition, fees, housing, and supplies at the college of \ntheir choice. Veterans can also access private schools through the \nYellow Ribbon Program, which allows the VA to pay a portion of private \nschool tuition under agreements with these schools.\n  A lot of students are using the GI bill to attend for-profit colleges \nwhich are far more expensive than their public counterparts and even \nmore expensive than many private not-for-profit universities. There is \na rapid growth in veteran enrollment in these for-profit schools. For-\nprofit schools cost an average of $14,000 a year compared to $2,500 a \nyear at public 2-year colleges and $7,000 at public 4-year \nuniversities.\n  In the first year of the post-9/11 GI bill implementation, the \nVeterans' Administration spent $697 million on students attending \npublic schools and $640 million on students attending for-profit \nschools--almost the same. But we educated far more students for our \nmoney in public schools--203,000 students at public schools compared to \n76,000 at for-profit schools, which charge two or three times as much \nfor tuition and obviously educate one-half to one-third of what the \npublic schools educated.\n  The top five for-profit recipients of the post-9/11 dollars received \nover $320 million from the Department of Veterans Affairs last year: \nITT received $79 million; Apollo, which is the University of Phoenix, \n$76.9 million; Education Management Corporation, $60.5 million; Career \nEducation Corporation, $58.2 million; and DeVry, $47.9 million.\n  There are reports of for-profit colleges aggressively targeting \nmilitary servicemembers and veterans with expensive ad campaigns and \nhundreds of recruiters. One prominent for-profit college has 452 \nrecruiters focusing on recruiting veterans out of the military. Another \nemploys 300. Why do they want these students? Because when they bring \nthe students in under the GI bill, they get compensated at higher \nlevels by the Federal Government. We have a limit that says that none \nof these for-profit schools can take more than 90 percent of their \nrevenue out of the Federal Treasury. That is money that comes in \nthrough Pell grants and Federal college loans. When it comes to the GI \nbill, we raised the 90 percent. So these schools that argue: We are \njust in the private sector, just little businesses, get more than 90 \npercent of their revenue from the Federal Government. They are the most \nheavily subsidized private businesses in America. It is time for us to \nask, Are the taxpayers getting their money's worth? Are the veterans \ngetting their money's worth?\n  It is troublesome when these schools spend so much money on \nrecruiting students instead of educating them. I am concerned. The \ncurrent system allows for-profit colleges to earn millions of dollars \nfrom taxpayer-funded programs while providing a low-quality education \nto students. We need to put the brakes on for-profit colleges that are \ntargeting veterans to reap profits from taxpayers' dollars.\n  Last week, the Department of Veterans Affairs announced that it and \nthe Texas Veterans Commission had disqualified three Texas campuses of \nWestwood College. They could no longer receive GI bill benefits. \nWestwood College is a for-profit college based out of Colorado, with 17 \nlocations in 6 States--several in Illinois.\n  When I drive to O'Hare, I am on the Kennedy Expressway, and I look up \nand there is this office building and a big, huge sign, ``Westwood \nCollege.'' Wow, the campus of Westwood College.\n  I know one of the students who went to Westwood College. This is a \nyoung lady who decided she needed to improve her life after high school \nand wanted to get into law enforcement. She enrolled at Westwood \nCollege to get a bachelor's degree in law enforcement. Five years \nlater, they handed her a diploma at Westwood College. She went to the \nChicago police department, and they said: We don't recognize that \ncollege; that is not a real college. All of the law enforcement in the \nregion said to her: Westwood is not a real college; this is not a real \ndiploma. She learned that to her disappointment, and she also learned \nto her disappointment that she had incurred\n\n[[Page S1616]]\n\n$90,000 in college student loans for this worthless Westwood College \ndiploma.\n  Now the Veterans' Administration has disqualified three Westwood \nCollege campuses in Texas for their recruiting tactics when it comes to \nour veterans--a lesson learned and a word of warning. This action \nagainst Westwood was in response to findings of erroneous, deceptive, \nmisleading advertising and enrollment practices at the Houston South, \nDallas, and Fort Worth campuses.\n  The Department of Veterans Affairs began its investigation after the \nGAO report on recruiting practices at for-profit colleges. They sent \nundercover applicants to 15 of these for-profit colleges. They found \nthat all 15 made deceptive or otherwise questionable statements to \npotential applicants, including Westwood. Investigators found \nadmissions representatives at Westwood misstating the cost of programs, \nfailing to disclose graduation rates, and even suggesting that \napplicants falsify Federal financial aid forms.\n  When asked about the cost of the program by the undercover \ninvestigator, the recruiter replied:\n\n       It depends on the program. Usually a bachelor's program, \n     coming in with no college credits, this could be--it could \n     range from $50,000 to $75,000. Most schools, more traditional \n     schools, you're looking at about $100,000 to $150,000 to \n     $200,000.\n\n  That isn't true. To obtain the same degree from a public university \nin Texas would cost the student $36,000.\n  Another financial aid counselor told a student with $250,000 in the \nbank that he should not report that money on his Federal financial aid \nforms, counter to Department of Education requirements.\n  The Westwood representative said, ``Frankly, in my opinion, they \ndon't need to know how much cash you have.''\n  In December, the Texas Workforce Commission fined Westwood College \n$41,000 and put its Texas campuses on probation for the high-pressure \nrecruiting practices that GAO discovered. And Westwood's online \noperation was put out of business in Texas for operating without a \ncertificate of approval. Wisconsin has also banned Westwood from \nenrolling its students online.\n  These are not the only problems that have arisen at Westwood College. \nFormer recruiters have spoken out about the high-pressure sales tactics \nthey were encouraged to use at Westwood. Recruiters talk about how they \nwere given a script and told to make prospective students ``feel their \npain.''\n  Joshua Pruyn testified before the Senate HELP Committee as an \nadmissions officer for Westwood College. He testified about how he was \ntaught that enrolling a student was a psychological game.\n  Recruiters told students that they could only be accepted into \nWestwood by interviewing with and securing a recommendation from an \nadmissions representative. But in reality there was no standard for \nenrollment.\n  Joshua testified:\n\n       A student only needed a high school diploma or GED and $100 \n     for the application fee. This fake interview would allow the \n     representative to ask students questions to uncover a \n     student's motivators and pain points--their hopes, fears, and \n     insecurities--all of which would later be used to pressure a \n     student to enroll.\n\n  And I have heard from a number of former students of Westwood College \nin my State. They tell me of being lied to by recruiters and being \nburied under a mountain of debt for a degree that they are afraid will \nbe worthless.\n  Westwood College is accredited by a national accrediting agency. \nBecause Westwood lacks regional accreditation, some employers such as \nthe Illinois State Police will not consider graduates for employment.\n  It also means that credits from Westwood College will not be accepted \nby most traditional public and non-profit colleges.\n  Westwood admits this on its Web site, which states:\n\n       Credits earned at Westwood College are typically not \n     transferable to other colleges or universities.\n\n  How do they explain this to prospective students on the Web site?\n\n       As a career-focused college, we offer a hands-on approach \n     to learning that's different--though, we believe, no less \n     valuable--than approaches students may experience at other \n     colleges and universities.\n\n  But the real story is that traditional colleges do not view credits \nearned at Westwood as equivalent to their courses.\n  Jason Longmore is a Navy veteran from Colorado who spent 6 months at \nWestwood College. His story was recently highlighted in a New York \nTimes article. About his experience, Jason says ``I felt like I made a \nhorrible, horrible decision.'' After 6 months, he left and had to \nrepeat classes elsewhere because his Westwood credits wouldn't \ntransfer.\n  I have heard similar stories from my constituents. Bret, from \nRockford, attended Westwood for a year and a half. He told me that his \neducation was very low in quality and that his credits weren't accepted \nat any traditional schools. He says, ``I now have a mountain of debt \nand literally a degree that means absolutely nothing.''\n  When I met with a former Westwood College student named Michelle in \nChicago, she told me that Westwood repeatedly promised that regional \naccreditation was right around the corner.\n  That never happened. Westwood College was pursuing accreditation from \nthe Higher Learning Commission, a regional accrediting agency. The \nHigher Learning Commission declined to accredit Westwood and its \napplication was withdrawn last November.\n  And at least one Westwood campus is in trouble with its national \naccreditor as well.\n  The Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges placed \nWestwood's Denver North campus on probation in September. The \naccreditor's notice states that Westwood ``has not demonstrated \ncompliance with the Commission's requirements relative to student \nachievement outcomes'' and that it ``is gravely concerned about the \nrecruiting activities of the system of Westwood affiliated \ninstitutions.''\n  Many students who enroll at Westwood aren't sticking around long \nenough to graduate.\n  The Senate HELP Committee made official information requests of 30 \nfor-profit companies, including the company that owns Westwood.\n  According to that information, 2,500 students were enrolled as \nassociate's degree students in 2008-2009. By September 2010, 57.6 \npercent of those students had withdrawn from the school.\n  One of the Westwood campuses in Illinois has a graduation rate of \njust 32 percent.\n  The evidence suggests that Westwood may be more focused on enrolling \nstudents than supporting their academic success. I am glad to see the \nVA take action to address this issue.\n  Congress gave the VA additional tools to do so at the end of our last \nsession with the Post-9/11 GI Bill Improvements Act of 2010.\n  The VA will soon have greater flexibility to act on its own to \ndisapprove courses at schools that abuse student-veterans.\n  We also gave the State approving agencies, which work hand-in-hand \nwith the VA to monitor course quality, authority to disapprove courses \nprovided at schools that fail to follow the rules, regardless of the \nState in which the school is located.\n  These are important changes to VA's oversight authority at a time \nwhen distance learning takes on greater significance and for-profit \nschools are recruiting nationwide from call centers in various \nlocations.\n  I am glad that the VA has taken action to identify colleges like \nWestwood using abusive practices and end their participation in the VA \neducation benefits program. But we have to do more for our veterans and \nall our students.\n  I don't think Westwood will be the only college facing scrutiny under \nthe G.I. bill program. I met with Secretary Shinseki this week and \nasked him to take more aggressive steps to identify colleges misusing \nthe G.I. bill program. Veterans deserve to know that they have real \nsupport at their school and that their education will be meaningful \nwhen they are considering college or enrolled in college.\n  I will continue to work with my colleagues, including Chairman Harkin \nand Senator Webb, to address this important issue.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n[[Page S1617]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/15/senate-section/article/S1617-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1617-S1619]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      HEALTH CARE AND JOB CREATION\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, next Wednesday marks the first \nanniversary of the day President Obama signed the bill into law that, \nin my opinion and in the opinion of most Americans, is the greatest \ninvolvement in our Nation's health care system in history.\n  What we see, as that law is discussed, as it is challenged in court, \nis a bill that was signed into law that was full of problems when it \nwas signed into law. It was a bill full of constitutional questions, \nand, in fact, while some courts have said it may be constitutional, \nothers have said it is not.\n  It was a bill where the courts say the Federal Government cannot make \nyou buy a commercially available product, then the same people who were \nsaying a year ago that this requirement is not a tax are saying: Maybe \nit is a tax. Maybe the Constitution allows us to define that particular \npurpose as a tax on the American people.\n  But a year ago, they were saying: This is not a tax at all. This is \ndefinitely not a tax. There is no way this could ever be interpreted as \na tax.\n  But when courts say you cannot do this the way this bill does it, \nsuddenly they try to reinvent what the law was designed to do.\n  One of the reasons this bill has so many of these problems is there \nwas a rush to get a bill into law, a bill with more government control \nof health care into law, a bill that could not have passed the Senate \nthe day the President signed it into law. A bill that was full of \nconcerns, a bill that the Senate voted on never believing that it \nactually would become law but would create a vehicle to become law, \nbecame the only option the House leaders thought was available to them, \nand they passed it. They passed it without the kind of process that \nwould have produced a law that could stand a constitutional challenge, \nproduced a law to which Americans would be more responsive.\n  While I believe the law was misguided in its concept, more \nimportantly, it was put together in what I think will be seen as the \nworst possible way--a rush to judgment, to get a law on the books. Now \nthe people who voted for the law are saying things like: There may be a \nbetter way than an individual requirement that everybody buy a \nspecified, defined insurance policy. Not all the people are saying that \nbut some are. They are saying: Maybe we ought to look for that better \nway. The time to look for that better way was before the bill was \nsigned into law, not after it was signed into law. Even the White House \nis saying: Certainly let's work together to change this. This is headed \nin fundamentally so much the wrong direction, changing it would not be \nthe best option.\n  Already in the Senate we have voted not to vote on a repeal of this \nlaw that would allow us to replace it with better things. Unless those \nvotes change, that will not happen this year. But the view that \nAmericans have of this law is not likely to change either. I certainly \ndo not believe government has the authority in the Constitution to \npenalize people for not buying a commercially available product.\n  Sometimes people say that the States require that under their \nconstitution, to buy auto insurance if you drive a car. No. 1, that is \na State decision, and No. 2, they do not require you to drive a car. \nYou don't have to have that particular product if you do not make that \ndecision. This gives you no options but to pay a penalty or to do what \nthe government says you have to do.\n  During the debate surrounding this bill and immediately following the \nenactment of the bill, the American people began to tell us that this \nwas not the approach they wanted. In Missouri, where I am from, the \nfirst place that had an issue on the ballot where voters could speak \nabout whether they wanted to be part of this new concept of more \ngovernment control of health care, 71 percent of them said they did not \nwant to be part of it. That was in a primary election. Hundreds of \nthousands of people voted and 71 percent of them said: We do not want \nto go in this direction.\n  Missouri is a State that generally is pretty reflective of the \ncountry in our elections, in our economy, in how our population comes \ntogether. Madam President, 71 percent of them said: Let's not do this; \nlet's do something besides this. They had a sense that this was a \nmisguided plan that put government between them and their doctors, that \nhad as one of its major tenets that the government would describe a \ncertain regimen of care that would have to be followed for doctors and \nhospitals to be reimbursed. Missourians by and large believe this \nsignificantly changes--some would say implodes--our current health care \nsystem.\n  To make it worse, this law cuts Medicare by $500 billion, not to save \nMedicare or improve Medicare, but it cuts Medicare by $500 billion so \nwe could start another health care program. This makes so little sense \nas we look at Medicare--one of our major challenges as the demographics \nof the population change. Medicare is one of the areas where we know \nthat in a handful of years, Medicare will face a generation of great \nchallenge. We look for savings in Medicare not to save Medicare but to \nstart a new program. That would be totally unacceptable anywhere except \nWashington, DC. It makes as little sense to people as the idea that we \ncould come up with a new $1 trillion program over a handful of years \nand say that is going to save money. Nobody believes that.\n  When you look at the greater concept of what this law will do, if it \nis ever implemented, to change the relationship of people and their \ngovernment, I can't think of anything, besides the government taking \nover the economy, that actually has greater potential to change that \nrelationship than the government having more control of your health \ncare. What more controlling element could the government look to than \nyour health care and your family's health care to make sure that you \nnever got on the wrong side of that government? It does change that \nrelationship.\n  It also creates real uncertainty in what should be the No. 1 goal in \nAmerica today: private sector job creation. If a year ago the President \nwould have signed bills into law that encouraged private sector job \ncreation or created more certainty about our health care costs, about \nour utility bills, about our taxes, about regulation, rather than \nsigning this bill into law, I believe we would be much further down the \nroad toward seeing private sector jobs, jobs that create taxpayers that \nhelp government provide the services only government can provide. We \nwould be much further down that road.\n  The very clear message I and others heard all over the country in the \nlast year was, we do not want to create these jobs with all of these \nissues out there not yet really decided and if they are decided, likely \nto be decided in a way that makes that job-creating decision less of a \ngood situation than it would have been otherwise.\n  Cap and trade, in the middle of the country, in Missouri, the sixth \nmost dependent State on coal for its utilities--the estimate was that \nit would double the utility bills in a dozen years. What is the job-\ncreation message there?\n  We are exactly where we were 2 years ago on the tax question because \njust a few months ago the President signed a bill that extended current \ntax policies but only for 2 years. So we are no further down the road \non that question than we were 2 years ago today.\n  The President calls for regulations that make sense. I join him in \nthat. But we see none of that coming from the regulating authorities \nright now. The clear message people had was, they would like the \ngovernment to create more certainty in the areas the government \ncontrols so they can decide whether they want to take the certain risk \nyou always have when you create a job.\n  I was in northwest Missouri not too long after this bill was signed \ninto law 1 year ago and very well remember a conversation I had with \nsomeone whose business was going well. In fact, he said: I have 47 \nemployees. You will remember the bill creates a threshold of 50, that \nyou have different kinds of obligations and regulations once you get to \n50--over 50 employees--than you had before that. He said: I have 47 \nemployees. I need to hire six more people right now. But I have looked \nat this health care law, my accountants have looked at this health care \nlaw, and we are not going to get 1 employee closer to 50 than we are \nright now.\n  So there are six jobs that did not get created. His view of what to \ndo about\n\n[[Page S1618]]\n\nhis current situation was, I am going to pay overtime until I can \nfigure out what I am doing that is not making much money or, in fact, \nmaybe even losing a little money, and I am going to quit doing that. I \nam going to be sure we get back to where we are truly a 47-employee \nbusiness again, instead of what should be a 53-employee business.\n  Many employers I talked to said: We are not going to hire full-time \nemployees. We think we can get our job done with more part-time \nemployees who do not force us into the environment under this law, \nwhere the government comes in and says: You have to pay a penalty or \nyou have to offer an unknown insurance policy that will be created by \nsome group created by the Congress that says what everybody's insurance \npolicy has to look like.\n  ``One size fits all'' almost never fits anybody, and it will not fit \nanybody in this insurance plan that this bill anticipates and mandates. \nWhat you need is more competition, more choice, real, sustainable \nunderstanding that the marketplace works. On the job creation front, \nprivate sector job creation will not occur until we do the things we \nneed to do that create more certainty in the job-creating marketplace: \nletting families keep more of what they earn, economic incentives for \nsmall business, government that does not constantly talk about how it \ncan raise all the costs that you have as the underlying costs of the \nbusiness you create.\n  While I would be voting--if we would have a chance to repeal this \nbill--I would also be working hard to replace it with better solutions. \nMaybe the only good thing about this health care bill is, it requires \nus to either go down a road most Americans now think is the wrong \ndirection or to truly tackle these big questions involving health care, \nthings such as small business health care plans--at one time they were \ncalled association health care plans--where you could find some bigger \ngroup to affiliate with if you are an individual or a business and get \nyour insurance that way rather than trying to get it as an individual.\n  Medical liability reform is a concept I have sponsored legislation on \nand others have, over and over again, to see it pass the House of \nRepresentatives and not get voted on seven times in the Senate. The \nmedical liability bill last year, the estimate was it would save $56 \nbillion for health care under current government programs and at least \nthat much more in health care costs for Americans who pay for their own \nhealth care or have their own private insurance. That is over $100 \nbillion in savings at a time when we need to be looking for every $100 \nbillion in savings we can find. Unfortunately, in our current \nsituation, it takes several of those $100 billion in savings--16 of \nthem, in fact--to just get the budget back in balance. We cannot afford \nto not do things that would save $100 billion.\n  Risk pools. Nobody wants people not to be able to get insurance \nbecause of preexisting conditions. But they are not moving in the \ndirection this bill would allow them to move. In fact, the people who \nhave signed up for the concept the bill put out there of how to open \nrisk pools, I think, is about 6 percent of the anticipated number. When \nthe target is 6 percent of what you thought the law would encourage \npeople to do, obviously there is something wrong with the way that is \nput together. It is only 94 percent short of the estimate of people who \nwould rally to risk pools that allowed for access if you have a \npreexisting condition. There are better ways to expand these risk pools \nthat are better than telling people: No, you will get insurance the \nsame way everybody else gets it, for the same thing they pay for it, \nanytime you need it, which is what the bill says. You will have to pay \na penalty, in the interim, that is much less than it would have cost \nyou to have insurance. People will figure that out and pretty quickly.\n  On what may have been that same visit with the employer in Rockport, \nMO, I was talking to a hospital in that area right after this bill \npassed. They said: I guess, if this bill goes into law, we will put the \ninsurance application forms in the ambulance. That way you can get your \ninsurance on the way to the hospital. Because, after all, under the \nbill, you would pay 100 percent of what everybody else was paying. So \nwhy would you want to pay 100 percent until the day you knew you needed \nit? This is a badly thought-out concept. Expanding risk pools in other \nways and helping fund and encourage those risk pools would have been \nthe better way to do that.\n  Being sure families still make family decisions about health care \ninstead of being told: No, there is only one option your health care \nplan that is defined by the government will pay for; encouraging \ncoverage available in other States, buying this product across State \nlines. There is no reason not to have a health care marketplace. It \ndoes not just have to be buying the product in the half dozen States \nthat touch Missouri, the six or seven States that touch Missouri. There \nis no reason it cannot be bought in a marketplace that is the national \nmarketplace. Competition produces better choices, and it also produces \nmore choices so you can look at the health care plan that is right for \nyour family or you as an individual, rather than the health care plan \nsome newly created board and agency said had to be the health care plan \nfor everyone to meet the new Federal Government standards.\n  Tax equity. If you buy a health care plan on your own, you should do \nthat with pretax dollars, just like the biggest corporations in America \nbuy health care for their employees with pretax dollars.\n  More transparency of how health care works. I would like to know, if \nI am on the way to get a health care procedure, I would like to know, \nbefore I leave to do that, what do people charge and what are their \nresults. Most trips for health care are not to the emergency room, they \nare planned trips for health care. Once you are in the car, if it means \ndriving another 20 minutes or 1 hour and 20 minutes to get to the place \nthat does a better job for less money, I think most Americans would do \nthat.\n  We know this. These factors are generally known. I remember a study \njust 1 year or so ago that was checking to see the survival rates for \ninhospital heart attacks based on the response time. That information \nis all available. At this point, it is available anonymously. But if it \nis available anonymously, it would also be available specifically.\n  More transparency in the system. How do you go to the place to get \nthe best results or, if the results are the same, how do you go to the \nplace that gets the best results for the better cost? When employers \nare telling us they are not hiring because of the uncertainty created \nby this law, when courts are ruling the law is unconstitutional or even \nwhen courts disagree on this topic--when some courts think it is \nunconstitutional and some think it is--when voters are overwhelmingly \nrejecting it every opportunity they have had at the polling place to \nvote on it, something is wrong with the direction we are headed.\n  Americans deserve a plan where the people are still in the driver's \nseat, where the people are bigger than the government, where the people \nare making decisions for themselves and their families about lots of \nthings but particularly about health care.\n  I am working and will keep working to repeal this bill and replace it \nwith policies that make more sense, policies that move us toward more \ncompetition, more transparency, and better health care. The anniversary \nof this signing next week would be better spent if we were all here \nnext week trying to come up with policies that make health care sense, \nthat make economic sense, that meet the constitutional standard, and \nstill keep people in charge of these important life-sustaining, health-\nsustaining decisions.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S1619]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/15/senate-section/article/S1619-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1619-S1620]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           ENERGY PRODUCTION\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I would like to speak this morning on an \nissue that I believe is of great importance to our economy and to our \nnational security. In recent weeks, we have seen political turmoil in \nLibya and Egypt and Tunisia and throughout the Middle East and other \nNorth African nations.\n  Only time will tell what the outcome of these historic events will \nbe. What is clear, however, is that there is, once again, disruption in \nthe worlds's petroleum supplies as a result of the turmoil in this \nregion of the world, and American consumers and businesses are feeling \nthe brunt of it.\n  In the United States, we have seen the price of gasoline and other \npetroleum products increase dramatically. The pain is particularly \nsharp at the pump.\n  Over the last few weeks, retail gasoline prices have risen to more \nthan $3.50 a gallon. They are expected to rise to more than $3.70 a \ngallon during the peak summer driving season and, of course, they could \ngo substantially higher. This is a reflection of what is happening in \nthe crude oil commodity markets around the world. In fact, the Energy \nInformation Administration's latest forecast of the average West Texas \nspot price for the remainder of this year increased from $93 a barrel \nto more than $100 a barrel. The EIA expects continued tightening of \nworld oil markets in the next 2 years in light of the events in North \nAfrica and in the Middle East.\n  For example, in Libya it is widely reported that much of the \ncountry's 1.6 million barrels a day of total production in 2010 has \nbeen largely shut down. It is unclear how long this will last. However, \nthe reality is that the problem is not a matter of current supply. \nPrices are going up not because of lack of supply but because of \nconcerns in the market about future supplies. Therefore, to address \nthis problem, we must increase domestic production. We must produce \nmore American energy, and we can do it.\n  Furthermore, taking steps now to create a legal, tax, and regulatory \nenvironment that will stimulate more domestic production will help take \npressure off prices even before that supply comes on line, as markets \nanticipate more production.\n  Of course, the opposite scenario exists today as markets anticipate \nless supply from the Middle East and they do not see the commitment \ndomestically to offset that reduction in supply. We must change that \nperception by taking real action to encourage production here at home. \nStalled energy projects and impediments to domestic oil production in \nour own country are costing our Nation's economy billions of dollars \nand millions of jobs.\n  A study released last week by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce says 351 \nenergy projects, both renewable and traditional, are stalled, at a cost \nof $1.1 trillion to the American economy and nearly 2 million jobs for \nthe American people. When we combine disruptions in foreign sources of \nproduction and a domestic market hobbled by bureaucracy and delays, the \nresult is higher energy prices, a sluggish economy, and fewer jobs. \nThat is exactly what we see happening. That should be a cause of huge \nconcern, but it should also be a huge call to action. There is a path \nout of this for America, a path we in my home State of North Dakota \nsuccessfully followed starting a decade ago by building a comprehensive \nenergy plan called Empower North Dakota.\n  Through Empower North Dakota, we worked to create a business climate \nthat incentivized energy companies across all industry sectors, \nincluding the oil industry, to invest in our State. We created the kind \nof legal, tax, and regulatory certainty that attracted capital, \nexpertise, and jobs to North Dakota. In fact, when we started 10 years \nago, oil companies had either left or they were leaving the oil-\nproducing region in our State, the Williston Basin. Why was that?\n  First, they were getting better returns elsewhere. Technology was \nlacking to produce oil economically from new formations. Companies were \ngoing to other places in the world where they could extract oil less \nexpensively. Second, data on confirmed reserves was lacking, and the \ntechnology to produce oil from shale wasn't sufficiently developed. \nThird, the workforce was aging, and we lacked the training and \neducation for new workers. And fourth, transport constraints limited \nproduction. In other words, there were better places for the industry \nto invest shareholder dollars and earn a return.\n  To turn that around, we built a climate for investment. We \nestablished an oil and gas research fund paid for by the industry. We \nput tax incentives in place. We initiated studies of the Bakken \nformation at the heart of the Williston Basin through the North Dakota \nGeological Survey. That was followed by a U.S. Geological Survey study. \nI have requested another USGS study I believe will demonstrate that we \nhave billions more in recoverable oil reserves in our State.\n  We also improved infrastructure. We created a pipeline authority to \nexpand transportation capacity, and we established a center of \nexcellence for petroleum safety and technology at Williston State \nCollege to train workers in oilfield drilling and recovery methods. \nBefore that we had to send workers to Wyoming or Oklahoma and other \nplaces for training and education. Now we do it in our State.\n  In response, our enhanced business environment drew investment \ncapital, technology, and ingenuity to Williston Basin which unlocked \nthe potential of North Dakota's oil patch. We took full advantage of \nthe Bakken and Three Forks, which are deep shale formations with \nbillions of barrels of oil locked away in porous rock, by using \ninnovative, unconventional technologies and with good environmental \nstewardship.\n  To release the oil, companies in North Dakota use hydraulic \nfracturing which involves pumping water under pressure deep into the \nEarth to crack the shale and release the crude oil. The water is then \nrecycled or deposited safely back into the ground 2 miles down, well \nbelow, far below the water table. Companies also use directional \ndrilling which enables drilling rigs to drill one vertical bore and \nmultiple horizontal bores deep in the ground, producing more oil with a \nsmaller footprint and, again, better environmental stewardship.\n  As a result, this year North Dakota will produce more than 120 \nmillion barrels of oil. That number is growing dramatically. This is \nsweet crude oil.\n  Since 2006, we have grown to become the fourth largest oil-producing \nState among all 50 States in the Union, passing States such as Oklahoma \nand most recently Louisiana. Bear in mind that in North Dakota the \nmeasures we took were not about government spending. They were about \ncreating an environment for private investment that generated revenues \nfor the State, broadened the economic base, and actually enabled us to \nreduce taxes. This isn't a Republican or a Democratic issue. It is an \nAmerican issue, and it will take both parties to fix it. That is why I \nam cosponsoring a bill with Senator Roberts that actually works with a \ndirective from President Obama.\n  The Regulatory Responsibility for Our Economy Act will give the force \nof law to a Presidential Executive order issued in January. The order \nproposes to review rules that may be outmoded, ineffective, or \nexcessively burdensome, and to modify, streamline, or repeal them. We \nare all committed to good environmental stewardship and effective \nconsumer protections. But the President's order acknowledges that \nFederal regulations are hindering the Nation's economic growth and our \nability to create jobs. The law we are proposing, if passed, will make \nsure we take a clear-eyed look at our rules and help to bring \nregulatory and legal certainty to the markets.\n  While we are working to produce more oil in America, with the right \napproach, with the approach I am describing, we can also enlist the \nhelp of our friend and close ally to the north, Canada. To do that, for \nexample, we need to complete some very ambitious projects that need \npermitting and approval. One example is the Keystone XL pipeline. This \n$12 billion, high-tech transcontinental petroleum pipeline is designed \nto carry crude from the Canadian oil sands in Alberta to the Gulf of \nMexico. As it passes through the Midwest, an onramp will receive \nmidwestern sweet crude from States such as North Dakota and Montana to \nmix with the heavier Canadian crude and send it to refineries that will \nturn it into gasoline and diesel fuel in America. With no overseas \ninvolvement, this\n\n[[Page S1620]]\n\none promising project would help double current flows of oil from \nCanada, which is already our No. 1 trading partner.\n  One estimate projects that the project will create--and these are \nnumbers the company has put forward in advancing this project--at least \n20,000 high-paying jobs during the construction phase and more than \n250,000 permanent jobs. It will spur more than $100 billion in annual \ntotal expenditures in the U.S. economy. It will generate $6.5 billion \nin new personal income for U.S. workers and their families, and it will \nstimulate nearly $600 million in revenue for State and local \ngovernments along its route.\n  Federal approval is something that will cost our Nation not one \npenny. What it will do, however, is create assurances in markets that \nthe energy we need to power our Nation will be there in the future, and \nit will be there when we need it. That in turn will help to reduce our \ndependence on unstable overseas regimes, hold down the cost of gasoline \nat the pump, and create thousands of good American jobs at a time when \nunemployment is still hovering at about 9 percent.\n  Keystone XL is just one example. Across America there are hundreds of \nprojects like it that could be advanced with good environmental \nstewardship and responsible oversight, if we resolve to do it and we \ncreate the climate to do it.\n  Today the United States, Canada, and Mexico combined produce 75 \npercent of the total oil we need. We can do much more. Our Nation needs \nto send a signal to energy markets that the United States is committed \nto a policy of aggressive domestic energy development by creating a \nstrong business environment and a pro-energy agenda, including the \nlegal, tax, and regulatory certainty companies need in order to make \nthe kinds of investments that will truly lessen our dependence on \nforeign oil.\n  We are at a moment in history when we can truly turn adversity into \nopportunity and potential into reality. I urge Members to seize this \nopportunity to make America stronger, safer, and more financially \nsecure with a comprehensive approach to truly develop American energy \nright here at home, to meet our needs both now and for future \ngenerations. We can do it. We must do it, for the well-being of our \ncountry today and for future generations.\n  I thank the Chair for this opportunity, yield the floor, and suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I appreciate the cooperation of both \nleaders to help us get to the floor this morning for a debate on this \nvery important piece of legislation and one that we have actually and, \nunfortunately, struggled with for the last two Congresses.\n  The Acting President pro tempore knows, as a member of the Small \nBusiness Committee and as a Senator from New Hampshire, how important \nthis piece of legislation is as we continue to fight--and that is what \nthe word is, ``fight''--to create jobs right here at home in America, \nnot just on Wall Street, not just in the fancy places, but on Main \nStreet in our hometowns all over America.\n  Senator Snowe and I are on the Senate floor today together, happily, \nto talk about a bill into which she has put a tremendous amount of time \nand effort before as the chair of the committee. I serve as the chair \nof the committee, and she is my very able ranking member. Together our \nstaffs have worked very closely for a long period of time to try to \nfashion the compromise that is before the Senate today.\n  I thank the 84, I believe, Members of the Senate who voted for \ncloture last night. I know the rules of the Senate are strange, still, \nto many Americans. But we cannot operate without unanimous consent. So \nit takes an extra special level of cooperation. While we did not get \neveryone last night to go on the record, we did get the prerequisite \nnumber--above 60--to move to this debate. I am hoping our amendment \nprocess can be very smooth, that we stay focused on small business-\nrelated amendments, that we work in good faith, and, hopefully, in the \nnext couple of days we can get this bill off the floor because this is \na job creator.\n\n[[Page S1632]]\n\n  One of the Senators was here earlier this morning talking about \ncreating an atmosphere for job growth and development. Tax codes do \nsome of that, Federal investments in infrastructure do that, \ninvestments in education do that. But one other thing that does it is \nfashioning Federal programs that work for the job creators of America, \nand that is what the SBIR Program does and the STTR Program does. It is \nthe Federal Government's largest research and development investment \nprogram for small businesses. It was created actually 30 years ago, and \nthe idea developed from one of our outstanding Federal workers.\n  Roland Tibbetts was a staffer at the National Science Foundation. He \ntook the lead in 1976 in directing a greater and more significant share \nof the research and development budget of the National Science \nFoundation and directed it to small business in a new innovation \nprogram.\n  Why did he do this? He did it because from his position, directing a \nvery established and strong research component, he saw the Federal \nGovernment giving most of its awards to large businesses. I think--\nalthough I have not spoken to him personally; but I most certainly \nintend to because he has testified before former committees--I am \nimagining he probably had a heart for actually wanting to find cures \nfor some diseases and realized that not all of that technology and \ninnovation rested with the large companies; that, in fact, there might \nbe small pharmaceutical companies or brilliant scientists in Maine or \nin New Hampshire or in Louisiana who had discovered or had the \npotential to discover something that could be transformative. So this \nstaffer said: Let's set aside or direct a small portion, but an \nimportant portion, to small businesses. That is how this program began.\n  I am so pleased with this funding, which only government can do. Only \ngovernment can do this. There are certain things the private sector \ndoes well. They do venture capital when an idea has been proven or when \nthe potential has clearly been established or when the potential is at \nleast clearly established in the mind of one or two individuals--such \nas the guy who created Facebook or Bill Gates with Microsoft. But \nmostly great ideas need early, patient capital--very risky, but when it \nhits, it hits big.\n  That is what this program does. It sets aside 2.5 to 3 percent of all \nthe research and development budgets of all the Federal agencies \nranging from the Department of Defense, which is about $1 billion that \nwould be contributed to this program, down to the smaller agencies, \nwhich have maybe up to a couple million dollars in their research \nbudgets. But out of that very pilot-like initiative back in 1976, that \nwas focused on discovering, funding, and evaluating the initial highest \nrisk, most cost-cutting exploratory research that is necessary to \nachieve significant technological innovations and breakthroughs, this \nprogram was created.\n  Let me share with you what a gentleman who testified before our \ncommittee--we have had several hearings on this particular program, and \nno program is perfect. Let me begin with this: This program is not \nperfect. But we are perfecting it as we bring this bill to you. We have \nlooked at its weaknesses. We have tried in our reauthorization to \ncorrect those, to firm those up. But the gentleman who is actually \nprobably the leading expert on this program, Dr. Wessner, of the \nNational Research Council, recently testified before our committee. He \nsaid:\n\n       An important point to keep in mind is [that] you can have \n     really good ideas that die. They will die because they do not \n     have funding.\n\n  Not because they do not have potential but because they do not have \nfunding. I would add to this, particularly in this time of recession \nand tightening back on capital and the closing down of credit card \nlending: If you think it is normally tough for entrepreneurs and \ninnovators and discoverers and inventors to get capital, it has been a \nvery rocky road in the last year or two. So he said these ideas just \ndie.\n  He said:\n\n       SBIR brings capital to transform those ideas into \n     innovations. You are not done then . . . but that gets you \n     the innovation and product development and the start of the \n     uptake. . . . The rest of the world thinks this is the \n     greatest thing since sliced bread. . . . The rest of the \n     world is copying it, putting it on steroids, while we are \n     debating it.\n\n  That is the point I want to make. We have debated the reauthorization \nof this legislation for 6 years. The time has come to stop the debate, \npass the bill, and recognize this is a world model. No program is \nperfect. But the wisdom and the importance of setting aside a small \nportion of the research and development programs of all the Federal \nagencies, and then to train our workforce and our managers to look out, \nseek, and find some of the interesting technologies that could be \ncreated and grow into big businesses is very forward thinking, and we \nshould be very grateful to Roland Tibbetts and the Senators and \nRepresentatives who started this program.\n  Senator Warren Rudman took this idea, saw this pilot program, and \nmade it a national program. We have him and others to thank for the \njobs, the businesses that have been created.\n  Let me give you one example. The founder of Qualcomm came and \ntestified before our committee. Qualcomm is a very famous business. It \ndeveloped a lot of technologies that made wireless communications \npossible. It started 25 years ago in the den of its founder, Dr. \nJacobs. He testified before the committee and said basically Qualcomm \nwas just at one time, 25 years ago, an exciting new idea. It was not a \ncompany. It was not a business. He and 35 of his colleagues consulted \nand talked about the new technologies they were seeing. They got an \nSBIR grant of $150,000, and then they were subsequently awarded, \nbecause they developed the idea, to $1.5 million. They got another \ngrant, which are the limits of the program. This program has limits. \nYou have to test your idea, and then you come back for phase II \nfunding.\n  Well, Qualcomm now employs 17,500 people. They are operating in 22 \ncountries. They paid more in taxes last year to local, State, and \nFederal governments than 50 percent of the cost of this entire program. \nSo that is one success story. That is what I mean when I say: When it \nhits, it hits big.\n  Now, not every company will turn into Qualcomm. But without programs \nlike this, there is what they call a valley of death. There are ideas \nthat are created out of the minds and hearts of Americans who have been \nwell educated, raised to believe that dreams come true, and are \nencouraged to risk. We are natural risk takers. We have these ideas and \nthese innovations. But what happens is, if there is not that important, \nearly funding to develop that kind of science and technology, in large \nmeasure some of these ideas just fall into the valley of death. We are \ngoing to catch them. That is what this bill does. It is what it \nattempts to do.\n  So as it has grown and developed--and we have reauthorized it over \nthe years--there have been some important changes and improvements.\n  I am going to recognize the ranking member, but I want to finish up \nin just a few minutes.\n  In 1980, the White House Conference on Small Business echoed these \nsentiments, recognized the value of the program. The end result of the \nrecommendation was this program, as I said, first authored by Senator \nWarren Rudman. It had 84 cosponsors, 8 of whom are still serving in the \nSenate: Senator Baucus, Senator Cochran, Senator Grassley, Senator \nHatch, Senator Inouye, Senator Leahy, Senator Levin, and Senator Lugar. \nThey all were original sponsors of this bill. I hope they are proud. In \ntheir careers they have sponsored many bills. I hope they are proud of \nthis one because it has done its job and it has helped America to \ncontinue to honor our entrepreneurs and our inventors.\n\n  As I mentioned, Senator Rudman, a Republican from New Hampshire, and \nonce a member of our committee, was the Senate champion for the \ncreation of the SBIR and STTR Programs. He was a true statesman--a man \nof vision with regard to the importance of technology to our economy. I \nwish to quote him as we begin this debate:\n\n       The issue addressed in Senate bill 881--\n\n  The bill at the time--\n\n     is one which plays an underlying role in the ability of this \n     Nation to maintain its security to achieve energy \n     independence, increase productivity, and preserve the quality \n     of life we all enjoy. Our national strength and confidence in \n     these areas depend upon maintaining a leading role in \n     technological superiority.\n\n\n[[Page S1633]]\n\n\n  That is what he said in his opening statement at the Senate \nSubcommittee on Innovation and Technology on June 30, 1981.\n  Senator Snowe was in the House at the time. She was a Congresswoman \nwhen President Reagan signed this legislation, creating it in 1982. She \nquoted from President Reagan. I know she will probably remember this \nand I think it is worth repeating:\n\n       Our nation is blessed with two important qualities that are \n     often missing in other societies, our spirit of \n     entrepreneurship and our capacity for invention and \n     innovation. These two elements are combined in the small \n     businesses that dot our land.\n\n  I am proud to bring this bill to the floor. It has had \nextraordinarily positive and noble champions since its beginning. As I \nsaid, no program is perfect, but we have tried in this reauthorization \nto look at the places where the program is weak and strengthen it. I \nwill go through some of those details in the latter part of the \nafternoon. But for an overview this morning, I wanted to give more of a \nhistorical context of this bill, and to thank the Members for moving so \nquickly at our request to the bill.\n  I look forward to the debate. I hope Members will be responsible in \noffering their amendments. I know the time for debate on the floor is \nprecious. We wish to limit debate to be focused around the principles, \nat least, and the details of this bill as best we can so we can get \nthis program reauthorized. Then we can continue to be the leaders in \ncutting-edge innovation, and the Federal Government can do its part--an \nimportant part--that venture capitalists can't do, big banks don't want \nto do, investment bankers aren't made to do, and small community banks \ndon't do in this kind of lending. Only patient, directed capital can \ngive that boost over the valley of death and create that bridge so \nsmall businesses and our scientists and engineers can walk over it \nsafely.\n  I wish to recognize at this time my ranking member and thank her for \nher support of this legislation from its beginning and her championship \nto this day.\n  For clarification purposes, the time until noon will be for debate \nonly and no amendments until after lunch.\n  I yield to Senator Snowe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, first I wish to commend the Chair of the \nSmall Business Committee. She has done an extraordinary job in bringing \nthis legislation to the floor in a bipartisan fashion, which I think is \nso essential to ensuring the passage of this legislation which, suffice \nit to say, has been long overdue. It has been on a long journey since \n2008 in terms of extensions and reextensions, but we have never been \nable to accomplish a reauthorization for a variety of reasons which I \nwill explain later in my statement. But I do wish to congratulate the \nChair for working mightily on both sides of the aisle and in the \ncommittee, accommodating bipartisanship by allowing the new members of \nthe committee--particularly on our side of the aisle where we have five \nnew members of the committee--who were not able to have the opportunity \nto review this legislation as new Members of the Senate because we had \npassed this unanimously in the last session of Congress. So she did \nhold a hearing and a markup to accommodate those views and give them a \nchance to review this legislation as well as to amend it in the \ncommittee. I know some of the Members will have amendments they will \noffer on the floor as well. So I wish to thank the Chair for \naccommodating those various issues and the members of the committee as \nthey attempted their new duties as members of the Small Business \nCommittee.\n  I also wish to thank the Chair for working through these issues \ndiligently, because these are two critical programs, as she indicated \nin her opening statement, that are crucial to small businesses, but \nalso important to innovation in America.\n  Reauthorizing both the SBIR and the STTR Programs represents a \nprofound opportunity for us to reaffirm the truth in the optimistic \nvision of America that indeed it is small businesses that are going to \nmake the contributions not only for job creation but through their \ninnovation and inventions, as the Chair mentioned, with President \nReagan's comments many years ago. That is why I am very excited about \nreauthorizing these programs, which foster an environment of innovative \nentrepreneurship by directing more than $2 billion annually in Federal \nresearch and development funding to the Nation's small firms most \nlikely to create jobs and commercialize their products.\n  Small businesses are our Nation's job generators, employing more than \nhalf of all private-sector employees and creating 64 percent of the net \nnew jobs over the past 15 years. They also represent 99.7 percent of \nall employer firms. Furthermore, small businesses are our Nation's most \neffective innovators, producing roughly 13 times more patents per \nemployee than large firms--patents which are at least two times as \nlikely to be among the top 1 percent of high-impact patents. Recipients \nof both of these programs have produced more than 85,000 patents and \nhave generated millions of well-paying jobs across all 50 States. It is \ncrucial, then, that both of these programs--one of the strongest \nexamples of a successful public-private partnership--be a key part of \nour job creation agenda.\n  The SBIR program got its start at the National Science Foundation \nback in 1976 following growing concerns that small businesses were not \nreceiving an adequate share of Federal research and development funding \ndespite their prominent role in innovation. It was officially \nestablished in law as part of the Small Business Innovation Development \nAct of 1982. As the Chair indicated, I was an original cosponsor in the \nHouse--hopefully that is not dating myself too much--which set four \ngoals for the program: stimulate technological innovation; use small \nbusiness to meet Federal R funds; foster and encourage participation \nby minority and disadvantaged persons in the technological innovation; \nand increase private-sector commercialization of innovation derived \nfrom Federal R\n  The STTR program was established in 1992 to complement the SBIR \nprogram by stimulating partnerships between small businesses and \nnonprofit research institutions such as universities and research \nlaboratories. Together, these vital job creation programs have provided \nsmall firms with over $28 billion during their lifespans.\n  These programs have been front and center in improving our Nation's \ncapacity to be innovative. According to a report by the Information \nTechnology and Innovation Foundation, SBIR-backed firms have been \nresponsible for roughly 25 percent of the Nation's most crucial \ninnovations over the past decade--``a powerful indication that the SBIR \nprogram has become a key force in the innovation economy of the United \nStates.''\n  Furthermore, a comprehensive 2008 National Academy of Sciences study \nof the SBIR program noted that more than 20 percent of companies \nresponding to their survey noted they were founded entirely, or at \nleast in part, because of a prospective SBIR award, and a full two-\nthirds said the projects they performed would not have taken place \nwithout the funding. Just under half of the projects pursued in the \nSBIR program reached the marketplace, bringing countless new \ninnovations to our everyday lives. Additionally, the study noted that \nover one-third of the companies awarded SBIR funding participate in the \nprogram for the first time each year, thus . . . ``encouraging \ninnovation across a broad spectrum of firms.'' It concludes that SBIR \nis ``sound in concept and effective in practice.''\n  In fact, there is a wide range of remarkable success stories \nassociated with the SBIR program, including Qualcomm, which the Chair \nmentioned, which is a remarkable story. Qualcomm received roughly $1.5 \nbillion in SBIR grants to pursue several innovative programs and \ndevelop breakthrough technologies. Now it employs 17,500 individuals \nworldwide with an annual revenue of $11 billion. In fiscal year 2010 \nalone, Qualcomm paid $1.4 billion in Federal, State, and local taxes--a \nsignificant return on investment.\n  Another example of SBIR's success is LASIK eye surgery. The company \nbehind the technology for the procedure received SBIR awards from both \nNASA and the Department of Defense. In the 1980s, NASA awarded funding \nfor a project developing technology for\n\n[[Page S1634]]\n\ndocking of space vehicles to satellites by pointing laser beams. This \nconcept was then applied to develop LASIK, which corrects vision \nproblems.\n  The technology that went into the Sonicare electronic toothbrush was \nfunded by an SBIR award. According to NIH, which made the award, SBIR \nfunding allowed the firm that developed the technology to create a $300 \nmillion business, employing over 500 individuals.\n  In my home State of Maine, Tex Tech Industries has researched and \ndeveloped high-tech textiles that are used in body armor for U.S. \ntroops and bulletproof vests for public safety personnel. Tex Tech also \ndeveloped a fire-resistant material to be used as the primary fire \nbarrier in the seating cabins of new commercial aircraft.\n  Additionally, BioSciCon in Maryland is responsible for the MarkPap \nsystem, which is a diagnostic device that tests for cervical cancer and \ncan be used as a research tool to improve cervical cancer screening.\n  Other companies such as Symantec, which makes antivirus software for \ncomputers, and Genzyme, one of the world's leading biotechnology firms, \nall received SBIR funding at some point during their formative years. \nSome of these firms are now household names; others are still small \nbusinesses with a plethora of novel ideas.\n  As these examples demonstrate, SBIR funding has helped small \nbusinesses nationwide develop incredible breakthrough technologies for \na whole host of applications. These are innovations we use in our \neveryday lives, that help strengthen our national defense, improve our \nhealth, and boost our competitiveness. Regrettably the SBIR program \nexpired in September 2008 and has been subject to a series of 10 short-\nterm, temporary extensions since then, plaguing the programs with \nuncertainty and potentially dissuading some of our Nation's most \npromising firms from participating in them. This is legislation that \nour committee has worked to have signed into law for nearly 6 years--\nsince the time, in fact, when I was chair of the committee. Indeed, we \npassed legislation out of the Small Business Committee unanimously in \n2006 to preempt this stalemate by making improvements to the program \nand doubling the SBIR allocation from 2.5 percent to 5 percent over 5 \nyears, and doubling the STTR allocation immediately.\n  Last Congress, with our Chair, we once again passed legislation out \nof our committee unanimously which was very similar to the bill we \nreported out in the previous Congress. Specifically, it maintained the \nallocation increases spread out incrementally that had been developed \nin the previous Congress as a compromise, as well as the 18-and-8 \ncompromise on the venture capital issue. This time, the full Senate \npassed the legislation unanimously and sent it to the House of \nRepresentatives, where the bill sat.\n  The legislation we are debating today is very similar to the bill we \npassed out unanimously 3 months ago. But we have already wasted too \nmuch time over the past several years, and it is now vitally critical \nthat we act now and pass this legislation to provide these crucial \ninnovation initiatives with certainty for the future. As the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce has noted:\n\n       [E]ven though this important program for the small business \n     has a proven track record of success, its full potential has \n     been held hostage by a series of short-term reauthorizations \n     which has created uncertainty for SBIR program managers and \n     limitations for potential small business grant recipients.\n\n  As in the previous two Congresses, our legislation increases the \nallocation for SBIR from 2.5 percent of an agency's extramural research \nand development to 3.5 percent for over 10 years, and doubles the STTR \nallocations from 0.3 to 0.6 percent over 5 years. This means the \nFederal Government can make more awards to a greater number of small \nbusinesses out of its existing research and development budget. It \nwould also codify increased award sizes of $150,000 for phase I and $1 \nmillion for phase II in the SBIR program, and apply those levels to the \nSTTR program as well to adjust for inflation. The last statutory \nincrease in award sizes for the SBIR program was 19 years ago as part \nof the 1992 reauthorization.\n  It is critical that we bring the program into the 21st century to \nacknowledge the growing costs of quality research.\n  Furthermore, in December, Chair Landrieu and I sent a letter to SBA \nAdministrator Karen Mills stating that rooting out fraud and abuse in \nthe agency's program will be our committee's first priority this \nCongress. To that end, this bill includes stringent oversight and fraud \nprevention measures, requiring inspectors general of participating \nFederal agencies to establish fraud detection measures.\n  In a similar vein, the legislation includes a series of data-\ncollection provisions that we worked on with Senator Coburn to ensure \nwe have a better base of information to use when considering future \npolicy changes to the programs and engaging in necessary oversight.\n  This reauthorization act contains an unprecedented compromise on the \nventure capital issue which has long bogged down any serious progress \nin reauthorizing these valuable programs. It would make firms majority \nowned by multiple venture capital companies eligible for up to 25 \npercent of SBIR funds at the National Institute of Health, National \nScience Foundation, and Department of Energy, and up to 15 percent of \nthe funds at the remaining agencies. My longstanding guiding principle \non reauthorization of these programs has been simple: These are small \nbusiness programs, not big business programs or venture capital \nprograms. I have worked closely with Chair Landrieu to ensure changes \nwe make to these programs keep it squarely as a small business program. \nThe unprecedented landmark compromise on the venture capital issue \npasses this test. Our compromise has the backing of diverse \nstakeholders, from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, NFIB, Small Business \nTechnology Council, to the Biotechnology Industry Organization, the \nNational Venture Capital Association, and a whole host of other \norganizations, as we can see on this chart.\n  It is critical to note that funding for both of these programs is \nmeant to serve as early-stage seed capital for eligible small \nbusinesses. In general, venture capital companies invest in firms that \nare further along in their development and commercialization, and they \nfocus on larger investments that are easier to manage than is normally \nappropriate for many small, innovative technology firms. Nonetheless, \nparticularly for firms in the biotechnology industry, venture capital \ninvestment is essentially a necessity to commercialize their \ntechnology.\n  Here is what some of the groups endorsing our legislation have to say \nabout the compromise we arrived at. Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record letters of support we have \nreceived regarding this legislation, as well as the report from the \nInformation Technology and Innovation Foundation I referenced earlier.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        Chamber of Commerce of the\n\n\n                                     United States of America,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 8, 2011.\n     Hon. Mary L. Landrieu,\n     Chairwoman, Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Olympia J. Snowe,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Small Business and \n         Entrepreneurship, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairwoman Landrieu and Ranking Member Snowe: The U.S. \n     Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest business federation \n     representing the interests of more than three million \n     businesses and organizations of every size, sector, and \n     region, strongly supports S. 493, the ``SBIR/STTR \n     Reauthorization Act of 2011,'' which, if enacted into law, \n     would unleash the innovative talents of our nation's \n     entrepreneurs to help create jobs and revive the economy.\n       The Small Business Innovative Research Program (SBIR) \n     serves as an important avenue by which agencies harness the \n     creativity and ingenuity of small business to meet specific \n     research and development needs of the Federal government. In \n     effect, this program requires federal agencies with a certain \n     level of research dollars to give a small percentage of those \n     dollars to small businesses through a competitive grant \n     process.\n       Even though this important program for small business has a \n     proven track record of success, its full potential has been \n     held hostage by a series of short-term reauthorizations which \n     has created uncertainty for SBIR program managers and \n     limitations for potential small business grant recipients. \n     This landmark compromise bill, if passed into law, would \n     unlock the door for entry for businesses that acquire equity \n     funding\n\n[[Page S1635]]\n\n     through venture capital firms without diminishing the \n     programs effectiveness for traditional small businesses, thus \n     setting the stage for a robust and revitalized SBIR program.\n       Ninety-six percent of the Chamber's members are small \n     businesses with fewer than one-hundred employees. On behalf \n     of our smaller members, we thank you for introducing the \n     ``SBIR/STTR Reauthorization Act of 2011'' and look forward to \n     working with you to expeditiously pass it into law.\n           Sincerely,\n     R. Bruce Josten.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                      CONNECT,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 8, 2011.\n     Hon. Mary Landrieu,\n     Hon. Olympia Snowe,\n     U.S. Senate, Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee, \n         Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chair Landrieu and Ranking Member Snowe: As the \n     Committee meets to markup S. 493--the SBIR/STTR \n     Reauthorization Act of 2011, I write to introduce you to \n     CONNECT and to encourage the Committee's support of S. 493 \n     since the bill will have a positive impact in the formation \n     of start-up technology companies. The formation of such \n     companies will create jobs and help rejuvenate the American \n     economy. We appreciate your strong and consistent leadership \n     in shepherding previous versions of this reauthorization \n     through the Committee and the Senate floor.\n       CONNECT is an innovation accelerator with the mission to \n     assist entrepreneurs in their efforts to propel creative \n     ideas and emerging technologies to the marketplace. As a \n     regional innovation development organization, our \n     commercialization efforts in Southern California span the \n     spectrum of technologies from IT, wireless health, software, \n     clean energy, environmental, life sciences/biotech, defense \n     and security, and sports/action technologies. Over the last \n     25 years, CONNECT's commercialization capacity-building model \n     has helped over 2,000 start-ups and has been replicated in \n     numerous U.S. cities, states and regions, as well as \n     overseas.\n       From our experience, CONNECT knows that the Small Business \n     Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer \n     programs can be advantageous to start-up formation, thus \n     CONNECT's interest in S. 493 is profound. Because acquiring \n     funding through traditional lending sources continues to \n     prove difficult in today's tight credit market, SBIR/STTR \n     grants provide tech start-up companies another viable chance \n     to compete for early-stage funding.\n       We recognize the delicate balance that S. 493 strikes \n     related to the issue of venture- backed applicants and are \n     grateful for the efforts made to reach an agreement. However, \n     we encourage the Committee to explore a more robust approach \n     that would increase the percentage of funds available to VC-\n     backed applicants because such applicants provide extra value \n     to the American taxpayer. Given that venture capital firms \n     conduct extensive due diligence reviews before investing, \n     venture-backed applicants have already demonstrated a strong \n     business plan by which to break into an industry sector. In \n     this time when the federal dollar needs to return revenues to \n     the Treasury, allowing for more VC-backed applicants \n     increases the likelihood that SBIR/STTR funds will create new \n     jobs and grow companies in a way that will generate new tax \n     revenue.\n       The Committee is right on point in proposing to increase \n     award amounts and adding new data collection, reporting \n     requirements, and performance metrics to ensure the SBIR/STTR \n     missions are being upheld. Although the SBIR program \n     allocation increase of 1% is critically important, such \n     allocation presents another opportunity for the Committee to \n     explore a more robust expansion. Because the 1% increase is \n     spread evenly over 10 years, further adjusting the increase \n     would give stakeholders plenty of notice to plan accordingly.\n       As the bill moves to the floor, we'd like to suggest one \n     new proposal that could be added to a Manager's Amendment. We \n     continue to hear that one of the major costs that start-ups \n     face are the legal costs to secure intellectual property \n     rights through the patent and trademark application process. \n     Because IP is indispensable for a start-up's growth, the \n     Committee should consider allowing a percentage of Phase I \n     awards (possibly up to one third) to be directed toward IP \n     acquisition.\n       Again, thank you for your work to advance the cause of \n     SBIR/STTR reauthorization. We are ready to assist you, your \n     staff, and other Committee members as the bill moves onto the \n     Senate floor.\n           Best wishes,\n                                                Timothy Tardibono,\n     Director of Public Policy.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                 DAWNBREAKER  \n\n                               Rochester, New York, March 8, 2011.\n     Hon.

Snowe,\n     Ranking Member, U.S. Senate, Committee on Small Business and \n         Entrepreneurship, Russell Senate Office Bldg., \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairwoman Landrieu and Ranking Member Snowe: I am \n     writing to express my support for S. 493, the ``SBIR and STTR \n     Reauthorization Act of 2011.'' In 2008, the National Research \n     Council completed a comprehensive assessment of the SBIR \n     program and found the program to be, ``sound in concept and \n     effective in practice.'' Reflecting the sentiment of the NRC \n     study, S. 493 preserves the program's concept and improves \n     its effectiveness.\n       This legislation ensures the economic engine of our \n     nation--small businesses--will have access to a larger share \n     of federal research funding. This is timely and necessary \n     given the fragile state of our economy. These programs play a \n     critical role in our innovation ecosystem by providing \n     important competitively awarded seed funding for promising \n     innovative ideas. With proper nurturing, these ideas will \n     grow into engines of economic growth and the solutions for \n     tomorrow's most pressing technological challenges.\n       Dawnbreaker is a small women-owned business and we have had \n     the great fortune to work side-by-side with more than 3,000 \n     SBIR recipients since 1992. We consistently hear from SBIR \n     awardees about the need for increased award levels so they \n     can further the maturation of their technologies; more \n     efficient program management across the agencies; and, the \n     need for additional commercialization support--this bill \n     remedies these concerns and accomplishes a lot more.\n       S. 493 ensures that our nation's most important small \n     business research and development program will continue while \n     operating more efficiently. Dawnbreaker supports S. 493, and \n     we thank you both for your efforts to see this deserving \n     program reauthorized and improved.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Jenny C.

Mary Landrieu,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Landrieu: Small Business California supports \n     greater private sector participation in the market for \n     Federal Research and Development, and especially increased \n     engagement of small businesses through open, merit-based, and \n     competitive bidding.\n       The R dollars spent at small business deliver outsized \n     returns. As of 2005, the Small Business Innovation Research \n     (SBIR) program has created over 87,000 patents. Overhead \n     rates at many small companies are 1/2 to 1/3rd of the \n     administrative costs typical of larger organizations.\n       The employment of scientists and engineers at small \n     companies has grown rapidly over the last 20 years, now \n     accounting for more than 50% of scientists and engineers in \n     the United States. Nothing could be more critical to the \n     competitiveness of the United States than to open the Federal \n     marketplace to participation by the fastest growing and the \n     most productive sector of the economy, America's small \n     businesses.\n       Small Business California is therefore pleased to support \n     S. 493 to reauthorize the highly successful SBIR program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Scott Hauge,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       National Defense Industrial\n\n\n                                                  Association,\n\n                                     Arlington, VA, March 8, 2011.\n     Hon. Mary L. Landrieu,\n     United States Senate, Senate Committee on Small Business and \n         Entrepreneurship,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Chairwoman: On behalf of the 1,743 corporate \n     members and over 87,755 individual members of the National \n     Defense Industrial Association (NDIA), I am writing to \n     express our support for S. 493, the SBIR/STIR Reauthorization \n     Act of 2011.\n       Small business represents about two thirds of NDIA's total \n     membership and we regard the SBIR program as the nation's \n     most viable tool in leveraging small business resources that \n     employ about half of the U.S. workforce. American small \n     businesses currently employ more than half of all U.S. \n     scientists and engineers, yet have access to less than five \n     percent of government research and development funds. One \n     critical access point to those funds is the SBIR Program. \n     SBIR awards have led to important developments in \n     technologies that directly supported our war fighters.\n       As I have previously testified before Congress, NDIA has a \n     laser focus on American competitiveness in a global defense \n     industry that increasingly challenges our members for \n     primacy. We have therefore concluded that small business \n     resources offer our defense industry the competitive \n     advantages needed in these especially difficult economic \n     times.\n       Madam Chairwoman, NDIA and its member companies support S. \n     493 and urge the Senate to consider this bill as promptly as \n     possible. We thank you for your leadership and commitment to \n     work in support of small businesses.\n       If NDIA can be of any further assistance, please feel free \n     to have a member of your staff contact Mr. Peter Steffes, \n     Vice President Government Policy for NDIA.\n           Sincerely and respectfully,\n\n                                     Lawrence P.

Mary L. Landrieu,\n     Chair, Committee on Small Business & Entrepreneurship, United \n         States Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Landrieu: The New England Innovation Alliance \n     represents scores of small high technology businesses with a \n     vital interest in the SBIR and STTR programs. We know that \n     you understand how important this program is in creating \n     advanced technologies, products and jobs. However, SBIR and \n     STTR have been operating under ten continuing resolutions \n     since 2008. It is scheduled to expire on May 31, 2011. This \n     uncertainty has adversely affected small business and the \n     SBIR/STTR program, and it needs to be reauthorized \n     immediately.\n       It should be noted that NEIA companies have worked closely \n     with university researchers across the country, providing \n     over $50M in subcontracts to more than 60 universities over \n     the past five years. We believe that small high tech \n     companies and the SBIR/STTR program provide the ideal bridge \n     from academia to the marketplace, while providing future \n     employment to tens of thousands of science and engineering \n     graduates.\n       The New England Innovation Alliance supports the passage of \n     Senate Bill S. 493.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                  Robert F.

Mary L. Landrieu,\n     Chairwoman, Senate Small Business Committee, U.S. Senate, \n         Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Olympia J. Snowe,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Senate Small Business Committee, \n         U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senators Landrieu and Snowe: On behalf of the National \n     Venture Capital Association (NVCA) and its members, I am \n     writing in support of Senate passage of S. 493, the SBIR/STTR \n     Reauthorization Act of 2011, which reauthorizes the Small \n     Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business \n     Technology Transfer (STTR) programs. This legislation \n     represents a fair compromise to ensure that America's most \n     innovative small businesses can once again have access to \n     existing government incentives to grow jobs by \n     commercializing new discoveries.\n       In particular, NVCA supports the bill's provisions allowing \n     greater access to SBIR funds for majority owned venture-\n     backed small businesses and fixing the affiliation rules to \n     ensure these companies will be able to once again participate \n     in the program. Many small businesses that are developing \n     truly disruptive innovations rely on venture capital \n     investment to help bring breakthrough products to market and \n     grow U.S. jobs. The legislation will correct a regulatory \n     interpretation made by SBA in 2003 which revoked the \n     eligibility of many venture-backed companies from \n     participating in the program. This compromise will help to \n     ensure that small U.S. venture-backed companies have \n     increased access to capital for meritorious cutting-edge \n     early-stage research.\n       At a time when our country needs to build new businesses, \n     the venture capital industry believes that the best use of \n     government dollars is to leverage public/private partnerships \n     and we are committed to working with the government to bring \n     a steady stream of innovation and economic value to market. \n     S. 493 is a positive step forward to allow venture-backed \n     companies to have a fair chance to thrive under the SBIR \n     program alongside non-venture-backed counterparts. Doing so \n     will only strengthen the future success of the program.\n       For these reasons, I hope the Senate will move quickly and \n     pass S. 493, the SBIR/STTR Reauthorization Act of 2011, and \n     work with the House on an appropriate compromise prior to the \n     May 31, 2011 reauthorization deadline.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Mark G. Heesen,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    Small Business\n\n\n                                           Technology Council,\n\n                                                    March 7, 2011.\n     Hon. Mary Landrieu,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Landrieu: As the nation's largest tech-\n     oriented small business organization representing diverse \n     industries, the Small Business Technology Council (SBTC) \n     would like to express its support on behalf of its members \n     for S. 493, ``The SBIR/STTR Reauthorization Act of 2011''. \n     This bipartisan legislation is the result of years of \n     negotiations and compromise between both parties and the many \n     organizations that have a stake in this program. It is thanks \n     to the hard work and leadership of yourself and Ranking \n     Member Snowe that an agreement between those stakeholders was \n     finally reached.\n       The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program is \n     one of the most successful innovation programs in the \n     country, providing technology-oriented small businesses with \n     seed-stage R funding that they otherwise would not have \n     access to. It has been praised by multiple studies from the \n     National Academies of Science, and has inspired similar \n     programs in foreign countries such as the UK, Japan, South \n     Korea, and the Netherlands. Not only does this program spur \n     technological innovation and entrepreneurship, it helps \n     create high-tech jobs, and does so without increasing Federal \n     spending.\n       This program is currently under its 10th continuing \n     resolution, and is set to expire on May 31, 2011. While most \n     agree this is a good program that deserves to be \n     reauthorized, disputes over what should be in the \n     reauthorization legislation and proposed changes to the \n     program have held it up until now. Those disputes have \n     finally been resolved, and the current legislation is \n     supported by all stakeholders. It has been over two years \n     since the last reauthorization period ended, and after years \n     of uncertainty and short-term continuing resolutions, the \n     SBTC asks all Senators to support S. 493, and urges the swift \n     passage of this important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Jere W.

Mary Landrieu,\n     Chair, U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business and \n         Entrepreneurship, Russell Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Olympia Snowe,\n     Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business and \n         Entrepreneurship, Russell Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chair Landrieu and Ranking Member Snowe: On behalf of \n     the Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) and our more \n     than 1,100 biotechnology companies, academic institutions, \n     state biotechnology centers and related organizations, I am \n     writing in support of S. 493, legislation to reauthorize the \n     Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business \n     Technology Transfer Program (STTR) programs. This bill \n     represents a balanced approach to ensure that America's most \n     innovative small businesses can access existing incentives to \n     grow jobs by commercializing new discoveries. As such, I \n     commend you for your introduction of S. 493 and I urge the \n     committee to favorably report the legislation to the full \n     Senate for prompt consideration.\n       In particular, I am writing in support of the bill's \n     provisions allowing greater access to SBIR funds for small \n     businesses reliant upon venture capital financing. Small \n     biotechnology, medical device and other life sciences firms \n     increasingly rely on venture capital investments to fund \n     research and development. The legislation will correct a \n     regulatory interpretation made by SBA in 2003 which revoked \n     the eligibility of many venture capital-reliant small \n     companies from participating in the SBIR and STTR programs \n     over the last several years. This provision will ensure that \n     many of America's most innovative small businesses are not \n     excluded simply because of how they raise capital and can \n     once again compete in the SBIR and STTR programs based on \n     scientific merit. The legislation will help to ensure that \n     small, U.S. biotech companies have increased access to \n     capital for meritorious cutting-edge, early-stage research.\n       Small biotechnology companies face the constant challenge \n     of raising sufficient capital to fund biomedical research. \n     This funding shortage is most acute for research projects at \n     the earliest stages, exactly the point at which SBIR funds \n     can be most productive in fostering science and innovation. \n     By filling this market gap, SBIR funds have helped small \n     biotechnology companies continue lines of medical research \n     that might otherwise go unfunded. The legislation will \n     increase access to critical, early-stage sources of funding \n     for small businesses, including small biotechnology firms, \n     thus facilitating economic growth, job creation, new \n     breakthrough therapies for patients in need, and American \n     economic competitiveness in the global economy. This is \n     exactly the intent of the SBIR program, as created in 1982.\n       S. 493 represents a compromise to ensure that America's \n     small businesses remain at the forefront of global \n     innovation. While the legislation does not give any single \n     interested party in the debate over reauthorization all that \n     it might want, the legislation creates a framework that will \n     help move the process forward and will hopefully ensure that \n     SBIR reauthorization is enacted into law this year. The bill \n     recognizes that the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) \n     Program--last reauthorized in 2000--plays an important role \n     in the development of new breakthrough therapies to improve \n     human health, and must be updated to reflect the new \n     realities facing America's small businesses in the 21st \n     Century.\n       For these reasons, I urge the committee to favorably \n     discharge S. 493 so that it can be passed promptly by the \n     Senate.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               James C. Greenwood,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n Where Do Innovations Come From? Transformations in the U.S. National \n                      Innovation System, 1970-2006\n\n                 (By Fred Block and Matthew R. Keller)\n\n       How should the United States craft policies that \n     effectively spur technological innovation? With increasing \n     competitive challenges from other nations, particularly in \n     technology and innovation-based sectors\n\n[[Page S1637]]\n\n     once thought to be largely immune from foreign competition, \n     there is increasing interest in crafting policies to help \n     spur innovation. But if innovation policies are to be \n     effective, it's critical that they be based on an accurate \n     understanding of the U.S. innovation system--in particular, \n     an understanding of where U.S. innovations come from. This \n     report does this by analyzing the sources of award-winning \n     innovations over the past few decades. It finds that the \n     sources of these innovations have changed in two key ways. \n     First, large firms acting on their own account for a much \n     smaller share of award-winning innovations, while innovations \n     stemming from collaborations with spin-offs from universities \n     and federal laboratories make up a much larger share. Second, \n     the number of innovations that are federally-funded has \n     increased dramatically. These findings suggest that the U.S. \n     innovation system has become much more collaborative in \n     nature. Federal innovation policy needs to reflect this fact.\n\n\n               Analysis of Data on Funding of Innovations\n\n       The growing weight of public institutions as the source of \n     U.S. innovations that win R 100 Awards and the growing role \n     of interorganizational collaboration in U.S. innovations are \n     suggestive that public fund- ing has become steadily more \n     important to the U.S. innovation process in recent years. \n     Nevertheless, it is necessary to probe a bit further, because \n     the U.S. firms coded as ``private'' are sometimes recipients \n     of federal funding--sometimes for the precise R activity \n     that wins the award.\n       Back in the 1970s, for example, some of the laboratories of \n     the Fortune 500 firms that were frequent R 100 Award \n     winners received substantial amounts of direct federal \n     funding. And in the more recent period, there has been a \n     proliferation of programs through which government agencies \n     support private sector R An example of the latter is the \n     growing importance of Small Business Innovation Research \n     (SBIR) firms among the award winners.\n       The SBIR program, established in the 1980s, is one of the \n     most important mechanisms through which the federal \n     government supports smaller innovative firms, including the \n     firms that we have labeled as supported spinoffs. The SBIR \n     program is a set-aside program; all government agencies that \n     finance a large amount of R must set aside 2.5 percent of \n     their R budgets for projects that originate with small \n     businesses. The program awards up to $750,000 in no strings \n     support for projects in Phase I and up to $1.5 million for \n     Phase II projects that have shown significant progress in \n     meeting the initial objectives. Some of the SBIR firms have \n     now been in existence for 20 or more years, and at least one \n     has grown to become a Fortune 500 firm.\n       Figure 6 shows the total number of past and present SBIR \n     winners among winners of R 100 Awards.\n       The results show that these SBIR-nurtured firms \n     consistently account for a quarter of all U.S. R 100 Award \n     winners--a powerful indication that the SBIR program has \n     become a key force in the innovation economy of the United \n     States.\n       Figure 7 shows a more comprehensive measure of the role of \n     federal financing of R 100 Award winners in the United \n     States in 1975 and in 2006. The bottom part of the bar graph \n     for each year shows the number of award-winning innovations \n     from public sector entities in the United States that rely \n     heavily on federal funding. As indicated earlier, the number \n     of award-winning innovations from public sector entities \n     increased dramatically from 14 in 1975 to 61 in 2006.\n       The top part of the bar graph for each year in Figure 7 \n     shows the number of Fortune 500 and ``other'' U.S. firms that \n     received at least 1 percent of their revenues from the \n     federal government. The 1 percent screen picks up both large \n     defense contractors and firms that have received substantial \n     federal grants to support their R efforts. In 1975, 23 \n     innovations that won R 100 Awards were developed by private \n     firms in the United States that received at least 1 percent \n     of their revenues from federal support. Prominent among these \n     firms was General Electric, which developed nine of the \n     award-winning innovations that year.\n       There is evidence that in 2006. the federal government \n     directly funded three of the five private collaborations in \n     the United States that produced innovations that received R \n     100 Awards. Of the 20 ``other firms'' that won awards in \n     2006, 13 had federal support above the 1 percent threshold \n     and we were able to link the federal money directly to the \n     specific innovation that received the award. Hence, 16 of \n     these ``private'' innovations count as federally funded. The \n     overall result in Figure 7 is that the number of federally \n     funded innovations rises from 41 in 1975 to 77 in 2066.\n       In 2006, only 11 of the U.S. entities that produced award-\n     winning innovations were not beneficiaries of federal \n     funding. And even among this group of 11, there were some \n     ambiguous cases. Dow Automotive won an R 100 Award for its \n     work in developing an adhesive used with composite auto parts \n     that was installed in Volkswagen cars. But a few years \n     earlier, Dow had been a beneficiary of a substantial grant \n     from the Advanced Technology Program in the Department of \n     Commerce that was designed to accelerate the use of \n     composites in automobiles. Two other winning firms--Brion \n     Tech and MMR Technologies--were recent spinoffs from Stanford \n     University, but since the firms had not received federal \n     support, they were not coded as ``supported spinoff''; \n     however, it is likely that the professors behind the \n     companies received federal research grants while at Stanford. \n     Finally, we were unable to ascertain whether any of those \n     remaining firms received research support from federal \n     laboratories.\n       In short, Figure 7 probably understates the magnitude of \n     the expansion in federal funding for innovations in the \n     United States that R 100 Awards between 1975 and 2006. \n     After all, in 1975, we counted innovations as federally \n     funded even if support was not going to the specific unit of \n     the firm that was working on a particular innovation. For \n     2006, however, a demonstration of federal support required \n     showing that the federal funds were going to the same unit \n     that was responsible for the particular technology that won \n     the award.\n       The fundamental point is that even in the period that \n     Fortune 500 corporations dominated the U.S. innovation \n     process, they drew heavily on federal funding support. If one \n     is looking for a golden age in which the private sector did \n     most of the innovating on its own with federal help, one has \n     to go back to the era before World War II. Nevertheless, over \n     the last 40 years, the R 100 Awards indicate a dramatic \n     increase in the federal government's centrality to the \n     innovation economy in the United States. In the earlier \n     period, U.S. technology policies were almost entirely \n     monopolized by the military and space programs. More \n     recently, a wide range of federal agencies that are not part \n     of the Department of Defense are involved in supporting \n     private sector R initiatives. Key agencies now include the \n     Department of Commerce, Department of Energy, National \n     Institutes of Health, Department of Agriculture, National \n     Science Foundation, and Department of Homeland Security. In \n     addition, over the last 20 years, state governments have \n     become much more involved in technology policy, with many, if \n     not all states funding technology-based economic development \n     activities. To the extent that state programs help small \n     firms or university and federal lab innovations, their \n     role would not be picked up in this analysis.\n\n\n                               DISCUSSION\n\n       Back in 1887, Thomas Edison built an invention factory that \n     has long been seen as the inspiration for the rise of the \n     corporate research labs established by large U.S. firms \n     during the 20th century. Our analysis suggests that although \n     large corporations in the United States emulated Edison's \n     model for decades, this pattern became much weaker after the \n     corporate reorganizations of the 1970s and 1980s. Thus, the \n     ``era of Edison'' did not last the full century.\n       It is not clear why the relative role of Fortune 500 \n     companies in the U.S. innovation system has declined. We can \n     hypothesize three factors. First, it seems likely that big \n     corporations facing relentless pressures from the financial \n     markets have been forced to cut back on expenditures that do \n     not immediately strengthen the bottom line. In some cases, \n     corporate cutbacks have meant eliminating laboratories \n     altogether; in other cases, such cutbacks have meant reducing \n     expenditures on early stage technology development that is \n     often both expensive and risky and is more likely to lead to \n     the kind of radical breakthroughs that win awards like the \n     ones analyzed here\n       A second factor that may be involved in the decline in \n     Fortune 500 companies in the U.S. innovation system is that \n     several factors, including the rise of computers and the \n     Internet, have made it much easier for small firms to enter \n     markets previously dominated by large firms. Many \n     technologies today require less capital-intensive production \n     processes (e.g., software), making it possible for small \n     firms to innovate the technologies for which they received \n     R 100 Awards. In other industries (e.g., \n     biopharmaceuticals), small, innovative companies can contract \n     out manufacturing (e.g., of new drugs). Because small and \n     mid-sized firms can now better compete in product markets, \n     they have dramatically increased their R investments. In \n     fact, while the ratio of R investments to U.S. gross \n     domestic product more than doubled between 1980 and 2000, \n     almost all of that increase was due to increased R \n     investments by small and mid-sized firms with fewer than \n     5,000 employees. Moreover, large firm R may now be more \n     focused on improving existing product lines, as opposed to \n     generating radically new innovations.\n       The third factor that may have contributed to the decline \n     of Fortune 500 companies dynamic is a change in the \n     employment preferences of scientists and engineers. As the \n     employment landscape has shifted, it seems quite possible \n     that many talented scientists and engineers have voted with \n     their feet and have left work in corporate labs in favor of \n     work at government labs, university labs, or smaller firms. \n     More research is necessary to tease out the causes.\n       But returning to the history of the Edison lab suggests a \n     longer term and more structural explanation for the recent \n     shifts in the U.S. innovation system that we have uncovered. \n     Revisionist scholars have discovered that Edison's laboratory \n     actually operated differently from the corporate labs of the \n     20th century. It is true that Edison assembled a team of \n     scientists and engineers that had built up considerable \n     expertise in working with electrical devices--but Edison's \n     team divided its time between internal\n\n[[Page S1638]]\n\n     projects and external projects. The Edison laboratory did \n     extensive contract work for other firms, helping them develop \n     solutions to particular problems that their industry faced. \n     Edison's employees worked closely with employees with \n     technical knowledge from those other firms.\n       The argument by revisionist historians is that the \n     extraordinary productivity of the Edison labs was a result of \n     the systematic interaction between Edison's team and other \n     groups of experts with very specific types of knowledge. When \n     U.S. corporations sought to emulate Edison's model in the \n     20th century, though, they built elaborate laboratories that \n     tended to cut their in-house technologists off from these \n     systematic encounters with experts in other organizations. \n     This choice fit with the model of the corporation that was \n     exemplified by Henry Ford's decision to produce his own steel \n     at the River Rouge plant. The idea was that bringing these \n     activities, including R, fully in-house maximized \n     management's ability to deploy the organization's resources.\n       What we have found in the United States at the end of the \n     20th century, though, is basically a return to Edison's \n     model--with successful research organizations; public. or \n     private, developing a highly productive mix of internal and \n     external projects. There appear to be an increasing number of \n     private sector research laboratories that combine their own \n     internal projects--often funded with federal money--with \n     contracted research for other firms. Some of their \n     innovations show up as a winners of R 100 Awards.\n\n\n                               CONCLUSION\n\n       These findings suggest that the U.S. federal government's \n     role in fostering innovation--both in terms of \n     organizational, auspices and funding--across the U.S. economy \n     has significantly expanded in the last several decades. But \n     the federal government's role is not to act as the agent of \n     centrally planned technological change.\n       In Chalmers Johnson's classic account of the Japanese model \n     of industrial policy, he shows how government officials, \n     working at the Ministry of Trade and Industry, operated as \n     both coordinators and financiers for the conquest by Japanese \n     firms of new markets. Japanese government officials were \n     implementing a shared plan that linked investments in \n     particular technologies with specific business strategies to \n     win in particular markets--both domestically and \n     internationally. That strategy may have allowed Japan to \n     catch up the leading nations in an array of industries, but \n     it did not and does not fit the new innovation environment \n     where cutting-edge innovation produced in a new collaborative \n     and dispersed models is the key to success. It is for that \n     reason that many other nations have shifted their innovation \n     policies to be less directed.\n       In the United States, there is no central plan for \n     innovation, and different federal agencies engage in support \n     for new technologies often in direct competition with other \n     agencies. The federal government had created a decentralized \n     network of publicly funded laboratores where technologists \n     will have incentives to work with private firms and find ways \n     to turn their disoveries into commercial products. Moreover, \n     an alphabet soup of different federal programs provides \n     agencies with opportunities to help fund some of these more \n     compelling technological possibilities, just as there has \n     been increasing support, at both the federal and state \n     levels, for industry-university research collaboration.\n       Complementing these decentralized efforts are, more \n     targeted federal government programs that are designed to \n     accelerate progress across specific technological barriers. \n     Today, for example, the. Advanced Research Projects Agency in \n     the Department of Defense is prioritizing support for \n     computer scientists to find ways to overcome the obstacles to \n     creating.ever more powerful microchips for computers. It is \n     also helping biological scientists find ways to accelerate \n     the production of large batches of vaccine, which would be \n     useful to protect the population both against biological \n     weapons and a global pandemic of a deadly influenza. For \n     these targeted efforts, officials in these government offices \n     decide to renew grant support to one research group because \n     it has made progress, withhold it from another research group \n     that appears to be heading towards a dead end, and encourage \n     connections with still another research group--working on a \n     seemingly unrelated problem--because they suspect that the-\n     third group's, findings might have relevance for solving the \n     targeted problem.\n       Both types of U.S. government innovation initiatives--\n     decentralized and targeted--are increasingly described with \n     the language of venture capital. Private sector venture \n     capitalists, such as the famous firms in Silicon Valley, have \n     an open door policy for scientists and engineers who have a \n     bright idea for a new business. Of every hundred pitches they \n     hear, they might decide to invest in 20 with the idea that if \n     even one or two of the 20 are successful, then they make vast \n     amounts of money that they can recycle into new rounds of \n     initial investments. But the key assumption behind venture \n     capital is that even after careful screening, most of these \n     new business ventures will fail. Some won't be able.to \n     develop the promised technology, some won't find a market for \n     their particular innovation, and some won't be able to build \n     an organization capable of exploiting the Market. \n     Nevertheless, the enormous gains from the small percentage of \n     winners are more than enough to cover the bases from the \n     others.\n       Many U.S. government officials, now use the same rhetoric. \n     They know that most new startups begun by scientists and \n     engineers at universities or government laboratories will \n     fail, but the minority that succeed will create jobs and \n     advance new technologies. With the decentralized approach, \n     they may provide support to several hundred firms with the \n     idea that 20 to 50 might actually flourish. With the more \n     targeted efforts, they realize that in each funding cycle, \n     only a minority of the researchers will make any significant \n     headway on the key problems. But the idea is that over time, \n     a few incremental advances will eventually set the stage for \n     the big breakthrough that they are looking for.\n       The largest federal government program that fits this \n     venture capital model is the Small Business Innovation \n     Research (SBIR) program. In 2004, the SBIR program gave out \n     more than $2 billion for some 6,300 separate research \n     projects. The success of programs such as SBIR helps to \n     explain what is perhaps the most surprising turn in federal \n     innovation policy of the last decade.\n       Starting with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in \n     1999, a number of government agencies have now set up their \n     own venture capital operations. The CIA's venture capital \n     arm, In-Q-Tel, maintains its own Website and lists 90 recent \n     startup firms in which it has invested. Congress provided a \n     $500 million initial fund, and just as with private sector \n     venture capital, the idea is that the initial fund will be \n     replenished and expanded as In-Q-Tel sells its stake in those \n     firms that have been successful. The Department of the Army \n     has followed the CIA model, and the Department of Energy has \n     partnered with Battelle--the large nonprofit organization \n     that manages several of the department's labs--which has now \n     created its own not-for-profit venture capital arm with an \n     emphasis on supporting startup firms that originated in the \n     laboratories.\n       Although this explicit turn towards venture capital by U.S. \n     government agencies is understandable, it will not, by \n     itself, solve what we see as the main weaknesses in the \n     current system of federal support for innovation in the \n     United States. In our view, the system of federal support for \n     innovation has enormous strengths, but it also suffers from \n     three major, interconnected weaknesses. First, the system \n     carries decentralization to an unproductive extreme. Under \n     current arrangements, it is entirely possible that five \n     different government agencies might be supporting 30 \n     different teams of technologists working on an identical \n     problem without a full awareness of the duplication of \n     efforts. This situation is a particular problem if different \n     groups are unable to learn from each other in a timely \n     fashion. Second, because the importance of the federal role \n     in fostering innovation is not widely recognized, federal \n     programs in support of innovation lack the broad public \n     support that would be commensurate with their economic \n     importance. Third, the budgetary support for the current \n     system is inadequate and uncertain. Funding for more \n     collaborative research and commercialization efforts are \n     relatively limited, and total federal levels of R spending \n     have been declining in real terms since 2003. These declines \n     put the entire U.S. innovation system at risk.\n       This analysis has shown a dramatic shift in the locus of \n     innovation in the U.S. economy that has occurred over the \n     last three decades. We hope these findings spur a broad \n     debate about the changing role of the federal government in \n     our national innovation system.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, the Biotechnology Industry Organization \nnoted:\n\n       [t]his bill represents a balanced approach to ensure that \n     America's most innovative small businesses can access \n     existing incentives to grow jobs by commercializing new \n     discoveries.\n\n  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said:\n\n       [t]his landmark compromise bill, if passed into law, would \n     unlock the door for entry for businesses that acquire equity \n     funding through venture capital firms without diminishing the \n     programs effectiveness for traditional small businesses, thus \n     setting the stage for a robust and revitalized SBIR program.\n\n  That is really our goal--a modern program that recognizes the reality \nof today's innovative small businesses and provides the appropriate \nenvironment in which they can flourish.\n  Given the nature of the compromise we have reached--from increasing \nallocations over a number of years to allowing limited participation by \nmajority-owned venture capital firms--we must allow time for these \nprovisions to take shape and enhance these programs. That is why our \nlegislation reauthorizes these measures for 8 years, through 2019. \nIndeed, the past two reauthorizations of the SBIR program have been for \n8 years each--in 1992 and 2000--as was the last reauthorization for the \nSTTR program in 2001.\n  This long-term reauthorization will allow more small businesses to \naccess this funding without the fear of constant interruptions based on \nwhims of\n\n[[Page S1639]]\n\nwhether Congress will extend these programs for an indefinite period of \ntime. Indeed, a company's life cycle in either of these programs is by \nnature a multiyear process--a phase I award will last 6 months, while a \nphase II award will last for 2 years. That timeframe does not include \nthe time it takes for businesses to apply for funding and await a \ndecision, as well as the time between three phases waiting for new \nsolicitations from agencies.\n  It will also allow the Government Accountability Office to \neffectively study the venture capital compromise over time to see if it \nis serving its intended purpose of allowing promising small businesses \nto utilize these resources. We include a provision in the bill \nmandating that the GAO issue a report on the subject 3 years after \nenactment and every 3 years thereafter. By reducing the length of the \nreauthorization, we would be allowing this delicate compromise to be \nrelitigated immediately without the benefit of studying its impact, and \nwe would effectively negate any modicum of certainty provided in the \npending legislation.\n  Finally, on the matter of procedure, I am very pleased the majority \nleader has indicated he will be allowing an open amendment process to \nthis legislation. That is also important as well as necessary for \nworking through these issues and others that are critical to our \nconsideration.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for the consideration, but I most \nespecially thank the chair of the Small Business Committee for \nproviding the kind of leadership that has been so essential to bringing \nthis legislation forward. After 10 reauthorizations and for about 6 \nyears in the process, to bring it to this point will be critical for \nthe innovation that is so essential to creating new products and to \nalso creating new jobs we desperately need in our economy.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank Senator Snowe. I could not have \na better partner on this committee. Her expertise is noted and admired \namong the Members. She has served as a member of this committee--\noftentimes its chair--for many years. I appreciate her help and the \nhelp of her staff as well.\n  In the 10 minutes we have left, I wish to add a couple of specifics \nof the compromise Senator Snowe has outlined.\n  It is true that this program has been sputtering along on very \nuncertain terrain because of every 3-month or 6-month reauthorization \nhastily put forward because there has been no agreement on a few of the \ndetails. We finally reached an agreement on some of those details, the \nlargest of which had to do with the percentage of awards that could be \ngiven or funded to companies that are owned by venture capitalists.\n  This program was started as a small business program. Senator Snowe \nand I feel very strongly and the same to try to keep it as a small \nbusiness entrepreneurial program but to obviously recognize the changes \nand opportunities for capital presented by some venture capitalists. \nThat has been the subject of the largest piece of negotiation. I am \nhappy to say we have letters of support from the Bay Area Innovation \nAlliance, the BioDistrict from New Orleans, just to name one, the \nBiotechnology Council. They are all very supportive of this compromise.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthese letters of support.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Hon. Mary L. Landrieu,\n     Committee on Small Business & Entrepreneurship, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Subject: Senate Bill S. 493\n       Dear Senator Landrieu: The Bay Area Innovation Alliance, \n     representing more than 60 technology companies in the San \n     Francisco Bay Area who participate extensively in the SBIR/\n     STTR programs, is pleased to support compromise legislation \n     for SBIR reauthorization.\n       We urge a timely passage of Senate Bill S. 493.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Christopher White.\n     Bay Area Innovation Alliance,\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                      Biodistrict New Orleans,\n\n                                   New Orleans, LA, March 9, 2011.\n     Hon. Mary Landrieu,\n     Chair, Senate Committee on Small Business and \n         Entrepreneurship, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairwoman Landrieu: BioDistrict New Orleans is \n     pleased to support your compromise Small Business Innovation \n     Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) \n     programs reauthorization legislation. Rebuilding the New \n     Orleans economy around the biotech, digital media and other \n     knowledge-based industries is our #1 priority.\n       As you know, SBIR is the nation's largest source of early-\n     stage research and development funding. Providing more than \n     50,000+ patents since its inception, SBIR has successfully \n     harnessed the proven innovative power of small, technology-\n     based businesses to meet the nation's technology needs, and \n     New Orleans needs to become a center of such activity.\n       Unfortunately, the reauthorization of this demonstrably \n     effective program has been beset by various tribulations, \n     court interpretations and special interests. This has lead to \n     nine short-term reauthorizations since 2008. These repeated, \n     temporary extensions have wreaked havoc on agencies' ability \n     to make strategic decisions in regard to the programs. The \n     uncertain future of the program has also deterred potential \n     participants and investors.\n       Thankfully, S.B. 493 allows for increased venture-capital \n     participation but retains the small-business integrity of the \n     program. This bill has been endorsed by the Biotechnology \n     Industry Organization and the Small Business Technology \n     Council, the nation's largest tech-oriented small business \n     organization from diverse industries.\n       The BioDistrict also fully supports this legislation and \n     urges its swift adoption. We wish to thank you for your \n     unflagging and indispensable efforts to protect the small-\n     business focus of the SBIR and STTR programs and achieve this \n     balanced and fair compromise reauthorization package.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Bonita A. Robertson,\n     Special Counsel.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Small Business\n\n\n                                                  Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 7, 2011.\n     Hon. Mary Landrieu,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Olympia Snowe,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairwoman Landrieu and Ranking Member Snowe: The \n     National Small Business Association is pleased to support the \n     SBIR/STTR Reauthorization Act of 2011 (S. 493). Reaching \n     150,000 small-business owners across the nation, NSBA is the \n     country's oldest small-business advocacy organization and a \n     longtime supporter of the Small Business Innovation Research, \n     SBIR, program.\n       As you both know, the SBIR program is the nation's largest \n     source of early-stage research and development funding. \n     Providing more than 50,000 patents since its inception, SBIR \n     has successfully harnessed the proven innovative power of \n     small, technology-based businesses to meet the nation's \n     technology needs. On average, SBIR generates seven new \n     patents per day--which is far more than all U.S. universities \n     combined, at less than one-twelfth their level of federal \n     research and development funding.\n       Unfortunately, the reauthorization of this demonstrably-\n     effective program has been beset by various tribulations. \n     This has led to ten short-term reauthorizations since 2008. \n     These repeated, temporary extensions have wreaked havoc on \n     agencies' ability to make strategic decisions in regard to \n     the programs. The uncertain future of the program also has \n     deterred potential participants and investors.\n       Thankfully, a compromise reauthorization package--which \n     allows for increased venture-capital participation but \n     retains the small-business integrity of the program--has been \n     forged. This compromise has been endorsed by the \n     Biotechnology Industry Organization, the National Venture \n     Capital Association, and the Small Business Technology \n     Council, the nation's largest tech-oriented small business \n     organization from diverse industries.\n       NSBA also fully supports S. 493 and urges its swift \n     adoption. NSBA thanks you both for your unflagging and \n     indispensable efforts to protect the small-business focus of \n     the SBIR and STTR programs and achieve this balanced and fair \n     compromise reauthorization package.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Todd O. McCracken,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                      Smaller Business Association\n\n\n                                               of New England,\n\n                                       Waltham, MA, March 8, 2011.\n     U.S. Senator Mary Landrieu, \n     Chairman, Senate Small Business & Entrepreneurship, Russell \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Landrieu: The Smaller Business Association of \n     New England fully supports S. 493, which reauthorizes the \n     Small Business Research Innovation program for the next eight \n     years. Life sciences, defense, high technology and the energy \n     sectors in Massachusetts have been tremendous beneficiaries \n     of the SBIR/STTR programs averaging almost one quarter of a \n     billion dollars per year. This research and development \n     engine has spawned new revolutionary products that have been \n     utilized in an innovative way by the military and commercial \n     markets.\n       The proposed incremental increases in the SBIR/STTR \n     formulas will only enhance the technology readiness of the \n     program and will provide incentives for further innovation.\n       We think your compromise on the sticky venture capital \n     issue is an equitable one,\n\n[[Page S1640]]\n\n     particularly if it is inextricably linked to the increase in \n     the SBIR formula from 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent. Secondly, \n     the increased-size limits on Phase I and Phase II and \n     allowance of sequential phasing from I to II appears to be \n     reasonable and permits program flexibility for both the \n     agency and recipient.\n       In summary, we think you and your staff have crafted an \n     excellent compromise in order to satisfy divergent interests \n     and most importantly, preserve the integrity of the SBIR/STTR \n     programs. Please let us know if there is anything else SBANE \n     can do to facilitate Senate 493. Thank you very much.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Robert A. Baker,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  V-LABS, Inc.\n\n                                     Covington, LA, March 8, 2011.\n     Senator Mary Landrieu,\n     U.S. Senate Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Landrieu: I am writing to give my support for \n     SBIR/STTR Reauthorization Bill (S. 493). I am also a \n     supporter of Senator Landrieu as a Louisiana resident. She \n     has worked tirelessly for the business community in \n     Louisiana. I have a small high tech company in Covington LA \n     and have received several SBIR grants that enabled us to do \n     research that we could not have afforded. I have worked many \n     years in support of the development of biotechnology in \n     Louisiana.\n       I am Councilor of the Division of Small Chemical \n     Businesses, SCHB, of the American Chemical Society. The SBIR/\n     STTR program is very important to our members. We offer \n     symposia to our membership at national and regional meeting \n     to share the opportunities of the SBIR/STTR program. The \n     Division supports reauthorization of the SBIR/STTR program.\n       I have campaigned for support of the program by the \n     American Chemical Society, ACS, for a number of years. The \n     American Chemical Society has 163,000 members; it is the \n     largest scientific society in the world. The support of the \n     program was announced by the ACS Board of Directors in \n     December, 2010 in a position statement, ``A Competitive U.S. \n     Business Climate: The Role of Chemistry'', on creating new \n     U.S. based science jobs. The complete publication is on the \n     ACS webpage under policy, www.acs.org/policy The last \n     paragraph of this statement reads: ``Recommendations: Small \n     Business and Entrepreneurship--ACS supports policies that \n     foster the growth of small research and development \n     businesses and encourage entrepreneurship: Expanding funding \n     for the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR), Small \n     Business Technology Transfer (STTR), and Small Business \n     Investment Companies (SBIC) programs and reforming these \n     programs to make direct research funding for small businesses \n     more easily available Providing incentives for larger \n     companies to expand investments in start-up research and \n     development businesses''\n       I thank you for your work as well as the Committee on Small \n     Business in introducing this bill S. 493 for the \n     Reauthorization of the SBIR/STTR program.\n           Yours truly,\n                                            Sharon V. Vercellotti,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, CONNECT, which is out of the University \nof California, is another important player in this particular field, \nand Dawnbreaker, a commercialization company. They were part of helping \nus forge this important compromise.\n  I also note that the guidelines of the awards have been raised in the \nfirst stage from $100,000 to $150,000 and from $750,000 to $1 million \nfor phase II and allows for sequential phase II awards--another \nimportant change.\n  I particularly thank Senator Coburn for agreeing to an 8-year \nextension. We think, for a program such as this which is dealing with \ntechnologies that sometimes take years to develop, that can be very \npromising, but it takes some planning, it takes patience. This is not a \nprogram that lends itself readily to 2- to 4-year reauthorizations. \nThat is too much uncertainty for a program such as this. Maybe other \nprograms in the Federal Government should go through 4-year and 5-year \nauthorizations. Both Senator Snowe and I pressed for a longer time. \nSenator Coburn is somewhat reluctant, but we are very grateful that he \nand others stepped up and said 8 years would be a good compromise in \nthat way. We are grateful. This will be a very important authorization \nbecause it will set the direction for the next 8 years for our Federal \nagencies.\n  We have also made an important change--and I am very pleased about \nthis because I think you can have the greatest programs in the world, \nbut if you are not focused on quality, if you are not focused on \nexchanging best practices, if you are not focused on good management of \nthose programs, even some of the best intentions fall apart or the \ntaxpayers' money is wasted. We do not want to see that happen here. So \nwe have set aside a small portion for administration, which was \nrecommended by this study of oversight, so that the managers in each of \nthese departments can be better trained to actually identify promising \ntechnologies, make sure they are requesting in the right areas the \nkinds of technologies they are looking for, and receive that \ninformation in a more professional way. That is an important component \nof this compromise--the 3-percent allocation for administration and \noversight.\n  As I said, it reauthorizes it for 8 years, and the arrangement \nbetween venture capital and small businesses--that kind of capsulizes \nthe major changes.\n  I do wish to recognize Senator Rockefeller's amendment that he put on \nin the 111th Congress which is a policy directive against waste, fraud, \nand abuse. Senator Rockefeller has been very helpful in this regard. \nHis amendment, along with others, requires inspectors general in \nparticipating Federal agencies to establish fraud-detection measures, \ncoordinate fraud information sharing between agencies, and provide \nfraud prevention related to education and training of the \nadministration.\n  In addition to all of this, it actually gets even better because \nSenator Snowe and I have figured out a way to reduce the cost from the \nlast Congress to this Congress from $229 million over 5 years to $150 \nmillion. We are being as efficient with taxpayers' dollars as we can, \nstrengthening administration and fraud detection, giving a longer lead \ntime and runway for some of these technologies.\n  Again, we think this is a model program in the world. We do not \nthink, we know that because of the research and review that has been \ndone of this program and from what we hear from other countries. They \nwonder: How does your system work? This is one important aspect. The \ngovernment does have a role to play--not the most significant role \npotentially but a portion of one of the most significant roles to play \nin promoting entrepreneurship, creativity, innovations, and expanding \nthe number of patents that are issued in the United States by providing \nprograms that give an open door, access, and level playing field to the \nsmallest businesses in America to give them a chance to compete against \nsome of the big guys. That is really what this is all about.\n  Mr. President, let me see if the ranking member has anything else to \nadd. We have a few minutes left. She may have one or two points to add \nas we close out before the lunch period.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I thank the chairman. The points she raised \nare very critical because of the contributions these programs have made \nto our economy, most especially because much of the innovation that \noccurs in America comes from small businesses. In fact, this report by \nthe Information and Innovation Technology Foundation underscores this \npoint, that the innovations coming from big companies is actually on \nthe decline. We really do depend on the entrepreneurial spirit of small \nbusinesses to create the kind of innovation we require in America if we \nare going to be on the vanguard of change and vanguard of technologies \nand which is so crucial in moving forward as a nation.\n  The SBIR program in particular has played a very crucial role in that \nregard. I think this report truly does emphasize the degree to which it \nhas played a paramount role over the years since the program was \ncreated in 1982. It certainly has had an extraordinary history in that \nregard.\n  We talk about a lot of programs that we underwrite at the Federal \nlevel, but I can say this is a good use of taxpayers' dollars when we \nare thinking about how we maximize taxpayers' dollars within the \nFederal agencies that are now utilizing these programs, of which we \nhave 11 different agencies that are setting aside the research and \ndevelopment funds specifically to ensure that small business has an \nallocation among the research and development dollars so they get their \nfair share because that is from where the innovation is derived in the \nfinal analysis. That certainly has been the indication of the many \nresults we have achieved due to these programs, and that is what makes \nthem outstanding in that regard.\n  You can draw a cause and effect. Certainly, there is a correlation \nbetween\n\n[[Page S1641]]\n\nthe effectiveness of these programs among the agencies that award them \nto small businesses that then become the true laboratories for the \ninnovation. That transformation, as this report indicated, has been \ncentral to the types of technologies that have emerged over the last \nthree decades.\n  We want to continue to advance these programs because they are \nundeniably beneficial and well worth the investments that are made by \nthese agencies because of their required set-asides for these programs \nand to ensure that small businesses are part of the research and \ndevelopment funding that is in the billions of dollars at the Federal \nlevel, if you look at the collective budgets of just these 11 agencies. \nWe want to make sure small businesses are key to our technological \ngrowth and, therefore, having these types of programs becomes a major \nforce in developing our innovative economy, as this report indicated \nrecently.\n  Again, I wish to thank the Chair for her efforts in that regard.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank Ranking Member Snowe and, \naccording to the previous agreement, I think we are going to move to a \nquorum call at this point. Within a short period of time, I think the \nleadership is going to lay down two amendments and then, after lunch, \nof course, we will be open to consider others. We are hoping they will \nbe limited to the subject matter before us, but it is an open debate on \nthis bill.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee-\nreported amendments be agreed to en bloc; the motions to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid upon the table en bloc; the amended version of \nS. 493 be considered original text for the purposes of further \namendment; that Senator Nelson of Nebraska then be recognized to offer \nan amendment to S. 493; that following the reporting of the Nelson \namendment, the amendment be set aside and the Republican leader be \nrecognized to offer a first-degree amendment to the bill; and following \nthe reporting of the McConnell amendment, the Republican leader be \nrecognized for up to 5 minutes for debate only relative to his \namendment; that following the Republican leader's remarks, the Senate \nresume consideration of the Nelson amendment and Senator Nelson be \nrecognized for up to 10 minutes for debate only relative to his \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent this be modified to allow the \nRepublican leader to speak for whatever time he needs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The committee-reported amendments were agreed to en bloc.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 182\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to \ncall up the amendment I just sent to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Nelson] proposes an \n     amendment No. 182.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to \ndispense with further reading of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       It is the sense of the Senate that it supports reducing its \n     budget by at least 5 percent. The Senate has made the \n     findings that:\n       Finding that, Congress must pursue comprehensive deficit \n     reduction,\n       Finding that, the nation is deeply involved in military \n     action on two fronts\n       Finding that, Admiral Mullen has noted the most significant \n     threat to national security is the national debt\n       Finding that, the nation is in fragile recovery from an \n     economic downturn that has spanned two administrations\n       Finding that, the offices and agencies that serve Members \n     of Congress must be reduced along with the rest of the budget\n       Finding that, in order to address the Nation's fiscal \n     crisis, the Senate should lead by example and reduce its own \n     legislative budget\n       It is the sense of the Senate, that it should lead by \n     example and reduce the budget of the Senate by at least 5 \n     percent.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 183\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, with gas prices on the rise, Americans \nwant to know what Washington is going to do about it. So let me provide \na little update: The White House has responded by locking up domestic \nenergy supplies and pushing an energy tax that will drive gas prices up \neven higher and Democrats in Congress aren't doing anything at all.\n  So we have a total disconnect right now between Democrats in \nWashington when it comes to gas prices. Both the White House and \nDemocrats in Congress are acting as if they haven't seen a nightly \nnewscast or driven by a gas station in weeks.\n  Senator Inhofe, Senator Murkowski, and Senator Barrasso have done a \nterrific job of raising the alarm on the administration's efforts to \nlock up domestic energy, even as it continues to push costly new \nregulations at the Environmental Protection Agency. I wish to commend \nthem for their efforts on this most important and timely issue. They \nhave shown how American families are getting a double whammy right now. \nRefiners would pass the costs related to these regulations on to \nconsumers, and the White House's efforts to lock up domestic energy \nproduction puts even more pressure on gas prices.\n  If you are just tuning in, let's review what the White House has been \nup to on that front: They have resisted our push for American \nproduction offshore, onshore and in Alaska and the jobs that go along \nwith it. They have canceled existing drilling permits and the jobs that \ncome with them. They have needlessly delayed offshore leases, which \neven former President Clinton has referred to as ridiculous. They have \nimposed a moratorium on oil and gas drilling, which amounts to a \nmoratorium on domestic energy-related jobs. They have proposed a tax on \ndomestic energy production that might be called a ``minivan tax.'' Now \nthey are trying to impose a backdoor national energy tax through the \nEPA.\n  It is a strange way to respond to rising gas prices. But it is \nperfectly consistent with the current Energy Secretary's previously \nstated desire to get gas prices in the United States up to where they \nare in Europe.\n  These new regulations would destroy jobs at a time when Americans \nneed them the most, and they would be especially devastating for States \nsuch as Kentucky and other coal States. EPA regulations resulting in \ndramatic energy price increases would jeopardize the livelihoods of the \n18,000 miners in Kentucky and the additional 200,000 jobs that depend \non coal production and the low cost of electricity that Kentuckians \nenjoy.\n  They would raise the price of everything from electricity, gasoline, \nfertilizer, to the food we eat, and that is why farmers, builders, \nmanufacturers, small businesses, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce \noppose them and support an effort to stop them.\n  But the White House is determined to get its way, and that is why \nthey are attempting to do through regulation what they couldn't do \nthrough legislation regardless of whether the American people want it. \nIn my view, it is an insult to the millions of Americans who are \nalready struggling to make ends meet and to find a job.\n  Fourteen million Americans are looking for work, gas prices are \napproaching $4 a gallon, and the Obama administration wants unelected \nand unaccountable bureaucrats to impose new regulations that will \ndestroy even more jobs and drive gas prices even higher.\n  If you want proof that common sense is taking a backseat to ideology \nin the White House, look no further: This plan is bad for jobs and bad \nfor the economy and it must be stopped. That is why, at the end of my \nremarks, I will be introducing an amendment to block it.\n  In an effort to prevent the administration from adding yet another \nburdensome, job-destroying regulation through the backdoor, we will \nhave a vote on whether, at a time of rising gas prices and growing \nconcern about the scope of government, we should allow\n\n[[Page S1642]]\n\nthe White House to impose new energy regulations through the EPA.\n  This vote is needed because the White House appears ready to advance \nits goal by any means possible, regardless of our economy or the will \nof the people. That is why it is my hope we will vote to stop this \npower grab in its tracks.\n  I wish to, in particular, give credit to Senator Inhofe. This is \nlegislation he has introduced and has been promoting. It is exactly the \nsame legislation that is moving over in the House of Representatives, \nand it is time the Senate took a stand on this measure as well.\n  Mr. President, I believe there is an amendment pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be temporarily set aside, and I send an amendment to \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell] proposes an \n     amendment No. 183.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \n   Agency from promulgating any regulation concerning, taking action \nrelating to, or taking into consideration the emission of a greenhouse \n                     gas to address climate change)\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n                    TITLE VI--ENERGY TAX PREVENTION\n\n     SEC. 601.

The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 182\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the \namendment I have just offered dealing with cutting the Senate budget by \nat least 5 percent.\n\n[[Page S1643]]\n\n  When I go home every weekend and I am at the grocery store or I am at \na hardware store, I have people coming to me saying they are concerned \nabout the growing deficit, they are concerned about the increasing \ndebt, and they are asking what Congress can do, what can the Senate do, \nspecifically, to avoid having this unsustainable growth and debt and \ndeficit. They are concerned.\n  In many respects, the growth of that debt is most threatening to the \nnational security of this country.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Would the Senator from Nebraska yield for a question?\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Sure.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask the Senator from Nebraska--the minority leader has \njust introduced an amendment that is pending right now, and I was going \nto speak on that amendment. Rather than going to another one, would the \nSenator yield for 3 or 4 minutes so I can at least weigh in on this \namendment?\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Ordinarily, I would grant that request, but I \nhave a speech at another location that should be starting about right \nnow. So I will be brief.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of the Senator's remarks I be recognized next.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nAdmiral Mullen, noted that the most significant threat to our national \nsecurity is in fact the national debt.\n  The Nation is in a fragile state of recovery, one that we hope will \nimprove the unemployment situation in our country and will improve the \noverall economy. But as we look at dealing with the deficit and deficit \nreduction, we must in fact pursue a very important part of that \nreduction ourselves here within the confines of the Senate. The offices \nand agencies that serve the Members of Congress have to be reduced \nalong with the rest of the budget.\n  In order to address the Nation's fiscal crisis I think the Senate \nmust lead by example and reduce our own legislative budget. It is in \nthat context I have introduced this resolution of the Senate today, a \nsense of the Senate that it should lead by example and reduce the \nbudget of the Senate by at least 5 percent.\n  This is not something new to me. Two years ago, we held the line in \nthe growth of the Senate budget. A year ago we cut the legislative \nbranch budget. We are looking forward, beyond this current budget, this \ncontinuing resolution, and looking at 2012. I hope the legislative \nbranch on a bipartisan basis--as in the past, with Senator Murkowski, \nnow with Senator Hoeven--will be able to further reduce the legislative \nbranch budget as we go forward on the 2012 budget that will take effect \non October 1 of this year.\n  This is designed for us to set an example by cutting our own budgets, \nnot just asking other people to tighten their belts and go through the \nprocess of deficit reduction through cuts, but to lead by example and \ndo it ourselves. Obviously there will be an opportunity to speak more \nat a later time. I hope that will generate some more discussion on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first I thank the Senator from Nebraska \nfor allowing me to come in immediately following his remarks.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 183\n\n  An amendment was just offered by the minority leader. Let me explain \nwhat this is. As the former chairman of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, and now the ranking member, we have been very much \nconcerned for a long period of time over what they are trying to do \nwith cap-and-trade. All the way back to the Kyoto treaty and then \nthrough the five different bills that were debated on the Senate floor, \nwe recognized the incredible cost to the American people if we were to \npass cap-and-trade legislation.\n  The interesting thing about this is the most votes that were in the \nSenate at any one time in order to pass cap-and-trade were about 30. \nObviously it takes a lot more than that. So what this administration \ndid was say: All right, if you are not going to pass cap-and-trade \nregulation--keep in mind what that is; that would end up being the \nlargest tax increase in the history of America on the American people--\nif you are not going to do it through legislation, we will do it \nthrough our regulations, through the Environmental Protection Agency.\n  There was an endangerment finding. The Administrator of the EPA had \nthe endangerment finding and it was based on the IPCC flawed science, \nbut nonetheless it was there. So they started on a route to regulate \nCO2 through regulations. Let's stop and think about what \nthat would be. The costs we have determined, over a period of 10-years, \nto take over the regulation and have in fact a type of cap-and-trade \nthrough regulation--or by regulation--would be about $300 billion to \n$400 billion a year. I did a calculation as to what that would cost the \naverage family in the State of Oklahoma and it was about $3,000 for \neach family who actually files a tax return.\n  You have to ask the question, what do you get if you pass this. First \nof all, I think most people right now are concerned with the price of \ngasoline at the pump. It is going up again. I suggest it is not market \nforces that are forcing the price up. It is nothing less than \nregulation. We have an administration that is doing all it can to kill \nfossil fuels in America. This is a chart showing--and this all happened \nin the last year--in the United States we have the largest recovery \nreserves in oil, coal, and gas of any other country. In fact, our \nresearch is right there. You can see recovery reserves are astronomical \ncompared to China, Iran, Canada, and some of the other countries.\n  The problem we have is a political problem. We are not allowed to go \nahead and exploit our own reserves. It is simple supply and demand. I \nthink there is not a person listening to us now who has not studied \nsupply-and-demand basics back in school. If we have all this supply \nhere, why can't we exploit the supply?\n  To give another illustration of what we have--this is coal reserves. \nWe have 28 percent of all the world's coal reserves. We are exploiting \nright now clean coal technology, being very successful. We have, in \naddition to this, oil and gas reserves. But the problem we have is a \npolitical problem.\n  It was the Secretary of Energy, Steven Chu, who made the statement in \nthe Wall Street Journal:\n\n       [S]omehow we have to figure out how to boost the price of \n     gasoline in Europe.\n\n  ``To boost the price of gasoline to the levels in Europe.'' Right now \nthe levels in Europe are around $8 a gallon. That is what the \nadministration wants us to pay. Why do they want that? They want that \nso we will be priced out of using fossil fuels. We are talking about \noil, gas, and coal.\n  Right now we are faced with this. Frankly, as we speak, in this very \nmoment over in the House of Representatives they are taking up what \nthey call the Upton-Inhofe bill. That is the same amendment the \nminority leader just filed. What that does is propose the content of \nthe Inhofe-Upton bill, which says the EPA does not have jurisdiction \nover controlling CO2. That should be a legislative matter. \nYou say, Who would agree with that?\n  Max Baucus, Democrat from Montana, said:\n\n       I do not want the EPA writing those regulations. I think \n     it's too much power in the hands of one single agency, but \n     rather climate change should be a matter that's essentially \n     left to the Congress.\n\n  The Senator from Nebraska who just walked off the floor:\n\n       Controlling the levels of carbon emissions is the job of \n     Congress. We don't need the EPA looking over Congress' \n     shoulder telling us we're not moving fast enough.\n\n  He went on further to say:\n\n       Because the EPA regulations would be a government-directed \n     command-and-control regime, they would raise the price of \n     energy--\n\n  . . . in his State and for all the other States.\n  This is something I think we have talked about but there is one thing \nthat seems to keep getting overlooked. Somebody asked me the other day, \nthey said: Inhofe, what if you are wrong, in terms of how \nCO2--they are talking about catastrophic global warming. I \nsaid: It is very simple. I have a great deal of respect for the \nDirector of the Environmental Protection Agency. She actually said--\nLisa Jackson--in response to my question, live on TV, in our committee. \nI said:\n\n\n[[Page S1644]]\n\n\n       Let's say we pass a cap-and-trade either by regulation or \n     legislation. What do you think that is going to do in terms \n     of the overall emissions of CO2?\n\n  Her response was, well, it wouldn't really affect them because that \nwould only affect the United States.\n  I go on further and say: If we were to restrict these, and stop us \nfrom producing oil, gas, and coal in the United States, necessarily our \npower would be reduced. That would move it to China, to India, to \nMexico, to places where they do not have these regulations and do not \nhave restrictions on emissions. It would have the effect of actually \nincreasing, not decreasing, CO2. Even if we are wrong on \nthat we have to keep in mind it would not make any difference.\n  I know there are several others who want to talk about this. I am \nvery excited we now have this as a pending amendment, to adopt what I \nrefer to as the Inhofe-Upton bill. He referred to it as the Upton-\nInhofe bill. It would merely take out the jurisdiction of the EPA to \nregulate CO2.\n  I would say also in the case of the Director, Lisa Jackson, when I \nasked the question--and this was a year ago in October, I say to my \ngood friend from Louisiana--I said: If you are going to try to have an \nendangerment finding so that would allow the EPA to regulate the same \nas the cap-and-trade would, it has to be based on science. What science \nwould you base it on? Her response was the United Nations IPCC. What is \nthat? It was Climategate IPC. It happened about a year ago. It was \ncooked science. I remember standing at this podium in this Senate many \ntimes, talking about how they have tried to falsify the science to make \npeople believe catastrophic global warming is going to come in as a \nresult of CO2 emissions.\n  I am glad this has come up. Right now we are looking at gasoline \napproaching $4 a gallon. It is a supply-and-demand situation. My friend \nfrom Louisiana has a lot of gas and oil in her State. We do in my State \nof Oklahoma. We need to get the regulators, who are the politicians, to \nallow us to go ahead and exploit our own resources. Eighty-three \npercent right now of the Federal lands where we could be producing oil \nand gas is off limits.\n  The last thing I will say before yielding the floor is that if we \nwere to take the recoverable oil and the recoverable gas and take away \nthe political obstacles that are in the way, we would have enough to \nrun this country for 90 years, in terms of the supply of oil, and for \n90 years in the supply of gas, all produced here in the United States. \nThat would mean we would not have to be reliant upon the Middle East to \nrun this machine called America.\n  Let's pull away those. The way to do that is to vote in favor of this \namendment and I am very excited we will have the opportunity to do that \nshortly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. The Senator and Senator McConnell have an amendment. \nThere is an amendment pending. We only have a minute and a half. I wish \nto call to the attention of the Chair, Senator Vitter has an amendment \nwhich we will take up to discuss later this afternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 178\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I want to briefly preview an amendment, \nVitter amendment No. 178, which I will formally call up this afternoon \nabout 2:45. This is a spending amendment to get back to what I believe \nis the central challenge we face as a country right now, this \nunsustainable path we are on with regard to Federal spending and debt. \nThis is a very simple, straightforward amendment which I think deserves \nand will hopefully get strong bipartisan support. It requires the \nFederal Government to get rid of its billions of dollars of inventory--\nliterally billions and billions of dollars of unutilized or \nunderutilized real property.\n  The Federal Real Property Council reports that the Federal Government \nowned or operated more than 1.1 million assets worldwide in 2007. It \nwas worth an estimated $1.5 trillion. But a lot of those assets, real \nproperty buildings, land, are unused or underused. According to OMB, \nthere are about 47,000 underutilized properties, almost 19,000 \ncompletely unutilized properties. That is over 65,000 properties with \nan estimated value of $83 billion that would better be diminished, \nsold, or demolished.\n  This is a commonsense way to save money in the Federal budget, to \nmove us forward in terms of a more sustainable path on spending and \ndebt. Obviously we need many more larger steps, but this is brought in \nthat spirit.\n  I look forward to returning to the floor around 2:45 to make it \nformally pending and to offer some brief additional comments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, according to the agreement, we are going \nto break now at 12:30 and take up this debate this afternoon and stay \non this bill with open debate. Hopefully, it can be productive and \ncordial and then, hopefully, we can move to pass this important bill, \nthe reauthorization of SBIR.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order with respect to \nSenator Portman be vitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, we will break now and come back and \nresume our debate at 2:15.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/15/senate-section/article/S1644-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1644]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, returning to the Senate is in many ways \nlike having a chance to relive part of one's life; yet doing so with \nthe benefit of experience, experience that I gained in serving in this \nbody before and also from service in the private sector. It allows one \nto see things differently than before.\n  While I can discuss with my colleagues many things that remain the \nsame in the Senate, there is also much that has changed in our country \nthat requires change in this institution. It is what has changed that \nhas brought me back to the Senate. The more I witnessed what was \nhappening to our country, the more I realized that I, like many others \nacross the country, needed to reengage in some way or another in the \ntask of returning our country to its basic values and time-tested \nprinciples, not the least of which is returning our Federal Government \nto one that ensures a healthy fiscal nation whose finances and policies \npromote job opportunities for its citizens.\n  I could not get comfortable with the fact that my generation might be \nthe first to leave a country to our children that is in worse fiscal \nshape and with less opportunity than the one we had the privilege of \ninheriting.\n  When I first came to Congress in 1981, one of the first votes I had \nto deal with was to raise the national debt limit to just over the $1 \ntrillion mark. It was a tough one. Think of that. For nearly 200 years, \nas our country prospered and grew financially, we spent ourselves into \n$1 trillion worth of debt. As a newly elected Member of the House of \nRepresentatives at that time, the last thing I wanted to do, \nparticularly having run on a campaign of limited government and \ntrimming the size of government and spending, was to make one of my \nvery first votes on raising the national debt to accommodate excessive \nspending. But gritting my teeth and swallowing hard, I followed the \nrequest of newly elected President Ronald Reagan, who said we need to \npay past bills so we can get to the job of cutting spending and cutting \ntaxes and getting our country back on the right track economically.\n  It is difficult for me to comprehend that I am standing here 30 years \nlater, and we are looking at a national debt of over $14.5 trillion. So \nin just 30 years we have gone from $1 trillion to $14.5 trillion. I \ncannot comprehend that number. Very few Americans can comprehend that \nnumber. But, clearly, one thing stands out; that is, this Federal \nGovernment has grown faster and much deeper in debt than any of us \ncould have imagined over a very short\n\n[[Page S1645]]\n\nperiod. We will pay a steep price tag for that debt. It threatens our \nway of life, as well as our Nation's security.\n  During the 1990s, the combination of economic growth and defeat of \nthe 1993 health care plan, President Clinton's decision to move to the \nmiddle and support welfare reform--all contributed to moving us toward \na more sensible and fiscally responsible balance between revenue and \nspending. In fact, in 1998, we actually reached a surplus of about $69 \nbillion, the first surplus reached since the year 1969. That would have \nbeen the ideal time to lock in a balanced budget amendment to ensure we \nwould not slip back into deficit spending and that Congress and the \nWhite House would be held accountable for future spending. There were \ntwo serious attempts during the 1990s, both of which I supported, to \nenact a balanced budget amendment. They failed, each one, by one vote. \nThink today where we would be fiscally had we gotten that one vote and \npassed either of those amendments and sent it to the States for \nratification, which I am sure they would have done. We would not be \nfacing the dire situation we face today.\n  I have decided not to go into the details of our exploding deficit \nand debt. Much has already been said and published in that regard. Much \nhas been said on this floor, and more will be said. Based on the last \nelection, the American public is now much better informed of our \ncurrent financial situation and the dangerous consequences of unchecked \nspending. We have spent beyond our means in all areas of government. We \nhave increased unfunded liabilities, and we have committed to programs \nwhich we cannot afford or sustain. Americans have heard the warnings of \nmany who have analyzed the situation and sounded the alarm.\n  In 2010, they said immediate action must be taken to avoid a national \nfiscal crisis of unprecedented negative consequences. What are those \nconsequences? Ultimately, those consequences include a lower standard \nof living, less income for families to take home to pay the mortgage, \nto buy that new car, to save and send their children to school. Those \nconsequences have, unfortunately, over the past couple of years put our \nNation in a serious unemployment situation. People are out of work, and \nthey have been out of work for months if not years. Ultimately, it all \nturns back to jobs.\n  Having the ability to bring home earnings that will sustain a family \nand provide opportunities for education, health, growth for those \nfamilies, and give our children and grandchildren and all those who \nfollow the opportunities so many of us have enjoyed--those are the \nconsequences we face if we don't today address these problems.\n  Many respected economists and financial experts have continued to \nissue dire warnings about our current fiscal condition. Let me quote a \nfew.\n  Erskine Bowles, former Chief of Staff to President Clinton and \ncochair of the President's deficit reduction committee, said:\n\n       This debt is like a cancer [that] will destroy the country \n     from within [unless Washington acts].\n\n  Pete Peterson, former U.S. Secretary of Commerce and finance \nexecutive, said about the national debt:\n\n       We need to ask ourselves, not just is this sustainable, but \n     is it moral? What does it mean to burden our kids to an \n     unconscionable doubling of their taxes?\n\n  Admiral Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said:\n\n       I believe our debt is the greatest threat to our national \n     security. If we as a country do not address our fiscal \n     imbalances in the near term, our national power will erode, \n     and the costs to our ability to maintain and sustain \n     influence could be great.\n\n  Finally, former U.S. Comptroller General David Walker, who served \nunder both Republican and Democratic administrations, said:\n\n       What threatens the ship are large, known and growing \n     structural deficits . . . Habitually spending more money than \n     you make is irresponsible.\n\n  But that is exactly what Washington has done, habitually spend, \nsinking our fiscal ship deeper and deeper each year.\n  We saw a drastic swing in November: Hoosiers and Americans united in \na common purpose to demand that our newly elected representatives and \nall representatives repair our fiscal health that has been destroyed by \nexcessive tax-and-spend policies. They called for a change in course. \nThey called for bold action today to preserve our country for tomorrow. \nThey realized that the stakes are too high to ignore or delay \naddressing our fiscal challenges. Hoosier families and businesses, \nlocal communities, States, and virtually every other entity across \nIndiana and the country have had to make sacrifices to trim their \nbudgets. They are now calling for the Federal Government and Congress \nto do the same.\n  We cannot succeed unless we together, Republicans and Democrats, \nagree that addressing our current fiscal crisis requires political \ncourage and bold action from both parties, both Chambers of Congress, \nand President Obama.\n  I wish to offer what I think are some solutions I believe Congress \nmust execute, perhaps, in a coordinated way, essential steps if we are \nserious about addressing the fiscal challenge before us.\n  First, stop the fiscal bleeding and avoid economic distress by doing \nso. Washington has to break its spending and borrowing addiction. Like \ncuring any bad habit, it will take discipline and commitment. As we \nconsider spending cuts and ways we can reverse the growth of \ngovernment, I believe everything must be on the table. All functions of \ngovernment should be examined, including mandatory spending and defense \nspending. Serious discussions and proposals are currently underway in \nthis Congress. I am participating in many of them. These proposals need \nto be considered carefully. They need to be debated and voted on.\n  Secondly, it is important we recognize that spending cuts alone will \nnot solve our fiscal challenges and preserve our future. We need to \npair our cuts with a pro-growth agenda that puts Hoosiers and Americans \nback to work. One of the ways Congress can achieve this goal is by \nreforming the Tax Code. By lowering marginal rates, by lowering \ncorporate rates to make us more competitive with our competitors around \nthe world, by eliminating exclusions and special introductions and \ncredits and simplifying the complex and convoluted Tax Code, Congress \ncan help advance the economic recovery. This is a necessary element in \nthe task of returning to fiscal health. I currently am working on \nlegislation on this very topic and hope to introduce it in the coming \nweeks.\n  Third, Washington needs to examine, reduce and, in many cases, \neliminate harmful regulations and mandates. As I have traveled across \nIndiana, perhaps one story I have heard over and over from every \nbusiness with which I engage is, regulations coming out of Washington, \nmany of which do not reflect the will of the people, the will of \nCongress but are imposed by nonelected bureaucrats, have put us at a \ndisadvantage with our competitors, have added additional burdens of \npaperwork and compliance that don't make sense from a health and safety \nstandpoint.\n  Oversight and proposals to address the regulatory burdens also need \nto be considered, debated, and voted on by this Congress.\n  Fourth, I think we need to promote trade policies. Six thousand \nbusinesses in Indiana export overseas. One-fourth of all of our \nmanufacturing jobs result from exports. A good first step in this \nprocess is to open our markets by approving the three pending trade \nagreements we have: Korea, Colombia, and Panama. This will increase job \nopportunities at home and put us on the path of continuing open trading \nthat provides so many jobs to so many Americans.\n  Having said all this, the greatest threat to our fiscal security is \nthe growing and unsustainable mandatory spending. We cannot strengthen \nour country's financial health without addressing Medicare and Medicaid \nand Social Security. These programs along with the interest on the \nnational debt consume nearly two-thirds of the Federal budget. While we \nhear a lot of talk about the necessity of tackling entitlement \nspending, little action occurs because it is often considered too \npolitically dangerous. However, I believe we no longer have a choice. \nWe no longer can defer addressing these problems until after the next \nelection. The entitlement crisis is before us and has been growing for \nseveral years.\n  We know about the coming baby boom generation that is retiring and \nthe impact that will put on entitlement programs. We have to commit to \nfinding a way to restructure these programs and make them solvent.\n\n[[Page S1646]]\n\n  Let me repeat that. We are not here to undercut these programs; we \nare here to preserve them. We are here to make the necessary \nstructural, long-term incremental changes so those benefits will be \nthere for people when they retire.\n  As Winston Churchill once said:\n\n       One ought never to turn one's back on a threatened danger \n     and try to run away from it. If you do that, you will double \n     the danger. But if you meet it promptly and without \n     flinching, you will reduce the danger [at least] by half.\n\n  We have not met this promptly. But I believe it is not too late to \nbegin the process of making commonsense adjustments to the current \nsystems. Modest incremental changes now will help us avoid much more \ndrastic and painful changes later.\n  In 1983, Congress was faced with a serious Social Security crisis. We \nwere months away from having checks not sent out. Together, President \nReagan, Tip O'Neill, majority and minority members of the Senate and \nthe House, and the political leaders of the respective parties gathered \ntogether and decided to put this issue and the solution to this issue \nabove politics, and they did so. It was a difficult debate and \ndiscussion, but we made the changes that were implemented on an \nincremental basis.\n  Social Security bought 30 years of solvency on the basis of that \ndecision. The sky did not fall. The economy did not collapse. And the \npeople, when they learned why we were doing what we were doing--to \npreserve the program, not leave it in a dire situation where benefits \nwould have to be cut or reduced dramatically--they backed what we did \nand supported it.\n  I believe we are in that position now with our entitlements. So if we \ncan propose sensible, modest changes that will save these programs, I \nthink the public will gladly support them.\n  Over the last decade, we have watched the storm clouds gather, and we \nhave watched as those fiscal clouds have drawn ever closer and become \never darker. They are now bearing down upon us, and alarms are sounding \nlouder than ever. As I have said, it is incumbent upon each of us in \nthis Congress to acknowledge that the storm is here and to do all we \ncan to mitigate the damage.\n  But given the current division of authority in our Congress and \nexecutive branch, it is incumbent upon the two Chambers and the two \nparties to set aside the politics of 2012 for the sake of the future of \nour Nation. I believe the voters will respond favorably to that \ndecision.\n  However, no matter what we do as elected representatives, we cannot \nultimately succeed without the engagement and the support and the \nleadership of the President of the United States. We know the President \nunderstands the gravity of the fiscal crisis. As a former Senator, as a \nPresidential candidate, and now as Commander in Chief, he has clearly \narticulated his understanding of the issue.\n  In 2006, then-Senator Obama said:\n\n       Increasing America's debt weakens us domestically and \n     internationally. Leadership means that the ``buck stops \n     here.'' Instead, Washington is shifting the burden of bad \n     choices today onto the backs of our children and \n     grandchildren. America has a debt problem and a failure of \n     leadership.\n\n  Those are the words of former Senator Barack Obama, now President of \nthe United States.\n  As a candidate for President, in 2008, Presidential candidate Barack \nObama said:\n\n       We're going to have to take on entitlements and I think \n     we've got to do it quickly.\n\n  And in 2009, President Obama said:\n\n       What we have done is kicked this can down the road. We are \n     now at the end of the road and are not in a position to kick \n     it any further.\n\n  He also promised his administration would ``work with Congress to \nexecute serious entitlement reform.''\n  President Obama, as both Republicans and more and more Democratic \nMembers of Congress are committing to go forward--and as Republican and \nDemocratic Governors of States in fiscal peril are responding--our \nNation, Mr. President needs you now to assume the primary leadership \nrole in helping us avert these financial problems and potential \nfinancial meltdown.\n  The 2012 election must be subordinate to the urgency and the \nchallenge before us. We cannot afford to wait until 2013 to begin the \nnecessary work to prevent a fiscal disaster. We need Presidential \nleadership now. Our country's future is at stake.\n  Given the immensity of our fiscal challenges we face today, some \nwould say it is too late to remedy the problem. I do not hold that \nview. And I do not hold that view primarily because of our Nation's \nhistory in rising to the challenge that faces us. From the Founding \nFathers to George Washington, from Abraham Lincoln to Roosevelt and \nReagan, times of trial and crisis have always produced moments of great \nleadership and the response of the American people to support that \nleadership.\n  That is what Americans are yearning for today: leadership--leadership \nto guide us out of this dangerous financial hole that threatens our \nNation's security and future.\n  So I ask our President--as other Presidents throughout our history \nhave done in times of major threats--Mr. President, grant us your \nleadership. Grant us the leadership needed to restore the strength and \nprosperity that has been the American story and has allowed our Nation \nto be the defenders and protectors of democracy and freedom.\n  Thirty years ago, Ronald Reagan delivered his first inaugural \naddress, and expressed the urgent need to rein in spending and curb the \nsize and growth of the Federal Government. He said doing so will \nrequire ``our best effort, and our willingness to believe in ourselves \nand to believe in our capacity to perform great deeds; to believe that \ntogether, with God's help, we can and will resolve the problems which \nnow confront us.''\n  For each of us serving here today, I believe it is our duty to rise \nto the immediate challenge and ``resolve the problems which now \nconfront us.'' It will take all of us uniting behind a common purpose--\nthat above all else, we must first restore and strengthen our fiscal \nsecurity. We must articulate a clear vision, set specific goals, and \nmake the tough decisions needed to bring our Nation out of debt and \npreserve prosperity and opportunity for future generations.\n  I am here today to commit to Hoosiers, to my colleagues, to my \nchildren and grandchildren, to all our Nation's children and \ngrandchildren, that I will not turn my back on our economic dangers or \nseek the false safety of political denial.\n  I am standing here today to find solutions, to make the hard \ndecisions, and to leave behind a country that is stronger and more \nfiscally secure for future generations.\n  This crisis is not insurmountable. We can overcome it by doing what \ngreat generations before us have done: mustering our will to do what is \nright. If we do, I know that America's greatest days are not behind us \nbut still lie ahead.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, not often in life does someone get a \nsecond opportunity to make a good first impression. The Senator from \nIndiana has had a chance to make two maiden speeches in the Senate. I \nconfess I was not there for the first one, but I am pleased to have \nbeen here for the second, and I want to commend him for his \nextraordinary speech, particularly his emphasis on the importance of \nthe President of the United States leading on the issue of entitlement \nreform.\n  We all know that under the Constitution only the President's \nsignature can make a law. I think what the Senator from Indiana has \npointed out, and many others have pointed out, is that on the issue of \nentitlement reform--the over $50 trillion of unfunded liabilities we \nhave lying out there ahead of us; promises we have made we cannot \nkeep--this cannot be done without Presidential leadership and a \nPresidential signature. I thank the Senator from Indiana for reminding \nus all of that. We all still hope the President will step up and help \nus meet this enormous challenge. I commend the Senator from Indiana for \na wonderful first impression.\n\n[[Page S1647]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/15/senate-section/article/S1647-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1647-S1673]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n            SBIR/STTR REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2011--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Human Rights\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to share my thoughts on the \nhearings held last week in the House of Representatives called ``The \nExtent of Radicalization in the American Muslim Community and that \nCommunity's Response.'' Congressional hearings are supposed to serve as \nan important role of oversight, investigation, or education, among \nother purposes. However, this particular hearing--billed as the first \nof a series--served only to fan flames of fear and division.\n  My first concern is the title of the hearing--targeting one \ncommunity. That is wrong. Each of us has a responsibility to speak out \nwhen communities are unfairly targeted.\n  In 1975, the United States joined all the countries of Europe and \nestablished the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, now \nknown as the OSCE. The Congress created the U.S. Helsinki Commission to \nmonitor U.S. participation and compliance with these commitments. The \nOSCE contains commitments in three areas or baskets: security, \neconomics, and human rights. Best known for its human rights \nadvancements, the OSCE has been aggressive in advancing these \ncommitments in each of the OSCE states. The OSCE stands for religious \nfreedom and protection of minority rights.\n  I am the Senate chair of the U.S. Helsinki Commission. In that \ncapacity, I have raised human rights issues in other countries, such as \nin France when, in the name of national security, the Parliament banned \nburqas and wearing of all religious articles or when the Swiss \nrestricted the building of mosques or minarets.\n  These policies were restrictive not only to the religious practice of \nMuslims but also Christians, Jews, and others who would seek to wear \nreligious symbols and practice their religion as they saw fit.\n  I have also raised human rights issues in the United States when we \nwere out of compliance with our Helsinki commitments. In that spirit, I \nfind it necessary to speak out against the congressional hearing \nchaired by Congressman Peter King.\n  Rather than constructively using the power of Congress to explore how \nwe as a nation can use all of the tools at our disposal to prevent \nfuture terrorist attacks and defeat those individuals and groups who \nwant to do us harm, this spectacle crossed the line and chipped away at \nthe religious freedoms and civil liberties we hold so dearly.\n  Radicalization may be the appropriate subject of a congressional \nhearing but not when it is limited to one religion. When that is done, \nit sends the wrong message to the public and casts a religion with \nunfounded suspicions.\n  Congressman King's hearing is part of a disturbing trend to demonize \nMuslims taking place in our country and abroad. Instead, we need to \nengage the Muslim community in the United States.\n  A cookie-cutter approach to profile what a terrorist looks like will \nnot work. As FBI Director Mueller recently testified to the Senate:\n\n        . . . during the past year, the threat from radicalization \n     has evolved. A number of disruptions occurred involving \n     extremists from a diverse set of backgrounds, geographic \n     locations, life experiences, and motivating factors that \n     propelled them along their separate radicalization pathways.\n\n  Let us remember that a number of terrorist attacks have been \nprevented or disrupted due to informants from the Muslim community who \ncontacted law enforcement officials.\n  I commend Attorney General Holder and FBI Director Mueller for \nincreasing their outreach to the Arab-American community. As Attorney \nGeneral Holder said:\n\n       Let us not forget it was a Muslim-American who first \n     alerted the New York police to a smoking car in Times Square. \n     And his vigilance likely helped to save lives. He did his \n     part to avert tragedy, just as millions of other Arab-\n     Americans are doing their parts and proudly fulfilling the \n     responsibility of citizenship.\n\n  We need to encourage this type of cooperation between our government \nand law enforcement agencies in the Muslim community.\n  As the threat from al-Qaida changes and evolves over time, the piece \nof the puzzle is even more important to get right. FBI Director Mueller \ntestified before the House recently that:\n\n       At every opportunity I have, I reaffirm the fact that 99.9 \n     percent of Muslim-Americans, Sikh-Americans, and Arab-\n     Americans are every bit as patriotic as anyone else in this \n     room, and that many of the anti-terrorism cases are a result \n     of the cooperation from the Muslim community and the United \n     States.\n\n  As leaders in Congress, we must live up to our Nation's highest \nideals and protect civil liberties, even in wartime when they are most \nchallenged. The 9/11 Commission summed up this well when they wrote:\n\n       The terrorists have used our open society against us. In \n     wartime, government calls for greater powers, and then the \n     need for those powers recedes after the war ends. This \n     struggle will go on. Therefore, while protecting our \n     homeland, Americans must be mindful of threats to vital \n     personal and civil liberties. This balancing is no easy task, \n     but we must constantly strive to keep it right.\n\n  I agree with Attorney General Holder's recent speech to the Arab-\nAmerican Anti-Discrimination Committee, where he stated:\n\n       In this Nation, our many faiths, origins, and appearances \n     must bind us together, not break us apart. In this Nation, \n     the document that sets forth the supreme law of the land--the \n     Constitution--is meant to empower, not exclude. And in this \n     Nation, security and liberty are--at their best--partners, \n     not enemies, in ensuring safety and opportunity for all.\n\n  Actions, such as the hearing held last week, that pit us against one \nanother based on our religious beliefs, weaken our country and its \nfreedoms and ultimately do nothing to make our country any safer. \nHearings such as the one held last week only serve as a distraction \nfrom our real goals and provide fuel for those who are looking for \nexcuses to find fault or blame in our way of life.\n  Let's not go the way of other countries but instead hold dear the \nprotections in our Constitution that safeguard the individual's right \nto freely practice their religion and forbid a religious test to hold \npublic office in the United States. Our country's strength lies in its \ndiversity and our ability to have strongly held beliefs and differences \nof opinion, while being able to speak freely and not fear the \ngovernment will imprison us for criticizing the government or holding a \nreligious belief that is not shared by the majority of Americans.\n  On September 11, 2001, our country was attacked by terrorists in a \nway we thought impossible. Thousands of innocent men, women, and \nchildren of all races, religions, and backgrounds were murdered. As the \n10-year anniversary\n\n[[Page S1648]]\n\nof these attacks draws closer, we continue to hold these innocent \nvictims in our thoughts and prayers, and we will continue to fight \nterrorism and bring terrorists to justice.\n  After that attack, I went back to my congressional district in \nMaryland at that time and made three visits as a Congressman. First I \nvisited a synagogue and prayed with the community. Then I visited a \nmosque and prayed with the community. Then I went to a church and \nprayed with the community. My message was clear on that day: We all \nneeded to join together as a nation to condemn the terrorist attacks \nand to take all necessary measures to eliminate safe havens for \nterrorists and bring them to justice. We all stood together on that day \nregardless of our background or personal beliefs.\n  But my other message was equally important: We cannot allow the \nevents of September 11 to demonize a particular community, religion, or \ncreed. Such actions of McCarthyism harken back to darker days in our \nhistory. National security concerns were used inappropriately and led \nto 120,000 Japanese-Americans being stripped of their property and \nrights and placed in internment camps in 1942, though not a single act \nof espionage was ever established.\n  The United States should not carry out a crusade against any \nparticular religion as a response to 9/11 or other terrorist attacks. \nThe United States will not tolerate hate crimes against any group, \nregardless of their religion or ethnicity, and we should not allow our \ninstitutions, including Congress, to be used to foment intolerance and \ninjustice. Let's come together as a nation and move forward in a more \nconstructive and hopeful manner.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I understand Senator Inhofe and Senator \nVitter are both on the floor to offer amendments to the SBIR and STIR \nProgram. Are we under a consent agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are not.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes, I yield to Senator Inhofe.\n  Mr. INHOFE. The pending amendment is No. 183. I ask unanimous consent \nthat it be temporarily set aside for the purpose of introducing \namendment No. 161.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Is that Senator Vitter's amendment? Senator Vitter was \nhere, so I wanted him to have the opportunity to offer his. It doesn't \nmatter to me in what order.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Why not recognize Senator Vitter for his amendment, set \naside our amendment temporarily, and then we will get to the Johanns \namendment after that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 178\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Thank you, Mr. President, and thanks to my colleagues for \ntheir courtesies and cooperation.\n  At this point, I move to temporarily set aside the pending amendment \nand to call up Vitter amendment No. 178.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Vitter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 178.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Definitions.\n``Sec. 622. Disposal program.''.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, right before lunch, I laid the groundwork \nfor this amendment, so let me quickly summarize.\n  This is one of a series of amendments that conservatives are bringing \nto the floor that go to our central challenge of reining in \nuncontrolled spending and debt. Clearly, we face a monumental challenge \nin this country from the fact that we are on an unsustainable path \nright now of Federal spending and debt. Clearly, this endangers our \nfuture. We are used to talking about it as a threat to our kids and \ngrandkids--something that will come home to roost years from now.\n  Sadly, in the last several years, it has grown to much more than \nthat. It is such an unsustainable path that it yields the possibility \nof a crisis within weeks or months or a couple of years. So we cannot \nkick the can down the road. We cannot fail to act now. We must change \nthe fiscal path we are on to protect not just future generations but \nour country as we know it right now. In that spirit, a number of fiscal \nconservatives are coming to the floor to offer spending and debt \namendments, and I am honored to be associated with that group. We will \nsee other Senators come down, including Senator Cornyn and Senator \nRubio, Senator DeMint, Senator Paul, and others, with other spending \nand debt amendments.\n  Amendment No. 178 is a very simple, straightforward idea. It would \nmandate that the Federal Government, in an orderly way, begin to get \nrid of billions of dollars worth of unused or underused Federal \nproperty. There have been many studies on this topic. They all come to \nthe same bottom line, which is that the Federal Government owns many \ntens of billions of dollars worth of unused or underused Federal \nproperty that not only represents assets that could be liquidated to \nyield money to the Federal Treasury, but as long as we hold on to it as \na Federal Government, it represents enormous ongoing\n\n[[Page S1649]]\n\ncosts to simply maintain and deal with this unused Federal property.\n  The Office of Management and Budget says there are over 46,000 \nunderutilized properties but almost 19,000 completely unused \nproperties, with an estimated value between the two categories of $83 \nbillion. Those properties could be liquidated and that money brought to \nthe Treasury. Also, in the meantime, if we don't do this, that is \nactually costing us money in terms of upkeep--mowing the grass, if you \nwill, and a lot more other and expensive upkeep.\n  This amendment is very simple and straightforward to require the \nFederal Government to sell off or demolish this property and help \ncontribute, in a limited way but an important way, to get us on a \ndifferent, more sustainable fiscal path.\n  Again, I commend this amendment to all of my colleagues, Democrats \nand Republicans. As I said, it is part of a broader effort on this \nbill--as well as on other bills, I am sure, in the future--to get us on \na different fiscal path.\n  Today and over the next few days, we will be seeing Senators Cornyn, \nDeMint, Rubio, and others coming to the floor with this set of fiscal \namendments to nudge, push, pull--anything we can do--this body and the \nCongress in this important direction before it is too late.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. With that, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, let me just add a word. I see the \nSenator from Oklahoma. Again, as the managers of this bill, Senator \nSnowe and I have worked across party lines to bring the SBIR bill to \nthe floor. We want to have as open an amendment process as possible. We \nthink that is fair. We would like to really ask people to focus on \namendments specific to this legislation. I know time on the Senate \nfloor is precious, and we don't get as much time as we would like to \noffer our bills and amendments, but we do ask that of everyone so we \ncan try to get this bill to the House and, hopefully, to the \nPresident's desk.\n  Senator Inhofe is here to offer an amendment. We agreed earlier to \nallow that to happen, so I will turn the floor over to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 161\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator from Louisiana.\n  First of all, we are currently on, it is my understanding, amendment \nNo. 183. I ask unanimous consent to set aside the current amendment for \nconsideration of amendment No. 161 by Senator Johanns and ask for its \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe], for Mr. Johanns, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 161.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal the \n  expansion of information reporting requirements to payments made to \n   corporations, payments for property and other gross proceeds, and \n       rental property expense payments, and for other purposes)\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n            TITLE VI--COMPREHENSIVE 1099 TAXPAYER PROTECTION\n\n     SEC. 601.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to return to the \npending amendment, amendment No. 183.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Thank you. Again, I thank the Senator from Louisiana.\n  This is an amendment to the underlying bill. It is a very significant \none.\n  To give a little background, for the last 9 years, I have had an \neffort to stop legislation called cap-and-trade legislation. It is one \nthat I think everyone now--no one used to hear about it, but everyone \nis familiar with it now after all these 9 years. It goes all the way \nback to the Kyoto treaty, when people realized, under the Clinton \nadministration, that we were not going to ratify that treaty. In fact, \nPresident Clinton never even brought it up for ratification. But people \nrealized this would be something very, very expensive to America.\n  So after that, in 2003, 2005, 2008, and on up, there were about seven \ndifferent times that Members of the Senate brought up different cap-\nand-trade legislation. It was in 2003 that MIT and the Wharton School \ncame out with analyses of what it would cost to do a cap-and-trade \nbill. The amount always ranged between $300 billion and $400 billion a \nyear. I quite often say, when we are talking about billions and \nbillions of dollars, you have to bring this home so people understand \nwhat we are talking about. In this case, in my State of Oklahoma, this \nwould equate to something a little bit over $3,000 for every family \nthat files a tax return.\n  The reason I am bringing this up at this time is that they tried to \npass this all throughout the years. I think the last one was the \nWaxman-Markey bill over in the House. It came over to the Senate, and, \nof course, they didn't have near the votes to pass it over here. I \nthink the most votes they could have gotten at any time in the Senate \nto pass a cap-and-trade bill was about 30 votes. Obviously, that is not \nenough.\n  So this administration decided: Since they won't do it legislatively, \nwe will do what they wouldn't do legislatively through regulations. \nThat is where the Environmental Protection Agency came along and--of \ncourse, back when the Republicans were in the majority, I was the \nchairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee. Now it is \nSenator Boxer from California, and I am the ranking member. So we have \njurisdiction over the Environmental Protection Agency.\n  I think it is very important that we draw this in and make an attempt \nto connect the dots and make people realize what we are talking about \nnow. There is great concern in this country about the price of gas at \nthe pumps. It is approaching $4 a gallon, and this is something of \ngreat concern to my wallet and to everybody else I know in the State of \nOklahoma.\n  The problem we have is a bureaucratic problem. It is a problem of \nthis administration not allowing us to exploit the reserves we have in \nthis country.\n  We hear over and over--or we did; we have not heard it recently--that \nwe have only 28 billion barrels of proven\n\n[[Page S1650]]\n\nreserves and that is not enough to provide for our own consumption in \nthis country. I ask us now to go to the CRS report. Less than 1 year \nago, Senator Murkowski and I requested a CRS, Congressional Research \nService, report. They said, right now, the United States of America has \nmore oil, gas, and coal reserves than any other country in the world.\n  Let's take first the oil reserves. These are the proven reserves. The \nproblem with using the word ``proven'' instead of ``recoverable'' is \nthat proven has to be the result of drilling. We have to drill and know \nit is there. Obviously, if we have obstacles so that a majority of \npeople, along with the administration, do not want us to drill \noffshore, do not want us to drill on public lands, and we cannot get in \nthere and prove it, then we have to go back and take the recoverable \noil.\n  This is what the geologists say we have in this country. No one has \nrefuted this, I might add. Instead of being 28 billion barrels, it is \n135 billion barrels of oil. If we carry that further, we realize this \nreport is one that shows clearly we could have these huge reserves.\n  Let's go to natural gas and see what this same CRS report says about \nnatural gas. This chart shows a combination of the fossil fuels; that \nis, gas, coal, and oil. First is the United States of America. Second \nis Russia. It shows the United States has greater recoverable reserves \nthan Saudi Arabia, China, Iraq, and these countries combined. There is \na huge reserve out there. In fact, the reserves of oil we are talking \nabout, we have the equivalent to replace our imports from the Persian \nGulf for more than 90 years. In other words, if we lift the \nrestrictions we currently have in place on drilling for oil, it will be \n90 years.\n  Gas turns out to be about the same. Based on the CRS report, it says \nthe 2009 assessment of the Potential Gas Committee states that \nAmerica's future supply of natural gas is 2,000 trillion. At today's \nrate of use, this would be enough natural gas to meet America's demand \nfor 90 years.\n  The report also reveals the number of coal reserves. The coal \nreserves are 28 percent of the world's coal. CRS cites America's \nrecoverable coal reserves to be 262 billion short tons. For \nperspective, the United States consumes 1.2 billion short tons of coal \nper year. That is a major export opportunity for us, as well as for \njobs.\n  When we talk about our reserves in oil, gas, and coal, there are a \nlot more out there. This is just what we know is recoverable. For \nexample, I did not include oil and gas shale. The Green River Formation \nlocated in Colorado, Wyoming, and Utah contains the equivalent of 6 \ntrillion barrels of oil. The Department of Energy estimates that of \nthis 6 trillion, approximately 1.38 trillion barrels are potentially \nrecoverable. That is equivalent to more than five times the oil \nreserves of Saudi Arabia. I did not include these when I said we have \nenough to sustain us for 90 years.\n  Another domestic energy source is methane hydrates. That is another \none that has tremendous potential. While the estimates vary \nsignificantly, the U.S. Geological Survey recently testified that ``the \nmean in-place gas hydrate resource for the entire United States is \nestimated to be 320,000 trillion cubic feet of gas.'' For a \nperspective, if just 3 percent of this resource can be commercialized \nin the years ahead, at current rates of consumption, that level of \nsupply would be enough to provide America natural gas for more than 400 \nyears. I did not include that. For 400 years, I am only including what \nis recoverable and what is out there. That is what I call energy \nsecurity.\n  We need to also realize it is not just energy we can do. There is \nnothing more basic than supply and demand. If we are stopping our \nsupply of oil and gas in this country, the demand is going to go up, \nand we will have to go elsewhere. If we want to become independent--and \nwe could become independent if we were to exploit our own resources.\n  We have other reports that talk about the number of jobs at stake. \nOnly two deepwater well permits have been issued in the last 11 months. \nI thought, at the time when we had the oilspill in the gulf, there were \ngoing to be people around saying: Aha, we are going to parlay this into \nstopping production, stopping exploration. Sure enough, they did.\n  While the moratorium on the gulf has been lifted, only two deepwater \nwell permits have been issued in the last 11 months. Delays and \ncontinuation of the current permitting pace could cost 125,000 jobs in \n2015, and getting down to the developing of Alaska's offshore, for \nexample, would create 55,000 jobs a year. We are talking about a lot of \njobs. We are talking about a lot of reasons we should go ahead and \nadopt this amendment.\n  Let's keep in mind what this amendment is. It is an amendment that \nwould take away jurisdiction from the Environmental Protection Agency \nto regulate greenhouse gases, anthropogenic gases, and leave that as \nsomething that should be done by Members of the Senate and the House.\n  Senator Baucus from Montana said:\n\n       I mentioned that I do not want the EPA writing those \n     regulations. I think it's too much power in the hands of one \n     single agency, but rather climate change should be a matter \n     that's essentially left to the Congress.\n\n  That is what we are talking about. As we speak, the House is marking \nup the bill. It is the Upton-Inhofe bill over there, and over here it \nis the Inhofe-Upton bill. That is to stop EPA from this regulation.\n  Senator Nelson from Nebraska said:\n\n       Controlling the level of carbon emissions is the job of \n     Congress. We don't need the EPA looking over Congress' \n     shoulder telling us we're not moving fast enough.\n\n  We have some eight Democratic Senators joining them saying that the \nEPA does not have the authority and should not be doing it. We are \ntalking about Senators such as Senator Mark Begich, Senator Sherrod \nBrown, Senator Bob Casey, Senator Claire McCaskill, Senator Carl Levin, \nand Senator Max Baucus.\n  That is the reason I feel optimistic that if we can call up this \namendment for a vote, we are going to have a favorable vote on it. I \nknow all the Republicans are going to vote for it, and I think an awful \nlot of the Democrats will when we are facing a situation where we have \ngas going so high it is going to be difficult to not give serious \nconsideration to this amendment.\n  I go further to say the administration has been of no help. I have a \nquote I have used several times on the floor. Steven Chu, the Secretary \nof Energy, told the Wall Street Journal that somehow we have to figure \nout how to boost the price of gasoline to the levels in Europe. That is \n$8 a gallon. What they are saying is, they want to do away with fossil \nfuels, and before we can go to other forms of energy, we have to do \nthat. In the meantime, how do we run this machine called America? We \ncannot do it without oil, gas, and coal.\n  The bottom line is, we do have enough oil, gas, and coal to run this \ncountry. We could be independent from our reliance on the Middle East--\ntotally--after a short period of time. People say: If we were to open \nall these places, it would be another 5 or 6 years before we are able \nto actually produce this oil and gas we so desperately need in this \ncountry. In response to that I say: First of all, it will not be that \nlong. Secondly, I heard that same argument 5, 6 years ago, and if we \nhad done it then, we would be there today.\n  We have a serious problem that is looming out there. I know others \nwant to speak. I know Senator Barrasso--by the way, Senator Barrasso \nhas a different amendment than this amendment, even though he is a \ncosponsor of this amendment No. 183. This would go into such things as \nNEPA, the Endangered Species Act, and the other things the EPA is \ntrying to use to regulate greenhouse gases to change our lifestyle in \nAmerica. That is where we are today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his courtesy. I \nam not speaking about this issue. I saw he looked over in this \ndirection. I will be brief.\n  I rise to speak about the current debate over the Federal debt. Last \nweek, H.R. 1, the House Republican scorched-earth spending proposal \nthat counts among its casualties such priorities as border security, \ncancer research, disaster preparedness, and much needed investments in \ndomestic energy production, was summarily defeated in the\n\n[[Page S1651]]\n\nSenate. That same day, a Democratic alternative that would have cut \nspending by $10 billion, compared to current levels, and $51 billion, \ncompared to the President's budget request, was also defeated. We were \nhopeful these failed votes would be an opportunity to start afresh. We \nthought it would allow us to hit the reset button on the negotiations.\n  The purpose of those votes was to make it clear that both sides' \nopening bids in this debate were nonstarters and thus pave the way for \na serious, good-faith compromise.\n  Unfortunately, an intense ideological tail continues to wag the dog \nin the House of Representatives. One week after those test votes failed \nin the Senate, House conservatives are still showing no yield. We have \nmoved $10 billion in their direction. They have not budged an inch off \nH.R. 1, even though H.R. 1 did not get a single Democratic vote in the \nSenate. In fact, the Republican conservatives in the House are digging \nin. In the last 48 hours, there has been a wave of hard-liners who are \nnow rejecting even the 3-week stopgap measure negotiated last week. \nThis measure is needed to avert a government shutdown this Friday. But \nin a vote occurring very shortly in the House, there is expected to be \na number of rightwing defections on this short-term continuing \nresolution.\n  Look, Democrats agree this short-term solution is not ideal. Running \nthe government 2 weeks at a time is not good for anyone. We prefer not \nto have to do another stopgap measure, but we recognize the need, the \nnecessity of averting a government shutdown.\n  Throughout this debate, Democrats have shown a willingness to \nnegotiate, a willingness to meet Republicans in the middle. Yet the \nrank and file of the House GOP has been utterly unrelenting. They have \nwrapped their arms around the discredited reckless approach advanced by \nH.R. 1, and they will not let go.\n  But why are House conservatives bucking their leadership by resisting \neven the stopgap measure? It certainly cannot be because it does not \ncut spending because it does by another $6 billion over just 3 weeks. \nThe real reason many of the House conservative Republicans, \nparticularly the freshmen, oppose the stopgap CR is clear. It is \nbecause it does not contain the extraneous riders they demand.\n  H.R. 1 was chock-full of ideological policy measures. These items \ndeal with controversial issues such as abortion, global warming, and \nnet neutrality. They do not belong on a budget bill, but they were \nshoehorned onto it anyway. These measures are akin to a heavy anchor \nbogging down the budget negotiations.\n  In recent days, a number of rightwing interest groups--the Heritage \nFoundation and the Family Research Council--began encouraging \nRepublicans to vote against any budget measure that does not contain \nthese controversial policy measures. This is what is driving the \ndefections on the Republican side.\n\n  For example, Mike Pence explained he is voting no because the 3-week \nmeasure doesn't weigh in on abortion. He is the author of the \ncontroversial hard-right amendment to defund Planned Parenthood. \nYesterday, he said he wouldn't mind a government shutdown if it meant \nhe could succeed in passing his rider. Michele Bachmann said she is \nvoting no because the short-term CR doesn't repeal the health care law. \nTim Huelskamp, a freshman from Kansas on the Budget Committee, said he \nwould oppose the stopgap measure because it lacked riders against EPA \nand against family planning.\n  We finally know why a compromise has been so hard to come by on the \nbudget. It is because Republicans want more than spending cuts; they \nwant to impose their entire social agenda on the back of a must-pass \nbudget. They are entitled to their policy positions, but there is a \ntime and place to debate these issues--and this ain't it.\n  We have seen this type of overreach before. In the recent battle in \nWisconsin, where Governor Scott Walker went to war with the State's \npublic workers. Governor Walker started out seeking concessions from \nthe unions on their benefits in order to reduce Wisconsin 's budget \nshortfall. In the spirit of cooperation, unions agreed to reduce their \nbenefits. But the Governor didn't take yes for an answer. He went \nfurther and insisted on ending collective bargaining entirely.\n  The budget fight going on right now in this Chamber is also about \nmore than just budget cuts. The conservative Republicans in the House \nare showing themselves to be Scott Walker Republicans. They are using \nthe budget to try to shoot the Moon on a wish list of far-right policy \nmeasures.\n  If this debate were only about spending cuts, we would probably come \nto an agreement before too long. But we will have a hard time coming to \nan agreement with these Scott Walker Republicans who are trying to use \nthe budget to enact a far-right social agenda.\n  I urge Speaker Boehner to consider a path to a solution to this \nyear's budget that may not go through the tea party. He should consider \nmoving on without them and forge a consensus among more moderate \nRepublicans and a group of Democrats because if these extraneous policy \nitems are going to be a must-have on the budget, a compromise will be \nvery, very, very hard to come by.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to speak in support \nof the incredibly important legislation that is on the Senate floor, \nthe Small Business Innovation Research Program reauthorization, a bill, \nS. 493, which also reauthorizes the Small Business Technology Transfer \nProgram.\n  I want to commend Senator Landrieu, the chair of the Small Business \nand Entrepreneurship Committee, and her ranking minority member, \nSenator Snowe of Maine, for their leadership in moving this to the \nSenate floor. Getting this considered is vital to making progress on \nthis bipartisan bill.\n  This is the third in a series of bipartisan bills we have taken up. \nThe first two--the FAA reauthorization, and the second, the patent \nreform bill--have passed, and it is my hope that all of us in this \nChamber will seriously consider supporting S. 493.\n  The 30 million small businesses in America are incubators of \ncreativity and job creation. They drive our innovation sector and make \nus more competitive globally. In addition to employing over half our \nprivate sector workforce, small businesses are the backbone of our \nAmerican communities and can be a source of economic advancement for \nmillions of Americans in every State.\n  The Small Business Innovation Research Program, or SBIR, sets aside a \nsmall part of the research and development budget from a number of \nFederal agencies to be used as grants for small businesses, and the \nSmall Business Technology Transfer Program, or STTR, helps scientists \nand innovators at research institutions take their discoveries and \ncommercialize them through small business startups.\n  Since their creation in 1982 and 1992, respectively, SBIR and STTR \nhave invested more than $28 billion in helping American small \nbusinesses turn into big businesses through innovation and \ncommercialization of cutting-edge products. The classic example, which \na number of our colleagues, including Senator Landrieu, have \nhighlighted in the conversation so far is Qualcomm of San Diego, which \nbegan as a small business of just 35 employees and has now, in fact, \ngrown to a company of 17,000. It pays more in taxes every year than the \nwhole budget of the SBA.\n  We can't lose sight that every large company in America at one point \nbegan as a small business. The SBIR and STTR Programs were created \nthrough bipartisanship and should maintain wide support. In fact, SBIR \nwas signed into law by former President Ronald Reagan. They more than \npay for themselves and the jobs and economic growth they create and the \ntaxes paid by these companies as they grow.\n  For too long, the Senate has kicked the can down the road by passing \ntemporary extensions month after month, year after year, for these two \nvital programs. This week, at long last, we have a chance to pass real \nlong-term reauthorization.\n  It is a shame that we had to vote for cloture even to just begin \ndebating this bill which has wide bipartisan support. Ideology should \nnot trump practical solutions that can put more Americans back to work \nand get our economy\n\n[[Page S1652]]\n\nmoving again. These two programs are proven vehicles for growth in all \nour States, including my home State of Delaware.\n  In Delaware, where we have a strong and growing high-tech sector, \nsmall businesses have been benefiting from these two programs. With \nyour forbearance, Mr. President, I will, for a moment, just mention \nthree.\n  One Delaware company that received a critical SBIR grant was \nElcriton. Elcriton started with two employees who patented a process to \ntake bacteria which turned algae into butanol for fuel. Imagine that. \nThink of the possibility of literally using pond scum to produce fuel \nfor cars and trucks. Butanol is superior to ethanol in many respects \nbecause it is more compatible with the whole current petroleum \ninfrastructure. This SBIR grant enabled this company to expand \nsignificantly, to grow their production, and to scale up not just the \nresearch and development but their early-stage manufacturing.\n  Another company--Compact Membrane Systems of Newport, DE--is putting \na $1 million SBIR grant to work developing a hollow fiber filter that \nis used to filter hydraulic fluid from water. This extends the life of \nmachinery, such as wind turbines, that use hydraulic fluid or filter \noil. They started with three employees and now have 24. Five of those \nhires were directly made possible through the SBIR grant.\n  Last, in Newark, DE, ANP Technologies is using an SBIR grant to build \nbiological detection systems for our American Department of Defense. \nThe kit they are developing is rapid, lightweight, and lifesaving for \nour troops and our first responders. This is another example of a great \napplication of cutting-edge technology by a small business that will \nhave positive impacts for our first responders, our Armed Forces, and \nmy home community of Newark, DE.\n  Since 1983, over 403 Delaware small businesses have received more \nthan $100 million in SBIR grants. I know every one of my colleagues in \nthe Senate has a similar positive story from his or her State. Each one \nof these businesses I just spoke about in Delaware could be the next \nQualcomm. Any one of the small businesses in our States that receive \ngrants through SBIR and support through STTR could generate a \nrevolution in high tech that spurs the creation of thousands of jobs.\n  In my view, we cannot afford to let this critical job-creating \nprogram expire. According to one report, businesses backed by SBIR \ngrants have been responsible for almost one-quarter of our Nation's \nmost important innovations over the past decade, and they account for \nalmost 40 percent of our Nation's patents. The applications range from \nthe military to medicine, from education to emergency services.\n  Congress must have a smart approach to budget reform that balances \nbudget cuts with strategic long-term investments that create growth and \njob creation for our communities--a great example of exactly what it is \nthat the SBIR and STTR Programs do. I hope all our colleagues will join \nin supporting Senator Landrieu of Louisiana in supporting this vital \nbill and the great work she and the committee have done to advance it \nto this stage.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I sincerely appreciate the remarks of \nthe Senator from Delaware and thank him for his support not only of \nthis program but for his expertise and leadership in the whole area of \nsmall business innovation and technological advancements. He was quite \na leader in his previous positions in Delaware, and he brings a great \ndeal of expertise to the Senate.\n  I know the Senator from Alaska is on the floor to speak about an \namendment that is pending for debate and consideration. We may have \namendments that are called up for votes today--that has not been \nfinally decided--but we can come to the floor, of course, and offer \namendments and debate several that are pending.\n  One thing I want to say before I turn it over to Senator Murkowski is \nthat I think Senator Coons hit the nail on the head when he said a \nsmart budget plan is going to work to meet the challenges of this \nextraordinary debt we have that has been caused for multiple reasons. \nIt is important we address that correctly and not just one-sided.\n  This bill addresses a significant aspect of smart budgeting and debt \nreduction by creating jobs that generate revenues for governments at \nthe local level that are looking for those revenues, at the State level \nwhere they are desperate for those revenues, and at the Federal level \nthat could most certainly use some additional tax revenues so we can \nmaintain our leadership in strategic investments.\n  Now, there were some on the floor this morning and in the Senate who \nsaid the only way to get to a balanced budget is by slashing some of \nthe important programs that help create the atmosphere in America for \nbusinesses to thrive. Some of that would be strategic investments in \ninfrastructure; some of that would be strategic investments in \neducation. But even the Business Roundtable would say the last programs \nwe should be cutting from the budget are effective job training and \neducation programs. Yet, according to the philosophy of some, those are \nthe first programs that get slashed.\n  That is not smart budgeting. That is not closing the budget gap. That \nis not putting your head to the problem. What the Senator from Delaware \nsaid is, it is a combination of some strategic cutting and some \ndiscretionary budgets. We are going to have to pare down the defense \nbudget appropriately and find some cuts in some savings.\n  Even Secretary Gates acknowledges there is waste, fraud, and abuse in \nthe Defense bill. But, most importantly, I think Democrats and \nRepublicans are coming together to say we can grow our way out by \nproducing jobs, and this reauthorization bill is one of the bills that \ncan actually do that. So I just wanted to put a little exclamation \npoint on that part.\n  I see the Senator from Alaska, who is going to be expressing her \nviews on one of the amendments that is pending. Then Senator Boxer is \nalso on the Senate floor, as is Senator Lautenberg from New Jersey. I \nthink Senator Snowe may want to say just one word.\n  Senator Snowe is here to offer an amendment. So why don't we turn to \nSenator Murkowski.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Just a parliamentary inquiry: Since we are going back and \nforth, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized after Senator \nMurkowski.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Small \nBusiness Committee, as well as the ranking member, for their work on \nthis legislation. Senator Landrieu has spoken about the necessity, \nparticularly in this environment today, as we are coming out of a \nrecession, to ensure we have a conducive environment for our small \nbusinesses to thrive. It is not just about incentives and \nopportunities, it is that business environment.\n  One of the things I think is important for us as policymakers to look \nat is those things that are put in place that perhaps smother our \nbusinesses, whether it is through regulation or the cost of permitting, \nbut also those things that create uncertainty. That is what I would \nlike to speak to for just a few minutes this afternoon.\n  The minority leader put forth an amendment several hours ago that \nwould put a stop to the EPA's command-and-control climate regulations. \nThis is an amendment for which I am rising today to offer my support. \nThis is not the first time I have had an opportunity to be here on the \nSenate floor to speak about my concern about the agency advancing \npolicies ahead of the Congress; of the EPA advancing regulations that \nset climate policy--again, before the Congress had acted. We spent a \nconsiderable amount of time here last year discussing the pitfalls of \nEPA's massive and unprecedented expansion of regulatory powers as they \nsought to advance those regulations that would impose that uncertainty \non our businesses.\n  I remain as convinced now as I was when we had the arguments \npreviously, when we were talking about this resolution of disapproval \nagainst the EPA, I remain as convinced as ever that EPA's efforts to \nimpose these backdoor climate regulations is the wrong way, and perhaps \nit is the worst way to address our Nation's energy and climate \nchallenges.\n\n[[Page S1653]]\n\n  Our country is struggling to recover from the worst economic downturn \nin our modern history. We talk daily about the need for us, as \nlawmakers, to advance those policies that will help our Nation restore \njob growth. All this is going on in the midst of global events that are \nclearly out of our control. We have chaotic global events that have \ndriven our energy prices to near 2-year highs. The last thing in the \nworld for us to do would be to allow unelected bureaucrats to impose \nnew economic burdens on our families and on our businesses.\n  In combination with these recent events overseas, the EPA's \nregulation of greenhouse gases is contributing to increased energy \nprices. The proliferation, the numbers are astounding in terms of what \nthe EPA is advancing in terms of these regulations that hit our \nbusinesses every day. The proliferation of EPA rulemaking on climate \nchange is creating pervasive uncertainty throughout our economy. It has \nstymied and delayed new investments in energy production and this will \nonly become worse once the temporary relief provided by the EPA's \n``tailoring rule'' is tossed out by the courts or perhaps ratcheted \ndown by EPA's own timeline.\n  What is most troubling is that the EPA has consistently failed to \nconsider what the economic impact of their rulemaking is. We have asked \nrepeatedly. Yet there is no response back from the EPA. It is kind of a \nshell game that we have seen moving forward. First, the EPA claimed its \nendangerment finding is simply a scientific finding, it is nothing \nmore; there is not going to be any regulatory burden that will be \ncreated as a result of this.\n  Then we saw a deal struck between the automakers and the State of \nCalifornia and the environmentalists and the EPA to tie emissions \nstandards to already enacted mileage increases for light-duty vehicles. \nThat move then triggered regulation of greenhouse gases under the Clean \nAir Act for all emitters, including stationary sources. But here again \nthere was no economic analysis provided by the EPA. A lack of this \nanalysis or this assessment and the lack of information led many \nMembers of Congress, myself included, to repeatedly ask for a study of \nthe potential impacts. But EPA has disregarded these requests. Finally, \nthey published their tailoring rule, which was not only finished \nwithout a real economic analysis, but it was somewhat brazenly pitched \nas regulatory relief. They first said this was not a burden that had \nbeen imposed, and then they come back and say now we are providing \nregulatory relief. That is kind of an odd claim to have made.\n  But what became clear throughout all of this is that the EPA wants us \nto believe that none of their actions have imposed new regulatory \nrequirements and therefore there is no cost. If we have not added any \nregulatory burden there is not going to be any subsequent cost.\n  But this assertion simply denies logic. Their regulations require \nthat expensive new permits be obtained. To do that you have expensive \nnew technologies that have to be purchased, installed, and operated.\n  In the next few years these requirements will become more severe and \nmore businesses will be folded in to face them. To accept these \neconomy-wide climate regulations with no substantive analysis of their \neconomic impacts is to take a huge gamble with an already fragile \nAmerican economy. This is a gamble that I believe we should not take. \nThe amendment from the minority leader that was presented earlier today \nwould ensure that we do not.\n  As I mentioned just starting off on my comments, I think it is \nfitting that this debate does take place on legislation that is \ndesigned to help our small businesses. It is true that because the EPA \nhas decided they are not going to regulate greenhouse gases under the \nClean Air Act--but not according to it--they are not going to regulate \nthe small businesses at this point in time. Soon, however, they are \ngoing to be caught up in the same net as their larger counterparts. In \nthe meantime, as the customers of the refiners and powerplants \nthroughout the country that are now regulated, our small businesses \nwill inevitably face increased costs. Innovation should not mean having \nto find creative ways to comply with government regulations in order to \nkeep your doors open.\n  Fortunately, it is not too late to prevent this situation from \nbecoming worse. The first round of regulations kicked in at the start \nof this year, and then the so-called New Source Performance Standards \nfor refineries and powerplants, one of the next steps in the EPA's \nregulatory process, are not expected until later this year. We can and \nwe should step in now to prevent this additional growth of the now \nsweeping regulatory burden from the EPA. If we do not act now, if we \nfail to act now, America's competitive position in the world will \ncontinue to deteriorate.\n  This should be cause for concern for all of us serving here in the \nCongress. Unfortunately, we have not only failed to put a stop to this \nagenda but some have actually embraced it. Explanations are out there, \nI am sure. Perhaps the most common is a misplaced hope that by forcing \nconsumers to pay more for energy, somehow or other this is going to \nusher in the green jobs to manufacture the wind turbines and other \nequipment that can just as easily be made overseas. It is this kind of \nthinking that brought us to where we were last year, or the year \nbefore, with the tremendously unpopular cap-and-trade bill.\n  For too many in this town, here in Washington, DC, higher energy \nprices have been an explicit goal. The President, when the cap-and-\ntrade proposal was being debated, very clearly stated--his words--\n``electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket.''\n  The Secretary of Energy has said a couple of years ago, ``Somehow we \nhave to figure out how to boost the price of gasoline to the levels in \nEurope.'' Notably, I think those comments were made when gasoline was \neven more expensive than it is today.\n  But every Member of this Chamber should recognize where EPA is going \nwith these regulations. They are the administration's plan B, initially \nmeant to force us here in Congress to pass cap-and-trade and now of \ncourse substitute for it. I think the question that is worth asking is, \nif cap-and-trade could not pass for lack of support, why should we let \nthese regulations replace them? If we would not agree to a legislative \nprogram because it was too damaging, why would we let command-and-\ncontrol regulations, pressed into place through rulemakings, be the \nanswer instead?\n  If we knew these regulations are a bad idea whose time should not \nhave come, why--why--would we let American families and businesses \nsuffer greater and greater consequences?\n  In the midst of our economic recovery and high energy prices, we need \nto protect our small businesses, not expose them to new regulatory \nburdens. I think the amendment of the minority leader would do just \nthat. I am hopeful the Senate will have an opportunity to vote on it \nand pass it within the near future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have the floor now to respond to some of \nthe statements of my friend from Alaska, and also to be able to enter \ninto some colloquies about this very dangerous and radical amendment. \nBut before I do that, without losing my right to the floor, I yield for \na moment to Senator Snowe to lay down an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California for \nyielding to me so I could call up an amendment. I ask unanimous consent \nto set aside the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 193\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to call up amendment No. 193.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Ms. Snowe], for herself, Ms. \n     Landrieu, and Mr. Coburn, proposes an amendment numbered 193.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S1654]]\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To strike the Federal authorization of the National Veterans \n                   Business Development Corporation)\n\n       At the end of title V, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 504.

Mr. President, I will address this amendment later. I wish \nto add that the Chair and Senator Coburn are both cosponsors of this \namendment as well.\n  I thank the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am happy my friend has her amendment \nlined up so we can get to that.\n  I commend, first of all, the Senator from Louisiana for her measure \nthat is before us. It is a bill I support very strongly. Therefore, to \nsay I was disappointed to see an unrelated amendment offered is an \nunderstatement. But that is the way it is. We are going to have to vote \non this. Frankly, we have had votes similar to this before. I feel \ncomfortable and hopeful that we will defeat this amendment.\n  In about 5 minutes I am going to yield for a question to my friend \nfrom New Jersey, but before I do that I want to make about 5 minutes \nworth of remarks.\n  The amendment that is pending on this bill has been named by Senators \nMcConnell and Inhofe The Energy Tax Prevention Act. Good title. The \nbill doesn't do one thing to lower the price of oil--not one thing. We \nknow what we can do right now to lower the price of oil. We know we \nshould go after the speculators who are speculating on futures. We know \nwe have the Strategic Petroleum Reserve that the President is looking \nat. Every time we have taken some oil out of that it has had a salutary \nimpact on the price of gas immediately. We know we should increase our \ninvestment in alternative clean fuels. We know what we have to do. We \nhave to work for more stability in the Middle East. Most of all, we \nhave to get off foreign oil. We cannot be hostage to what is going on \nin the world. This bill does nothing about it. It has a good title but \nit has nothing to do with the price of oil. We know what we have to do \nto do something about that. I hope we will.\n  Let me tell you what I would name this amendment. I would not name it \nwhat it has been called, the Energy Tax Prevention Act, because it \ndoesn't do a thing about that. I would call it the Reliance On Foreign \nOil Forever Act, because part of it says we can no longer look at fuel \neconomy through the Clean Air Act and make gains on fuel economy.\n  We all now have the opportunity to buy gas-efficient cars. How do you \nthink that happened? It did not happen without some leadership here. As \na matter of fact, the Senator from Maine, Olympia Snowe, was very \ninvolved in that. My colleague Senator Feinstein was as well. We all \nworked on this--Senator Lautenberg. We said we are going to have more \nfuel-efficient cars. According to this, it is over and no State can \nstep out and pass tougher fuel economy standards. It is stopping our \nStates from acting. That is No. 1. So I call it the Reliance On Foreign \nOil Forever Act because as long as we drive cars that do not do well on \nfuel economy, we will be stopping at the gas pump. Mark my words.\n  How wonderful is it for me. I drive a hybrid car. I go about 50 miles \nper gallon. I can wave at that gas station and say I am glad I don't \nhave to stop here for a long time.\n  If you don't want to name the amendment the Reliance On Foreign Oil \nForever Act, you can name it something else:\n  The More Air Pollution for Americans Act. The More Air Pollution for \nAmericans Act. More air pollution. Now, we all ran for office and we \nall run for office. I never met one person who said: Please go back \nthere and get me more air pollution. Not one person ever said that. \nWhat they tell me is that they know someone with asthma. They have \nasthma. Their kid has asthma.\n  So here is what happens here. This bill says, forever, the EPA can \nnever, ever go after carbon pollution. Let me repeat that. This \namendment, despite the fact that the Clean Air Act specifically says \nthat carbon pollution is covered, says, no more. EPA cannot go after \nit. It is going to keep on keeping on, and there is going to be more \nair pollution for every American. That is what this amendment promises \nthat they want to pass.\n  I have to tell you, my colleagues are playing scientist and they are \nplaying doctor. They are deciding for us whether we should be exposed \nto pollution. When we hear from my colleague, Senator Lautenberg, we \nare going to hear what it is like to have a grandchild with terrible \nasthma and to worry about it 24/7.\n  So who are the real doctors and what are they saying? We got a letter \nin opposition to this terrible amendment from the American Lung \nAssociation. I guarantee you, Mr. President, even though you are an \nextremely persuasive person, if you went outside and just stopped \npeople on the street and said: Well, who is really more trustworthy \nabout your health, the American Lung Association or a Senator, I don't \ncare what you say, they would take the American Lung Association. They \noppose this.\n  The American Public Health Association, the American Thoracic \nSociety, the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, the Physicians \nfor Social Responsibility and Trust for America's Health--they write to \nus.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                   March 15, 2011.\n       Dear Senator: We the undersigned write to express our \n     strong opposition to the McConnell Amendment, known as the \n     ``Energy Tax Prevention Act of 2011.'' We believe that this \n     legislation would block the Environmental Protection Agency, \n     EPA, from setting sensible safeguards to protect public \n     health from the effects of air pollution.\n       Our organizations are keenly aware of the health impacts of \n     air pollution. The Clean Air Act guarantees all Americans, \n     especially the most vulnerable, air that is safe and\n\n[[Page S1655]]\n\n     healthy to breathe. Despite tremendous air pollution \n     reductions, more progress is needed to fulfill this promise.\n       If passed by Congress, this legislation would interfere \n     with EPA's ability to implement the Clean Air Act; a law that \n     protects the public health and reduces health care costs for \n     all by preventing thousands of adverse health outcomes, \n     including: cancer, asthma attacks, heart attacks, strokes, \n     emergency department visits, hospitalization and premature \n     deaths. A rigorous, peer-reviewed analysis, The Benefits and \n     Costs of the Clean Air Act from 1990 to 2020, conducted by \n     EPA, found that the air quality improvements under the Clean \n     Air Act will save $2 trillion by 2020 and prevent at least \n     230,000 deaths annually.\n       Additionally, the public strongly opposes Congress blocking \n     EPA's efforts to implement the Clean Air Act. A recent \n     bipartisan survey, which was conducted for the American Lung \n     Association by the Republican firm Ayres, McHenry & \n     Associates and the Democratic polling firm Greenberg Quinlan \n     Rosner Research indicates the overwhelming view of voters: 69 \n     percent think the EPA should update Clean Air Act standards \n     with stricter limits on air pollution; 64 percent feel that \n     Congress should not stop the EPA from updating carbon dioxide \n     emission standards; 69 percent believe that EPA scientists, \n     rather than Congress, should set pollution standards.\n       The McConnell Amendment would strip away sensible Clean Air \n     Act protections that safeguard Americans and their families \n     from air pollution. We strongly urge the Senate to support \n     the continued implementation of this vital law.\n           Sincerely,\n     Charles Connor,\n       President and Chief Executive Officer, American Lung \n     Association.\n     Georges C. Benjamin, MD, FACP, FACEP (E),\n       Executive Director, American Public Health Association.\n     Dean E. Schraufnagel, MD,\n       President, American Thoracic Society.\n     Bill McLin,\n       President and CEO, Asthma and Allergy Foundation of \n     America.\n     Peter Wilk, MD,\n       Executive Director, Physicians For Social Responsibility.\n     Jeffrey Levi, PhD.,\n       Executive Director, Trust for America's Health.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. ``We the undersigned write to express our strong \nopposition to the McConnell amendment known as the Energy Tax \nPrevention Act of 2011. We believe this legislation would block the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency from setting sensible safeguards to \nprotect public health and the effects of air pollution.''\n  So here is where we are. This is a terrible amendment. It is going to \nkeep us reliant on foreign oil. It is going to overturn the \nendangerment finding, a health finding made by scientists and doctors \nthat says carbon pollution is dangerous. It is even going to stop us \nfrom having a greenhouse registry where we know how much carbon \npollution we are producing. This is a radical amendment. I trust we \nwill defeat it.\n  I yield to Senator Lautenberg, without losing my right to the floor, \nfor a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I would ask the Senator from \nCalifornia how she sees the amendment we are discussing in terms of the \nlives of our countrymen as we see them. And I wish to first mention \nwhat I see and see if the Senator agrees with me.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. The amendment that has been proposed by the Senator \nfrom Kentucky, Republican Mitch McConnell, is as dangerous an effort as \nwe can imagine. It would undermine our children's health while helping \npolluters and their lobbyists. And what a strange thing this is. I hope \nthe American public sees it for what it really is. It is an attack on \nthe well-being of our children, our grandchildren, at the expense of \npromoting those companies, taking the rules off so those companies can \nrun rampant, do any darned thing they want, put up any pollution they \nfeel like doing, not having to care that effluent from their \nmanufacturing process has to be properly packaged away but just dump \nit, get rid of it. Often, those dump sites wind up as Superfund sites. \nBut it does not matter; just go ahead and do what you want.\n  I was watching television, as everybody here must be, looking at the \ncalamity that struck Japan, and I saw one bright moment. They found a \nchild who was under debris for something like 3 days, and they \nunearthed her. She was so beautiful, and it brought tears to my eyes--I \nam a tough guy, it is believed--to see this beautiful thing alive and \nwanting to be protected and continue her life.\n  I never met a grandparent who was not ready to show you pictures of \ntheir latest grandchild. So there is no deeper love that can be found.\n  Here, we hear the message that has been going around: Let's get rid \nof the EPA's ability to regulate. Who are they to tell us what \nbusinesses can do?\n  Thank goodness that in this democratic society in which we live, \nthere are rules and regulations to keep us as a civilized nation. The \nSupreme Court and scientists at the Environmental Protection Agency \nagreed that the Clean Air Act is a tool we must use to stop dangerous \npollution.\n  This amendment, it is very clear, favors one group--the business \ncommunity. I come from the business community. I know what companies \nwill do to help stretch their profits. Most companies do it reliably, \nhonestly, and so forth, but there are others who encourage this kind of \nthinking and say: Get rid of this regulation, this bureaucratic stuff.\n  You know, the Republican tea party politicians--and we see them, we \nsee their thoughts reflected here--say: Just ignore the Supreme Court. \nIgnore the scientists. We know better. They want to reward the \npolluters by crippling EPA's ability to enforce the Clean Air Act.\n  Gutting this vital law is a clear and present danger. The Clean Air \nAct protects our children from toxic chemicals in the air and illnesses \nsuch as asthma and lung cancer. Last year alone, the law prevented 1.7 \nmillion cases of childhood asthma--1.7 million children--and more than \n160,000 premature deaths, according to the EPA.\n  Those numbers are gigantic, but they loom much larger when it is your \nchild, when it is your doctor who says: I hate to tell you this, Mr. or \nMrs., but your child is sick. Your child has asthma. Your child may \nhave lung cancer. And the largest cause of these conditions is \npollution in the air.\n  Numbers are big in what we say here because it doesn't seem to be \nentering the thought process. What goes around comes around, and it may \nbe your child in danger, and heaven forbid, because there isn't a \nparent or a grandparent around who wouldn't give their own life to \nprotect the lives of their children or grandchildren.\n  Do you really want to know the real value of the Clean Air Act to \nAmerican families? Talk to the millions of parents who live in fear of \ntheir child's next asthma attack, and it is one my own family knows \nvery well. A grandson of mine suffers from the disease. He is an active \nathlete, and every time he goes to a soccer game or another game, my \ndaughter first checks to see where the nearest emergency room is \nbecause if he starts wheezing, she knows very well that she has to get \nhim to a clinic.\n  The experience in our family with asthma is a tragic one. My sister, \nwho was in her early fifties, 52 years of age, was at a school board \nmeeting when she felt an attack of asthma coming on. She started out to \nrun to her car, where she carried a little plug-in respirator. She \nnever made it. She collapsed in the parking lot, and she died within 3 \ndays.\n  So when you see the effects of these things, you say: What could we \npossibly do to prevent this from happening again to another family, to \nanother relative? The tea party Republicans say to these families: \nClean air is nice, but, listen, these companies have to make money, \nthey have to pay dividends, they have to pay big salaries to these \nexecutives. So for them, on that side, they say the most important \nthing is those profits, those companies. Too bad, kids; sorry, we can't \nhelp you.\n  The tea party Republicans say you can't restrict polluters with \nregulations. It is too cumbersome. By their logic, we ought to get rid \nof traffic signals. Those red lights really slow down traffic. It is a \ndarn nuisance. How does that sound for logic? That is what they are \nessentially saying. While we are at it, maybe we ought to get rid of \nthe air traffic control system, too, because\n\n[[Page S1656]]\n\nwhy should pilots of these big aircraft have to wait for some \ngovernment bureaucrat to tell them where and when they can land or take \noff? Just another bureaucratic agency. As ridiculous as it sounds, that \nis how ridiculous this sounds and should sound to the American people, \nthe people across this country.\n  Stop it, Republicans. Stop threatening our children. Stop taking away \na level of protection they now have. And if the tea party Republicans \nhave their way, we will get rid of these environmental regulations \nbecause they interfere with some of these companies' rights to pollute. \nDo we want to protect our children from playing outside in foul air by \nkeeping them indoors on a permanent basis or would it be better if the \nair were clean and they could go outside and play and you don't have to \nworry about it?\n  If you want to see where the Republicans will lead us, look at China. \nChina has no clean air act. The air there is so polluted that many \npeople wear masks when they walk outside. During the Olympics in \nBeijing, some U.S. athletes delayed their arrival to avoid the exposure \nto the polluted air.\n  I was on a trip to China some years ago, and I went to visit the \nMinister of Environment. He started complaining about how much of the \nenergy supply the United States uses and fouls the air. So I was \nstunned because I had looked outside the window, and I invited him to \njoin me from the 23rd floor and look down at the street. The only thing \nis, you couldn't see the street. It was so blocked with soot and mist, \npoisonous mist out there, you couldn't see the sidewalk. That is how \nheavy the pollution in the air was. We don't need that.\n  We want to make sure we take care of our obligation to our families, \nto the children, and the strongest obligation anybody has in America is \nto the kids. The bottom line is that a day on the playground should not \nend in an emergency room. But for millions of children with asthma in \nAmerica, that is exactly where the tea party Republicans want to take \nour country.\n  As a corollary, I just met with a group concerned about diabetes, \nparents, each one of them, of a child with diabetes. I have a \ngrandchild who suffers from diabetes. The forecast is that of children \nborn in 2000, the year 2000, one-third of them will ultimately have \ndiabetes. And it sends a chill through your body when you look at these \nkids and you think, well, one of the three of them is going to be a \ndiabetic before their life ends.\n  I use that example to remind everybody, those who can see and hear \nwhat we are talking about and those on the other side who want to sweep \naway all of the protections we passed with the Clean Air Act and let \nthose who would pollute go on unencumbered. So I hope my colleagues \nwill stand up and vote down this amendment.\n  I ask the Senator from California, do you generally agree with what I \nhave had to say here?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Well, I say to my friend, not only do I generally agree, \nI agree wholeheartedly.\n  Let me show you a picture of a couple of kids. We have a couple of \npictures. I would love my friend to look at this, these beautiful \nchildren.\n  They say a picture is worth 1,000 words. This is worth 1 million \nwords. This baby has to go to a mask to breathe air because the air is \nso foul. We have another picture of another child. I am sure my \ncolleague has seen it. I am a grandma. I would say we are talking maybe \n3 years old, maybe even younger, a child knowing how to gasp for air. \nHere is another beautiful child. The answer I give to my friend is--\nthanking him for his passion, because this is what he has dealt with \nwith one of his grandkids, the fear, the blood-curdling fear, as my \nfriend has said over and over, that when he is out and playing a sport, \nhe might have to rush to an emergency room and my friend's daughter \nhaving to know in advance where the nearest emergency room is--this \namendment is an attack on our children.\n  Let me prove it. We have the leading health experts who have just \nsent us a letter telling us it is an attack on our children. I put up \nany Senator against these groups for a debate. When I hear from the \nAmerican Lung Association, the American Public Health Association, the \nAmerican Thoracic Society, the Asthma and Allergy Foundation, from \nphysicians across the country, the Trust for America's Health--they \nsay: Beat this McConnell amendment; it is dangerous--I listen. So \nshould every American. I don't care if one is a Republican or a \nDemocrat.\n  The Senator from Alaska was railing against the Environmental \nProtection Agency. Let's see what the American people think of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency. There was a bipartisan poll done by a \nRepublican pollster and a Democratic pollster. Sixty-nine percent of \nAmericans think EPA should update the Clean Air Act standards with \nstricter air pollution limits. The McConnell amendment says to EPA: You \nmay not do this. You may not update air pollution standards as it \nrelates to carbon pollution.\n  We are a country that is polarized by a lot of issues. I appreciate \nthat. I often say, I just came out of an election that was tough. But \n68 percent of the people believe Congress should not stop EPA from \nenforcing Clean Air Act standards. Let me repeat: 68 percent of the \nAmerican people--this poll was done February 16, very recently--believe \nCongress should not stop EPA from enforcing Clean Air Act standards. \nGuess what the McConnell amendment does. It stops the EPA from \nenforcing Clean Air Act standards.\n  Sixty-nine percent believe EPA scientists, not Congress, should set \npollution standards. What does the McConnell amendment do? It says that \nMitch McConnell and Jim Inhofe--my buddy, my pal, and we are friends. \nBut on this one, we are on opposite sides. I stand with the American \npeople on this one. Sixty-nine percent say EPA scientists, not \nCongress, should set pollution standards.\n  Why would that be? These are people from Alabama, Florida, \nCalifornia, New Hampshire. It doesn't matter. This is a huge number. \nWhy do they think that? Common sense. We trust doctors and scientists \nto tell us what is good for us, not politicians. Period. We have \nMembers of Congress who are doctors. But I have to say, some of them \ncome out against the science and the doctors because they have given \nthat up. They are politicians now. Here is the deal. We have the \nMcConnell amendment. It is taken straight from the Upton bill in the \nHouse and the Inhofe bill in the Senate that stops EPA in its tracks \nfrom updating Clean Air Act standards, so that we have a standard for \ncarbon pollution which is dangerous. Who tells us it is dangerous? The \ndoctors. Who tells us it is dangerous? The scientists. Who made an \nendangerment finding? The Environmental Protection Agency.\n  Do my colleagues know who actually came up with the idea of an \nEnvironmental Protection Agency in the 1970s? Richard Nixon. Everyone \nknows Richard Nixon was a Republican. By the way, I have the same \nSenate seat he once held. In this, we are in agreement. The EPA was a \nbrilliant idea. Why? Because if we can't breathe, we can't work. My \ncolleagues may think they are doing something for the economy by \ntelling the EPA to go into their rooms and forget about their jobs. But \nwhen people start getting more asthma, when there are increased \npremature deaths, they will think about it again.\n  Let me show my colleagues what happened in Los Angeles since the \nClean Air Act was passed. This is an amazing graph. I hope people can \nsee this clearly. In the 1970s, when Richard Nixon and Congress voted \nthe Clean Air Act in--and it was voted in with a huge majority, it was \noverwhelming--in Los Angeles, 166 days were lost where people were told \nthey had to stay in, sensitive people. I remember those years. You used \nto go to the radio to make sure it was safe to go out, if you had a kid \nwith asthma or you had a mom who had a breathing problem. More than \nhalf the year, in those years, you couldn't go out of the house. Think \nabout what that says about the economy, when people are trapped inside \ntheir houses. Think about what it means to their freedom of movement \nand think about what it means to the economy when so many people have \nto stay home and not go to work, not go to school.\n  Over the years, as the EPA starts to do its job, we start to see \nfewer and fewer lost days where people could actually go out. I am \nproud to tell my\n\n[[Page S1657]]\n\ncolleagues, in 2010, in Los Angeles, which was once the smog capital of \nthe Nation, not one day was there an advisory, not one day. What more \nof a success rate can we have?\n  Do my colleagues want to see more success? I will show you some of \nthe benefits in another way. The Congress said to the EPA: We want to \nmake sure there are benefits that go along with your enforcement of the \nClean Air Act, so that when you go to a company that is belching smoke \nand you say they have to install some cleanup devices, it is working. \nWhat did we find out? In 2010, the Clean Air Act prevented 160,000 \ncases of premature death. We understand why the heart doctors and the \nlung doctors and the physicians and the public health doctors are \ntelling us: Don't vote for McConnell. It will turn the clock back. We \nsaved 160,000 lives in 2010 alone. Projected out, it is going to go way \nhigher in the number of premature deaths averted, if we move forward \nwith the Clean Air Act and we don't substitute politicians for doctors \nand scientists. Clearly, we are on the right track. In the future, we \nprevent even more deaths--230,000, to be exact, by 2020.\n  I don't care if one is a Republican or a Democrat, liberal, \nconservative, Independent, whatever, this has nothing to do with \npolitics. This has to do with families. This has to do with health. \nThat is why we see 69 percent of the people saying: Congress, butt out \nof this. Let the EPA do its work. That is why a defeat of the McConnell \namendment means we are standing with the doctors, with the scientists \nand, more than anything else, we are standing with the kids. We are \nstanding with these beautiful kids, these kids who at age 3 are having \nto learn how to breathe oxygen because they can't go outside because \nthe air is dirty.\n  Whose side are we on? Are we on the side of this baby and his family \nor are we on the side of the biggest polluters in the country who are \nmaking billions of dollars? They are doing fine, and all they have to \ndo is do a little bit more to clean up the air. We had lots of \narguments over the years. Every time we had Clean Air Act amendments, \npeople argued: Don't do it. The air is clean enough. Stop. Enough. \nBusiness can't do it.\n  Guess what we found out. Not only did business step up to the plate \nand do it, but what was created was an incredible export business, \nexports of clean air products, technologies, machinery, the best \navailable technology made in America. We are talking about taking the \nlead on clean air and keeping it, not retreating.\n  We remember when the Berlin Wall came down. Everyone said: Hooray. \nBut then they could see the air settling on the other side. Germany did \nthe right thing, and they said: We are going to clean up the air in \nEastern Europe. Because without clean air, you can't have growth.\n  I am happy to see my friend from Washington State. I will yield to \nher for a question. I want her to know how much I rely on her \nleadership. Maria Cantwell has been a leader from the beginning on \nclean air, clean water, safe drinking water, cleaning up Superfund \nsites. She never flinches.\n  Before I yield for a question, I started off my debate by telling the \nSenate what my friends on the other side call their amendment. They \ncall it the Energy Tax Prevention Act. I have already told my \ncolleagues why it should be called the more air pollution for every \nAmerican act or, if they don't like that, we could call it the relying \non foreign oil forever act. That is what it truly is. It stops us from \ncleaning up our air, which the people definitely do not support, 69 \npercent of the people in a bipartisan poll.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record this Truth-O-\nMeter Politifact. That is an independent Web site that judges the truth \nof these claims.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Fred Upton Says Pending Bill To Block EPA Curbs of Greenhouse Gases \n                    Will ``Stop Rising Gas Prices''\n\n       To hear Reps. Fred Upton and Ed Whitfield talk about their \n     new energy bill, you'd think it will prevent gas prices from \n     increasing before your next fill-up.\n       Upton, the Michigan Republican who chairs the influential \n     Energy and Commerce Committee, and Ed Whitfield, the Kentucky \n     Republican who heads the Energy and Power subcommittee, \n     recently argued in a letter to fellow lawmakers that one way \n     to stop rising gas prices would be to pass the Energy Tax \n     Prevention Act of 2011 (H.R. 910).\n       The bill grows out of longstanding frustration by industry \n     groups and lawmakers who believe that Environmental \n     Protection Agency regulations unnecessarily burden many \n     companies.\n       The measure--which Whitfield's subcommittee approved on \n     March 10, 2011, and which now heads to the full committee--\n     would prevent the EPA from regulating greenhouse gases for \n     the purpose of addressing climate change.\n       Here's a portion of what Upton and Whitfield wrote to their \n     colleagues in the March 8, 2011, letter, which is headlined, \n     ``Concerned About High Gas Prices? Cosponsor H.R. 910 and \n     Make a Difference Today!!''\n       ``Whether through greenhouse gas regulation, permit delays, \n     or permanent moratoriums, the White House takes every \n     opportunity to decrease access to safe and secure sources of \n     oil and natural gas,'' the lawmakers wrote. ``Gasoline prices \n     have climbed dramatically over the past three months. \n     American consumers deal with this hardship every day, and as \n     this poll indicates, the majority of respondents do not see \n     the pain subsiding anytime soon. Americans also understand \n     the realities of supply and demand as it relates to oil \n     prices. Unfortunately the White House does not. . . .\n       ``H.R. 910, the Energy Tax Prevention Act of 2011, is the \n     first in this legislative series to stop rising gas prices by \n     halting EPA's Clean Air Act greenhouse gas regulations. As \n     one small refiner testifying before the Committee on Energy \n     and Commerce put it: `EPA's proposed [greenhouse gas] \n     regulations for both refinery expansions and existing \n     facilities will likely have a devastating effect on . . . all \n     of our nation's fuels producers. . . . If small refiners are \n     forced out of business, competition will suffer and American \n     motorists, truckers and farmers will be increasingly reliant \n     on foreign refiners to supply our nation's gasoline and \n     diesel fuel.'\n       ``We . . . have taken the first steps in attempting to \n     restrain this regulatory overreach that will restrict oil \n     supplies and cause gasoline prices to rise.''\n       But can the bill really stop gas prices from going up, as \n     the letter says?\n       We'll look at two key questions. Could the proposed EPA \n     regulations on oil refineries actually increase prices at the \n     pump? And when would the impact of the regulations be felt?\n       As to the first question, experts had different opinions.\n       The oil industry argues that regulations imposing new costs \n     on refiners could force U.S. refineries to charge more. (The \n     proposed regulations are supposed to shield smaller \n     operations from regulatory impacts, but experts said that a \n     significant proportion of U.S. refineries would indeed be \n     affected.)\n       ``It's Economics 101,'' said John Felmy, chief economist at \n     the American Petroleum Institute. ``The refinery business is \n     a very low-margin business. They have no margin for error and \n     face tough competition internationally.''\n       Others argue the refining industry could adapt to new \n     regulations.\n       ``Looking at past public claims when the Clean Air Act was \n     passed would show that U.S. refining capacity still managed \n     to increase over time, despite the high expense refiners had \n     to put out to comply with the Clean Air act,'' said Amy Myers \n     Jaffe, a fellow in energy studies at Rice University.\n       ``So one might imagine, depending on the details on how \n     carbon regulation would be implemented, U.S. industry could \n     likely similarly adjust,'' Jaffe said. ``It depends on the \n     specifics of how a policy is implemented. There are no doubt \n     some small refineries in the United States that might be \n     really inefficient, so maybe some of them would close if they \n     had to increase their costs substantially, but tiny, \n     uncompetitive, regional refineries are not the main thing \n     that makes the US refining and marketing industry \n     `competitive.' ''\n       Indeed, while a shift to overseas refiners could have \n     negative consequences for the nation--it could weaken the \n     United States' industrial base, threaten U.S. jobs and pose \n     problems for national security--it's not a foregone \n     conclusion that prices at the pump would rise. If U.S. \n     refiners become less competitive and more oil is instead \n     imported from overseas refiners, it will be because the cost \n     of refining overseas becomes more competitive. That's the \n     essence of a free market.\n       And even if the cost of refining did go up, the cost of \n     gasoline is volatile and affected by many factors such as \n     global demand and supply disruptions. So there's no certainty \n     that a bump in refining costs would necessarily translate \n     into higher prices at the pump.\n       As for the second question--when any impact might be felt--\n     the rules wouldn't take affect for months or years.\n       The EPA won't even propose the first-ever greenhouse-gas \n     standards for refineries until December 2011 and doesn't plan \n     to issue final standards until November 2012. Those standards \n     would govern emissions for new and significantly overhauled \n     refineries. Rules for existing refineries are expected to be \n     unveiled in July 2011.\n       Based on the past history of EPA regulations, the new rules \n     aren't likely to take effect until a few years after that, \n     experts said.\n       So, if the bill were to pass, it would prevent EPA \n     regulations that would otherwise take effect in 2013, 2014 or \n     2015. That's a long way away.\n\n[[Page S1658]]\n\n       Another factor: the regulations targeted by the House bill \n     are new ones. So if the House bill passes, it would \n     essentially protect the status quo--not take any explicit \n     action to stop price hikes.\n       So where does this leave us?\n       While Upton and Whitfield's letter is carefully worded, it \n     frames the argument for the bill in the context of today's \n     trend of rising gasoline prices. Yet the impact of the bill--\n     if there is an one--would be years away. And there's no proof \n     that the law would actually stop gas prices from rising. The \n     added regulations now being planned may hamper U.S. refiners, \n     but the international free market could just as easily end up \n     keeping refining costs low. And it's hardly assured that any \n     changes in refining costs--up or down--will influence \n     gasoline prices, which are subject to a wide array of \n     influenes. We find their claim False.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. They looked at this amendment. They said the claim is \nfalse, that gasoline prices would go down. So beware of things that are \ncalled good names. But when we get behind them, we see they are not \ngood. They are dangerous. This is a red flag coming from me to \neverybody watching the debate. This bill would tell the EPA they can no \nlonger do their job--EPA, one of the most popular agencies in the \nNation. Sixty-nine percent of the people say: Do your job.\n  It would, in essence, stop us from making more fuel-efficient cars \nbecause it would say States cannot do more, and that would mean \nreliance on foreign oil.\n  I am happy to yield to my friend from Washington for a question.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Thank you, Madam President.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, can I just inquire?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. How long does the Senator think the Senator from \nWashington will proceed and how long will the Senator herself proceed?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have the floor, and I plan to proceed as long as \ncolleagues want to come and ask questions. I could go until about 5.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. OK. Because Senator Snowe has an amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. She was already allowed to offer it.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. She would like to speak on it.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will continue yielding without losing my right to the \nfloor because there will be a question.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Do you think Senator Snowe can go after Senator \nCantwell?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I do not at this point. We are taking our time. I wish to \nsay through the Chair to my friend, this amendment is so radical, it is \nso far beyond any other amendment we have ever had on this subject, so \nI am not going to yield the floor until I have given people a chance on \nmy side to ask questions about it. I intend to hold the floor at this \npoint. I cannot give you a time when I will stop. I am also very \nwilling to have a vote on this at a time we can mutually agree to. But \nat this point, I will not be able to yield the floor.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Let me see what we can do.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield to my friend for a question or a series of \nquestions--as many as she might have.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I thank my colleague from California, who is the chair \nof the committee, for working so hard on this important amendment to \ntry to articulate and help colleagues understand what is the basis of \nit.\n  I too was surprised to learn that the McConnell-Inhofe amendment \nwould overturn what has been the hard-won future gains in fuel economy \nwe passed overwhelmingly on a bipartisan basis just a few years ago. I \ndon't get it, EPA's clean car standards through 2016 will save so much \ngasoline that car buyers will actually save as much as $3,000 over the \nlife of the car. That is because of the hard work we have done in the \nSenate on a bipartisan basis.\n  I know our colleagues from both sides of the aisle worked to get that \nlast agreement that we did in 2008, and while we are doing this, we \nwill save 1.8 billion barrels of oil. So I was surprised to hear that \nthis legislation--the McConnell-Inhofe amendment--would overturn all \nthat progress we have made in the last couple decades on having cleaner \nair and more opportunities for fuel efficiency.\n  When I look at this, I look at our domestic automakers in Detroit who \nare making much more progress based on this new generation of \ntechnology. Our domestic automakers are getting back to profitability \nbased on a new generation of vehicles offering much better fuel \neconomy. So they are actually--because we have said you have to have \nmore fuel-efficient cars--they are actually now winning in the \nmarketplace with consumers because of those offerings. I know the \nDepartment of Energy, for the first time, has said we have reduced our \ndependence on foreign oil because of these fuel economy improvements.\n  So I say to my colleague from California, it was not because of \n``drill, baby, drill'' that we got fuel efficiency and got off foreign \noil. It was because we had fuel efficiency in automobiles that we were \nable to reduce our dependence.\n  So I ask my friend from California why we would want to go backward \non that if we have made progress and better cars out of Detroit, if \nthey have become cheaper for consumers over the life of the car. If we \nhave made advancements in reducing our dependence on fossil fuel, why \nwould we want Americans to pay more at the pump and have cars that do \nnot go as far per gallon of gas as they do today? So I do not \nunderstand what kind of scheme this is, to keep the oil companies in \nbusiness? Why would we want to go back on that level of fuel efficiency \nand override that by this amendment?\n  Am I correct in understanding that?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will answer and then yield for further questioning. The \nSenator is making the case so clearly. The one area we know we can make \nprogress on in terms of getting off foreign oil is cars that get better \nfuel economy. My friend worked so diligently on the Commerce Committee, \nalong with Senator Snowe, Senator Feinstein, and others. We all worked. \nBut my friend took a tremendous lead on it.\n  In this particular amendment, which is named something that has \nnothing to do with reducing or preventing gas taxes or something--it \nhas nothing to do with that. If this passes--and I hope it will not \npass--but if it were to be signed into law, it essentially takes the \nEPA completely out of the picture, in terms of fuel economy, which \nmeans that all the progress we have made in getting more fuel economy, \ncleaning up the air, will be gone.\n  This little child, shown in this picture, gasping for air, as it is, \nis going to be gasping for more air. Children are particularly \nvulnerable.\n  So the Senator is right on so many fronts. If we were to pass this, \nwe would turn around from all our progress we just made. We would stop \nthe States from being able to do more on their own. We would lose the \ncompetition in the world for the most fuel-efficient vehicles, which is \nso critical--everybody looks to us--and consumers, as my friend points \nout, would miss out on, frankly, thousands of dollars a year in \nsavings.\n  I hope I have answered my friend's question.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I am amazed because my predecessor, a Republican from \nWashington, was fighting for fuel efficiency standards in the 1990s. So \nI do not know why we would be here in 2011 with a radical proposal to \nbasically erase the ability for fuel efficiency standards.\n  But I have a question about public health too because I think my \ncolleague from California has articulated something that is greater \nthan any economic issue; that is, health and clean air and healthier \nchildren because of that. I do not understand why we would want to go \nback on the Clean Air Act as it relates to adverse health outcomes.\n  Why would you want to have more problems with asthma attacks, heart \nattacks, strokes, visits to the emergency room, hospitalization, \npremature deaths, all these things? EPA just came out with a \ncomprehensive cost-benefit study on the Clean Air Act, and their \nfindings were stark. They said the Clean Air Act will save our society \n$2 trillion through 2020. That is amazing.\n  So when I look at that, and we are going to say to polluters do not \nhave to pay or adhere to the law, we are going to cause ourselves more \ncosts in the future with health care. Yes, some polluters need to pay \nmore, but as members of Congress we need to think of what's good for \nAmerica, not just special interests. And the Clean Air Act\n\n[[Page S1659]]\n\ncreates $30 for every $1 investing in reducing pollution.\n  I ask my colleague from California, what is it that Senators \nMcConnell and Inhofe think they know about this that is different than \nwhat the American Lung Association, the American Public Health \nAssociation, the American Thoracic Society, the Asthma and Allergy \nFoundation of America, Physicians for Social Responsibility, and Trust \nfor America's Health--what is it they know that those organizations do \nnot know? Because those organizations are saying we have a serious \nhealth problem, and let's make sure it is addressed through the Clean \nAir Act. Are they just ignoring this issue?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Obviously, I cannot speak for my colleagues. I cannot. \nBut I have to look at what would happen if this were to become law. \nEPA, the Environmental Protection Agency, signed into law by Richard \nNixon, a Republican, overwhelmingly--and, by the way, the Clean Air Act \namendments were signed into law by George Herbert Walker Bush--they \nwould say to the EPA: You are out. You no longer have the ability to do \nyour job, which is laid out in the Clean Air Act. This particular \namendment changes the Clean Air Act and says--I say to my friend--to \nthe EPA: You no longer can look at carbon pollution. You cannot look at \nany pollution at all that relates to the climate change issue. In doing \nso, they are in a frontal assault against the American Lung \nAssociation, the American Public Health Association, the American \nThoracic Society, the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, \nPhysicians for Social Responsibility, and Trust for America's Health.\n  But I say to my friend, even more than that, they are going against \nthe American people. I wished to share this poll with the Senator.\n  In February, 1 month ago--truly 1 month ago--there was a bipartisan \npoll. A Republican pollster and a Democratic pollster teamed up, and \nthey asked the people what they thought about these very issues. Sixty-\nnine percent of the American people--this is not people in Washington \nState or California; this is all over the country--think EPA should \nupdate the Clean Air Act standards with stricter air pollution limits.\n  The McConnell amendment stops them, stops them from updating the \nClean Air Act standards. As a matter of fact, it repeals the ability of \nthe EPA to ever address carbon pollution, which, by the way, is a clear \nendangerment to the people. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record EPA's Endangerment Finding.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       EPA's Endangerment Finding\n\n                             Health Effects\n\n       The key effects that support EPA's determination that \n     current and future concentrations of greenhouse gases \n     endanger public health include:\n\n\n                              Temperature\n\n       There is evidence that the number of extremely hot days is \n     already increasing. Severe heat waves are projected to \n     intensify, which can increase heat-related mortality and \n     sickness. Fewer deaths from exposure to extreme cold is a \n     possible benefit of moderate temperature increases. Recent \n     evidence suggests, however, that the net impact on mortality \n     is more likely to be a danger because heat is already the \n     leading cause of weather-related deaths in the United States.\n\n\n                              Air Quality\n\n       Climate change is expected to worsen regional ground-level \n     ozone pollution. Exposure to ground-level ozone has been \n     linked to respiratory health problems ranging from decreased \n     lung function and aggravated asthma to increased emergency \n     department visits, hospital admissions, and even premature \n     death. The impact on particulate matter remains less certain.\n\n\n              Climate-Sensitive Diseases and Aeroallergens\n\n       Potential ranges of certain diseases affected by \n     temperature and precipitation changes, including tick-borne \n     diseases and food and water-borne pathogens, are expected to \n     increase.\n       Climate change could impact the production, distribution, \n     dispersion and allergenicity of aeroallergens and the growth \n     and distribution of weeds, grasses, and trees that produce \n     them. These changes in aeroallergens and subsequent human \n     exposures could affect the prevalence and severity of allergy \n     symptoms.\n\n\n            Vulnerable Populations and Environmental Justice\n\n       Certain parts of the population may be especially \n     vulnerable to climate impacts, including the poor, the \n     elderly, those already in poor health, the disabled, those \n     living alone, and/or indigenous populations dependent on one \n     or a few resources.\n       Environmental justice issues are clearly raised through \n     examples such as warmer temperatures in urban areas having a \n     more direct impact on those without air-conditioning.\n\n\n                             Extreme Events\n\n       Storm impacts are likely to be more severe, especially \n     along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts. Heavy rainfall events are \n     expected to increase, increasing the risk of flooding, \n     greater runoff and erosion, and thus the potential for \n     adverse water quality effects. These projected trends can \n     increase the number of people at risk from suffering disease \n     and injury due to floods, storms, droughts and fires.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my good friend and colleague from Washington \nState, in EPA's summary of the endangerment our people would face, they \ntalk about the worsening of ground-level ozone pollution if the EPA is \nnot allowed to enforce the law, which is what McConnell offers us \ntoday.\n  They say:\n\n       Exposure to ground-level ozone has been linked to \n     respiratory health problems ranging from decreased lung \n     function--\n\n  We know kids, even today, with all the progress we have made--kids \nwho are born in areas that are close to freeways, I say to my friend, \nclose to railroads, close to ports--have a reduced lung function. At \nbirth, they have a lesser lung function. What are we doing? How dare \npeople come and hurt the American people. That is what this is. This is \nabout hurting the American people, hurting America's families, stopping \nthe Environmental Protection Agency from cleaning up the air, cleaning \nup pollution.\n  Here is this poll: 69 percent say EPA scientists--not Congress--\nshould set pollution standards. Yet this amendment says: EPA, get out \nof the picture. We do not want you. We want to do this, the \npoliticians. Well, the people do not want this. That is why I hope we \nwill reject this terrible amendment that endangers the people.\n  I continue to yield for a further question.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I thank my colleague because my next question deals \nwith technology. One thing I appreciate about working with the Senator \nfrom California is that we certainly share an interest in innovation \nand the innovation economy and making sure we do not do things to \ndamage it, since so much job creation has happened from the technology \nsectors and from our improvements.\n  So I was surprised to think about this amendment from the perspective \nof that it would kill a wide range of jobs in America, including many \nthat can't be outsourced. If we basically say we are going to allow \npeople to continue to pollute and not adhere to the Clean Air Act, all \nthose technologies that are about to get us off those pollutants and \ndiversifying our energy sources would no longer be incented. The \nSenator and I probably would say we need to do a lot more to incent \nthose and stop incenting those that cause so much harmful pollution.\n  But the United States is the largest producer and consumer of \nenvironmental technology, goods, and services. The environmental \ntechnology industry has approximately 119,000 firms and generates $300 \nbillion in revenues and $43.8 billion in exports.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Could the Senator repeat that, please?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. That is just the environmental technology industry. So \nthat is 119,000 firms, $300 billion in revenue, and $43 billion in \nexports. So it is a very vibrant part of our economy that is based on \nthat we want to do something about toxic pollutants. If all of a sudden \nyou pass a bill in the Senate saying we do not want to do anything \nabout these toxic pollutants, even though the Clean Air Act says we \nshould, and the Supreme Court said, yes, EPA you should, then all of a \nsudden we are basically saying: OK. How far are we willing to go in \nsaying we do not need to deal with toxins and pollutants?\n  To me, the foreign markets in developing countries that are already \ngetting an edge on some of the clean energy technologies would worry me \nthat they would continue to make advancements even more with these \ntechnologies.\n\n[[Page S1660]]\n\n  I do not understand why people would think this radical measure would \nsomehow help us, when the foreign technology market would continue to \ngrow, and we would lose market share.\n  But foreign markets, particularly those of developing countries offer \nthe most opportunity for U.S. companies.\n  The U.S. share of foreign environmental technology markets has \ncontinued to grow from 5.7 percent in 1997 to 9.8 percent in 2007, \ngiving the U.S. environmental technology industry a positive trade \nsurplus for the past decade.\n  I ask my friend from California, doesn't it make more sense to think \nabout the future jobs we are trying to attract--because they are so \nmuch bigger--than thinking about this in the sense of 20th century \njobs? That is almost what we are advocating: Let's go back to saying, \nif you are a pollutant, it is OK because somehow you are creating jobs.\n  I ask my colleague, isn't the market opportunity more in these \ntechnology jobs and environmental technology jobs?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Well, my friend is so right. If this is an economic \nargument, bring it on to us. We know the numbers. The Senator has laid \nthem out. We know tens of thousands of firms are moving forward because \nwe have these laws on the books. The clean air technologies and the \nclean water technologies and the safe drinking water technologies are \nwanted by the whole world.\n  I have to say to my friends who are pushing this--I wish to tell them \nsomething they do not seem to either understand or maybe they do not \nwant to hear, but I am going to say it--the whole world is going green, \nno matter where you look. Walmart is going green. I have had my \ndifferences with them on their policies on workers.\n  Walmart is going green. And why? Because, as my friend said, it saves \nmoney. The whole world is going green. What does it mean? It means \neveryone wants to save money. Everyone is looking for better energy \nopportunities that are clean. And everybody wants clean energy. If we \nback away from that, we are saying to China: Go for it. You will get \nthe whole market, and we will still be pumping for oil.\n  By the way, I have a message on that front: Oil companies have 57 \nmillion acres of land and offshore tracts they already have a permit to \ndrill in. My friends on the other side, in another debate, keep saying: \nLet's drill, drill. Why don't they drill where they already have the \nleases and it is already approved? So that is not at debate here.\n  What is at debate here is why would we, as my friend asked me, turn \naway from policies that result in clean technologies that the entire \nworld wants--clean technologies that support more than 100,000 \nbusinesses and tens of thousands of more jobs? Why would we do that? My \nanswer is, to me, it would be a self-inflicted wound on our country, \nwhen this is an opportunity.\n  I think my friend from Washington knows John Doerr who is a venture \ncapitalist. He has told us for years now that if we invest in clean \nenergy, if we incentivize clean energy, the venture capitalists will \ncome off the sidelines with more billions than they ever gave to high \ntech and biotech combined. So why would anyone support this amendment \nwhich would turn the clock back on fuel economy, as my friend said, on \nclean energy technology, and turn the clock back on our little kids who \nare struggling as it is with asthma?\n  I yield for another question.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I thank my colleague from California.\n  I am also interested in the Senator's opinion about this as it \nrelates to gas prices because people are--I think House Republicans, \nanyway, and maybe even the minority leader, feel that if we pass this \namendment, somehow gas prices are going to come down. Well clearly they \ndon't believe this radical measure will actually pass because then they \nwould have to worry about misleading their constituents.\n  We all know this: It seems about every summer we have these debates \nabout the impact of gas prices. But this measure is so radical. When I \nthink about even if EPA continued to act on their fulfillment of the \nSupreme Court decision that they must act in regulating pollutants--and \nrules on oil refineries won't even go into effect until December of \n2011 and the final rules aren't even due until July 2011. So we are \ntalking about rules that don't go into effect until 2013, 2014, 2015.\n  I ask my colleague from California, how would that have an impact? We \ndon't even know what they are going to be. We have to wait until July, \nhopefully, to hear from EPA about that. So, somehow, that is going to \naffect gas prices today?\n  I think what we know to be true is that getting off of oil and having \nmore fuel-efficient cars has reduced our dependence, saved consumers \nmoney, and allowed them to have a choice in the marketplace. We ought \nto continue in that direction, not this direction. But does the Senator \nthink those rules going into effect are somehow having an effect today? \nAren't we talking about people who have already written about this as \nfalse rhetoric in the debate, that it is not accurate and that this \nwill impact the price at the pump tomorrow?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Well, of course my friend from Washington is right on \ntarget when she points out that--first of all, the EPA is being very \ncautious in the way it moves on this. They are only going after the \nbiggest, dirtiest polluters. I think most of the people I talk to out \nthere say--my mother always said, Clean up your room. If you are \nbelching all of this smoke into the air, you have to take some \nresponsibility for it, especially when you are making billions and \nbillions and billions of dollars of profit.\n  No one has come to me and said big oil is suffering because they were \nunder the Clean Air Act all of these years. But it is true. There is no \npressing matter before us. They are using the problems in Libya and the \ntragedy in Japan.\n  The Upton bill, as in this McConnell amendment, says--Upton: A bill \nthat would halt the EPA from regulating greenhouse gases would help \nstop rising gas prices. That is what he says, that this amendment \nbefore us will help stop rising gas prices. The nonpartisan PolitiFact, \nwhich is an independent Web site, looked at this. When they came to the \nend of looking at Mr. Upton's claim that this would reduce gas prices--\nand this is the same bill as the Upton bill--they say, We find this \nclaim false.\n  I feel comfortable in this debate because I am on the side of the \ntruth. I am on the side of the American people who are telling us: \nStop, Congress. Don't tell EPA to stop enforcing the law. That is \nwrong. So I feel good about that. We are on the side of these children \nwhom we are protecting. We are on the side of consumers. We are on the \nside of progress. We are on the side of business. We are on the side of \nexports. We want America to be the leader.\n  My friend from Washington is an innovator. My friend knows what it is \nto go to the capital markets and say, I have a great idea, and she \nknows what government can do to encourage this type of investment. \nGovernment can't do everything, but we can set the stage. One of the \nways we set the stage for a great multibillion-dollar economy to take \noff is by having a Clean Air Act that saves our children from these \nterrible air-gasping days, but also creates technology that cleans up \nour air.\n  My friend is so right. The false claim that this amendment is going \nto lower gas prices has been debunked right now. That claim has been \ndebunked by people who have no axe to grind.\n  I appreciate my friend coming here and engaging this. Does she have \nany further questions?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I do, if the Senator from California would indulge me \non this. Because I see our colleagues on the floor, and as a member of \nthe Small Business Committee I am as frustrated as they are that this \nimportant legislation that would help small businesses in America grow \nis being now held hostage by this amendment.\n  I look at this issue, the broader issue of discussion, as some of our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle have said, as a major policy \nissue. Well, if it is a major policy issue and it is a major policy \nchange, why should we try to hang it in an amendment onto the small \nbusiness bill? Is that making some industry happy? Is that why they are \ndoing it? Because if this is, as they are saying, a major policy issue, \nthen let's have a major policy discussion. I know my colleague and I \nsupport legislation that would instigate a major policy discussion \nhere. Some of that legislation has gotten bipartisan support. I think \nsome of our colleagues on\n\n[[Page S1661]]\n\nthe other side of the aisle have been saying we should address climate. \nWell, if that is the case, let's have that broad debate. Is that the \nunderstanding of my colleague, that some Republicans wish to address it \nand are saying now that we need to address it and not leave it all to \nEPA? If that is the case, then let's have that debate, but let's not \nhave a rifle shot amendment that basically guts the law as it is being \nimplemented. Let's have a discussion about what would be a more \nflexible approach to implementation of the requirements to regulate \npollutants.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The Senator from Washington poses an important question, \nand that is: Why are we seeing this kind of amendment on a small \nbusiness bill? It is ridiculous. It makes the American people lose \nfaith in us, frankly. This is a bill about small business innovation. \nThis isn't a bill that is about telling EPA they can no longer do their \njob in protecting the American people. This is ridiculous.\n  We already know from reports how many lives have been saved. We have \nit here, and I want my friend to see this. In 2010, the Clean Air Act \nprevented 160,000 cases of premature deaths. That is a fact. By 2020, \nthat number is projected to grow to 230,000. So excuse me. If this \namendment were to pass and stop EPA from cleaning up the air, people \nwill die.\n  If this is what you want to do, don't hang it on a small business \nbill. Why don't you have a press conference and say, You know what, we \ndon't think this is worth it: 160,000 deaths; win a few, lose a few, \nyou know. They don't care at all. But we care, and that is why we are \ntalking about this.\n  I yield again to my friend.\n  This is what they would turn away from: preventing 160,000 premature \ndeaths--that is documented--in 2010 alone.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I have one last question for my colleague. I think \nthese attempts that try to carve out pollutants and give them \nexemptions are never good policy, because there is so much at stake for \nthe American people who believe our job is to protect them with clean \nair and clean water and to make sure that polluters are regulated. But \nit reminds me of that 2003 energy bill that was kind of done behind \nclosed doors when the whole MTBE debate--you know, the additive to \nfuel--came up. I remember one newspaper ended up dubbing the bill the \n``hooters and polluters and corporate looters'' bill or something like \nthat, because it ended up trying to carve out for the manufacturers of \nthat product that they would be exempted. It was a bipartisan effort on \nthe Senate floor. My colleagues from the Northeast, from New Hampshire, \nI believe, and there may have been the Senators from Maine, all said, \nWait a minute. We are not going to exempt MTBE from this legislation as \na way to get an energy policy for the future.\n  I ask my colleague from California if she remembers that and other \nattempts to try to do this without the public fully understanding what \nis at stake for clean air and clean water, and if she remembers that \nfailure because of doing this. It left the public vulnerable. Are there \nother instances of that debate she could recall for us? Because I think \nit is very similar.\n  Mrs. BOXER. There have clearly been a lot of moves on the part of \nspecial interests in this country--the biggest polluters--to try to get \ntheir way, and they try every which way to try to get their way. If \nthey were to present the case to the Senator from Washington or to me \nthat what they want is good for the American people, that is great. \nMake the case. Who could ever make the case that stopping the EPA from \nenforcing the Clean Air Act is good for the people? They can't. So what \ndo they do? My friend is right to recall these other attempts. They \ncouch it as: Oh, it is going to lower the price of gas, or it is good \nfor business, or it is good for jobs. The truth is, it is devastating \nfor all of those things.\n  My friend from Washington has been a leader on consumer protection. \nOh, my goodness, we remember the fights when we had the Enrons of the \nworld destroying people by raising the price of electricity behind \nclosed doors, and the conspiracy to do that. Remember those battles we \nwere in? These battles keep coming back at us. Does my colleague know--\nmy friend is asking me questions, but I would ask her one rhetorically. \nThis amendment is so radical, it goes after fuel economy standards, and \nit says, No more. EPA, you are out of that. You can't deal with it ever \nagain, even though we know fuel economy, when we get it done right, \ntakes those toxins out of the air, plus we get better fuel mileage, and \nthat will get us off of foreign oil. It takes that away. Chalk one up \nin the Middle East for oil barons. That is good for them. It is not \ngood for America, but yes, chalk that up for them.\n  We already know what happens to kids. Let's show this picture because \nit shows the look on this child's face. This is what happens to our \nkids when the air is dirty.\n  The fact is, if we take EPA out of the business of cleaning up carbon \npollution and all the co-contaminants that go into the air with it, \nsuch as mercury and others I could list, people are going to be sick. \nBut here is beyond the pale what they do: In addition to those things, \nthey even stop in this amendment the Carbon Registry, so that, America, \nyou might as well cover your eyes, cover your ears, and cover your \nmouth, because you will not speak evil, you will not hear evil, you \nwill not see evil. You will not see, you will not hear, and you cannot \nspeak about the carbon pollution in the air.\n  That is what is going on here. So my friend is right to connect this \nto a whole line of faulty reasoning that the American people have been \nasked to swallow.\n  But I have news for you. They are smart. Madam President, 69 percent \nthink EPA should update the Clean Air Act standards with stricter air \npollution limits; 68 percent believe Congress should not stop EPA from \nenforcing the Clean Air Act; and 69 percent believe EPA scientists, not \nCongress, should set pollution standards.\n  So this vote we will have tonight--I hope we will have it tonight--is \nabout whether Congress should play doctor and scientist and decide what \nis best for the people or allow that to be done by the physicians, by \nthe scientists, and by an agency that is extremely popular in this \ncountry.\n  It is not popular right here, right now, I will tell you that, \nbecause the polluters don't want anything to do with it. But we don't \nrepresent polluters, we represent everyone--everyone. And a vast \nmajority want us to say no to this McConnell amendment.\n  So I yield to my friend, if she has a final comment or question.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I thank the chair of the EPW Committee, a great \nlegislator, for protecting the interests of consumers on this issue. I \nserve with the Senator on the Commerce Committee, and I see her fight \nfor consumers every day. Her passengers' bill of rights for the \nairlines on the FAA bill is another perfect example of how she is \nthinking about how all legislation impacts individuals and their \nrights, and this is about the right to clean air and clean water and to \nmake sure we are not going to cut EPA out of the regulation of \npollutants business. I don't know why we would do that. That is their \nday job. They are supposed to regulate pollutants. The Supreme Court \nsays they are supposed to regulate pollutants.\n  So I thank my colleague for waging this battle against this amendment \nthat, as she has outlined, has these radical notions in it. But I guess \nI go back and say: We can try to keep hanging on to the past and saying \nthe past is going to take us somewhere, but that usually doesn't work.\n  My colleague from California understands probably more than any other \nbecause of the efficiency gains her State, California, has made in \ncreating jobs and in getting more out of our current energy supply. The \ninitiative that was just run in California, I think that was about \ngoing back to the past, too, wasn't it? That was the initiative where \npeople said: Do we want to go backward or forward? The people spoke in \nCalifornia, and they said let's move forward.\n  So I would conclude by thanking my colleague and asking her just one \nlast time, from an economic perspective, if America can afford this \namendment. How can we afford this amendment if it is going to cost us \nthat much in health care costs; if it is going to cause the loss of the \nadvancements we have seen in the automobile industry? I would think \nDetroit alone, if we pass this amendment, would stop and say: Wait a \nminute. Do we even have to comply with the mile-per-gallon already on \nthe\n\n[[Page S1662]]\n\nbooks because it seems as if Congress is saying they are out of the \nbusiness.\n  So I would just say to my colleague from California, how can we \nafford this amendment? They would like to try to claim that as the only \nhigh ground of their debate, that somehow they are protecting jobs. But \nthey are not protecting jobs. They are basically trying to take 18th-, \n19th-, and 20th-century jobs and somehow saying they do not have to \ncomply with the Clean Air Act. So I, again, ask my colleague whether we \ncan afford that kind of amendment and just thank her for her leadership \nand tremendous support.\n  We all come here for different reasons, and we are all motivated by \ndifferent reasons, but I know the Senator from California is motivated \nby doing what is right for the consumer and consumer interests. So I \nthank her for standing up for that voice that may not be heard today on \nthis important issue.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Before my friend leaves, I thank her so much, and I am \ngoing to leave the floor so my Republican friends have time to speak on \nthis issue. America will hear a lot of different stories from a lot of \ndifferent people. But, remember, this is pretty simple. This amendment \nstops the Environmental Protection Agency from doing its job.\n  I thank my friend and tell her that we can't afford this amendment. \nThis amendment will hurt America. It will hurt it in every way. It will \nhurt the health of Americans, it will hurt jobs in this country, it \nwill hurt consumers, and I am proud to stand with her.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maine.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 193\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I would like to speak to the amendment \nthat I called up earlier, amendment No. 193. This is a bipartisan \namendment that is being cosponsored by the chair of the committee, \nSenator Landrieu, as well as Senator Coburn, who, as we all know, has \nbeen recognized as a true leader in this body for streamlining the \nFederal Government.\n  We had a discussion recently about what programs or agencies or \nentities could be eliminated, and we readily identified the National \nVeterans Business Development Corporation--simply known as the TVC--as \nan example of an organization that the Federal government should sever \nits ties with, for the reasons that I will enumerate, Madam President.\n  The Veterans Corporation has been ineffective and controversial since \nits inception as part of the Veterans Entrepreneurship and Small \nBusiness Development Act back in 1999. In fact, in December of 2008, \nthe former Small Business Committee chairman, Senator Kerry, and I \ninvestigated the Veterans Corporation and issued a report detailing the \norganization's blatant mismanagement and the wasting of taxpayer \ndollars.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord pages one through four of the report and refer interested \npersons to the following Web site, for the full text of the report: \nhttp://sbc.senate.gov/Committee%20Report%20on% 20TVC.pdf\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n UNITED STATES SENATE COMMITTEE ON SMALL BUSINESS AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP\n\n                   REPORT ON THE VETERANS CORPORATION\n\n                       I. Committee Investigation\n\n       On March 3, 2008, the Senate Committee on Small Business \n     and Entrepreneurship (Committee) launched a bipartisan \n     investigation of the National Veterans Business Development \n     Corporation--better known as The Veterans Corporation (TVC)--\n     at the request of Senator John Kerry, Chairman of the \n     Committee, and Senator Olympia Snowe, the Committee's Ranking \n     Member. TVC, a federally-chartered, nonprofit corporation, \n     has received $17 million in taxpayer funds since 2001, but \n     has struggled to fulfill its statutory mission of providing \n     veterans with access to entrepreneurial technical assistance \n     and partnering with public and private resources to help \n     veteran entrepreneurs start or grow small businesses.\n       Since TVC was authorized in 1999, the Committee has raised \n     questions about the management and spending decisions made by \n     the organization and its leaders. Two reports issued in 2003 \n     and 2004 by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) \n     criticized TVC for a lack of internal controls, an inability \n     to measure the effectiveness of its programs, and TVC's \n     failure to become self-sufficient.\\1\\ Over the years, staff \n     members from several Congressional committees have rivet \n     repeatedly with TVC to impress upon TVC's leaders the \n     importance of becoming self-sufficient and reminding them of \n     TVC's duty to ``. . . establish and maintain a network of \n     information and assistance centers for use by veterans. . .'' \n     as mandated by the organization's enabling legislation, \n     Public Law 106-50--the Veterans Entrepreneurship and Small \n     Business Development Act of 1999 (PL 106-50).\n       In response to concerns raised by the Committee and several \n     veteran service organizations, TVC has repeatedly assured \n     members of Congress that TVC was taking the necessary steps \n     to correct its past failures. However, after various meetings \n     with TVC officials and after reviewing its FY 2007 annual \n     report, the Committee questioned TVC's direction and whether \n     any significant changes had been made over the past few \n     years. Consequently, the Committee launched the investigation \n     to determine whether TVC has adequately addressed the \n     concerns raised by the GAO in its previous reports, and by \n     Congress and veterans groups in recent years.\n       During the course of the investigation, the Committee's \n     staff reviewed various categories of documents furnished by \n     TVC, as well as others that the Committee subpoenaed from \n     TVC's financial institutions. Additionally, Committee staff \n     conducted numerous interviews with TVC insiders, including \n     each current member of TVC's board of directors (Board); \n     TVC's acting president, John Madigan; its former director of \n     finance; and its highest-paid independent contractor. TVC's \n     former president, Walter Blackwell, declined Committee \n     staff's repeated requests for an interview.\n\n                         II. Executive Summary\n\n       There are 23,400,000 veterans in America today.\\2\\ TVC was \n     founded to provide these veterans with the resources and \n     guidance needed to start and grow successful small \n     businesses. The Committee staff's investigation revealed an \n     entity that has been not only ineffective in meeting its \n     responsibilities to our nation's veterans, but also \n     troublingly irresponsible in its use of taxpayer dollars.\n\n\n                     A. Summary of Report Findings\n\n       Based upon its investigation, the Committee staff makes the \n     following findings:\n       1. Failure to Achieve Statutory Mission. TVC has not \n     accomplished its statutory mission as a result of the \n     organization's:\n       a. Failure to Support Veteran Business Resource Centers. \n     Since its founding, TVC has spent only 15 percent of the \n     federal funding it has received on the veterans business \n     resource centers (Centers), which TVC was required to \n     establish and maintain under PL 106-50. In FY 2008, the \n     percentage dropped to about 9 percent. As a result, the \n     Centers have been faced with the possibility of closure.\n       b. Wasteful Programs. TVC spent its limited resources on \n     several programs that bore little or no relation to the \n     organization's statutory mission, including at least $13,000 \n     on a teen essay contest and a movie promotional tour. Most \n     Board members either had no recollection of the promotional \n     tour or did not fully understand the extent to which TVC was \n     involved with it.\n       c. Lack of Outcomes-Based Measurements. TVC has largely \n     reported the results of its programs by measuring their \n     activity, rather than their outcomes. This has prevented TVC \n     from accurately determining whether its programs are \n     accomplishing their intended purposes.\n       2. Mismanagement of Federal Funds by TVC's Leadership. \n     TVC's leaders misspent hundreds of thousands of dollars in \n     taxpayer funds on:\n       a. Unacceptably High Executive Compensation. TVC's \n     executives received unacceptably high levels of compensation \n     given the organization's limited resources and reach. While \n     an average of 15 percent of TVC's federally appropriated \n     funds went to the Centers, 22 percent of TVC's FY 2007 \n     federal appropriation dollars were spent on its top two \n     executives' compensation packages alone. TVC's Board \n     continued to reward these executives with raises and bonuses, \n     despite reductions in TVC's federal appropriation and a lack \n     of citable program results under their leadership. See \n     Appendix A.\n       b. Dubious Expenditures. TVC spent tens of thousands of \n     dollars on expensive dinners for employees and Board members \n     at high-priced D.C. restaurants, luxury hotel rooms, first \n     class travel arrangements, and memberships to various airline \n     club lounge programs. TVC's top two executives failed to \n     report over $91,000 in charges on their company-issued credit \n     cards. In addition, TVC's executives failed to follow proper \n     expense reimbursement procedures and, in some cases, either \n     approved their own expense reports or had them approved by a \n     subordinate employee who was under their direct supervision. \n     And even when their expenses were reported, the executives \n     appeared to have demonstrated a general disregard for the \n     value of taxpayer dollars, incurring, for example, over \n     $40,000 in meal expenses in less than three years. See \n     Appendix B.\n       c. Failed Fundraising Efforts. During fiscal years 2005 \n     through 2007, TVC leaders spent $2.50 for every $1.00 they \n     raised through the organization's fundraising efforts--almost \n     entirely at the taxpayers' expense. During FY 2007, TVC spent \n     over $240,000 in fundraising expenses while raising only \n     $64,000. In the absence of a successful private fundraising \n     program, TVC spent much of its limited resources lobbying \n     members of Congress for annual appropriations.\n\n[[Page S1663]]\n\n                      B. Causes of TVC's Failures\n\n       Based upon its investigation, the Committee staff \n     identified the following causes for TVC's failures:\n       1. Ineffective Board Governance. Through broad decision-\n     making powers granted to TVC's executive committee under the \n     organization's bylaws, the committee has approved a number \n     of measures without proper approval or ratification from \n     the full Board. For instance, last year $40,000 in \n     employee bonuses were not properly approved by the full \n     Board. In addition, several of TVC's Board members have \n     lacked the level of engagement necessary to effectively \n     discharge their duties to the organization. For example, \n     the chairman of TVC's audit committee could not correctly \n     identify the committee's other two members.\n       2. Fragmented Oversight. TVC's status as a private entity--\n     outside the reach of typical federal agency oversight--led to \n     fragmented and inadequate oversight mechanisms. The lack of \n     sufficient oversight prevented lawmakers from properly \n     monitoring TVC's operations and diminished opportunities for \n     necessary changes to TVC's culture. Even where federal law \n     required an oversight mechanism through the Single Audit Act, \n     TVC either ignored, or was incorrectly advised of, its duty \n     to comply with the statute. In doing so, TVC removed a \n     crucial external check on the organization's internal \n     controls, as well as an additional means to measure its \n     efficiency and effectiveness in expending taxpayer dollars.\n\n\n                  C. Summary of Report Recommendations\n\n       Based upon its findings, the Committee makes the following, \n     recommendations:\n       1. No Further Federal Funding. Through its misguided \n     programs, excessive executive compensation, and questionable \n     spending decisions, TVC has squandered hundreds of \n     thousands--if not millions--of the $17 million in taxpayer \n     dollars it has received since 2001. Given TVC's poor track \n     record, its lack of effective programs, and its Board \n     members' own admission that taxpayers have not received an \n     adequate return on their investment, TVC should receive no \n     federal funds for the remainder of FY 2009 and for the \n     foreseeable future.\n       2. Transfer of Responsibility. if, in the absence of \n     federal funding, TVC cannot adequately support the Centers, \n     responsibility for funding and overseeing the Centers should \n     be transferred to the Small Business Administration's Office \n     of Veterans Business Development, which should receive \n     additional federal funds to carry out this new \n     responsibility.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, the report was initiated by the Small \nBusiness Committee, and it found, among other things, that the Veterans \nCorporation failed to support Veterans Business Resource Centers; it \nhad wasteful programs; it lacked outcome-based measurements; it \nprovided its employees with unacceptably high executive compensation; \nit engaged in dubious expenditures; and it failed to properly raise the \nnecessary funds to become self-sufficient, as they were required to do \nunder the law.\n  For example, our report concluded that the Veterans Corporation had \nspent only 15 percent of the Federal funding that it had received on \nVeterans Business Resource Centers, which the TVC was required to \nestablish and maintain under law. In fact, in fiscal year 2008, the \npercentage dropped to about 9 percent.\n  We also found that the executives at TVC received unacceptably high \nlevels of compensation given the organization's limited resources and \nreach. While an average of 15 percent of the Veterans Corporation's \nfederally appropriated funds went to the centers, 22 percent of the \nfunds that were appropriated in 2007 were spent on its top two \nexecutives' compensation packages alone. Moreover, the organization \nmiserably failed to raise the sufficient funds, as required by law, in \norder to develop self-sufficiency and independence from Federal \nappropriations.\n  During fiscal years 2005 through 2007, the Veterans Corporation \nleaders spent $2.50 for every $1 they raised through the organization's \nfundraising efforts--almost entirely at the taxpayers' expense. \nAdditionally, through broad-based decision making powers granted to the \nVeteran Corporation's executive committee under the organization's \nbylaws, the committee approved a number of measures without proper \napproval or ratification from the full board, including $40,000 in \nemployee bonuses in 1 year alone.\n  Since the issuing of the Small Business Committee's report, Congress \nhas appropriated no additional funding for TVC, and the Small Business \nAdministration has incorporated the Veterans Business Resource Centers \npreviously funded into the existing network of the Veterans Business \nOutreach Centers. These moves were publicly supported by a variety of \nveterans service organizations, including the American Legion and the \nVeterans of Foreign Wars.\n  For example, in August of 2008, the American Legion passed a \nresolution at its national convention stating that the legion ``no \nlonger supports the continuing initiatives or existence of the national \nVeterans Business Development Corporation.''\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have a copy of that \nresolution printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Resolution No. 223\n\n       Whereas, small business ownership and entrepreneurship are \n     the backbone of the American economy and foundation for \n     democracy; and\n       Whereas, veterans, through their service, have cultivated \n     experiences, skills, and self-discipline that make them well \n     suited for self-employment; and\n       Whereas, Congress enacted the Veterans Entrepreneurship and \n     Small Business Development Act of 1999 (P.L. 106-50) to \n     assist veteran and service-disabled veteran owned businesses \n     by creating the National Veterans Business Development \n     Corporation; and\n       Whereas, the National Veterans Business Development \n     Corporation is no longer fully engaged in providing \n     entrepreneurial education, services and advocacy to promote \n     and foster successful veteran entrepreneurship within the \n     veteran business community: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by The American Legion in National Convention \n     assembled in Phoenix, Arizona, August 26, 27, 28, 2008, That \n     The American Legion no longer support the continuing \n     initiatives or existence of the National Veterans Business \n     Development Corporation.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. At present, TVC still exists, and it is still federally \nchartered. But as I indicated earlier, it receives no Federal funds, \nand has no department or agency oversight.\n  So in light of everything I have discussed, and based on the report, \nit is my belief that the Federal Government must take the next step and \nfully sever all ties with the organization. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this bipartisan initiative.\n  It is important to underscore the fact that the report the committee \nundertook back in 2008 illustrated serious mismanagement problems with \nthis organization.\n  As indicated in the summary of the report findings, it failed to \nachieve its statutory commission, which was to support the Veterans \nBusiness Resource Centers; it spent its limited resources on several \nprograms that bore little or no relation to the organization's \nstatutory mission; and it largely reported the results of its programs \nby measuring its activity rather than its outcomes. So it was very \ndifficult to actually determine what TVC's results were and whether \nthey were consistent with the intended purposes under Federal statute. \nTVC mismanaged Federal funds by providing for high executive \ncompensation, and had dubious expenditures.\n  The report indicates that TVC spent tens of thousands of dollars on \nexpensive dinners for employees and board members at high-priced \nrestaurants in Washington, luxury hotels, first-class travel \narrangements, memberships to various airline club lounges, and TVC's \ntop two executives failed to report over $91,000 in charges on their \ncompany-issued credit cards.\n  It is certainly an abysmal track record, regrettably, and that is why \nI think it is important that even though we do not provide any \nadditional appropriations--no appropriations--we should sever any \nlinkage of Federal ties with this entity.\n  So, Madam President, I would hope we could get bipartisan support, \nand I will ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  At this time there is not a sufficient second.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up my amendment, No. 186.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I will object. I know the Senator is very interested in \noffering this amendment, and we are very interested in hearing about \nit, but we have now six amendments pending. So if the Senator would \nlike to go ahead and speak about the amendment, explain the amendment, \nand when we can get an agreement about how we should proceed with these \namendments, we will move forward.\n\n[[Page S1664]]\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I am sorry the Senator from Louisiana \nobjects to my calling up the amendment and getting it pending. I was \ntold--and, indeed, I think everyone is operating under the impression \nthis is going to be an open amendment process--we would have debate on \nimportant issues. This happens to be relating to the establishment of a \nsunset commission, such as that which was recommended by the fiscal \ncommission appointed by the President of the United States and which \nenjoyed broad bipartisan support.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Will the Senator yield for a clarification?\n  This most certainly is an open process. What I was trying to explain \nto the Senator is there have been about a half dozen other Senators who \nhave come to the floor during the day--such as Senator Hutchison, who \ncame down earlier--and we are trying to be accommodating in the order \nthe Senators come. So if the Senator doesn't mind explaining his \namendment, I commit to him that Senator Snowe and I will try to get a \npending list as soon as we can.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Well, Madam President, I have been waiting all day, as \nall my colleagues, and I am on the Senate floor to offer an amendment. \nI am sorry the Senator thinks it is necessary to object. I am not sure \nwhat harm it causes to get another amendment pending, and I am happy to \nvote on any of these amendments as the majority leader determines to \nset the votes, or the bill managers. But I will speak just briefly on \namendment No. 186, which I will call up at the appropriate time.\n  All of us can agree the Nation faces the greatest fiscal challenge in \nits history, with growing deficits and record debt. Currently, the \ndeficit is roughly 9.8 percent of our gross domestic product, and the \ndebt is north of $14 trillion--so high that, in fact, we will be asked \nsometime in the spring to consider voting on lifting the debt limit, in \neffect raising the debt limit on the Nation's credit card because it is \nmaxed out.\n  According to the two Cochairs of the President's own fiscal \ncommission, the Nation could be facing a debt crisis, a loss of \nconfidence that we would actually be able to pay back our debts, and \nthat crisis could come as soon as in the next 2 years.\n  That is why the amendment I am offering today, which I hope will \nenjoy broad bipartisan support, establishes, indeed, a bipartisan U.S. \nAuthorization and Sunset Commission that will help improve oversight \nand eliminate wasteful government spending. The amendment is modeled \nafter the sunset process that was instituted in Texas in 1977, which \nhas over the years eliminated 50 different State agencies and saved \ntaxpayers more than $700 million. That may not seem like big money in \nWashington terms, but that is a substantial savings in Texas.\n  This is what the President's own fiscal commission had to say about \nsuch a concept:\n\n       Such a committee has been recommended many times and has \n     found bipartisan support. The original and arguably the most \n     effective committee exists at the State level in Texas. The \n     legislature created a sunset commission in 1977 to eliminate \n     waste and inefficiency in government agencies. Estimates from \n     reviews conducted between 1982 and 2009 showed a 27-year \n     savings of over $780 million, compared with expenditures of \n     $28.6. Based on savings achieved, for every dollar spent on \n     the sunset commission the State has received $27 in return.\n\n  This commission under my amendment would be made up of eight Members \nof Congress who would focus on unauthorized programs that continue to \nreceive taxpayers' money. As the chair knows, one of the biggest \nproblems we have when it comes to unsupervised spending is the fact \nthat the authorizing committees do not necessarily authorize a program, \nbut yet the appropriators for one reason or another have appropriated \nmoney, and those are never given the kind of oversight that is really \nnecessary. This means Congress has dropped the ball--spending without \nauthorization--when it comes to doing the hard work of figuring out if \nthese programs are working, but the spending nevertheless continues.\n  As Ronald Reagan famously said, the closest thing to eternal life \nhere on Earth is a temporary government program--there is no such thing \nhere in Washington, DC.\n  The Congressional Budget Office regularly finds that billions of \ndollars are being spent in unauthorized programs.\n  In addition, the commission would focus on duplicative and redundant \ngovernment programs annually identified by the Government \nAccountability Office. The GAO, as we all recall, recently found that \nbillions of taxpayer dollars are being spent on duplicative and \nredundant government programs. For example, the Federal Government has \nmore than 100 different programs dealing with surface transportation \nissues--100; 82 monitoring teacher quality; 80 for economic \ndevelopment; 47 for job training; and 17 different grant programs for \ndisaster preparedness. I think common sense would tell us that kind of \nduplication and overlap is not efficient and it is not an effective use \nof taxpayer dollars.\n  Under my amendment, the sunset commission would review each program \nand submit the recommendations, which must be considered by Congress \nunder expedited procedures like we use under the Budget Act. In other \nwords, it could not be filibustered; it would have to be voted on. \nCongress would not be able to ignore the commission's reports.\n  The amendment provides expedited procedures that would force Congress \nto consider and debate the commission's work. Congress would have 2 \nyears to consider and pass the commission's recommendations or to \nreauthorize the program before it would be abolished by operation of \nthe law. In other words, the program is abolished if Congress fails to \nreauthorize it 2 years after the commission completes its review and \nanalysis of the program.\n  This commission would help force Congress to do the necessary \noversight to make sure every taxpayer dollar is wisely spent. While we \nall do our best to ensure that proper oversight is given to each \nprogram, we simply do not have the tools currently available to monitor \nand review every program. This sunset commission would provide Congress \nwith those tools. It would improve government accountability and \nprovide for greater openness in government decisionmaking.\n  We know programs that have simply outlived their usefulness or failed \nto spend taxpayer dollars efficiently are a burden on the American \ntaxpayer and should be eliminated. We simply do not have the means to \nget there from here. Congress has a spending process in place, and we \nshould put together a sunset process for streamlining and eliminating \ngovernment waste. That is what this amendment would do.\n  The commission would supplement the work of the congressional \ncommittees that are already in place that I know mean well and intend \nto do the oversight but simply never seem to get around to it. It will \nnot replace the work of those committees; however, it will supplement--\nand I would say improve and strengthen--their oversight work. It will \nserve as another set of eyeballs, keeping a close eye on the wallets \nbelonging to taxpayers.\n  This commission will help Congress answer a simple but powerful \nquestion: Is this program still needed? Is this program still needed? A \nsunset commission would help us make many programs more effective by \ngiving them the attention they deserve and exposing their faults to the \nlight of day. It will improve government accountability and provide for \ngreater openness and government decisionmaking. Programs that outlive \ntheir usefulness or fail to spend tax dollars efficiently are a burden \non the American taxpayer and must be eliminated or reformed.\n  As we continue to face the mounting deficit and a struggling economy, \nshouldn't we be doing everything in our power to spend smarter and \nspend less? Imagine the tax dollars that could be saved by reviewing \nand revamping outdated and inefficient programs.\n  It is my hope that our colleagues will join me in supporting a \ngovernmentwide sunset commission, and I urge all my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment so we can start setting our spending priorities \nstraight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I know Members are following this debate \ncarefully, and their amendments. Let me bring everybody up to date. It \nis about 5 after 5. We hope to have a vote around 6 o'clock, \npotentially two\n\n[[Page S1665]]\n\nvotes. We have about five amendments pending. Senator Cornyn would like \nhis amendment pending, Senator Hutchison is here to speak about I think \ntwo amendments she may want to have pending, and Senator Barrasso is on \nthe floor to speak on the underlying McConnell amendment.\n  I will ask unanimous consent in a few minutes to try to get one or \ntwo votes set up for 6 o'clock, potentially get these other amendments \npending, and set a time for votes tomorrow so we can move through it. \nWe want to have as open a debate as possible, but we also really want \nto focus on the bill at hand, which is the Small Business \nReauthorization Act and related measures. Many of these are somewhat \nrelated to jobs and the economy, so we are trying to be liberal in our \nviews here. But we do want to try to be as orderly and as appropriate, \nas Members have come down to the floor, in the order they have come.\n  Why don't we turn now to Senator Hutchison, and Senator Cornyn--we \nwill get back to the Senator as soon as we can about getting his \namendment pending, if we can do that before the night ends.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I am going to object to any unanimous \nconsent requests until we have some understanding about when I will be \nallowed and others will be allowed to offer their amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 183\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I wish to speak in favor of the \nMcConnell amendment, which is the pending amendment, which the Senator \nfrom Louisiana is trying to get tagged for a vote. But I also wish to \nhave the opportunity to support two of the amendments that I have \noffered--at least filed--and would like to have them pending as soon as \nthe process allows.\n  Let me just say that I do support the McConnell amendment. Let me be \npretty clear and pretty simple. In the last session of Congress, \nSenator Lieberman and Senator Kerry offered a climate change regulation \nthat would have caused our fuel prices to go up exponentially. Senator \nBond and I did a study on the Kerry-Lieberman multitrillion-dollar tax \nbill that would have happened if Congress had passed their legislation. \nWe estimated that it would have been about $3.6 trillion in total fuel-\nadded expense to the small businesses and the families in this country. \nWe have documented that in this report.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the executive \nsummary of this report.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Executive Summary\n\n       The American Power Act proposed by Senators Kerry of \n     Massachusetts and Lieberman of Connecticut is the latest \n     attempt to cap American carbon emissions through new federal \n     legislation. However, Kerry-Lieberman is unique from previous \n     efforts by also proposing a new gas tax on the transportation \n     sector. American families and workers will pay this new \n     climate-related tax on the gasoline, diesel and jet fuel they \n     use to drive and ride in their cars, trucks, tractors and \n     planes. This report documents the cost of this proposed \n     Kerry-Lieberman gas tax.\n       Past attempts at federal climate legislation have struggled \n     with how to cut carbon emissions from the transportation \n     sector. A cap-and-trade approach used on industrial \n     facilities is not ideal for transportation emissions, \n     essentially becoming a complicated indirect tax on fuels. \n     Kerry-Lieberman takes the direct approach of assessing a fee \n     on transportation fuels linked to their carbon content.\n       Kerry-Lieberman's climate-related gas tax will drive up the \n     prices of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. The Kerry-Lieberman \n     gas tax hits families at every income level, farmers in every \n     field, truckers on every road and workers in every position. \n     Determining the size and cost of the Kerry-Lieberman gas tax \n     is essential to knowing how heavily this proposal will hurt \n     Americans.\n       The information and methodology needed to calculate the \n     Kerry-Lieberman gas tax is all publicly available. The U.S. \n     Energy Information Administration annually predicts future \n     U.S. fuel consumption. The U.S. Environmental Protection \n     Agency (EPA) has already adopted methods for calculating the \n     amount of CO2 emitted from each gallon of transportation \n     fuel. Finally, Kerry-Lieberman includes both a floor and \n     ceiling for carbon prices that will form the cost range for \n     the program. Additionally, EPA has just released its \n     estimates of future carbon prices that would form the basis \n     of the gas tax under Kerry-Lieberman. Utilizing this \n     information reveals a truly massive gas tax that Kerry-\n     Lieberman would impose on the American people.\n       Kerry-Lieberman will impose a new gas tax of at least $2.3 \n     trillion and up to $7.6 trillion. Under EPA estimates, the \n     Kerry-Lieberman gas tax would total $3.4 trillion:\n       $1.29 trillion to $4.18 trillion gasoline tax on American \n     drivers, workers and businesses ($1.87 trillion under EPA \n     estimates)\n       $744 billion to $2.46 trillion diesel fuel tax on American \n     truckers, farmers, workers and businesses ($1.08 trillion \n     under EPA estimates)\n       $294 billion to $963 billion jet fuel tax on American air \n     passengers ($425 billion under EPA estimates)\n       These figures include provisions in the legislation \n     intended to reduce the impact of this massive new gas tax. \n     While present, the allowances provided to refiners mitigates \n     only 2% of the gas tax, leaving consumers with a new $2.3 \n     trillion to $7.6 trillion gas tax bill.\n       Another component of Kerry-Lieberman is its refund program. \n     Building on legislation from Senators Cantwell and Collins, \n     Kerry-Lieberman refunds a portion of its tax and fee revenues \n     back to consumers. Kerry-Lieberman, like the House-passed \n     Waxman-Markey cap-and-trade bill, also attempts to shield \n     energy consumers from its massive cost increases with price \n     relief subsidies. Over the life of the bill, these refund and \n     relief programs amount to approximately 69 percent of the \n     revenues it collects. However, Kerry-Lieberman proposes the \n     government keep the remaining 31 percent of its new tax and \n     fee revenues and spend it on new government programs and \n     deficit reduction. Applying this 69/31 refund/spending ratio \n     to the new gas tax means that U.S. consumers would still face \n     a net tax burden of between $734 billion and $2.4 trillion \n     under Kerry-Lieberman (31 percent of $2.3 trillion and $7.6 \n     trillion).\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the reason we did not pass this \nlegislation is everyone realized it would have raised the cost of \ngasoline. Now the EPA is trying to do the same thing by fiat. By \nexecutive fiat, they are trying to regulate greenhouse gases. What they \nare going to do is raise the cost of fuel at a time when people are \nsuffering at the pump. I mentioned earlier that I filled up my pickup \ntruck last weekend. It was almost $50. I know every American is having \nthe same experience. If they have an SUV, it is even more.\n  We cannot allow the EPA, through greenhouse gas regulations, to \nincrease the cost of fuel when they put that regulation on a refinery. \nWe have very few refineries. We have not built a new refinery in this \ncountry since 1973 because it is so regulated, so that we really have a \nshortage of refineries. It is one of the problems with the supply issue \nin providing gasoline at reasonable prices.\n  We need to be stepping back, not stepping forward with more \nregulations. The EPA is doing something Congress would not do. Oddly, \nthe EPA is not authorized to make regulations that Congress does not \npass. They are to implement the law, not make it. But that is what they \nare doing, and we are trying to stop it with the McConnell amendment \nthat would repeal the EPA greenhouse gas regulations. I hope my \ncolleagues will support it.\n  In addition, as a former small businessperson myself, I know it is \nvery hard for small businesses to make ends meet. I have heard from so \nmany of the people in Texas who are now trying to make ends meet and \nkeep people employed in small businesses. This health care reform bill \nis causing them to not hire people because they do not know what the \ncosts are going to be.\n  Basically, you are going to be taxed if you are an individual or a \nsmall business that does not adopt the government-prescribed health \ncare insurance for your employees or your family. That is the bottom \nline. If you do not do exactly what the government says and meet their \ngovernment-required standards, even if the employees are happy with \ntheir health care coverage or certainly do not want to be left to the \ngovernment health care, you will still get the fine.\n  Most small businesses I talked to were saying: I am going to pay the \nfine. It is easier. I don't have liability. I don't have to hire people \nto work with my employees to get the best prices. That takes a lot of \nmy time and it is not helpful to the bottom line of my company, and \ntherefore I am just going to pay the fine and let the government do it.\n  Health care is not going to improve for the small businesses and for \nthe families in this country.\n  My amendment, No. 197, that has been filed, which I hope to have \npending, is called the SOS Act--Save Our States--meaning that while the \nFlorida case that has said the health care\n\n[[Page S1666]]\n\nreform law is unconstitutional is still unsettled, States and small \nbusinesses should not be spending the money to implement a law that may \nbe thrown out anyway by the courts. Let's not cause the financially \nstrapped States and small businesses in this country to have to spend \nthe money to implement the health care reform bill until we know it \nreally is the law of the land. Right now, that is a question because \ntwo courts have thrown it out as unconstitutional, one in Virginia and \none in Florida.\n  So my amendment, No. 197, will say that we will delay implementation. \nWe will not require any costs to be incurred by a business, an \nindividual, or a State until it is clear it has gone to the Supreme \nCourt and the health care reform act really is the law of the land.\n  How much could that save? Millions for our States and millions for \nthe businesses across our country. I hope we can get this amendment \npending.\n  The second amendment is No. 198. It is called the Lease Act. It is \nsimple. Today, we have a virtual moratorium. My colleague from \nLouisiana has designated what we have as a permitorium, because there \nis almost no activity--new activity--in the Gulf of Mexico in deepwater \ndrilling activity.\n  We know that gasoline at the pump is going up because there is a \nshortage of supply. If we would get these leases out there, all of the \nexploration that is being done, and allow the people who have paid the \nbonuses for the leases to fully use their leases, then we would give \nthem 1 more year to be able to determine if it is worth it to drill a \nwell in the Gulf of Mexico and start pumping oil and increase our \nsupplies through our own natural resources that God has given to our \ncountry.\n  Our amendment No. 198, which is the Hutchison-Landrieu bill, would \nextend for 1 year, which is the time these people have paid for a lease \nbut not been able to use it, because there is a moratorium on the \ndeepwater drilling, and the Department of Interior has now only given a \nmaximum of up to three, possibly only two permits for the people who \nhad been able to explore before the BP spill.\n  I hope to get both of those amendments up. I can think of nothing \nthat would help small business more than to know they will not have to \nimplement the health care reform act, they can go ahead and hire \npeople, free them to build up their employment base, which is what we \nall want to do, build our economy and, secondly, to hopefully get a \nbetter price on fuel for them so they will not have to suffer with \nthese high gasoline prices.\n  Most small businesses, in a poll, said their top three expenditures \ninclude the cost of fuel, electricity, and natural gas. So we need to \ngive our small businesses help. I hope we can get our amendment Nos. \n197 and 198 pending at the appropriate time.\n  At this point, I hope my colleagues will support Senator McConnell's \namendment to stop the EPA from adding costs to the refineries and the \ngasoline producers of our country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator from Texas. I appreciate the \npatience of my colleagues who are on the floor. Because we have had two \nor three colleagues from this side of the aisle speak, I thought it \nwould be appropriate to go to the Senator from Oregon, then recognizing \nSenator Barrasso to speak on his amendment and Senator Paul to then \nspeak on his amendment.\n  If no one objects--I do not see anyone on the floor--if we can go in \nthat order, I think everyone can be accommodated before the vote at 6 \no'clock.\n  Is that okay with everyone?\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 183\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I rise to address the McConnell-Inhofe amendment to \nrepeal EPA's authority to regulate greenhouse gases. My colleague from \nTexas was addressing this amendment and noting her support for it. But \nI wish to bring to my colleagues' attention several reasons this \namendment is bad policy for America.\n  First and foremost, this amendment increases our addiction to foreign \noil. It increases oil consumption by 455 million barrels. Right now we \nimport about 9.7 million barrels of oil per day. This amendment is \nequivalent to 6 weeks worth of oil imports. Recognize that gas prices \nare about $3.50 per gallon, so the McConnell-Inhofe amendment amounts \nto a $68 billion pricetag for working families to buy gas from oil \nimported from overseas.\n  This is not a tax that in any way supports our economy. In fact, this \nis a tax that goes out of our economy to purchase energy from \noverseas--from the Middle East, from Nigeria, from Venezuela. That is \nvery profitable to the companies that supply that oil. It is very \nprofitable to the governments far outside of the United States of \nAmerica. But it certainly hurts the citizens of our Nation. It takes \nour energy dollars and puts them elsewhere, rather than keeping them \ninside our economy. It decreases our national security rather than \nincreasing our national security.\n  Furthermore, gasoline prices are set by the law of supply and demand. \nThis amendment increases our demand for foreign oil. So if anything, \nthis amendment increases gas prices.\n  My colleague from Texas said we cannot afford to ``raise the cost of \nfuel.'' I absolutely agree, and that is why we should defeat this \namendment. Indeed, I think almost everyone understands that when you \nincrease demand for a product, you drive the price up, not down. But \nthere are some third parties that have weighed in on this conversation.\n  PolitiFact.com did an analysis of the claim that this amendment would \nkeep prices from increasing, and it did not find this claim to be true. \nIt found it to be false. So at this moment, when world events are \nunfolding in Cairo in Egypt, in Libya, and we recognize that our \ndependence on foreign oil is a huge strategic vulnerability for the \nUnited States of America, that the flow of our energy dollars overseas \nis a huge mistake for our economy, why--why--would we vote for an \namendment designed to increase our dependence, our dependence on oil, \nour dependence on foreign governments, decrease our security, and \ndamage our economy? It is simply a wrong amendment in all that \nframework about our dependence on foreign oil.\n  Second, this amendment is an attack on public health. It is an \nunprecedented attack, asking Congress to step in and veto the \nscientific judgment of the EPA scientists. It tells the agency charged \nwith protecting our public health and the health of our children to \nignore dangerous global warming, gas pollution, carbon pollution, and a \nlong list of other global warming gases.\n  The Clean Air Act in 1990 alone prevented 205,000 premature deaths, \n674,000 cases of chronic bronchitis, 22,000 cases of heart disease, \n850,000 asthma attacks, and 18 million cases of child respiratory \nillness.\n  In 2010, the Clean Air Act prevented 1.7 million asthma attacks, \n130,000 heart attacks, 86,000 emergency room visits. It has been \nstudied time and time again. What we know is the application of the \neffort to clean up our air results in all of us having a better quality \nof life.\n  This amendment, this attack on public health, is the wrong policy for \nour Nation. Again, it is something that third parties have weighed in \non, those who seek to protect our health and our health care system. \nThe American Lung Association calls this amendment ``a reckless and \nirresponsible attempt to put special interests ahead of public \nhealth.'' The American Public Health Association has weighed in \nsimilarly.\n  Finally, this amendment is an attack on science. The Clean Air Act, \npassed by a large bipartisan majority and signed by President George H. \nW. Bush, tasked the EPA with updating our clean air standards and \nsetting commonsense limits on pollution based on recent science.\n  This amendment would have Congress step in and overrule the EPA on \nscience, not just by gutting basic protections for clean air and clean \nwater but by repealing EPA's program for having polluters simply report \ntheir pollution.\n  In other words, this amendment says to the American public, we are \nnot even going to let you know about the dangerous pollutants being put \nin the air. Certainly that philosophy, not only of attacking our public \nhealth, but of attacking our right to know, is absolutely wrong.\n  Colleagues, let me wrap up. This amendment increases our dependence\n\n[[Page S1667]]\n\non foreign oil, it increases air pollution that endangers our health, \nit overrules the Nation's top scientific experts who are warning us to \nreduce pollution, not increase it, it asks American families to pay $68 \nbillion to the oil industry and foreign governments, instead of keeping \nthat money here at home. It is a mistake. Let's vote it down.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment \nand call up my amendment No. 199.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I object to making it pending but not for discussion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. PAUL. This amendment, No. 199, would save taxpayers $200 billion. \nRecently you have seen some discussion, but I think the American \ntaxpayers are actually baffled that there is not more discussion up \nhere.\n  We have proposals of a deficit from the other side of $1.65 trillion \nand yet we are not down here discussing this. We have not passed a \nbudget. We have not passed any appropriations bills this year. The \nAmerican people wonder what we are doing. You wonder why the American \npeople say Congress has about a 13-percent approval rate? Why are we \nnot today talking about a budget? Why are we not talking about \nappropriations bills? Why do they not come out of committee?\n  Then when we get to the proposals, look at the proposals. In the red \nwe have the deficit, $1.5 trillion, maybe $1.6 trillion. Here we have \nthe proposals. The other side, you cannot even see without a magnifying \nglass, $6 billion. We borrow $4 billion in 1 day. We spend $10 billion \nin 1 day. And the best they can do is $6 billion for a whole year.\n  Our proposal is a little bit better but still does not touch the \nproblem, $61 billion in cuts. It sounds like a lot of money. You know \nwhat, we increased spending by $700 billion, and now we are going to \nnibble away at $61 billion. But put it in perspective. Saving $61 \nbillion on $1.5 trillion means that either proposal, Republican or \nDemocrat, is going to add trillions of dollars to the deficit.\n  I am proposing something a little more bold. I am proposing $200 \nbillion in cuts. I think it is the very least we can do. Two hundred \nbillion dollars in cuts can be gotten rather easily. The Government \nAccountability Office said there is $100 billion in waste, duplicate \nprograms. Why do we not cut that? What are we doing?\n  If you look at the chart of what is going on here, and you say, what \nhas happened to spending, the yellow line, around 2008 when we got the \ncurrent administration, is going up exponentially. That is the spending \nthat is going up. The spending is driving the deficit.\n  You look at the two lines over here. You cannot even see the \ndifference. This is the Republican proposal to cut $61 billion in \nproposed increases. Spending is still going up. The deficit is going \nup. We need to do more. The danger is if we do nothing that we may well \nface a debt crisis in our country. We need to do more. My amendment \nwill cut $200 billion in spending.\n  When I go home and I talk to the grassroots voters, they say, that is \nnot even enough, we need more. But at the very least, let's have a \nsignificant cut in spending and do something to get the deficit under \ncontrol before it is too late.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Please let me correct myself. Earlier today I said that \nSenator Coons is from Connecticut. Clearly he is from Delaware. And \nSenator Johanns is not on the floor, but Senator Barrasso is. It has \nbeen a long day and I apologize to my colleagues. But the Senator from \nWyoming is going to speak for a few minutes, and then the Senator from \nVermont, Mr. Sanders.\n  I am still hoping we can have a vote on one or two amendments at 6 \no'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the McConnell \namendment, in favor of the McConnell amendment. Gas prices have \nincreased 43 cents in the last month, and 77 cents a gallon over the \nlast year. These skyrocketing prices are hurting American families, and \nare threatening to derail the economic recovery.\n  You say, how much is this impact on the American family? Well, the \nDepartment of Energy says the average American family will spend about \n$700 more on gas this year than they did last year. That is going to \nimpact every family, every family trying to deal with bills and kids \nand a mortgage. It is not as if this problem happened overnight. For \nover 2 years, Americans have heard the President deliver speeches and \nmake promises on energy.\n  But the President says one thing and then he does another. That ``say \none thing, do another'' policy does nothing to ease the pain at the \npump. The administration's policies are making the problems today \nworse. The President's reckless policies have virtually shut down \noffshore exploration for oil. Last week, former President Bill Clinton \ncalled the delays in offshore oil and gas drilling permits ridiculous. \nOffshore oil production in the Gulf of Mexico is expected to drop 15 \npercent this calendar year. What that means is higher gas prices and \nfewer American jobs. The administration actually told Congress we can \nreplace the loss of American oil from the Gulf of Mexico with more oil \nfrom OPEC. That is exactly what this administration told Congress in \nOctober. In justifying more restrictive offshore drilling rules, the \nadministration admitted this would lead to lower production of American \noil.\n  The administration wrote:\n\n       The impact on domestic deepwater hydrocarbon production as \n     a result of these regulations is expected to be negative.\n\n  Then the administration went on to say:\n\n       Currently there is sufficient spare capacity in OPEC to \n     offset a decrease in Gulf of Mexico deepwater production that \n     could occur as a result of this rule.\n\n  That is this administration's mindset: Don't worry about domestic \nproduction. OPEC has us covered.\n  The administration's shutdown of American exploration is not the only \nproblem. The administration is also aggressively implementing \nEnvironmental Protection Agency regulations that will drive up the cost \nof energy. The EPA's climate change regulations under the Clean Air Act \nwill cause gas prices for every American to go up even more. That is \nwhy I am here today. The McConnell amendment will fix this problem. \nSenator Inhofe originally introduced the legislation in the Senate. It \nwas introduced in conjunction with a bill in the House by \nRepresentative Fred Upton. This legislation will stop the Environmental \nProtection Agency's regulatory overreach that is going to increase gas \nprices.\n  When Congress refused to pass the President's cap-and-trade scheme \nlast year, the administration turned to plan B--the use of the Clean \nAir Act to regulate climate change. The theory behind it is that \nadditional restrictions on carbon-based energy and higher costs for \ngasoline are needed to make green energy more competitive. The key word \nis ``competitive,'' not actually making green energy more affordable, \njust more competitive, not by driving down the cost of green energy but \nby driving up the cost of red, white, and blue American energy.\n  Energy Secretary Steven Chu has even said publicly: ``We have to \nfigure out how to boost the price of gasoline to the levels in \nEurope.''\n  The price in Europe is $8 a gallon. Under this cover of creating \ngreen jobs, EPA regulations are increasing the cost of red, white, and \nblue energy. This administration is trying to achieve its goals, the \nsame goals as cap and tax, by placing a massive energy tax on gasoline \nand gasoline production.\n  One of the ways the EPA will use the Clean Air Act is to regulate \ngreenhouse gas emissions from America's oil refineries. We have not had \na new oil refinery built in this country since 1976. The EPA's climate \nregulations will make it even more difficult and more costly to build \nand operate refineries. The result, of course, is higher gas prices at \nthe pump and a greater reliance on imported gasoline. The Environmental \nProtection Agency's climate regulations must be stopped. They are \narbitrary; they are costly; they are destructive; and they are \npolitically driven.\n  The EPA's climate rules are just one tool to make gasoline prices go \nup. But\n\n[[Page S1668]]\n\nthis administration is proposing dozens more. I have introduced \nlegislation similar to the McConnell amendment and the Inhofe bill. But \nmy bill is more comprehensive. My bill, S. 228, is called the Defending \nAmerica's Affordable Energy and Jobs Act. It will block the same \nmanipulation of laws to increase the future cost of gasoline for all \nAmericans. My legislation, which has the support of 20 Senators, would \nblock the manipulation and misuse of the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water \nAct, the Endangered Species Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, \nand the use of citizen lawsuits.\n  I am trying to stop this administration from placing a massive energy \ntax on gasoline and other forms of affordable energy. The Environmental \nSpecies Act is currently being used to remove 187,000 square miles of \nland from energy exploration. A decision of this magnitude will \ndrastically limit oil and gas development and exploration. They do this \nall in the name of climate change.\n  When the administration blocks production of American oil used to \nmake gasoline, American families pay higher prices at the pump. They \npay higher prices today, and the prices will remain high in the future. \nI plan to continue to fight the many ways this administration is trying \nto enact cap-and-tax policies and raise gas prices. The President says \nhe wants renewable energy to be the cheapest form of energy. He needs \nto level with the American people. He needs to admit his scheme is to \nraise the cost of all other forms of energy and make the American \npeople pay the bill.\n  We should be exploring for more American energy offshore, on Federal \nlands, and in Alaska. I urge my colleagues to support the McConnell \namendment so we can block the administration's costly regulations and \nprotect the pocketbooks of American families. The President's policies \nare making the pain at the pump even worse. It is time to stop these \npolicies today with the McConnell amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I think we all know elections have \nconsequences. I doubt seriously, however, that when most voters went to \nthe polls last November, they were voting for more of their kids to get \naggravated asthma or more people to go to the hospital with respiratory \nproblems or more people to get sick in general. I do not think the \npeople went to the polls this past November to vote to put big oil and \nbig polluters in charge. I didn't see those TV ads.\n  But make no mistake. People may not have voted for a polluter poison \nagenda, but that is exactly what they are getting from Republicans in \nthe House and their colleagues in the Senate. Their agenda is to \nderegulate polluters, even if it harms our national security. They want \nto gut the bipartisan Clean Air Act, even if doing so harms public \nhealth. Republicans claim the Inhofe amendment would lower gas prices. \nThat claim was found to be false by politifact.com. Meanwhile, the \nClean Air Act is actually raising fuel economy standards and is \nprojected to save drivers $2,800 on gas for new vehicles.\n  The reason for that is pretty obvious. We are making an effort to see \nthat cars manufactured and sold in this country get decent mileage per \ngallon. We wonder why all over the world people are driving cars that \nget 40, 50, 60 miles per gallon, and we are stuck with cars that get 15 \nor 20. We can, we must, and we are doing better in that area. We have \nto continue to go forward.\n  The Clean Air Act standards are projected to save 2.3 billion barrels \nof oil. When we get cars that are energy efficient--hybrids, electric \ncars--we are not consuming oil from Saudi Arabia. We all talk in the \nSenate about the need to move this country toward energy independence. \nBut the Clean Air Act is actually helping to deliver it. That is good \nnews for our national security but not for polluters. The Inhofe \namendment would keep us dependent on foreign oil, something we \ncertainly do not want to be the case.\n  My Republican friends claim the Clean Air Act regulations are \ndestroying the economy. That claim is also false. This chart shows that \neven as we have reduced pollution in the air by 63 percent since 1970, \nour economy grew by 210 percent and added nearly 60 million jobs. In \nfact, the Clean Air Act and other environmental laws have helped create \nhundreds of thousands of jobs in environmental technologies and \npollution control industries. If we invest properly in energy \nefficiency and in such sustainable energies as wind, solar, geothermal, \nbiomass, over a period of years we will, in fact, not only clean up our \nenvironment, not only move toward energy independence but create \nmillions of good-paying jobs.\n  For every $1 invested in clean air, we see up to $40 in return in \neconomic and health benefits to America. We should all understand, \nhowever, that while big polluters may not like the Clean Air Act, it \nbenefits every American. Why is it that after we have made significant \nprogress in beginning to clean up our air, there are people who want to \nbring us back to the days when polluters could fill the air with all \nkinds of soot and other harmful products which cause disease all over \nAmerica?\n  Thanks to the Clean Air Act, we are actually saving 160,000 lives \neach year. People are not dying from premature deaths, as they would \nhave if the air they were breathing was dirty. We are literally \navoiding sending tens of thousands of people to the hospital and \nemergency rooms every year, avoiding thousands of cases of heart \nattacks, skin cancer, aggravated asthma, and lung damage thanks to the \nClean Air Act.\n  Senator Merkley made the point a few moments ago about the view of \nthe American Lung Association on this issue. They have strong concerns \nas to what will happen to respiratory illnesses if we weaken the Clean \nAir Act. We are currently reducing toxic pollution such as mercury that \nthe CDC has said causes major developmental problems for children. Our \nNation's leading public health experts, including the American Academy \nof Pediatrics, the American College of Preventative Medicine, the \nAmerican Public Health Association, the Asthma and Allergy Foundation \nof America, the American Heart Association, and the American Lung \nAssociation, recently said the Clean Air Act's continued implementation \nis ``quite literally a matter of life and death for tens of thousands \nof people and will mean the difference between chronic debilitating \nillness or a healthy life for hundreds of thousands more.''\n  That is what is at stake. I will vote against the Inhofe amendment \nand urge my colleagues to vigorously oppose this attack on our public \nhealth. While this amendment may benefit wealthy oil companies, it is \nan attack on the health of all Americans who want to breathe healthy \nair and drink clean water.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I see two Members on the floor. I ask \nunanimous consent for Senator Johanns to go next and Senator \nRockefeller, who wanted to speak, and then we will try to get some sort \nof consent for one or two votes tonight. We are still hoping to do that \naround 6. We will try to keep Members posted.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 161\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the pending Johanns-\nManchin amendment 161, which I believe would send a positive, strong \nmessage to job creators that Congress is listening, that we have heard \nthem. The bill we are debating today to help small businesses utilize \nFederal funding for research and development is certainly important. \nBut I have to tell my colleagues, I believe what our small businesses \nare focused on, what they are worried about is the avalanche of new \nregulations headed their way. They are worried about the mountain of \npaperwork that is about to overwhelm them due to the 1099 reporting \nrequirements contained in section 9006 of the health care law. Instead \nof focusing on hiring new workers and growing their businesses, they \nare meeting with accountants. They are wondering why those in \nWashington choose to weigh them down further after the last 2 years.\n  So the amendment I offer today seeks to solve that problem by \nrepealing the 1099 reporting mandate that is weighing down upon them. \nAs we all know, I am referring to the tax paperwork nightmare that, as \nI said, is buried in section 9006 of the health care\n\n[[Page S1669]]\n\nlaw. It is straightforward. It says if a business purchases more than \n$600 of goods or services from another business, then they are required \nto generate and provide to that business and to the Internal Revenue \nService a 1099 form.\n  This new mandate will affect 40 million businesses in this Nation. \nThat is not even mentioning the nonprofits, the churches, our local and \nState governments that are also impacted. Furthermore, it will stand in \nthe way of job creators by forcing businesses to waste capital and \nhuman resources on useless paperwork.\n  Considering the high unemployment rates plaguing many States, it does \nnot make sense that we would keep this job-suppressing paperwork \nmandate. Yet repealing the nonsensical mandate has been a long and \nsomewhat tortured path. I first circulated a ``Dear Colleague'' letter \nasking for cosponsors on the 1099 repeal back in June of last year. \nWhen we introduced it in July, we had 25 cosponsors, and small business \nwatched us with great anticipation. It gave them hope that common sense \nwas going to prevail in the Senate and that partisanship could be set \naside to simply do the right thing.\n  Unfortunately, that hope did evaporate. They have been frustrated, \ntime and time again, when it failed to advance in September and in \nNovember and appeared stalled as we came into the new year. But, \nfinally, they saw a ray of hope on March 3 when the House passed 1099 \nrepeal. It was a very large bipartisan effort, 314 to 112.\n  Small businesses cheered last week when Majority Leader Reid endorsed \nthe House-passed version and indicated H.R. 4 would likely be passed \nand go on directly to the President by the end of the week. Yet, when \nThursday rolled around, a vote on 1099 repeal was shelved and replaced \nwith a vote on a judicial nominee. Once again, our job creators were \nleft scratching their heads, disappointed by the continued political \ngamesmanship on this very important issue.\n  Moving the goalposts yet again, we now hear that some are objecting \nto the House bill's offset to completely pay for the repeal of the 1099 \nmandate. This now supposedly controversial provision simply reduces \nimproper overpayments of insurance subsidies.\n  As the Secretary of Health and Human Services said, the repayment of \nimproper subsidies makes it ``fairer for recipients and all \ntaxpayers.'' Yet some have now decided this House offset is somehow a \nmiddle-class tax increase. That argument, to me, is stunning.\n  Since when is requiring someone to repay what was given to them \nerroneously ever regarded as a tax increase? Where I come from that is \nsimply smart government for the taxpayer. Furthermore, I find it a bit \ntoo convenient that not one Senator complained about using this very \noffset to pay for the Medicare doc fix last December. Remember, the \nSenate passed the doc fix, and they did it unanimously. Only two people \nopposed it in the House. The President signed it eagerly.\n  Yet, today, some have decided it is somehow a tax increase. It does \nnot pass the smell test. Our small businesses--well, they are not \nbuying it either. They will see it as one more hollow excuse why we \ncannot provide businesses and their workers relief from the nonsensical \npaperwork mandate.\n  These job creators have watched dueling amendments and proposals and \ncounterproposals for too long, and they have grown impatient. Our small \nbusinesses do deserve better, but, unfortunately, at the moment, we are \ngetting more of the same.\n  More legislative squabbling only delays the certainty that our \nbusiness community wants us to provide to them. They are looking for us \nto help them through this paperwork mess.\n  Well, what is happening out there--because this is now starting to \nstare them in the face--is they are already starting to think about \nsoftware because they have to track this, and there is a cost to that. \nThey are talking to their accountants, and that costs money. They are \ndiverting very precious capital in anticipation of the new mandate, not \nto mention the fact that rental property owners are currently subject \nto the new mandate. Unfortunately, our rental property owners are \nhaving to comply with it and track each payment for repairs and for \nupkeep.\n  We need to give these folks a break so they can focus on growing and \ncreating jobs, not worrying about how to pay for additional \naccountants. Passing H.R. 4 would show them we are listening to their \nconcerns and we are committed to removing unnecessary barriers to their \nsuccess. Instead, we are requiring our job creators to wait out on the \nsidelines while this continues to go on and on and on. They deserve \nbetter.\n  So I join our Nation's job creators, once again, asking the Senate to \nact on this very important issue and repeal the 1099 requirement. Rest \nassured, they will not go away, and we do not want them to. We want \nthem to do everything they can to create jobs.\n  I will offer this legislation as an amendment to every legislative \nvehicle moving in the Senate until it becomes law. I am hopeful not \nmany more of these amendments will be needed because there is a simple \nsolution: Repeal it. I believe there is strong bipartisan support for \nit. We can then send it to the President. He can sign it, as he said he \nwould, and we can celebrate this in a very bipartisan way.\n  A vote on this amendment is significant, not only because it truly is \nthe right thing to do but because it will show that H.R. 4 has more \nthan 60 votes needed to pass the Senate. All we need to do is try on \nthis and get it done.\n  Once again, I point out, this is a bipartisan effort. This is an \neffort where Republicans and Democrats and Independents can claim \nvictory and say we got this done. It was the right thing to do. It \nnever should have been in the health care bill in the first place.\n  My hope is my colleagues will stick with me. We can get it done. We \ncan get it passed and get it signed by the President. You will hear a \ncheer all over this country by our job creators when it is finally \nrepealed.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I have comments I wish to make on \n1099 which are at odds with the distinguished Senator from Nebraska, \nbut I will hold that for another moment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 183\n\n  I think it is well known that in West Virginia we have had our \nproblems with EPA, and I have an amendment which would say for a period \nof 2 years they would not have the power to enforce their laws on \nstationary sources, i.e., powerplants. But it lasts for 2 years and \nthen it stops.\n  What is my reason for doing that? I will offer this amendment. My \nreason for doing that is, I wish to give us the time to come up with a \ngood carbon sequestration bill and also give us the time to come up \nwith an energy policy, since, if my amendment were to pass--since it is \n2 years from the date of passage--that does give us the time, if it is \nthe will of the Congress, to have an energy policy. If it is not, then \nthat, of course, is quite a different matter.\n  But I simply cannot support and will not support the McConnell \namendment, which calls for a complete emasculation of EPA forever. I do \nnot understand this type of thinking. I understand we are in a very \nsort of difficult position in a postelection period, where people have \nvery strong ideas: Let's get rid of government, and let's size \neverything down and get rid of all these people who have been giving us \ntrouble.\n  I think we have to be mature in the way we approach these problems. I \ndo not think by saying EPA, created by President Nixon in 1972, shall \nvirtually cease to exist with respect to any effect on greenhouse gases \nat all, forever--the concept of doing something forever is, to me, a \nvery risky thing on its face. It does not usually make any sense, \nwhether it is health care or energy policy or any other kind of policy, \nto make a law which has to do with regulation and then say: You cannot \nregulate forever.\n  What if you did that to the National Highway Traffic Safety \nCommission? We have discovered that for children the little models they \nuse for crash tests are not, in fact, big enough. They were created a \nnumber of years ago, and kids are much bigger now. So we have to \nchange, and the Commerce Committee is working on this. We have to \nchange the size of the little dummies they put in these seats to crash \ntest them to see what happens to them because kids are larger. So if \nyou made\n\n[[Page S1670]]\n\na rule that this was to last forever, under original circumstance, \nobviously, that would hurt our children and create discomfort and \nsadness.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency is not a frivolous agency. It is \ncreated, yes, to regulate pollution. I have been saying to the West \nVirginia Coal Association, which for the most part does not believe in \nclimate science--they do not believe there is a climate problem, and I \nhave been saying to them for a number of years that is wrong. In my \njudgment, the science is true, the science is unequivocally true, and \nthere is a price to carbon in their future. I said this a couple months \nago. There is a price to carbon in their future. You cannot simply \ncarry on business the way you are doing it now and avoiding any sense \nof responsibility and be called a mature corporation or a mature person \nin this country or a mature public servant.\n  I understand the fervor of the Senator from Oklahoma, the Senator \nfrom Kentucky, and others who put up this amendment for a permanent ban \non any regulation of carbon dioxide or any other of these areas. But in \nthe process, of course, what they say they are for is that the EPA can \nno longer regulate CAFE standards; that is, how many miles per gallon \nyour car gets. If you look at the private sector, there is a drive and \na competition now to increase and raise the level of corporate average \nfuel economy standards, lowering emissions. That is as it should be. \nThat is a natural product of free enterprise competition.\n  But to say that the EPA--what if there were to be a backslide? What \nif the Big Three and a number of others decided: Well, this isn't worth \nour while. There is nobody regulating us, so we don't have to do \nanything about it, and they slipped backward and then created a much \nmore emission-charged climate?\n  I cannot abide by that. I cannot believe that is sensible government. \nI cannot believe that in the theological drive to make government \nsmall, to make government disappear, to make health care disappear, to \nmake all kinds of things disappear--so we can all be happy again, as we \nwere in the 1910s and 1950s, I guess--life does not work like that and \nlegislation should not work like that.\n  We should approach it thoughtfully, with a long view as well as a \nshort view. The short view says: Oh, I have to be mad at EPA--and I am \nbecause they have done things in West Virginia which I think are wrong \nand should be changed--but I would never, for a moment, consider saying \nthey should forever be banned from having anything to do with climate \nchange policies or CAFE standards. It does not make any sense.\n  It is embarrassing. It is embarrassing. That is not a favor to the \npeople of West Virginia. What that means is the companies--coal \ncompanies, power companies--that are looking at all of this, they will \njust start walking away from coal very quickly. This would also be true \nin Pennsylvania, the home of the Presiding Officer. Natural gas is \nbeginning to take over large parts of our electric power industry. That \nhas happened in North Carolina and in Ohio and probably a little bit in \nPennsylvania and, yes, a little bit in West Virginia. The Marcellus \nShale is an unbounded, endless pool of natural gas, and it lies up and \ndown the Appalachian spine. Companies are beginning to switch away from \ncoal to natural gas.\n  Now, if one doesn't care about coal miners and one doesn't care about \ncoal companies--but, particularly, coal miners. They are not \nresponsible for any of this. They just dig the coal God put in the \nEarth 1 billion years ago. They dig it, and then it is shipped by truck \nor by rail or in some fashion, perhaps by barge, off to a power \ncompany. The power companies are the ones that have to make the \ndecision how are they going to burn it. Are they going to burn it \ncleaner?\n  Two companies in West Virginia, one being American Electric Power, \nhas conducted an experiment in New Haven, which is the large powerplant \nin the state. They have picked out 18 percent of all their emissions, \nand they have applied carbon-capturing sequestration to that 18 \npercent. That 18 percent of the flue gas emissions have gone from \nwhatever carbon content down to about 10 percent carbon content. That \nis called clean coal.\n  When we talk about coal on this floor, everybody assumes coal is \nalways dirty. Well, coal is dirty when it is taken out of the ground \nand nothing happens to it. But with all of the science and technology \nwe have available, carbon-capturing sequestration is not only working \nto make that clean coal, therefore, highly competitive--much more \ncompetitive than natural gas, which is 50 percent carbon dioxide--it \nmakes it only 10 percent when we use these technologies. That is what \nmy amendment--the 2-year amendment, and then only 2 years, that is what \nis meant to give us the time. Sensibly, that is what we ought to be \ndoing if people cared about having an energy policy.\n  Then there is another facility, operated by Dow Chemical. Dow \nChemical is not usually associated with these things. But they are \nrunning exactly the same kind of a burning of coal focus and \ndemonstration using a slightly different technology, but also getting \nabout 90 percent of the carbon out of the coal, and they use the power \nfrom that. They use that. So don't tell me it can't be done. Just tell \nme we don't have the technology to do it broadly enough. But if we are \ntalking about a nation with a couple hundred years' of coal left, \ndon't--I don't want to hear about dirty coal because that is not going \nto get anywhere. But clean coal, that can do a lot better than natural \ngas and do a lot better than a lot of other alternative energies.\n  What is going on in Japan right now, I shy away from the idea of \nsaying: Oh, well, then we have to stop from ever building any nuclear \npowerplant forever. I am not a big fan of nuclear power, but I don't \nthink we make decisions because of that. We don't make them out of \nemotion. We don't make them because of a catastrophe in another \ncountry. Maybe there is and maybe there isn't; I haven't checked the \nnews in 4 or 5 hours. But that is 20 percent of all of the power in \nthis country. So before we make the decision, let's be thoughtful about \nit.\n  I think we ought to be thoughtful about this amendment, the McConnell \namendment, which says that forever and ever the EPA will be completely \nstripped away of its authority for carbon monoxide, climate problems, \nplus anything else that creates carbon--it could be factories; all \nkinds of things. They will be completely free of any kind of \nregulation. I think that is wrong.\n  I think the regulation has to be put in place which is reasonable, \nwhich would be the purpose of my amendment for 2 years. Then that would \nbe it. Then we would see where we are. But to do a permanent, complete \nemasculation of the EPA isn't what a mature body of legislators does, \nin my judgment. I, therefore, will vote against this amendment and will \nwait to see the result and then offer my amendment which I think is \nmuch more sensible.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank Senator Rockefeller and all of \nthe Members who have come to the floor today debating this important \nbill and to share their thoughts about other amendments that are--some \ndirectly but some indirectly--related to our discussion. It doesn't \nlook as if we are going to vote tonight, but we are going to continue \nto work throughout the evening as Members want to come to the floor and \nspeak on their amendments, so we can try to work something out for \ntomorrow.\n  I thank Senator Snowe and her staff for their good work today. I see \nSenator Whitehouse on the floor. He may wish to speak about an \namendment. But I remind everyone that we are on the SBIR and STTR \nReauthorization Act. It is a very important piece of legislation that \nhas been sputtering for a reauthorization now for over 6 years, and \nthere are literally thousands of entities--small businesses, dozens of \nFederal agencies, many, many organizations from the Chamber of Commerce \nto the American Small Business Association--that are depending on us to \ndo our work and actually get this program reauthorized. It is important \nto give consistency and permanency. So we are going to continue to work \nto do that.\n  I look forward to speaking in more detail about the bill later \ntonight and tomorrow. But it looks as though we are not going to have \nvotes tonight;\n\n[[Page S1671]]\n\nbut, hopefully, we can get some order and some agreement to proceed.\n  At this time I see Senator Whitehouse on the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, we are not at this moment without \nvotes on this important legislation for lack of effort by the \ndistinguished Senator from Louisiana. She has been extraordinarily \ndetermined, as she was with her earlier small business legislation \nwhich she fought through to a success, and I am sure this will be \nfought through to a success as well.\n  One of the ways in which our friends on the other side are seeking to \nharass and impede this important piece of legislation is by putting on \nunrelated amendments--particularly poisonous unrelated amendments, \nincluding the one Senator Rockefeller just spoke about--to completely \ngut and strip the authority the U.S. Supreme Court has recognized EPA \nhas to protect us from the hazard of carbon pollution.\n  Underlying this procedural maneuver which would interfere with this \nsignificant jobs-related bill is a fundamental disagreement about \nwhether our atmosphere is being affected by the carbon pollution we \nhave been pumping into it. I would submit the facts are entirely on one \nside of that debate, and the polluters are entirely on the other. It is \nonly in a building such as this in which so many special interests have \nsuch sway that the debate has the currency it appears to have achieved.\n  Much of what is happening is nondebatable. Scientists know--not from \ntheory but from observation, from calculation--what the range of parts \nper million of carbon dioxide has been in the atmosphere for 8,000 \ncenturies. We can go back and find the carbon record in ice and in \nother ways, and we can establish what the range was of carbon dioxide \nin our atmosphere.\n  For the last 800,000 years, it has been between 170 and about 300 \nparts per million. That is the bandwidth--170 to 300 parts per \nmillion--over 800,000 years. For the first time in 800,000 years, we \nare out of that range. The present concentration--again, a measurement, \nnot a theory--exceeds 391 parts per million. Scientists can draw a \ntrajectory which is something that people do all over this world. It is \nnot complicated. It is not theory. If you draw a trajectory based on \nwhere we are going, the trajectory puts us at 688 parts per million in \nthe year 2095 and 1,097 parts per million in the year 2195. These are \nlevels that not only haven't been seen in 800,000 years, they haven't \nbeen seen in millions of years.\n  This is an experiment in the very nature, the very physics of our \nplanet. It has been known since just after the Civil War when the Irish \nscientist Tyndall discovered that CO2 in the atmosphere had \na warming effect, had a blanketing effect and warmed the atmosphere. \nThat has been bomb-proof science for more than a century. It is in \nbasic textbooks.\n  When we take that scientific theory--basic, established, more than \n130, 140 years old--and then combine it with the facts as we see it, \nthat it has been in this range, it is now out of an 8,000-century range \nand climbing, and we look at some of the effects that are beginning to \nhappen that are also consistent with that, a fairly undeniable story \nbegins to emerge.\n  The day will come, I am confident, when our grandchildren will look \nback at this moment at our unwillingness to deal with the plain \nscientific evidence in front of us and to instead be persuaded by \nmerchants of doubt with big checkbooks who have a vested interest in \nthe outcome, who have a conflict of interest. We are listening to them, \nand we are not listening to the plain facts and to the plain science \nand the theories that have been known for more than a century. People \nwill look back at us with real shame--there is no other word for it--\nshame and disgust, that this was the way we addressed this problem on \nour planet.\n  We can look back at other events such as this. Galileo had a view \nbased on his observations on science as to how the planets worked, and \nhe was intimidated out of it by the power of the day which couldn't \nabide that, and he was taken before the inquisition and was forced to \nrecant. The legend is that when he recanted, he quietly said to \nhimself: I recant, but the planets stay their courses.\n  Well, the planets stay their courses, the laws of physics and \nchemistry don't change, and we are on a slope toward a very severe \nproblem. We can't just simply, like the ostrich, put our heads in the \nsand over and over. It is just wrong.\n  So this amendment is wrong that would strip EPA of their authority. \nIt will hurt people who depend on this. It has always been good for \nAmerica when we have made our air and water cleaner. We simply cannot \ngo on this way. It is bad for this bill because it puts a poisonous \namendment on it when this should be a bill we should all be getting \nbehind. It is certainly wrong from a point of view of history and \nscience and the obligation we have to our younger people and to their \nchildren who have to live in a world that faces the consequences of our \nnegligence this day.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, this has actually been a very \ninvigorating debate on the bill that is pending before the Senate. We \nhave heard a few amendments that have been filed that are directly \nrelated to the reauthorization of this important program, and there are \nothers who have an arguably indirect impact on small business jobs and \nthe creation of opportunity for research and technology investments for \nsmall business in America. But we are unable to vote tonight and to \ncome to any consensus about the order of votes. Hopefully, we can do \nthat sometime this evening.\n  Let me take this moment to again thank the 84 Members of the Senate \nwho voted yesterday to give us an opportunity to get to this important \nbill. As people have watched this debate throughout the day and \ncontinue to watch this evening, one of the reasons the leadership likes \nto sometimes put appropriate limits on the debate is to keep people \nfocused on the underlying issue. But Senator Snowe and I decided to \nurge our leaders to have a really open debate because we understand \nthere are Members who feel very strongly about the EPA issues and the \nclimate change rules and regulations and about the 1099 provision. \nSenator Nelson feels strongly about reducing legislative spending. \nSenator Hutchison and I in particular have strong feelings about the \nLEASE Act. So we are going to be as inclusive and incorporate as many \nof these ideas as we can.\n\n  But I really want to ask, since we have looked at the amendment list \njust within the hour and we have 48 amendments pending on this bill--\nand some people have half a dozen--if Members and their staffs will \nplease look and see what is absolutely essential for them to offer as \nan amendment on this bill so that we don't miss this opportunity. That \nis really what I want to express right now, that this will be a missed \nopportunity to reauthorize one of the best programs at the Federal \nlevel.\n  We have heard a lot of talk about programs that don't work, about \nprograms that are wasteful, programs that are full of fraud and abuse. \nThis is not one of them. This is the Federal Government's largest \ninvestment program in research and development. This gives small \nbusinesses in America--businesses we all represent on main streets \neverywhere, whether North Carolina, Louisiana, California, or \nMassachusetts, small businesses with cutting-edge technology and new \nand exciting science, with very bright people who have graduated from \nsome of the finest universities in the world--this gives them an \nopportunity to put their technology and their know-how in front of \nFederal agencies for the sole purpose of saving taxpayer money, \ncreating jobs, and increasing the revenues paid to governments at the \nlocal, State, and Federal level to solve our deficit problem.\n  We are not going to solve our debt and deficit problem by cutting, \nslashing recklessly, domestic discretionary spending alone. No one in \nAmerica believes that. I don't know why people come to the floor to \ncontinue to promote that idea. It is not going to happen. We are going \nto get to a balanced budget when we bring our revenues and our \nspending, in appropriate order, in line and when we pass bills such as \nthis that literally help create thousands of jobs in America. That is \nwhat is going\n\n[[Page S1672]]\n\nto end the recession. That is what is going to close this budget gap. \nAnd that is why I will stay on the floor all week with Senator Snowe, \nwho has been wonderfully helpful today, and we will continue until we \ncan get this bill passed.\n  I don't want us to miss this opportunity because it has been three \nCongresses--not one, not two, but three Congresses--that have tried and \nfailed. We are not going to fail this week. We are going to pass this \nbill this week in the Senate. We are going to get a bill out of here \nand over to the House. It is very likely that the House will take up \nour bill as it is generally written.\n  Why do I say that? Because we have already incorporated so many of \nthe House views and thoughts over the last several years. This is not \nnew language to them. We have a new chairman--Chairman Graves--and he \nunderstands perfectly that we are working hard in the Senate to get \nthis bill over to him and to his good committee.\n  We have literally thousands of businesses kind of on hold because \nthey do not know whether this program is going to be here from week to \nweek. We have agencies that don't know if they should put out \nsolicitations for new technologies. Why wouldn't we want to take this \nopportunity when we clearly know this is one of the most effective \nprograms? Let me give a specific example. We have used it before, but \nit is worth using again, although we have hundreds.\n  Qualcomm is a company that is very well known. It developed the \nsoftware primarily that allows wireless communication. Twenty years \nago, nobody ever heard of Qualcomm, and very few people had cell phones \nthat weighed less than 3 pounds each, as I remember. But 25 to 30 \npeople came together with Dr. Jacobs. They sat in his den, as he \ntestified before our committee just last week. He said that through the \nSBIR Program, their initial idea got a couple hundred dollars. In phase \nII, they got $1.5 million.\n  That is what this program does--incentivizes or gives grants or \ncontracts to emerging technologies well before a bank would take a \nlook, well before a venture capital fund would even look in their \ndirection. You have to develop the technology to a point and then have \nit launched. This is where there is what he described as the valley of \ndeath--great ideas, but there is just not a lot of venture capital out \nthere and particularly in this recessionary period. So he says we \nhelped, that without this program, it would have been very difficult to \ngrow their company.\n  Today, that company employs 17,500 people in about 22 countries in \nthe world, including right here in the United States, and it pays in \ntaxes, in 1 year, $1 billion. That is 50 percent of the cost of this \nentire program. So one company--Qualcomm--in its 25-year life, has \ngrown so much that it pays enough taxes that it supports 50 percent of \nthe cost of this program annually.\n  I can give dozens of examples of other companies that have been \nlaunched through this program.\n  Let me say that our Federal departments are getting better at this. \nIt was a little touch-and-go at first. The Federal agencies weren't \nquite used to it. Senator Rudman helped to create this program. He was \nvery passionate about it, as were others, so we sort of pushed the \nFederal agencies to do this. They were more comfortable doing research \nand development with the big companies. They felt more comfortable. \nThey felt they weren't taking as much risk. No one likes to fail. So \nthey thought: Well, I have this project, and I am going to give it to \nIBM. If it doesn't work, nobody can blame me. The problem was that IBM \ndidn't have all the answers. We have come to find out that sometimes \nthey had very few during parts of their career as a company.\n  Not to be disrespectful to that company, but right down the road \nthere were 10 small businesses, but nobody ever heard of them; \nscientists nobody ever heard of. Senator Rudman knew this, so he said: \nWe are going to mandate a certain percentage of your research and \ndevelopment money, you have to push it out to small business. And some \nof them, yes, failed. But as the folks testified, if they are not \nfailing, this program isn't working. I want to repeat. If they are not \nfailing, this program isn't working because this program is front-end, \nhigh-risk, but with great returns for the American taxpayer and great \nreturns for small businesses.\n  I might say, as I said earlier today, it is the envy of many other \ncountries in the world. The gentleman who has done the most research \nand looking over at this program testified before our committee that he \ntravels around the world, and he is called by other nations that ask: \nHow is it that the Federal Government sets up programs that allow the \nsmall businesses to enter into research and development?\n  So Senator Snowe and I have taken this on as our first priority for \nthis year and for this Congress. We know there are many important bills \npending before our committee, but we believe this is the right bill to \npresent to the Congress in the right order. The Chair is on the \ncommittee, so she knows this very well. But we are trying to think of \nwhat we could get out of our committee to the floor, to the President's \ndesk, that has the most immediate impact, creates the most jobs, and \nthis is the program.\n  This program extends the authorization for 8 years. It updates the \naward sizes for the program from $100,000 to $150,000. It takes the \nphase II awards from $750,000 to $1 million. It increases investment in \nsmall businesses by increasing the percentage from 2.5 to 3.5 percent \nof the research and development monies at all agencies over 10 years, \nincluding NIH and the Department of Defense.\n  These are very significant numbers for the Department of Defense. It \nis $1 billion. It is $1 billion this bill will sort of set aside and \nsay: Defense Department, if you are looking for that new radiator for \nthat tank, if you are looking at ways to cool or looking at ways to \nsort your ammo more efficiently or looking at ways to come up with new \nsoftware to help that warfighter, here is $1 billion of research money, \nand we want you to ask not just the big companies in America and around \nthe world but the small companies, the innovators out there. Give them \na chance to show you what they have. That is what this program does, \nand we have reams and reams of data supporting its effectiveness.\n  It also includes this compromise between the biotech, the venture \ncapital industry, and the small business community. We had a big fight \nover the last several years, but we have come to a compromise. Neither \nside is ecstatic, which means it is a good compromise. They are all \nsort of just understanding that without this compromise, this bill \ncould fall apart, and they know how important it is. So they have come \nto terms on the basic portion that can be invested by venture capital \nfunds, leaving the integrity of this program as a small business \nprogram, which is the way it was created, but allowing an appropriate \nlevel of involvement with the venture capital industry.\n  It also creates Federal, State, and technical partnerships. It \nimproves the SBA's ability to oversee and coordinate this program. It \nadds some metrics and measurements so we can really get some good data \nabout how it is working and where it is not working. And as we \nauthorize it for 8 years, we will be able to really say that we got \ndown to business and we got serious about reauthorizing this important \nprogram, while leaving this debate open and flexible and allowing the \nMembers to have an opportunity to speak about things they feel strongly \nabout.\n  I am hoping that sometime tomorrow we can vote on some of the \namendments we discussed today--the McConnell amendment, the Johanns \namendment, potentially, the Vitter amendment, and the Nelson amendment. \nSenator Cornyn, Senator Hutchison, and others were down here to speak. \nWe hope to get their amendments in the queue. But again, if the Members \nwould just be cooperative and let Senator Snowe and me know whether you \ncould choose one or two and not offer six or seven amendments, that \nwould be extremely helpful to us. Just let us know and our staffs know, \nand we will work as hard as we can to have the votes that are necessary \nto move this bill off the floor and get it to the President's desk.\n  For those who say, why aren't we talking about the budget and debt, \nmy answer is, we are talking about the budget and debt. This is part of \nclosing the budget gap. This is about creating jobs that generate \nrevenue that closes\n\n[[Page S1673]]\n\nthat gap. It is not just about discretionary domestic spending cuts. We \nwill never get where we need to be going down that road. We are going \nto get to it by a combination of things, and that is why Senator Snowe \nand I feel very strongly about bringing this bill to the floor to talk \nabout growing and encouraging job creation, particularly by small \nbusinesses, innovators, entrepreneurs, inventors, and risk takers who \nneed and rely on this program to launch new and exciting businesses \nthat benefit us all.\n  Whether it is in the State of Oregon, the State of Louisiana, or, as \nI said, Massachusetts, New York, or California, we have literally \nthousands of companies that have used this program successfully to \ngrow. Our people are employed, and America is continuing to lead in \nmany areas. Unfortunately, we don't lead in every area, but in many \nareas in new emerging technology, depending on the field, of course, we \nare very proud of this Federal program, and it is an example of a \nprogram that works.\n  If we could work as well as this program does in doing our work this \nweek and getting this bill actually off the floor intact--with some \namendments, of course, that will be voted on--and get it over to the \nHouse, let them do their work, and get this bill to the President's \ndesk, we will have done some good work this week.\n  Mr. President, I am going to suggest the absence of a quorum. I don't \nsee anyone else on the floor. There may be Members who will want to \ncome to talk about amendments. There will be nothing that will be \npending for the next few hours, and hopefully we can get an agreement \nlater on tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, unfortunately, all too often it seems \nFederal agencies do not take into account the impacts to small \nbusinesses and job growth before imposing new rules and regulations. \nAnd so, I am introducing three amendments to the Small Business \nReauthorization bill to force Federal agencies to cut the redtape that \nimpedes job growth.\n  The first of my three amendments requires Federal agencies to analyze \nthe indirect costs of regulations, such as the impact on job creation, \nthe cost of energy, and consumer prices.\n  Presently, Federal agencies are not required by statute to analyze \nthe indirect cost regulations can have on the public, such as higher \nenergy costs, higher prices, and the impact on job creation. However, \nExecutive Order 12866, issued by President Clinton in 1993, obligates \nagencies to provide the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs \nwith an assessment of the indirect costs of proposed regulations. My \namendment would essentially codify this provision of President \nClinton's Executive Order.\n  My second amendment obligates Federal agencies to comply with public \nnotice and comment requirements and prohibits them from circumventing \nthese requirements by issuing unofficial rules as guidance documents.''\n  After President Clinton issued Executive Order 12866, Federal \nagencies found it easier to issue so-called guidance documents, rather \nthan formal rules. Although these guidance documents are merely an \nagency's interpretation of how the public can comply with a particular \nrule, and are not enforceable in court, as a practical matter they \noperate as if they are legally binding. Thus, they have been used by \nagencies to circumvent OIRA regulatory review and public notice and \ncomment requirements.\n  In 2007, President Bush issued Executive Order 13422, which contained \na provision closing this loophole by imposing ``Good Guidance \nPractices'' on Federal agencies, which requires them to provide public \nnotice and comment for significant guidance documents. My amendment \nwould essentially codify this provision of President Bush's Executive \nOrder.\n  My third amendment helps out the ``little guy'' trying to navigate \nour incredibly complex and burdensome regulatory environment. So many \nsmall businesses don't have a lot of capital on hand. When a small \nbusiness inadvertently runs afoul of a Federal regulation for the first \ntime, that first penalty could sink the business and all the jobs it \nsupports. My amendment would provide access to SBA assistance to small \nbusinesses in a situation where they face a first-time, nonharmful \npaperwork violation. It simply doesn't make sense to me to punish small \nbusinesses the first time they accidently fail to comply with paperwork \nrequirements, so long as no harm comes from that failure.\n  Each of the provisions of these amendments have been endorsed by the \nNational Federation of Independent Business, NFIB, and the Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship Council. I urge my colleagues to support \nthese important amendments to our regulatory system.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/15/senate-section/article/S1673-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1673]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU.

Mr. President, I have come to the Senate floor \nmany times before to speak about the important role that Louisiana \nsheriffs play in our State. Our sheriffs are unique among their \nnationwide counterparts in three distinct ways: in that they serve as \nthe chief law enforcement officer of the parish, the chief executive \nofficer of the parish court, and the official tax collector for their \nparishes. This position, established in our State Constitution, gives \nour sheriffs a highly influential and distinct position of power and \nresponsibility.\n  Today I have come to commemorate one of our State's most \ndistinguished sheriffs, and a true leader within our law enforcement \ncommittee, Hal Turner. Late last week, I learned that Hal, the \nexecutive director of the Louisiana Sheriffs' Association, LSA, will be \nretiring at the end of March. He has served in this important role \nsince 2004, and is only the third individual to do so since the LSA's \ninception in 1938. While I am sad to see him leave, I would like to \ntake a moment to honor Hal, his over 30 years of public service, and \nthe many contributions he made to Louisiana.\n  Hal began his law enforcement career in 1980 and rose through the \nranks of the Allen Parish Sheriff's Office from patrol deputy to \ncriminal investigator. From the beginning he knew that law enforcement \nwas something he ``wanted to do,'' but later in life he would\n\n[[Page S1674]]\n\nlearn that it was something he ``had to do.'' For Hal, law enforcement \nwas about more than solving crimes; he recognized the role of the \ncommunity in deterring criminal activity. To foster that engagement, \nHal began mentoring youth as one of Louisiana's first Drug Abuse \nResistance Education--DARE--officers. To this day, that post remains a \nsource of great pride for him.\n  Hal's passion for law enforcement and service fueled participation on \nnumerous LSA boards as well as the Louisiana Commission on Law \nEnforcement and Administration of Criminal Justice. In 2001, Hal \nachieved the highest honor awarded to a Louisiana sheriff--president of \nthe LSA. Because of his effectiveness as a leader and continued \nadvocacy for the sheriffs, this part-time role soon became a full-time \nposition. Hal took the helm as executive director in 2004.\n  As executive director, Hal ensured that the LSA was prepared for the \nchallenges of the 21st century. Some of his initiatives included the \npromotion of the Sex Offenders Tracking Web-Site, establishing \nLouisiana as one of the first States to take advantage of this National \nPrecursor Log Exchange, NPLEx, and launching the Louisiana \nMethamphetamine Task Force, a project I was proud to help Hal \naccomplish.\n  During his tenure Hal and his sheriffs were tested in unprecedented \nways, but his dedication to agency coordination allowed the sheriffs to \nutilize their unique role as both law enforcement and first responders \nthroughout the State. This role was particular clear during both \nhurricanes Katrina and Rita. As my colleagues know, August 2005 saw the \nworst natural disaster in the gulf coast's history. For me, the \nresponse to these disasters revealed the depth of Hal's character. Even \nunder the most difficult of circumstances, he responded calmly, and \ncontinued to work for the people of Louisiana. Hal's unfailing support \nduring these disasters, and his efforts to coordinate with State and \nlocal law enforcement made our State's response measures as effective \nas those circumstances would permit.\n  I could go on and on about Hal: from his efforts during other \nhurricanes to his work during catastrophic oilspills in the Gulf of \nMexico. However, I know that I could never fully express what Hal has \ndone for the people of Louisiana. Hal will always be remembered as the \nreliable voice of fortitude for and on the behalf of the Louisiana \nsheriffs. We will surely miss him but can take great comfort knowing \nthat his wonderful wife Kathy and five grandchildren will be spending \nmore time with their ``Paw Paw.'' I wish my friend all the best in his \nretirement and thank him for his steadfast duty to our great \nState.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/15/senate-section/article/S1674-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1674]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:35 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 793.

A resolution adopted by the House of Representatives \n     of the State of Michigan urging the Congress of the United \n     States to take steps to insure that the Wall Street Reform \n     and Consumer Protection Act does not result in increased fees \n     on consumers at exempted institutions; to the Committee on \n     Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 21\n\n       Whereas, under certain provisions (section 1075) of the \n     Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Public Law \n     No. 111-203), the Federal Reserve Board is required to issue \n     regulations that would provide for reasonable interchange \n     transaction fees for electronic debit transactions and place \n     limitations on payment card network restrictions; and\n       Whereas, in drafting Section 1075, Congress included \n     language to exempt small issuers from this provision, \n     defining small institutions as those ``with less than $10 \n     billion in total assets.'' Small issuers rely on debit \n     interchange fees to provide free checking services to their \n     customers and to cover costs associated with fraud prevention \n     and data security. If these costs were not fully recoverable, \n     small issuers would be unable to offer debit services to \n     their customers, and the result could be decreased consumer \n     choice and higher fees. Because of these concerns, Congress \n     specifically exempted those institutions with less than $10 \n     billion in assets; and\n       Whereas, the Federal Reserve Board's current debit \n     interchange fee regulatory proposal (Docket No. R-1404) could \n     lead to the unintended consequences of increasing costs on \n     consumers and limiting consumer choice. The proposal does not \n     include any provision designed to enforce the carve-out for \n     small issuers. It is incumbent on Congress to revisit this \n     issue and help insure that these regulations do not \n     ultimately result in less choice and higher costs for \n     consumers: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we urge \n     Congress to stop or delay the implementation of Section 1075 \n     so that statutory changes can be made to ensure institutions \n     with less than $10 billion in assets are\n\n[[Page S1676]]\n\n     exempted without consequence in order to ensure Section 1075 \n     does not result in increased fees on consumers at exempted \n     institutions; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/15/senate-section/article/S1676-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1676]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXECUTIVE REPORTS OF COMMITTEE\n\n  The following executive reports of nominations were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. LEVIN for the Committee on Armed Services.\n       *Michael Vickers, of Virginia, to be Under Secretary of \n     Defense for Intelligence.\n       *Jo Ann Rooney, of Massachusetts, to be Principal Deputy \n     Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness.\n       Army nomination of Lt.

A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n1965 to improve standards for physical education; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the FIT Kids Act. \nThat first word, FIT, an acronym for Fitness Integrated with Teaching, \nan important concept that I am proud to promote today. The FIT Kids Act \nencourages schools to provide children with quality physical education \nin an effort to promote health and wellness throughout their lives.\n  Since the 1970s, the incidence of obesity has more than doubled for \npreschool children aged 2-5 years and for young people aged 12-19 \nyears; for children aged 6-11 years, it has more than tripled. Since \nthere are many reasons for this public health crisis, we know that \naddressing it will require multiple solutions. An important place we \ncan address childhood obesity is in our schools. The Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention has found that fewer than 10 percent of \nour public schools offer daily physical education for the entire school \nyear for all students. Let me repeat that, fewer than 10 percent. Our \nkids deserve better. Research has shown that physical education not \nonly promotes health and wellness, it also has a direct correlation \nwith kids' academic performance in school.\n  The FIT Kids Act would amend the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct to shine a light on the availability of quality physical education \nfor all public school children through grade 12, and to ensure they \nreceive important health and nutritional information. As Chairman of \nthe Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, I have been \nworking in a bipartisan way with my colleagues on the committee to \nreauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n  With the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct, we must fix the things that are not working, while protecting the \ngoals of the bill, including narrowing achievement gaps. It is truly \nalarming to see the discrepancies in achievement between children in \nthe United States and children abroad. Here in the U.S., despite making \nsome progress, we continue to have wide and persistent achievement gaps \nthat are leaving behind children of color, young people from \ndisadvantaged backgrounds, and children with disabilities.\n  In addition to achievement gaps, I am also concerned about the trends \nin physical education in schools across the Nation. Currently, schools \nare decreasing the amount of free play or physical activity that \nchildren engage in during school hours. Only about one-third of \nelementary children have daily physical education, and less than one-\nfifth have extracurricular physical activity programs at their schools. \nI know that difficult resource decisions have to be made but we cannot \nshort-change our children's health. This is short-sighted for two big \nreasons: One, we are fighting a childhood obesity epidemic of \nfrightening proportions. And, two, as research shows, and as any \nteacher or parent knows, kids have to have time to play and burn off \nenergy if they are going to be in a proper frame of mind to learn.\n  The association between physical activity and academic achievement is \nan important part of why we need to continue to support physical \neducation. Broad evidence suggests a positive relationship between \nphysical activity and grade point average, rate of learning, memory, \nattention span, and classroom behavior, as well as cognitive, social, \nand motor skill development. Research indicates that youth who report \nengaging in physical activity at school are 20 percent more likely than \ntheir less active peers to earn good grades in math or English. \nFurthermore, data suggests that children who are overweight have \ngreater risk for school absenteeism than their peers who are average \nweight. In order for our Nation's children to be successful students, \nwe must do all that we can to ensure they are in school and ready to \nlearn.\n  This legislation will ensure that parents receive critical \ninformation regarding the time and resources devoted to their children \nfor a quality physical education. Specifically, the bill will require \nschools, local educational agencies, and state educational agencies to \npublicly report on the quantity and quality of physical education \ncourses provided using nationally recognized guidelines and standards. \nThis will give parents the information they need to assess whether \ntheir children are receiving an appropriate physical education. \nFurthermore, the FIT Kids Act would give parents the tools necessary to \nencourage and support a healthy and active lifestyle, including \nincreased physical activity during and outside the school day, and \nnutritious eating habits both at home and at school.\n  In addition, the bill promotes professional development for teachers \nand school principals to promote healthy lifestyles and physical \nactivity through evidence-based curricula, and thereby boost students' \nability to learn more effectively. The bill also promotes physical \nactivity in after-school programs and amends the school counseling \nprogram to take into account both students' emotional wellbeing and \ntheir physical wellbeing.\n  Finally, this legislation authorizes research on the ways physical \nactivity can be incorporated into all aspects of the school day, the \nimpact of physical activity on students' readiness to learn, and the \nbest ways to measure student progress in increasing physical activity.\n  The FIT Kids Act shines a spotlight on children's health and how our \nschools can play a greater role in teaching our children healthy \nbehaviors. As we move forward in reauthorizing the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act, we cannot neglect the importance of proper \nphysical education. We know that sedentary lifestyles that begin in \nchildhood can lead to number of major chronic diseases that affect \ntheir health and wellbeing in adulthood. Accordingly, we owe it to \nAmerican students to teach them healthy behaviors and the importance of \nphysical activity, and how these lessons will benefit them throughout \ntheir lives. The FIT Kids Act provides the framework to accomplish \nthis. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 576\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Fitness Integrated with \n     Teaching Kids Act'' or the ``FIT Kids Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n\n[[Page S1679]]\n\n       (1) Childhood obesity has reached epidemic proportions in \n     the United States.\n       (2) Obesity-related diseases cost the United States economy \n     more than $117,000,000,000 every year.\n       (3) The prevalence of overweight in children between the \n     ages of 6 and 11 years increased from 4.0 percent in 1971-\n     1974 to 17.5 percent in 2001-2004, and the prevalence of \n     overweight in adolescents between the ages of 12 and 19 years \n     increased from 6.1 percent to 17.0 percent.\n       (4) More than 9,000,000 children and adolescents between \n     the ages of 6 and 19 years are considered overweight on the \n     basis of being in the 95th percentile or higher of BMI values \n     in the 2000 CDC growth chart for the United States.\n       (5) If children do not become more active and healthy, one-\n     third of all children born in 2000 or later will suffer from \n     diabetes at some point in their lives.\n       (6) Of all United States deaths from major chronic disease, \n     23 percent are linked to sedentary lifestyles that now begin \n     at childhood.\n       (7) Adolescents who are overweight have a 70-80 percent \n     chance of becoming overweight adults, increasing their risk \n     for chronic disease, disability, and death.\n       (8) A recent study showed that plaque build-up in the neck \n     arteries of children who are obese or those with high \n     cholesterol is similar to those levels seen in middle-aged \n     adults.\n       (9) A decline in physical activity has contributed to the \n     unprecedented epidemic of childhood obesity.\n       (10) The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans \n     recommend that children engage in 60 minutes or more of \n     physical activity each day.\n       (11) In a 2005 Government Accountability Office report on \n     key strategies to include in programs designed to target \n     childhood obesity, ``increasing physical activity'' was \n     identified as the most important component in any such \n     program.\n       (12) Part of the decline in physical activity has been in \n     our Nation's schools, where physical education programs have \n     been cut back in the past 2 decades.\n       (13) The national standard for physical education frequency \n     is 150 minutes per week in elementary school and 225 minutes \n     per week in middle school and high school.\n       (14) Only 3.8 percent of elementary school, 7.9 percent of \n     middle school, and 2.1 percent of high schools provide daily \n     physical education or its equivalent for the entire school \n     year, and 22 percent of schools do not require students to \n     take any physical education at all.\n       (15) Among children ages 9 to 13, 61.5 percent do not \n     participate in any organized physical activity during out-of-\n     school hours.\n       (16) Regular physical activity is associated with a \n     healthier, longer life and a lower risk of cardiovascular \n     disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, and some \n     cancers.\n       (17) Research suggests a strong correlation between \n     children's fitness and their academic performance as measured \n     by grades in core subjects and standardized test scores.\n       (18) Approximately 81 percent of adults believe daily \n     physical education should be mandatory in schools.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \npermit direct payment under the Medicare program for clinical social \nworker services provided to residents of skilled nursing facilities; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, in honor of World Social Work Day, I \nrise today to introduce the Dorothy I. Height and Whitney M. Young, Jr. \nSocial Work Reinvestment Act and the Clinical Social Work Medicare \nEquity Act of 2011. I am proud to introduce legislation that will \nreduce the shortage of social workers in our nation and properly \nreimburse social workers for the services they provide.\n  Social workers play a crucial role combating the social problems \nfacing our nation and are essential providers in our health care \nsystem. Our health care and social service needs have drastically \nincreased over the past decade and will continue to do so in the next \ndecade. We must have the workforce in place to make sure that our \nreturning soldiers have access to mental health services, our elderly \nmaintain their independence in the communities in which they live, and \nabused children are placed in safe homes. Social workers provide mental \nhealth therapy, caregiver and family counseling, health education, \nprogram coordination, and case management. In these tough economic \ntimes, social workers have an essential role in keeping communities \ntogether and helping individuals and families cope with the stresses \nthey are facing. Social workers are vital to America's social safety \nnet.\n  The Dorothy I. Height and Whitney M. Young, Jr. Social Work \nReinvestment Act provides grants to social workers, identifies \nworkforce challenges and resource needs, and determines how any \nworkforce shortage will affect the communities social workers serve. I \nam honored to introduce this bill named after two social visionaries, \nDorothy I. Height and Whitney M. Young. Dorothy Height, who passed away \nlast year, was a pioneer of the civil rights movement. Like me, she \nbegan her career as a case worker and continued to fight for social \njustice. Whitney Young, another trailblazer of the civil rights \nmovement, also began his career transforming our social landscape as a \nsocial worker. He helped create President Johnson's War on Poverty and \nhas served as President of the National Association of Social Workers.\n  This bill is about continued investment in social work. It provides \ngrants for social work education, research, and training. These grants \nwill fund community-based programs of excellence and provide \nscholarships to train the next generation of social workers. This bill \naddresses the recruitment and retention of social workers and will \nresult in a renewed focus on improving social worker workplace safety. \nAccording to the National Association of Social Workers, 44 percent of \nsocial workers surveyed have faced personal safety issues when on the \njob. In addition, this bill will help identify and disseminate \nevidence-based best practices in social work interventions. This bill \nalso establishes a national coordination center that will allow social \neducation, advocacy and research institutions to collaborate and work \ntogether. The coordination center will facilitate gathering and \ndistributing social work research to make the most effective use of the \ninformation we have on how social work service improves our social \nfabric. This bill also creates a media campaign that will promote \nsocial work. This bill gives social work the attention it deserves.\n  As a social worker, I understand the critical role social workers \nhave in the overall care of our populations. Social workers can be \nfound in every facet of community life--in hospitals, mental health \nclinics, senior centers, and private agencies that serve individuals \nand families in need. Social workers are there to help struggling \nstudents, returning soldiers, and the chronically ill. Oftentimes, \nsocials workers are the only available option for mental health care in \nrural and underserved urban areas. Yet there are not enough social \nworkers to meet these needs. By 2018, it is estimated an additional \n100,000 social workers will be needed. We need to get our workforce in \nplace today so that we can meet the needs of our population, \nparticularly our aging Americans. The first of the baby boomers turn 65 \nthis year. The aging tsunami will hit us. We must be prepared.\n  I believe that social work is full of great opportunities, both to \nserve and to lead. Social work is about putting our values into action. \nSocial workers are among our best and brightest, our most committed and \ncompassionate. They are at the frontlines of providing care, often \nputting themselves in dangerous and violent situations. Social workers \nhave the ability to provide psychological, emotional, and social \nsupport--quite simply, the ability to change lives. I think we can do \nbetter by our constituents including our servicemembers, seniors, and \nchildren. We must make sure we have the social workers in place to meet \ntheir needs. I'm fighting to make sure we do.\n  I also stand on the Senate floor today to introduce the Clinical \nSocial Work Medicare Equity Act of 2009. This bill ensures that \nclinical social workers receive Medicare reimbursement for the mental \nhealth services they provide in skilled nursing facilities. Under the \ncurrent system, social workers cannot\n\n[[Page S1681]]\n\nbill Medicare directly for the services they provide. Psychologists and \npsychiatrists, who provide similar counseling, are able to separately \nbill Medicare for their services.\n  Since my first days in Congress, I have been fighting to protect and \nstrengthen the safety of our Nation's seniors. Making sure that seniors \nhave access to quality, affordable mental health care is an important \npart of this fight. I know that millions of seniors do not have access \nto, or are not receiving, the mental health services they urgently \nneed. Five million seniors are affected by depression, yet few ever \nreceive treatment. According to the American Psychological Association, \n20 percent of people over the age of 55 have a mental health disorder \nand 2/3 of nursing home residents have a mental or behavioral health \nissue, but less than 3 percent receive treatment. These mental health \ndisorders, which include severe depression and debilitating anxiety, \ninterfere with a person's ability to carry out activities of daily \nliving and adversely affect their quality of life. Furthermore, older \npeople account for 20 percent of suicide deaths in the U.S., and white \nmen age 85 or older have the highest suicide rate of any age group. \nEvery year nearly 5,000 older Americans kill themselves. This is \nunacceptable and must be addressed.\n  This bill helps residents of skilled nursing facilities across the \ncountry get the mental health and psychosocial services they need. It \nensures that seniors living in underserved urban and rural areas, where \nclinical social workers are often the only available option for mental \nhealth care, continue to receive the treatment they need. Clinical \nsocial workers, much like psychologists and psychiatrists, diagnose and \ntreat mental illnesses. In fact, clinical social workers are the \nprimary mental health providers for nursing home residents and seniors \nresiding in rural environments. Unlike other mental health providers, \nclinical social workers cannot bill Medicare directly for the important \nservices they provide to their patients. Protecting seniors' access to \nclinical social workers ensures that our most vulnerable citizens get \nthe quality, affordable mental health care they need. This bill will \ncorrect this inequity and make sure clinical social workers get the \npayments and respect they deserve.\n  Before the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, clinical social workers \nbilled Medicare Part B directly for mental health services they \nprovided in nursing facilities for each patient they served. Under the \nProspective Payment System, services provided by clinical social \nworkers are lumped, or ``bundled,'' along with the services of other \nhealth care providers for the purposes of billing and payments. \nPsychologists and psychiatrists, who provide similar counseling, were \nexempted from this system and continue to bill Medicare directly. This \nbill would exempt clinical social workers, like their colleagues, from \nthe Prospective Payment System, and would make sure that clinical \nsocial workers are paid for the services they provide to patients in \nskilled nursing facilities.\n  This bill is about more than paperwork and payment procedures. This \nbill is about equal access to Medicare payments for the equal and \nimportant work done by clinical social workers. It is about making sure \nour nation's most vulnerable citizens have access to quality, \naffordable mental health care. The overarching goal we should be \nstriving to achieve for our seniors is an improved quality of life. \nWithout clinical social workers, many nursing home residents would \nnever get the counseling they need when faced with a life threatening \nillness or the loss of a loved one. I think we can do better by our \nnation's seniors. I am fighting to make sure we do.\n  As a social worker, I have been on the frontlines of helping people \ncope with issues in their everyday lives. I started off fighting for \nabused children, making sure they were placed in safe homes. I will \ncontinue to fight every day for our children, seniors, and families on \nthe floor of the United States Senate.\n  The Dorothy I. Height and Whitney M. Young, Jr. Social Work \nReinvestment Act and the Clinical Social Work Medicare Equity Act of \n2011 are both strongly supported by the National Association of Social \nWorkers. I also want to thank Senator Inouye for his cosponsorship of \nthe Clinical Social Work Medicare Equity Act of 2012 and thank Senator \nBegich, Senator Cardin, and Senator Inouye for their cosponsorship of \nthe Social Work Reinvestment Act. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to enact these two important pieces of legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mrs. McCaskill):\n  S. 586. A bill to amend the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 \nto apply whistleblower protections available to certain executive \nbranch employees to legislative branch employees, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill that will \nkeep the Federal Government accountable.\n  Whistleblowers are the key to unlocking the secrets of wrongdoing \nbecause they have access to information about how the frauds were \nperpetrated and can help lead authorities in the right direction to \nuncover the frauds. However, for their brave efforts, they are often \nthe victims of retaliation and are removed from their jobs by \nsupervisors who don't want the wrongdoing uncovered. I have often said \nwhistleblowers are as welcome as skunks at a Sunday picnic, despite the \nfact that all they do is bring forward the truth. This is wrong and \nthat is why I have supported strong whistleblower protection laws \nduring my time in Congress.\n  The landmark whistleblower law, the Whistleblower Protection Act of \n1989, WPA, provided rights and remedies to Executive Branch \nwhistleblowers that are the victims of retaliation. I proudly \ncosponsored the WPA, but like many laws that are 20 years old, it needs \nto be updated. So, I cosponsored legislation introduced by Senator \nAkaka in the previous Congress to do just that. We are currently \nworking to introduce similar legislation in this Congress. Despite this \neffort, there is still a critical gap in whistleblower protections for \ngovernment employees, namely the lack of whistleblower protections for \nemployees of the Legislative and Judicial branches of the Federal \nGovernment. I am here today to start that discussion and introduce \nlegislation that will provide the same whistleblower protection rights \ncurrently extended to Executive Branch employees to the Legislative \nBranch.\n  I am pleased to be joined by Senator McCaskill in introducing the \nCongressional Whistleblower Protection Act of 2011. This important \nlegislation simply adds whistleblower protections to the Legislative \nBranch by incorporating the WPA into the Congressional Accountability \nAct of 1995, a law I authored to bring Congress in line with many labor \nlaws and workplace protections. I have long believed Congress should \npractice what it preaches, and this legislation will do just that.\n  A theme that has dominated this new Congress, as well as the \nelections this past November, is accountability and responsibility in \nWashington. In most instances, the only reason we discover waste or \nfraud is because employees are brave enough to stand up to the \nwrongdoers and expose their offenses. Without these whistleblowers, the \nAmerican taxpayer would continue to foot the bill.\n  This bill is long overdue. I have previously introduced similar \nlegislation but, unfortunately, those bills were never brought up in \nCommittee. I hope that the Homeland Security and Government Affairs \nCommittee will examine this legislation closely and expeditiously \nreport it to the full Senate so we can ensure employees of the \nLegislative Branch that they are protected from any reprisals related \nto protected whistleblowing.\n  Now, it's been a number of years since the Congressional \nAccountability Act was signed into law by President Clinton, so I would \nlike to remind my colleagues why we passed this law. It was a time very \nsimilar to today, the American people were demanding more from their \nelected officials in Washington and wanted accountability and \ntransparency in all branches of Government. I believed then, as I do \nnow, that Congress needs to put its money where its mouth is and apply \nthe various labor and employment laws that we enforce on other branches \nof government\n\n[[Page S1682]]\n\nand businesses all across the country to ourselves. The Congressional \nAccountability Act did just that.\n  It applied a number of important laws to Congress, including, the \nFair Labor Standards Act, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act, the Age Discrimination and \nEmployment Act, the Family Medical Leave Act, the Occupational Safety \nand Health Act, the Employee Polygraph Protection Act, the Worker \nAdjustment and Retraining Notification Act, the Rehabilitation Act, as \nwell as some provisions of title 5 related to Federal service labor-\nmanagement relations. It also created the Office of Compliance in the \nLegislative Branch that oversees application of these important laws to \nthe Legislative Branch and ensures that employee's rights under these \nlaws are protected. While the Congressional Accountability Act was a \ngood start, the Office of Compliance has recommended additional laws be \napplied to the Legislative Branch, including the Whistleblower \nProtection Act.\n  We have already taken the steps to protect whistleblowers in the \nExecutive Branch. It doesn't make sense not to extend these same \nprotections to whistleblowers in our own backyard. This bill will, very \nsimply, give congressional employees the same protections that workers \nin the other branches of government already possess. It does this by \nsimply adding the Whistleblower Protection Act to the preexisting list \nof statutes that are applied to the Legislative Branch by the \nCongressional Accountability Act. This is a straightforward and simple \nsolution to ensure that employees of the Legislative Branch are not \nwithout vital whistleblower protections.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me and Senator McCaskill in supporting \nthis bill to ensure that those who help us in the fight to hold \ngovernment accountable are not punished for their efforts.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Ms. Murkowski) (by request):\n  S. 590. A bill to convey certain submerged lands to the Commonwealth \nof the North Mariana Islands in order to give that territory the same \nbenefits in its submerged lands as Guam, the Virgin Islands, and \nAmerican Samoa have in their submerged lands; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I join with my colleague and the \nRanking Member of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, Lisa \nMurkowski, in re-introducing, by request, legislation to convey certain \nsubmerged lands to the Commonwealth of the North Mariana Islands, CNMI, \nthat would give that territory the same benefits in its submerged lands \nas Guam, the Virgin Islands, and American Samoa have in their submerged \nlands.\n  This bill is identical to H.R. 934 that was considered in the 111th \nCongress and which passed the House on July 15, 2009 and was reported \nby the Committee on May 6, 2010. Enactment of this legislation is time-\nsensitive because there is currently no Federal or local administrative \nregime in place to manage the lands from the mean high-tide line out to \n3 miles surrounding the 14 islands of the CNMI. As a result, \ndevelopment and other near shore activities are on hold, or are \nconducted under a cloud of legal uncertainty.\n  I refer those interested in additional information on this proposal \nto Senate Report 111-197. Included in that report, is the CBO estimate \nwhich states that enacting H.R. 934 would not affect direct spending or \nrevenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures would not apply.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    Congress of the United States,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 14, 2011.\n     Hon.

The measure had received unanimous support \n     in the House. And it was included in Majority Leader Reid's \n     amendment to S. 303, the America's Great Outdoors Act, but \n     proceeded no further in the Senate.\n       I have now reintroduced the bill, exactly as reported by \n     the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, as H.R. 670 in \n     this Congress; and I would like to request that, as a \n     courtesy, you together introduce companion legislation in the \n     Senate.\n       For your ready reference a copy of H.R. 670 is attached.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                   Gregorio Kilili Camacho Sablan,\n     Member of Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/15/senate-section/article/S1682-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 102--CALLING FOR A NO-FLY ZONE AND THE RECOGNITION OF \n               THE TRANSITIONAL NATIONAL COUNCIL IN LIBYA\n\n  Mr. McCAIN submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Social Security is the most successful and reliable \n     social program in our Nation's history.\n       (2) For 75 years, through good times and bad, Social \n     Security has reliably kept millions of senior citizens, \n     individuals with disabilities, and children out of poverty.\n       (3) Before President Franklin Roosevelt signed the Social \n     Security Act into law on August 14, 1935, approximately half \n     of the senior citizens in the United States lived in poverty; \n     less than 10 percent of seniors live in poverty today.\n       (4) Social Security has succeeded in protecting working \n     Americans and their families from devastating drops in \n     household income due to lost wages resulting from retirement, \n     disability, or the death of a spouse or parent.\n       (5) More than 53,000,000 Americans receive Social Security \n     benefits, including 36,500,000 retirees and their spouses, \n     9,200,000 veterans, 8,200,000 disabled individuals and their \n     spouses, 4,500,000 surviving spouses of deceased workers, and \n     4,300,000 dependent children.\n       (6) Social Security has never contributed to the Federal \n     budget deficit or the national debt, and benefit cuts should \n     not be proposed as a solution to reducing the Federal budget \n     deficit.\n       (7) Social Security is not in a crisis or going bankrupt, \n     as the Social Security Trust Funds have been running \n     surpluses for the last quarter of a century.\n       (8) According to the Social Security Administration, the \n     Social Security Trust Funds currently maintain a \n     $2,600,000,000,000 surplus that is project to grow to \n     $4,200,000,000,000 by 2023.\n       (9) According to the Social Security Administration, even \n     if no changes are made to the Social Security program, full \n     benefits will be available to every recipient until 2037, \n     with enough funding remaining after that date to pay about 78 \n     percent of promised benefits.\n       (10) According to the Social Security Administration, \n     ``money flowing into the [Social Security] trust funds is \n     invested in U.S. Government securities . . . the investments \n     held by the trust funds are backed by the full faith and \n     credit of the U.S. Government. The Government has always \n     repaid Social Security, with interest.''.\n       (11) All workers who contribute into Social Security \n     through the 12.4 percent payroll tax, which is divided \n     equally between employees and employers on income up to \n     $106,800, deserve to have a dignified and secure retirement.\n       (12) Social Security provides the majority of income for \n     two-thirds of the elderly population in the United States, \n     with approximately one-third of elderly individuals receiving \n     nearly all of their income from Social Security.\n       (13) Overall, Social Security benefits for retirees \n     currently average a modest $14,000 a year, with the average \n     for women receiving benefits being less than $12,000 per \n     year.\n       (14) Nearly 1 out of every 4 adult Social Security \n     beneficiaries has served in the United States military.\n       (15) Social Security is not solely a retirement program, as \n     it also serves as a disability insurance program for American \n     workers who become permanently disabled and unable to work.\n       (16) The Social Security Disability Insurance program is a \n     critical lifeline for millions of American workers, as a 20-\n     year-old worker faces a 30 percent chance of becoming \n     disabled before reaching retirement age.\n       (17) Proposals to privatize the Social Security program \n     would jeopardize the security of millions of Americans by \n     subjecting them to the ups-and-downs of the volatile stock \n     market as the source of their retirement benefits.\n       (18) Raising the retirement age would jeopardize the \n     retirement future of millions of American workers, \n     particularly those in physically demanding jobs as well as \n     lower-income women, African-Americans, and Latinos, all of \n     whom have a much lower life expectancy than wealthier \n     Americans.\n       (19) Social Security benefits have already been cut by 13 \n     percent, as the Normal Retirement Age was raised in 1983 from \n     65 years of age to 67 years of age by 2022.\n       (20) According to the Social Security Administration, \n     raising the retirement age for future retirees would reduce \n     benefits by 6 to 7 percent for each year that the Normal \n     Retirement Age is raised.\n       (21) Reducing cost-of-living adjustments for current or \n     future Social Security beneficiaries would force millions of \n     such individuals to choose between heating their homes, \n     putting food on the table, or paying for their prescription \n     drugs.\n       (22) Social Security is a promise that this Nation cannot \n     afford to break.\n\n     SEC. 603.

Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. Coburn) submitted an amendment \nintended to be proposed by her to the bill S. 493, to reauthorize and \nimprove the SBIR and STTR programs, and for other purposes; which was \nordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n              TITLE __--SMALL BUSINESS REGULATORY FREEDOM\n\n     SEC. _01. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Small Business Regulatory \n     Freedom Act of 2011''.\n\n     SEC. _02. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) A vibrant and growing small business sector is critical \n     to the recovery of the economy of the United States.\n       (2) Regulations designed for application to large-scale \n     entities have been applied uniformly to small businesses and \n     other small entities, sometimes inhibiting the ability of \n     small entities to create new jobs.\n       (3) Uniform Federal regulatory and reporting requirements \n     in many instances have imposed on small businesses and other \n     small entities unnecessary and disproportionately burdensome \n     demands, including legal, accounting, and consulting costs, \n     thereby threatening the viability of small entities and the \n     ability of small entities to compete and create new jobs in a \n     global marketplace.\n       (4) Since 1980, Federal agencies have been required to \n     recognize and take account of the differences in the scale \n     and resources of regulated entities, but in many instances \n     have failed to do so.\n       (5) In 2009, there were nearly 70,000 pages in the Federal \n     Register, and, according to research by the Office of \n     Advocacy of the Small Business Administration, the annual \n     cost of Federal regulations totals $1,750,000,000,000. Small \n     firms bear a disproportionate burden, paying approximately 36 \n     percent more per employee than larger firms in annual \n     regulatory compliance costs.\n       (6) All agencies in the Federal Government should fully \n     consider the costs, including indirect economic impacts and \n     the potential for job creation and job loss, of proposed \n     rules, periodically review existing regulations to determine \n     their impact on small entities, and repeal regulations that \n     are unnecessarily duplicative or have outlived their stated \n     purpose.\n       (7) It is the intention of Congress to amend chapter 6 of \n     title 5, United States Code, to ensure that all impacts, \n     including foreseeable indirect effects, of proposed and final \n     rules are considered by agencies during the rulemaking \n     process and that the agencies assess a full range of \n     alternatives that will limit adverse economic consequences, \n     enhance economic benefits, and fully address potential job \n     creation or job loss.\n\n     SEC. _03. INCLUDING INDIRECT ECONOMIC IMPACT IN SMALL ENTITY \n                   ANALYSES.\n\n       Section 601 of title 5, United States Code, is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(9) the term `economic impact' means, with respect to a \n     proposed or final rule--\n       ``(A) any direct economic effect of the rule on small \n     entities; and\n       ``(B) any indirect economic effect on small entities, \n     including potential job creation or job loss, that is \n     reasonably foreseeable and that results from the rule, \n     without regard to whether small entities are directly \n     regulated by the rule.''.\n\n     SEC. _04. JUDICIAL REVIEW TO ALLOW SMALL ENTITIES TO \n                   CHALLENGE PROPOSED REGULATIONS.\n\n       Section 611(a) of title 5, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (1), by inserting ``603,'' after ``601,'';\n       (2) in paragraph (2), by inserting ``603,'' after ``601,'';\n       (3) by striking paragraph (3) and inserting the following:\n       ``(3) A small entity may seek such review during the 1-year \n     period beginning on the date of final agency action, except \n     that--\n       ``(A) if a provision of law requires that an action \n     challenging a final agency action be commenced before the \n     expiration of 1 year, the lesser period shall apply to an \n     action for judicial review under this section; and\n       ``(B) in the case of noncompliance with section 603 or \n     605(b), a small entity may seek judicial review of agency \n     compliance with such section before the close of the public \n     comment period.''; and\n       (4) in paragraph (4)--\n\n[[Page S1702]]\n\n       (A) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``, and'' and \n     inserting a semicolon;\n       (B) in subparagraph (B), by striking the period and \n     inserting ``; or''; and\n       (C) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(C) issuing an injunction prohibiting an agency from \n     taking any agency action with respect to a rulemaking until \n     that agency is in compliance with the requirements of section \n     603 or 605.''.\n\n     SEC. _05.

Colonel Qaddafi needs to \n     step down from power and leave''.\n       (9) On March 10, 2011, the Director of National \n     Intelligence testified before Congress that, because of \n     Qaddafi's superior military resources, including airpower, \n     and in the absence of outside assistance to the opposition, \n     ``I think [over] the long term that the [Qaddafi] regime will \n     prevail.''\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--The Senate--\n       (1) applauds the bravery of the Libyan people, who are \n     fighting to secure their universal rights against the violent \n     dictatorship of Muammar Qaddafi;\n       (2) condemns Muammar Qaddafi, and the forces loyal to him, \n     for using overwhelming and indiscriminate violence, including \n     the use of airpower and foreign mercenaries, against peaceful \n     demonstrators and civilians, which has resulted in gross \n     human rights abuses, grave loss of innocent life, and \n     potentially crimes against humanity;\n       (3) strongly welcomes the calls for imposing a ``no-fly \n     zone'' in Libya made by the Arab League, the Gulf Cooperation \n     Council, and the Organization of the Islamic Conference;\n       (4) reiterates that it is the policy of the United States, \n     as stated by President Obama, that Colonel Qaddafi must step \n     down and leave power; and\n       (5) calls on the President--\n       (A) to recognize the Libyan Transitional National Council, \n     based in Benghazi but representative of Libyan communities \n     across the country, as the sole legitimate governing \n     authority in Libya;\n       (B) to take immediate steps to implement a ``no-fly zone'' \n     in Libya with international support; and\n       (C) to develop and implement a comprehensive strategy to \n     achieve the stated United States policy objective of Qaddafi \n     leaving power.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 214.
