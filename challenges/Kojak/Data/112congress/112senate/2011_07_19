Madam President, today Members of the House of \nRepresentatives will have a chance to stand up and be counted. They \nwill show with their votes whether they believe in freezing \nWashington's current spending habits in place and raising job-killing \ntaxes or whether they believe, as I do, that the reckless spending and \ndebt of the past 2 years has brought us to this point of crisis, and \nthat something serious must be done to rein it in without damaging a \nfragile economy with job-killing taxes.\n  Frankly, it is that simple. Those who support cut, cap, and balance \nthat the House takes up today will be voting for getting our fiscal \nhouse in order and against an unsustainable status quo. Those of us who \nhave been calling for serious short- and long-term action to cut \nspending, rein in our debt, and preserve entitlements congratulate \nthose who support it.\n  We look forward to voting on the same legislation here in the Senate \nsoon. Before we do, it is important to remember how far we have come in \nthis debate. A few months ago, the President's primary goal was to \nraise the debt limit without any spending cuts or long-term fiscal \nreforms at all--nothing but more debt. Now he is claiming not only to \nsupport cuts but a proposal he likes to call ``a big deal.'' Anyone who \nhas looked at the figures knows it is not. But the larger point here is \nthat the American people have already won this debate. No one, not even \nthe President, can claim to support the status quo anymore, even when, \nin fact, he does.\n  But, of course, winning the debate is not nearly as important as \nachieving the reforms that are needed to convince the world we are \nactually serious about getting our fiscal house in order. That is why \nRepublicans continue to hold out for significant reforms, and that is \nwhy we will continue to fight\n\n[[Page S4648]]\n\nfor serious, long-term reforms this week.\n  Republicans have tried to persuade the President of the need for a \nserious course correction, but weeks of negotiations have shown that \nhis commitment to big government is simply too great to lead to the \nkind of long-term reforms we need to put us on a path to both balance \nand economic growth. So we have decided to bring our case to the \nAmerican people. The President recently cited a poll that suggests \nAmericans want to see balance in this debate. I would point him to \nanother poll showing nearly two out of three Americans want a balanced \nbudget. That is what Republicans are fighting for.\n  Today, Republicans in the House will vote on legislation that cuts \ngovernment spending now, caps it in the future to the average of the \nlast 40 years, and which will only allow for a raising of the debt \nlimit if it is accompanied by a constitutional amendment to balance the \nFederal budget. Cut, cap, and balance is the kind of tough legislation \nWashington needs and that Americans want, and Republicans will spend \nthe week trying to convince Democrats to join us in supporting it.\n  Every single Republican in the Senate supports a balanced budget \namendment. All we need is 20 Democrats to join us in supporting this \ncommonsense legislation. At least 23 of our friends on the other side \nhave said or suggested they support the idea and told their \nconstituents that they will ``lead'' on the issue. We think they should \nhave an opportunity to follow through on their statements with an \nactual vote.\n  I will repeat what I said yesterday to my Democratic friends. If I \nwere you, I would take a long look at the cut, cap, and balance \nlegislation the House is taking up today and ask yourself the following \nquestion: Are you so committed to the status quo that you will vote \n``no'' on a bill to balance the Federal budget?\n  I strongly urge my Democratic friends to join us in supporting the \ncut, cap, and balance plan. The American people sent us here to make \ntough choices. Agreeing to balance the budget should not be one of \nthem. This should be an easy one. I urge my colleagues in the strongest \npossible terms to join us. It is time to balance the books.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/19/senate-section/article/S4648-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4648-S4649]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CUT, CAP, AND BALANCE ACT\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, today the House will consider legislation \nthat would force the Nation to default on our financial obligations for \nthe first time in history, unless Congress adopts a new--well, let's \nput it this way: What the House is working on today would force the \nNation to default on our financial obligations for the first time in \nhistory. They are going to do it with a radical--radical--new \nconstitutional amendment.\n  That amendment would impose arbitrary, reckless budget caps. It \nwould, without a doubt, force massive cuts to Medicare, Social \nSecurity, and other crucial benefits. At the same time, it would \nconstitutionally protect wasteful loopholes and tax breaks for \nmillionaires and billionaires.\n  To meet an arbitrary spending cap frozen at 18 percent of gross \ndomestic product, it would shrink benefits and services back to the \nlevels not seen since 1966. In 1966, Medicare was 1 year old, and there \nwere 100 million fewer people in this country. In 1966, the country had \n200 million people. We now have 300 million people, and they would take \nus back to the levels then. It is obvious it simply would not work.\n  For those who think rewinding 45 years is a good thing, consider how \nmuch America has changed since 1966. For example, life expectancy is 9 \nyears longer today than it was 45 years ago. One reason it is longer is \nbecause of Medicare. Medicare has made people healthier to live longer \nand lead more productive lives.\n  This legislation would roll back the progress that has been brought \nabout by these programs but especially Medicare. It would enshrine in \nthis thing they are trying to do in the House today a set of priorities \nso backward even advisers to President Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush \nhave called it unwise.\n  In the first decade alone, it would mean more than $3,000 a year in \ncuts to each senior's Social Security check. It would slash our social \nsafety net, decimating Medicaid and cutting Medicare benefits by $2,500 \nfor every senior. This is per year, every year.\n  In fact, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says that within \n25 years, it will slash government benefits and services in half. \nEveryone within the sound of my voice hear what I am saying: slash \nbenefits in half--veterans, Medicare, Medicaid. Seventy percent of the \npeople on Medicaid are in convalescent centers. It is obvious there \nwould not be people in convalescent centers. They would be at home \nhaving their sons, daughters, wives, and others trying to take care of \nthem in their so-called golden years, which would come to a screeching \nhalt.\n\n  When I talk about slashing benefits in half, I am talking about \nSocial Security, Medicare, Medicaid, veterans' benefits, and every \nother government service, no matter how essential. Yet it would make it \nalmost impossible to end even the most wasteful tax breaks and \nloopholes already in place, such as the subsidies to oil companies, \nwhich are making market profits with subsidies from American taxpayers. \nIt would allow benefits to go to corporations that are shipping jobs \noverseas and to rich people who buy yachts and private jets. If I were \nrich, I wouldn't buy a yacht. It would be nice to have an airplane \nthough. But this will not stop people from buying airplanes. It will \nallow the tax program to treat the rich people similar to everybody \nelse. It would require a two-thirds majority in the House--if the House \nissue prevails, it would require a two-thirds majority in both Houses \nof Congress to raise even a penny of new revenue.\n  Meanwhile, the so-called cut, cap, and balance does absolutely \nnothing to protect our economy from the kind of recession from which we \nare beginning to recover. In fact, if the economy wasn't already in a \nrecession, this legislation would quickly produce one.\n  Bruce Bartlett, an economic adviser to President Reagan, a fine man, \nand a Treasury official under President Bush, said the kind of rapid \nspending cuts called for in this House legislation would \n``unquestionably throw the economy into a recession.''\n  This legislation goes beyond the Draconian budget Republicans passed \nearlier this year. That budget would have ended Medicare as we know it, \nand it would have cut clean energy by 70 percent, axed education \nfunding, and cost hundreds of thousands of private sector jobs. It \npassed the House, but it didn't pass here.\n  What they are trying to do is even more Draconian than the so-called \nRyan budget, the House-passed budget. They are trying to do something \nworse. It would attack all the same programs, but its cuts would be \ndeeper and deeper. It would slash Social Security as well, which the \nHouse budget didn't have in it.\n  This legislation they are debating in the House is so restrictive, \nthe Republicans' own budget--the budget they passed earlier this year--\nwould not meet the standards they are now asking to be passed. It is so \nrestrictive, not 1 year of either the George W. Bush or Ronald Reagan \nadministrations would meet its standards.\n  Of the last 30 years, the only 2 years that would make the cut were \nduring the Clinton administration. As the Washington Post said:\n\n       Every single Senate Republican has endorsed a \n     constitutional amendment that would've made Ronald Reagan's \n     fiscal policy unconstitutional. That's how far to the right \n     the modern GOP has swung.\n\n  Bruce Bartlett--we talked about him before--said this about the \nlegislation:\n\n       This is quite possibly the stupidest constitutional \n     amendment I think I have ever seen.\n\n  I repeat the direct quote:\n\n       This is quite possibly the stupidest constitutional \n     amendment I think I have ever seen. It looks as if it was \n     drafted by a couple of interns on the back of a napkin.\n\n  That, in my opinion, is being awfully hard on interns.\n\n[[Page S4649]]\n\n  Bill Hoagland was on this floor working with us, and he is a fine \nman, a close adviser to Senator Domenici and other Republican Senators. \nI worked with him on the floor trying to get bills passed. He is a fine \nman--a Republican first, wanting to get things done for our country \nsecond. Bill Hoagland was a Republican budget adviser for a quarter \ncentury. He described it best when he labeled this legislation a \n``misleading political cheap shot.''\n  A balanced budget is something we can all get behind. But this \nlegislation isn't about balancing the budget; it is about scoring \npolitical points. Based on 30 years of evidence and the Republicans' \nown measuring stick, the stunt falls flat.\n  After all, who do you think helped President Clinton balance the \nbudget during the only 2 years of the last 30 that actually lived up to \nthe restrictive rules outlined in this legislation? It was Democrats in \nCongress.\n  Today, Democrats are trying to rein in spending again and are trying \nto avert a catastrophic default on our Nation's financial obligations. \nRepublicans are the ones standing in the way of a deal to avert \ndefault, refusing to move an inch, despite our offers to cut trillions \nfrom the deficit.\n  It is not just me. Read today's Washington Post and see again what \nDavid Brooks says. David Brooks is a card-carrying Republican \nconservative. Read what he says. As the conservative columnist Ross \nDouthat wrote in the New York Times yesterday, we can already be on the \nway to a deal if ``more Republicans had only recognized that sometimes \na well-chosen concession can be the better part of valor.''\n  We are arriving at a point, 2 weeks from today, when we will default \non the debt. I have not heard a Republican leader--and I have my friend \non the floor today from our sister State of Arizona. He always has said \nthere will not be a default on the debt. Senator McConnell, Speaker \nBoehner, and Majority Leader Cantor have all said that.\n  The proof is in the pudding. We have 2 weeks to prove they are right.\n  Would the Chair announce morning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/19/senate-section/article/S4649-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4649]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, first, let me reassure my friend and \ncolleague, the leader of the Senate, that it is our view that the debt \nceiling will be extended, and Leader McConnell wanted to make that \ncrystal clear in his discussions with Leader Reid, so the two of them \ncould work together on a plan that the Senate could pass and send over \nto the House, to ensure that our debt ceiling would be increased and, \nthus, assure the markets they need not be concerned about that fact. As \nI have said many times, Republicans are not going to be the ones who \nwould throw us into default.\n  Yesterday, I spoke on the floor about the reason Republicans are \nopposed to raising taxes. The President himself, last December, said \nraising taxes in a time of economic downturn would be a mistake, the \nwrong thing to do. We are still in that economic downturn. In fact, \nthings are worse now than they were then. It is similar to a doctor \ntreating a patient. When we diagnose what is wrong, we deal with what \nis wrong. We don't try to fix something else. Our problem is spending; \nit is not taxes. That is why we need to focus on spending rather than \ntaxes. At the conclusion of my remarks, I will ask unanimous consent to \nput an op-ed from the Wall Street Journal into the Record. It is \nwritten by Michael Boskin, who makes the point very clearly that our \nproblem is spending, not taxes, and that we should be focused on \nreducing spending growth, especially in entitlements. He is a professor \nof economics at Stanford University and senior fellow at the Hoover \nInstitution and he chaired the Council of Economic Advisers for the \nfirst President Bush. I will refer to that in a moment.\n  Yesterday, I said there were three reasons why Republicans were not \nwilling to raise taxes at this time. The first was that the problem, as \nI said, is spending, not taxes. Spending has increased under President \nObama from 20 percent of GDP--the historic average--to 25 percent in \njust 3 years. That has been the reason we have had a deficit of $l.5 \ntrillion each of those years, and we will see deficits in that order of \nmagnitude for as far as the eye can see.\n\n  The second reason not to raise taxes is that when we talk about whom \nthe taxes actually apply to, it turns out they don't just apply to \nmillionaires and billionaires. I pointed out that there were 319,000 \nhouseholds that reported over $1 million in income tax. Again, that is \n319,000. But the tax the President is talking about would apply to 3.6 \nmillion taxpayers--more than 10 times that many. So the point is, \nfrequently, Democrats like to aim at the rich--the so-called \nmillionaires and billionaires--and they end up hitting a whole lot of \nother folks who aren't in that category of millionaire and billionaire. \nIt has happened before with the alternative minimum tax, which was \noriginally to apply to 125 people, I think, and now it hits between 20 \nmillion and 30 million households. That is the second reason.\n  I might add, by the way, my friend, the majority leader, said a \nmoment ago there is nothing wrong with taxing yachts or airplanes and \nthat he would, in fact, rather have an airplane than a yacht. I \nremember the experience we had with that. We were going to hit the \nmillionaires. In 1990, we raised the tax on yachts and other luxury \nitems. All the people who made boats in Maine, Massachusetts, and other \nStates lost their jobs. I think it was something over 9,000 jobs that \nwere lost in the boat building industry. Congress quickly repealed \nthat. Within 3 years, we had to repeal that big luxury tax. We weren't \nhitting millionaires and billionaires; we were hitting the people who \nactually made the yachts.\n  Right after 9/11, Congress passed an accelerated depreciation \nprovision for the general aviation industry. The idea there was to make \nsure 9/11 didn't hit that industry too hard and jobs would be saved. In \nthe President's stimulus bill, that accelerated depreciation provision \nfor business jets was reauthorized. That is the thing we are talking \nabout here, when we talk about business jets.\n  The President has said business jets should not receive that kind of \ntax treatment. The people who he said would be benefited by the \nstimulus package with jobs created or saved are the people who will \nlose their jobs if that particular tax treatment is taken away.\n  Maybe we should look at that. I am not against looking at that tax \ntreatment. If we should look at it and decide it is not appropriate, \nmaybe people will lose their jobs, but we may want to get rid of it; we \nshould use whatever reduction there is in that to create lower rates \nfor corporations across the board, as the President indicated, because \nthen we can be more competitive with corporations abroad that have much \nlower corporate tax rates than the United States.\n  That gets me to the third reason we should not raise tax rates: \nbecause it will kill jobs, hurt the economy. If we want to put people \nback to work, we cannot impose more regulatory or tax burdens on the \nvery businesses that create the jobs. Two-thirds of the jobs coming out \nof a recession are created by small businesses. Fifty percent of the \nincome of the small businesses is reported in these top two income tax \nbrackets that would be affected by the President's proposal to raise \ntaxes. They would be hit by this and, as a result, they would not hire \nas many people.\n  There are a couple items from today's paper that I will use to \nillustrate the point. From the Phoenix Business Journal, it says: \n``U.S. small businesses out of gas on job creation.'' They point out:\n\n\n[[Page S4650]]\n\n\n       Small-business owners continue to be pessimistic about the \n     economy. . . . New jobs are not to be found on Main Street . \n     . . Economic uncertainty was cited as the biggest obstacle to \n     hiring. . . .\n\n  One of America's more colorful entrepreneurs, Steve Wynn, in Nevada, \nwho is one of the majority leader's constituents, a self-described \nDemocrat, says that ``this administration is the greatest wet blanket \nto business and progress and job creation in my lifetime.'' He says in \nhis report to his company shareholders on the company's quarterly \nconference call that ``my customers and the companies that provide the \nvitality for the hospitality and restaurant industry in the United \nStates of America, they are frightened of this administration, and it \nmakes you slow down and not invest your money.'' He goes on.\n  I have talked to Mr. Wynn. He is very concerned about the regulatory \nand tax burdens being imposed upon not just his industry but across the \nboard. That is what is inhibiting economic growth.\n  One of the taxes proposed by the administration was evaluated by this \nadministration's Small Business Administration, the Office of Advocacy \nof the SBA. They said:\n\n       It could ultimately force many small businesses to close.\n\n  Why would the administration propose a tax increase on, in this case, \nretailers and manufacturers, primarily, that could ultimately force \nsmall businesses to close, according to the administration's own SBA? \nIt doesn't make sense.\n  For all three reasons, we should not be raising taxes. The President \nwas right last December, and the reason is because spending is the \nproblem, not taxes; that we end up aiming at the millionaires and \nbillionaires, but we hit a broader swathe of our economy; and, third, \nbecause it would kill job creation and inhibit economic growth to \nenable us to get out of this recession.\n  The final point I would make here relates to that. It is the Wall \nStreet Journal op-ed of July 18 by Michael Boskin.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord this op-ed piece at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KYL. The point he makes here--and I will quote a couple of \npoints--is regarding the President's demand that we raise taxes, and he \nsays, ``His timing couldn't be worse.'' Let me quote from this.\n\n       Two problems arise when marginal tax rates are raised. \n     First, as college students learn in Econ 101, higher marginal \n     rates cause real economic harm. The combined marginal rate \n     from all taxes is a vital metric, since it heavily influences \n     incentives in the economy--workers and employers, savers and \n     investors base decisions on after-tax returns. Thus tax rates \n     need to be kept as low as possible, on the broadest possible \n     base, consistent with financing necessary government \n     spending.\n\n  The second point he makes is that as tax rates rise, the tax base \nshrinks, and ultimately you have a much smaller group of people paying \nat those very highest levels. He goes on to point out some examples of \nsomebody in the upper brackets in the State of California, which is a \nhigh-tax State. When you add in the California taxes, the payroll taxes \nto fund ObamaCare, ultimately the President's idea of uncapping Social \nSecurity payroll taxes, the combined marginal rates would rise to a \nstunning 58.4 percent. Then, if you added in the requirements to pay \nfor the additional costs of the excess spending the administration has \nproposed, the taxes could drive the combined marginal rate to more than \n70 percent by 2035 and 80 percent by 2050. I mean, there is a point at \nwhich people will stop working for that next marginal dollar because \nmost of it goes to Uncle Sam.\n  He also takes the example of a teacher in California earning $60,000, \nand when you add in all those other things, the marginal rate goes to \nan astounding 71 percent. He says:\n\n       At the margin, virtually everyone would be working \n     primarily for the government, reduced to a minority partner \n     in their own labor.\n\n  I will quote one of his conclusions and then conclude.\n\n       Higher tax rates are the major reason why European per-\n     capita income, according to the Organization for Economic \n     Cooperation and Development, is about 30 percent lower than \n     in the United States.\n\n  The point is that imposing more taxes on the economy not only \ninhibits job creation, but it reduces productivity because Americans \nstop working that extra hour or that extra day since most of what they \nearn is going to be given to Uncle Sam. That is part of the problem and \none of the reasons the European standard of living is 30 percent lower \nthan here in the United States. Do we want to get to where Europe is? I \nthink the answer is no.\n  So we have to deal with extending the debt ceiling. We should try to \nreduce spending so that we don't have this future cloud hanging over \nour head and, frankly, to prevent having to come back to increasing the \ndebt limit every few months or years. But the way to do that is not by \nraising taxes, which will not raise the revenues--it will inhibit \neconomic growth--but, rather, by focusing on the real problem, which is \nspending, which has increased from 20 to 25 percent of GDP in just 3 \nyears, and getting spending under control.\n  I mentioned yesterday, for example, that the President had taken a \nlot of things off the table. My friend the majority leader said a \nmoment ago that the President has decided he is willing to compromise \nabout reducing spending. I don't think he is. I have been sitting in on \nthose negotiations. I haven't seen that.\n  We proposed three things--just three things--that wouldn't touch \nbeneficiaries: Medicare, Medicaid, and uninsured benefits going to \npeople who aren't supposed to get them, or overpayments. You can save \nover $100 billion a year by simply not paying people what the law says \nthey shouldn't receive, just stopping the overpayments, or paying \npeople who aren't eligible for one of those three services. You are not \ntouching anybody who is currently eligible for Medicare, Medicaid, or \nuninsured benefits. You are not touching them. They receive their full \nbenefits. But let's simply watch out for taxpayer dollars.\n  The problem is, it is like renting a car. Has anybody here ever \nwashed a rental car? When you rent a car and you go home, is washing it \nthe first thing you do? If it gets a little dirty, do you wash it \nbefore you turn it back in? No. This is someone else's money, and \npeople aren't watching it. It is taxpayer money that is now \nadministered by the Federal Government through Medicare, Medicaid, and \nunemployed insurance, and the reality is that people aren't trying to \nstop the waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  All that is taken off the table. No, the administration says, we \ndon't want to talk about that because we don't want people who receive \nthose benefits to have to sacrifice. Well, the people who are receiving \nthe benefits aren't sacrificing. The taxpayers are the ones who are \nsacrificing by contributing money to the government that is then \nwasting.\n  There is plenty of reform out there to stop wasteful Washington \nspending. If the administration would be willing to do those things, \nthen I think we could find enough savings so that we wouldn't have to \neven be talking about tax increases, which for the three reasons I \nmentioned are so harmful to our society, to our families, to our \nbusinesses, and to our economy.\n  So I hope we will continue this debate on the so-called cut, cap, and \nbalance legislation that does require cutting spending, constraining it \nover time, and ensuring that over the long term--over the next 5, 10, \n15, 20 years--these savings don't all evaporate because we go back to \nour big spending ways. At least a balanced budget amendment would \nprevent us from doing that. So I fully support the legislation that \nwill be brought forward. I presume it will pass the House of \nRepresentatives this evening, and I am looking forward to the debate \nhere in the Senate so that we can try to adopt that same legislation.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, July 18, 2011]\n\n                 Get Ready for a 70% Marginal Tax Rate\n\n                         (By Michael J. Boskin)\n\n       President Obama has been using the debt-ceiling debate and \n     bipartisan calls for deficit reduction to demand higher \n     taxes. With unemployment stuck at 9.2% and a vigorous \n     economic ``recovery'' appearing more and more elusive, his \n     timing couldn't be worse.\n\n[[Page S4651]]\n\n       Two problems arise when marginal tax rates are raised. \n     First, as college students learn in Econ 101, higher marginal \n     rates cause real economic harm. The combined marginal rate \n     from all taxes is a vital metric, since it heavily influences \n     incentives in the economy--workers and employers, savers and \n     investors base decisions on after-tax returns. Thus tax rates \n     need to be kept as low as possible, on the broadest possible \n     base, consistent with financing necessary government \n     spending.\n       Second, as tax rates rise, the tax base shrinks and \n     ultimately, as Art Laffer has long argued, tax rates can \n     become so prohibitive that raising them further reduces \n     revenue--not to mention damaging the economy. That is where \n     U.S. tax rates are headed if we do not control spending soon.\n       The current top federal rate of 35% is scheduled to rise to \n     39.6% in 2013 (plus one-to-two points from the phaseout of \n     itemized deductions for singles making above $200,000 and \n     couples earning above $250,000). The payroll tax is 12.4% for \n     Social Security (capped at $106,000), and 2.9% for Medicare \n     (no income cap). While the payroll tax is theoretically split \n     between employers and employees, the employers' share is \n     ultimately shifted to workers in the form of lower wages.\n       But there are also state income taxes that need to be kept \n     in mind. They contribute to the burden. The top state \n     personal rate in California, for example, is now about 10.5%. \n     Thus the marginal tax rate paid on wages combining all these \n     taxes is 44.1%. (This is a net figure because state income \n     taxes paid are deducted from federal income.)\n       So, for a family in high-cost California taxed at the top \n     federal rate, the expiration of the Bush tax cuts in 2013, \n     the 0.9% increase in payroll taxes to fund ObamaCare, and the \n     president's proposal to eventually uncap Social Security \n     payroll taxes would lift its combined marginal tax rate to a \n     stunning 58.4%.\n       But wait, things get worse. As Milton Friedman taught \n     decades ago, the true burden on taxpayers today is government \n     spending; government borrowing requires future interest \n     payments out of future taxes. To cover the Congressional \n     Budget Office projection of Mr. Obama's $841 billion deficit \n     in 2016 requires a 31.7% increase in all income tax rates \n     (and that's assuming the Social Security income cap is \n     removed). This raises the top rate to 52.2% and brings the \n     total combined marginal tax rate to 68.8%. Government, in \n     short, would take over two-thirds of any incremental earning.\n       Many Democrats demand no changes to Social Security and \n     Medicare spending. But these programs are projected to run \n     ever-growing deficits totaling tens of trillions of dollars \n     in coming decades, primarily from rising real benefits per \n     beneficiary. To cover these projected deficits would require \n     continually higher income and payroll taxes for Social \n     Security and Medicare on all taxpayers that would drive the \n     combined marginal tax rate on labor income to more than 70% \n     by 2035 and 80% by 2050. And that's before accounting for the \n     Laffer effect, likely future interest costs, state deficits \n     and the rising ratio of voters receiving government payments \n     to those paying income taxes.\n       It would be a huge mistake to imagine that the cumulative, \n     cascading burden of many tax rates on the same income will \n     leave the middle class untouched. Take a teacher in \n     California earning $60,000. A current federal rate of 25%, a \n     9.5% California rate, and 15.3% payroll tax yield a combined \n     income tax rate of 45%. The income tax increases to cover the \n     CBO's projected federal deficit in 2016 raises that to 52%. \n     Covering future Social Security and Medicare deficits brings \n     the combined marginal tax rate on that middle-income taxpayer \n     to an astounding 71%. That teacher working a summer job would \n     keep just 29% of her wages. At the margin, virtually everyone \n     would be working primarily for the government, reduced to a \n     minority partner in their own labor.\n       Nobody--rich, middle-income or poor--can afford to have the \n     economy so burdened. Higher tax rates are the major reason \n     why European per-capita income, according to the Organization \n     for Economic Cooperation and Development, is about 30% lower \n     than in the United States--a permanent difference many times \n     the temporary decline in the recent recession and anemic \n     recovery.\n       Some argue the U.S. economy can easily bear higher pre-\n     Reagan tax rates. They point to the 1930s-1950s, when top \n     marginal rates were between 79% and 94% or the Carter-era \n     1970s, when the top rate was about 70%. But those rates \n     applied to a much smaller fraction of taxpayers and kicked in \n     at much higher income levels relative to today.\n       There were also greater opportunities for sheltering income \n     from the income tax. The lower marginal tax rates in the \n     1980s led to the best quarter-century of economic performance \n     in American history. Large increases in tax rates are a \n     recipe for economic stagnation, socioeconomic ossification, \n     and the loss of American global competitiveness and \n     leadership.\n       There is only one solution to this growth-destroying, \n     confiscatory tax-rate future: Control spending growth, \n     especially of entitlements. Meaningful tax reform--not with \n     higher rates as Mr. Obama proposes, but with lower rates on a \n     broader base of economic activity and people--can be an \n     especially effective complement to spending control. But \n     without increased spending discipline, even the best tax \n     reforms are doomed to be undone.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/19/senate-section/article/S4651-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4651-S4652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MILCON APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, there is no question that we need to \nmake smart decisions to tighten our belts and reduce our Nation's debt \nand deficit. American families have done it around their kitchen table, \nand we owe it to them to get our fiscal house in order.\n  But there is also one group of Americans we owe an even greater \npromise to, a group we can never allow to become pawns or fall through \nthe cracks, or be forgotten altogether in these budgets debates, and \nthat is our men and women in uniform and the veterans who have \nprotected our Nation for decades. That is why I am here today on the \nfloor, in the midst of the whirlwind of debt and deficit rhetoric, to \nremind us all of the critical nature of the bill that is on the floor \nthis week; to remind us all that no matter what fiscal crisis we face, \nno matter how divided we may be over approaches to cutting our debt and \ndeficit, no matter how heated the rhetoric gets here in Washington, DC, \nwe have to keep our commitments to our veterans and servicemembers, and \nwe have to move this bill forward and we have to provide for those who \nwore or who are wearing the uniform with the peace of mind that we are \nkeeping our promise to them.\n  A couple of years ago we took a proactive step to make sure the \nnonstop wrangling over appropriations bills here in Congress didn't \ninterfere with the health care our veterans have earned. Thanks to the \nwork of Senator Akaka and many others, the VA spending for health care \nis now appropriated a year in advance, protecting it from an imperfect \nbudget process that is so often affected by politics.\n  But I remember when we passed advanced appropriations, we were very \nclear. Our foresight was not going to be an excuse to sit on our hands \nwhen VA funding was up for consideration. We were not going to allow a \nprecautionary measure to get in the way of passing timely increases in \nveterans' health care, and so this bill is the test.\n  Can we put politics aside for the good of our Nation's veterans and \nservicemembers? Can we show them that, despite our differences, we will \nwork as diligently toward getting them the benefits and care they have \nearned as they have worked for our Nation? Well, I hope we can.\n  I say that because the investments in this bill are a lot more than \nnumbers on a page. They are life-changing programs for veterans with \npost-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury. It is \nsupport for suicide hotlines that are seeing more callers than ever \nbefore. It is providing roofs over the heads of our servicemembers and \ntheir families. It is timely investments in the very biggest priorities \nof our Nation's heroes.\n  Today I want to talk about a few of the investments that are included \nin the bill we are considering today and how they translate into the \nlives of our servicemembers, our veterans and, critically, their \nfamilies.\n  There is an influx of young veterans coming into the VA system right \nnow that we have not seen in a very long time. In fact, the VA \nestimates that the number of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans in its \nhealth care system will reach well over \\1/2\\ million at some point \nnext year. That is an over 100-percent increase since 2008. This is a \nbig challenge and one we have no choice but to step up to meet if we \nare going to avoid some of the same mistakes we saw with the Vietnam \ngeneration.\n  That is why this bill includes nearly $3 billion to meet the health \ncare needs of veterans who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, which is a \nnearly $600 million increase over last year.\n  But it is more than just the sheer number of new veterans that will \nbe coming home to the VA in the near future. It is the extent of their \nwounds,\n\n[[Page S4652]]\n\nboth visible and invisible, that will require an untold resource from \nour Nation.\n  Through the wonders of modern medicine, servicemembers who would have \nbeen lost in previous conflicts are coming home to live productive and \nfulfilling lives. But they will need a lifetime of care from the VA. \nThat is why part of this bill includes significant investments for \nresearch in a number of areas, including traumatic brain injury, spinal \ncord injury, polytrauma injuries, and sensory loss.\n  It includes funding that will go to maintaining world-class \nprosthetics such as the one that was worn by SGT Leroy Petry, whom I \nsaw at the White House last week shake the hand of a grateful President \nObama as he was awarded the Medal of Honor.\n  It is also funding that comes at a critical time as amputations have \nsharply increased among soldiers in Afghanistan, many of whom are \ngetting out of protective MRAP and Humvees to engage Afghan citizens \nand at the same time putting themselves at far greater risk of severe \nIED injuries. According to a recent Washington Post article, twice as \nmany U.S. soldiers wounded in battle last year required limb \namputations than in either of the two previous years.\n  This funding also comes as mental health concerns continue to rise, \nand suicides among active-duty troops and veterans from these wars have \nrisen to a level now on par with combat deaths. In April, the VA's \nsuicide hotline took 14,000 suicide calls, more than they had taken in \nany month in the previous 4 years. This bill makes sure we are putting \nsomeone on the other end of that call. This bill funds efforts to give \nveterans access to mental health professionals, and ensures we are not \nleaving our veterans to go it alone.\n  But this will do much more than help our newest generation of \nveterans. For generations we have faced the problems of homelessness \namong our Nation's veterans without making any real headway. Recently, \nthrough the success of programs such as HUD-VASH and the Grant and Per \nDiem Program, we are seeing real progress toward putting homeless \nveterans into safe and secure housing, and the bold goals laid out by \nthe Obama administration to end veterans' homelessness once and for \nall. This bill includes nearly $1 billion in direct assistance to \nhomeless veterans, and this bill helps those who have taken on the \nmonumental but deeply personal task of providing care to an injured \nveteran in their family, those people who have left behind their own \ncareers and personal lives, and even their own health care and benefits \nto care for those who can't take care of themselves.\n  It includes major investments to meet the unique needs of one of the \nfastest growing groups of veterans, women veterans who, through health \ncare and construction upgrades that improve privacy, will benefit from \nVA facilities that are more conducive to their needs.\n  This bill also includes major investments to fund military \nconstruction projects worldwide, including readiness centers, barracks, \nhospitals, clinics, and schools. It also supports family housing \nconstruction projects that ensure military families have a satisfactory \nroof over their heads. And that, by the way, will create thousands of \ngood-paying jobs.\n  As we all know, the strength of our military is rooted in the \nstrength of the families who support them. Investments such as these \nare what allow our servicemembers to go abroad knowing that their loved \nones are being looked after by the Nation they are protecting.\n  After nearly a decade at war, the consequences of sending our \nservicemembers into combat and the sacred obligation we have to care \nfor those injured in service have become clear. But so have the \nshortcomings and the challenges we have to meet.\n  Last week, I chaired a hearing on the gaps to mental health care that \nstill exist at the VA, and the stories we heard were deeply \nfrustrating. I heard the stories of two separate veterans who attempted \nsuicide but were still left to wait for weeks, and even months, for \nappointments at the VA. We have to fix the VA in a way that meets that \nobligation so they are more flexible and responsive to the needs of \ntoday's veterans, and we have to do it in a cost-effective way by \nmaking sure we are getting the most value out of every dollar that a \nbill such as this one provides. Next week in our committee I will be \nexamining the long-term costs of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to \nour newest generation of veterans, because I believe we need to address \nthis problem openly and honestly.\n  Like generations of servicemembers and veterans before them, today's \nheroes have done everything that has been asked of them. They have been \nseparated from their families through repeat deployments; they have \nsacrificed life and limb in combat; and they have done all this \nselflessly and with honor to our country. We cannot allow our \ncommitment to them to lapse or to get caught up in politics. That is \nwhy we need to pass this bill.\n  We must also come to a budget agreement that avoids default and the \nconsequences that would have on our veterans.\n  We have to keep our promise, no matter what.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/19/senate-section/article/S4652-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4652-S4653]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ABBY WAMBACH AND THE U.S. WOMEN'S NATIONAL SOCCER TEAM\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, first I want to thank my colleague from \nthe great State of Washington for her remarks and her never-ending \nstrong and successful defense of our veterans who have done so much for \nus. I want to salute my colleague from Washington State.\n  I am going to speak on two topics for the 10 minutes I have allotted. \nFirst, on Abby Wambach, the pride of Rochester and the U.S. Women's \nNational Soccer team, and then on the Cut, Cap, and Unbalance Plan that \nis now being debated in the House and will soon be debated in the \nSenate.\n  First, I rise to recognize the extraordinary efforts of the U.S. \nWomen's National Soccer team in this year's World Cup, and in \nparticular Pittsford, NY's own Abby Wambach.\n  Over the last month, the Women's National Team has taken this country \non the ride of a lifetime that we won't soon forget.\n  From their nail-biting efforts to qualify for the World Cup to their \nheroic comeback against Brazil in the quarter finals, this team showed \nthe best of America during this year's World Cup. At each stage of this \nteam's success, there was a driving force, a player who learned the \ngame from her older brothers on the soccer fields of New York's greater \nRochester region, a player named Abby Wambach. Hundreds of Rochester's \nfans gathered at her brother's pub to cheer on Abby as she headed ball \nafter ball into the back of the net.\n  In the past few years, and especially the past month or so, Abby has \nbecome a household name. Fans from Rochester, the State of New York, \nand across the country watched in awe of Abby as she led the U.S. squad \nthroughout the World Cup.\n  But in Rochester and the surrounding area, Abby has been a star ever \nsince she played on Our Lady of Mercy High School's varsity team as an \neighth grader. Unusually young to be playing on a varsity squad, she \nhelped her team achieve a section V title. And as is clear to all of us \nwho have watched Abby over the years, her success has continued ever \nsince.\n  From Our Lady of Mercy to the Olympic games in Athens, and the 2011 \nWorld Cup, Abby has been an incredible player and leader at every turn. \nAbby Wambach has always represented the best New York has to offer and \ngiven young women across the country someone to look up to, and the \nlast month of the World Cup action has only cemented her legacy as one \nof the greatest U.S. Women's Soccer players of all time.\n  She scored over 120 international goals, none more dramatic or \nmeaningful than her goal against Brazil in the quarter finals. No \nmatter the odds or the score, Americans will never give up and always \nbelieve, and Abby and her teammates showed that same drive and desire \nduring the game against Brazil. Abby and the U.S. soccer team created a \nmoment that will live long in the sports lore of our Nation.\n  As the buzz continues about her goal, there are some people close to \nAbby\n\n[[Page S4653]]\n\nwho probably weren't surprised. For those who watched Abby during her \nsophomore year score two goals and make a clutch penalty kick that \nvaulted Our Lady of Mercy to the section V championship match, they \nknow this is what Abby Wambach does.\n  For months, Abby has been a long way from home. But tomorrow, she \nwill get the warm Rochester welcome she comes to know when her Magic \nJack Club faces the Western New York Flash.\n  Of course, we all know the efforts of the U.S. women's team came just \nshort in the end, and we can't help but be happy for the Japanese team \nand the entire country as they finally have something to celebrate \nafter the challenging months they have been through. So Japan may have \nwon this round, and congratulations to them, but they should know the \nU.S. Women's Soccer Team will see them in London for the Olympics next \nsummer, and again for the World Cup in Canada in 2015, with the pride \nof Rochester, Abby Wambach, leading the way.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/19/senate-section/article/S4653-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4653]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CUT, CAP, AND BALANCE\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Now to perhaps a less happy subject, the so-called Cut, \nCap, and Balance Plan.\n  Let me say we are going to be debating this in the House and in the \nSenate over the next week. Theater trumps serious solutions as the \nHouse Republicans plan a vote on their unrealistic Cut, Cap, and \nBalance proposal. It truly is theater trumping serious solutions when \nyou put something on the floor that you know may not pass your own body \nin the House, certainly won't pass the Senate, and would be vetoed by \nthe President, at a time when our Nation's credit is teetering on the \nedge. Let's stop playing games and solve this problem once and for all.\n  We on this side of the aisle call the plan Cut, Cap, and Kill \nMedicare for one good reason. Under this reckless plan, seniors could \nsee their Medicare cuts go up by $2,500 beyond Ryan cuts, Social \nSecurity benefits could be slashed by $3,000 a year. It is the Ryan \nplan on steroids.\n  The Ryan plan has been seriously rejected in a bipartisan vote in \nthis body. The American people dislike it intensely. And yet now we \nhave done something that is even more extreme. If you thought it wasn't \npossible to be more extreme, look at the Cut, Cap, and Kill Medicare \nplan that some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are \noffering.\n  There are three things wrong with their plan. First, we have a \nserious debt problem. If the credit of the United States goes into \ndefault, we will pay the price for a decade. It will make our deficit \nworse, it will raise costs to the Federal Government because interest \nrates on Federal bonds will go up and stay up for a very long time. It \nwill raise the cost to average homeowners because both mortgages and \ncredit card rates will go up. It could very well send our economy back \ninto a recession. Let's roll up our sleeves, let's compromise, and \nlet's meet in the middle and do something that will end our deficit \nproblem, reduce our debt, and make sure we are able to pay the debts we \nhave already incurred.\n\n  But, no, theater is the day. Ideologues do not see the world as it \nis. I read some of the statements by some of the freshman colleagues \nfrom the Republican side in the House. They just do not get it. Their \nview is that they are so right that all they have to do is put this on \nthe floor and all of America and every other Senator and Congressman \nwill go along. Ideologues do not see the world as it is, and that is \nwhy I have never been too fond of them, whether they have been on the \nfar right or on the far left. Yet that is who is governing here.\n  If you read those statements in the papers this morning, that all \nthey have to do is put this out there and everyone will see the \nrighteousness of their cause, I have a word for them: Slashing Medicare \nand slashing Social Security is not the right thing to do, and I will \nnever see things that way. Saying that millionaires should continue to \nget tax breaks while we are slashing Social Security and killing \nMedicare is something I will never go along with, nor will a single \ncolleague on my side of the aisle.\n  It is not going to pass. It is theater and politics at its worst. It \nis ideologues governing--or trying to govern. They are not able to \ngovern because they do not see the grays in the world; it is only black \nor white.\n  The plan has three strikes against it. No. 1, it will not solve the \nproblem, and it is political theater. No. 2, it will kill Medicare as \nwe know it. That is why we call it cut, cap, and kill Medicare. And, \nNo. 3, it will not do a thing to help the middle class, while giving \nhuge tax breaks to millionaires and corporate America. That is not the \nplan America wants. That is not the plan America needs. That is not the \nplan that will pass.\n  I understand many of us have to bow to an extreme base in the party. \nThat happens around here a lot--but not when we are 2 weeks away from \ndefaulting on our debt, not when we are 2 weeks away from potentially \nwalking off a cliff and incurring injuries from which we will never \nrecuperate.\n  I call on my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to stop the \ntheater, to stop throwing red meat to the far right base, and join us \nin solving the problems of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to enter into a colloquy with my Republican colleagues for up \nto 30 minutes. Senator Alexander of Tennessee, Senator Hoeven of North \nDakota, and Senator Risch of Idaho will participate with me in this \ncolloquy.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/19/senate-section/article/S4653-2", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4653-S4656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I rise today to speak to an issue that \nI believe has all the potential in the world to define the future of \nthis great country. It is an issue with which all of us who are \nparticipating in this colloquy are very familiar, and that is a \nbalanced budget. All of us are former Governors of the States from \nwhich we come.\n  In my State, the State of Nebraska, our Nebraska Constitution \nrequires a balanced budget. It is not unusual. I believe 49 out of 50 \nStates have this requirement in their constitution. It is not theater; \nit is the way we do things at the State level.\n  In addition to that provision, however, our State constitution also \nsays the total amount of money the State of Nebraska can borrow is \n$100,000. What does that mean? We must balance the budget on an annual \nbasis, and we cannot go out to the debt market and burden our children \nand grandchildren by fulfilling promises that, quite honestly, we have \nno idea how we pay for. We cannot do that.\n  Does that sound familiar? That is what the Federal Government does \nevery single year, and the Federal Government has been doing it for \ndecades. In Nebraska we are forced to prioritize and live within our \nmeans. We have a very simple, straightforward philosophy. We do not \npromise something we cannot pay for, and we do not buy something we \ncannot pay for.\n  Is that unusual? Is that radical? Every working family in America \nunderstands that, and they live by that simple concept: the simple \nconcept that they should not buy what they cannot pay for. If they do, \nit gets them in trouble. Sadly, the Federal Government does not think \nthat applies. It thinks it is kind of a radical notion to apply that to \nwhat happens in Washington.\n  Let's look at the results of this kind of policy in my State of \nNebraska. The unemployment rate in Nebraska today is 4.1 percent. \nDuring one of the most difficult times since the Great Depression, the \nunemployment rate in Nebraska never exceeded 5 percent. As I have said \nbefore on this floor--let me state that a different way. That means \nabout 96 percent of Nebraskans have work.\n  Our State believes in the philosophy of less government. I have said \nmany times: Government does not create the jobs, the private sector \ncreates the jobs. It is small businesses and businesses willing to take \nthe risks that will get us out of the tough times we are in now.\n  When I was Governor, Nebraska went through some very difficult times. \nI was Governor on 9/11. I was Governor when the dot-com bubble burst. I \ndid\n\n[[Page S4654]]\n\nnot have the option of walking into my State of the State Address and \nstanding there and saying: Folks, these are tough times. We are kind of \ndivided out here. We will not be passing a budget. Had I said that, I \nwould have been looking for another State to live in. I would have been \nlaughed out of the Governor's office.\n  There were no easy decisions, but there were necessary and important \ndecisions to be made. Nebraskan pragmatism would go a long way in \nWashington, but my State is not unique. My State is not unique in terms \nof this balanced budget requirement. In fact, I have other Governors \nwith me today.\n  I would like to start out by recognizing Senator Lamar Alexander of \nthe State of Tennessee. When Senator Alexander became Governor, I know \nhe had a lot of priorities, but he created an environment in which job \ncreators could thrive. He created that environment with the spending \nrequirements of his constitution. I would like him to tell us how he \ndid it, how he took his State forward even though he had to balance his \nbudget.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank Governor Johanns. It is terrific to be on the \nSenate floor with other former Governors. When we were doing the health \ncare bill last year, I said everyone who voted for it ought to be \nsentenced to serve as Governor for 8 years and actually try to \nimplement it. But let me try to answer the question briefly so we can \nhear from the other Governors.\n  I became Governor 30 years ago, in the early 1980s. Inflation was 20 \npercent. It is hard to imagine, in the early days of the Reagan \nadministration, they had driven up interest rates to 12 percent to try \nto bring inflation down. We had terrible times. Of course, we still had \nto balance our budget. We had to live within our means. We had to have \nthe amount of money coming in equal to the amount coming out.\n  Let me tell one story of the difference that has made in our State \nand how it could make a difference in the Federal Government. The other \nday, in the Environmental and Public Works Committee, the Tennessee \nchief highway engineer was testifying. He was there when I was \nGovernor. He is still there. One of the Senators, the chairman, \nsuggested perhaps some flexible Federal financing would be a good thing \nfor Tennessee; in other words, loaning some money to the State of \nTennessee to build roads.\n  The State engineer said: Madam Chairman, with all respect, we don't \nwant to borrow any Federal money. The State of Tennessee has zero road \ndebt.\n  That about brought the hearing to a halt because several Senators had \nnot ever heard of such a thing.\n  He said: Yes, that is correct. We have zero road debt. We use all of \nour gas tax money to build roads, none of it to pay interest.\n  That means, I say to the Senator from Nebraska, when we have a tough \ntime like we did when I became Governor, as when he was Governor, as we \ndo in the country today, if our interest rates are low or we pay no \ninterest, we can use that money to get through tough times. A lot of \nthe businesses and the families today who have less debt are making \ntheir way through these tough times more easily.\n  On the other hand, the Federal Government, according to the \nPresident's budget, by the year 2020, would be spending more money on \ninterest on the Federal debt than it would on our national defense. \nInterest on the Federal debt would be $931 billion by 2021.\n  What if that money could be put back in our pockets through tax cuts \nor used to help send kids to college or build roads in the State or \nenergy research to lower the cost of gasoline? One way, I would say to \nthe Senator from Nebraska, that balancing the budget helps create jobs \nis if we keep our interest payments down, we keep our taxes down, we \ncan spend our money wisely on things that count.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Senator Alexander raises such a valid point. In the \nState of Nebraska we don't have any road debt either. If we wanted to \npave a mile of highway we had to have the money in the bank or it did \nnot get done. The other advantage of that is when the economy started \nto lift, we did not have to pay back all that money we had borrowed. We \nwere ready to take off. So I would have to imagine in Tennessee, like \nNebraska, our economic recovery was just much easier to achieve.\n  I had the pleasure of serving as Governor of Nebraska when Senator \nHoeven was Governor of North Dakota. The State of North Dakota is often \nrecognized as one of the best managed States in the country. It has its \nfiscal house in order. It runs a surplus with some of the lowest \nunemployment rates of any State in the country. Yet they suffered \nthrough some of the same problems we had after the dot-com collapse.\n  Could the Senator talk to us a little bit about how the balanced \nbudget provisions in his constitution required him and the legislators \nto manage the State?\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I thank Senator Johanns. It is an honor to be here with \nhim, and also with the good Senator from Tennessee, Lamar Alexander. It \nis great to be here with them as well as Senator Risch from Idaho. We \nhave a common shared experience as Governors. It is wonderful to draw \non that.\n  I also have to mention that the Presiding Officer in the Senate \ntoday, Senator Shaheen, is a former Governor as well. So we have that \ncommon, shared experience, actually, here today on both sides of the \naisle. It is an honor and it is a pleasure to be here with you and talk \nabout this matter that is so very important, particularly as we face \nthe need to do something on the debt ceiling. This issue of dealing \nwith a balanced budget is paramount for our entire country and your \nlead-in is exactly right. We served together as Governors. As a matter \nof fact, the truth is, I would call the Senator--because he was elected \nGovernor before I was--for advice and ask him about some of the things \nhe was working on in Nebraska. Our States share many things in common; \none the Senator mentioned, a low unemployment rate. The unemployment \nrate in our State is 3.3 percent. Again, I attribute that to the \nability of building a probusiness, progrowth, projobs environment that \nstimulates private investments, stimulates jobs. The Senator mentioned \nso very accurately that jobs are created by the private sector, not by \ngovernment. We have to create an environment that stimulates and \nencourages and helps create a forum for that private investment. That \nis how we create jobs and get this economy going.\n\n  On one side, we have to have a growing economy, which we don't have \nat the national level right now, and on the other side we have to live \nwithin our means. We have to control our spending, and the Federal \nGovernment has a responsibility to control its spending just as the \nStates do, just as businesses do, just as families do. We have to not \nonly balance this budget, we have to live within our means on an \nongoing basis. We have 49 of the 50 States with either a constitutional \nor a statutory requirement that they balance their budget every year. \nEvery single Governor with us today had to balance their budget every \nsingle year. It was recently reported that 46 States are already on \ntrack to make sure their budget is balanced by the end of their fiscal \nyear. The Federal Government needs to do the same thing.\n  Look at our situation right now. The Federal Government takes in $2.2 \ntrillion in revenues. We take in $2.2 trillion in revenues, but we \nspend $3.7 trillion. That is a $1.5-plus trillion deficit every year, \nand that is rolling up to a debt that is now closing in on $14.5 \ntrillion. We have to address this. This is not something we can hand \noff to future generations. So our message to the administration is, you \nare making it worse. We have to start living within our means. We \ncannot keep spending and then borrowing and then raising taxes and \nexpect to have an economy that grows and a government that lives within \nits means, and that is exactly why we are here today talking about the \nneed for this balanced budget amendment.\n  If one thinks about it, the balanced budget amendment gets everyone \ninvolved both now and for the future because it has to be passed by \nboth Houses of Congress with a two-thirds majority. That has to be done \non a bipartisan basis and then it goes out to the States and three-\nfourths of the States have to ratify it for it to become part of the \nConstitution. That gets everybody involved in doing exactly what we \nneed to do; that is, getting on top of this deficit and this debt, both \nnow and for future generations.\n\n[[Page S4655]]\n\n  Again, I wish to thank the good Senator from Nebraska for holding \nthis colloquy and for inviting me to be part of it with my fellow \nGovernors. I appreciate it very much.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Let me thank Senator Hoeven. I noticed today we are also \njoined by another former Governor. In fact, we were both elected to the \nSenate at the same time so we are both part of the same class.\n  Senator Risch, at one point in his career, served as Governor of the \nState of Idaho. He had financial restrictions just as we did in terms \nof a balanced budget. I ask the Senator, how was he able to deal with \nimportant priorities while balancing the budget and bringing the \nlegislative process along in accomplishing that? Could the Senator talk \nto us a little bit about that today?\n  Mr. RISCH. I thank Senator Johanns very much. I am honored to be here \nwith the other former Governors. There are a handful of us on each side \nwho have had the honor and privilege of serving their States as the \nchief executive, so it is a real honor to be here, and I bring that \nexperience with me. I think every one of us brings that experience with \nus. I not only bring that experience, but I did almost three decades in \nthe Idaho State Senate, balancing the budget and, indeed, I was in the \nleadership, having to do what the leadership does here, as far as \nbringing the two ends together, because we have a balanced budget \nrequirement in the State of Idaho, as virtually every other State does. \nDoes that create some angst when one is the chief executive or when one \nis in the legislative process trying to balance the budget? Of course \nit does. I am sure the Presiding Officer wound up with the same thing \nin her great State as she tried to balance the budget because no matter \nhow much money one has, it is never enough. As Senator Johanns pointed \nout, it is a matter of priority. This is not rocket science.\n  What the States do and, indeed, what businesses do and, indeed, what \nfamilies do around the kitchen table, either formally or informally, is \nanticipate how much money is going to come in over the year, sometimes \nover the month, sometimes over the week. They anticipate how much money \nis going to come in and then they say: We have priorities. What is our \nfirst priority? Of course, in a home, we have to be able to eat, we \nhave to have the utilities paid and a roof over our head, so those \nbecome very important. To a government, obviously, if it is a State \ngovernment, education is the largest expenditure for virtually \neveryone. For the Federal Government, obviously, the highest priority \nis national defense. But we make a list. Then what we do is we allocate \nthe money we have to a list. When we are done, nobody ever stands and \nsays: That went very well. We have enough money. We have everything \nfunded. We are able to do everything we want to do.\n  No, absolutely not. Indeed, around here, in this city, this \ngovernment is spending $3.8 trillion. I can tell you, there isn't a day \nthat goes by where we don't get hit up with somebody saying: It is not \nenough. Our agency doesn't have enough money. Why we can't even--blank. \nFill in whatever you want, whatever agency it is. Everybody tells you \nthey don't have enough money.\n  Yes, that is right. Because a balanced budget requirement \nacknowledges a plain, simple fact of life; that is, there are not \nenough resources to do everything we want to do. Indeed, a lot of times \nthere isn't even enough money to do what we need to do, but what we \nhave to do is we have to do the best we can with what we have. Without \na balanced budget amendment, it becomes the opposite of that--we keep \nspending.\n  People say to me: Well, Jim, you have been in public service all your \nadult life. Has anything in Washington, DC, surprised you? I said: Yes, \nbut only one thing. The stuff that goes on here doesn't surprise me at \nall, except the cavalier attitude this city has and, indeed, this \ninstitution has for the value of money. It astounds me that in this \ninstitution they don't stop spending money when they hit the end of the \nbudget or they don't stop spending money when they hit the end of the \nresources. They stop spending money when they run out of time. That \nseems to be the only sideboard on how much money is spent. If we look \naround--and people will criticize us on this--and say: You foolish \nRepublicans, what are you talking about? A balanced budget amendment, \nthat is dumb. You know what I say to them? Look at the States. Look \naround at the States. There are two, maybe three States that are having \nvery difficult financial situations, and it is because they either \ndon't have a balanced budget amendment or they have done some \nskulduggery to get around the balanced budget requirement they have. \nBut every other State has its financial house in order. Has it been \npainful? Of course, it has been painful. It is painful to everyone when \nthey don't have enough money, including American families, but that is \nsimply the way it is.\n  One of the problems we are having is the basic foundation of the \ndifference between Republicans and Democrats. People who say there is \nno difference between Republicans and Democrats ought to come and spend \nthe day here. They would find that philosophically we are hardwired \nvery differently. Similar to two brands of computers trying to talk to \neach other, we are hardwired differently.\n  Republicans believe this Nation was founded with the idea we would \nhave a limited central government. It was founded by people who, \nindeed, feared a central government. By the way, their fear, as we now \nsee every day, is very well founded. We believe in a limited \ngovernment. We believe in individual responsibility. We believe in the \nresponsibility of the States. It is hard to find people in this town \nwho actually believe the States are sovereign, that it was the States \nthat created the Federal Government and kept a leash on it and said you \ncan only have the powers we are specifically putting into this \nConstitution. Now the courts over the years have expanded that \ndramatically, but nonetheless, the vision the Founding Fathers had, the \nAmerican people had when they put together the country that created the \nmost successful, the wealthiest, the culture that enjoyed the best \nquality of life anyone on the face of this planet has ever enjoyed \nbefore, the Founding Fathers said: Look, we are going to create a \ngovernment for the individual, to give the individual the ability to \nprosper, to give the individual opportunity.\n\n  That is what they said. They didn't sit around the table and say: You \nknow what we need is a nanny State. We need to create a government that \nis going to take care of every American from the time they are born \nuntil the time they die just as in Europe.\n  In Europe, the government pays for your birth. In Europe, the \ngovernment pays for your funeral and, indeed, it pays for a whole lot \nof everything in between including every dime you spend after you \nretire. That is not what America was founded to do. They did not sit \naround and say: How can we take care of the whole society? They said: \nHow can we defend this country? How can we make sure no enemies come \ninto this country? How can we make sure people have the opportunity to \nsucceed? Yes, some will fail. Yes, some will succeed. Yes, we are going \nto have poor people, and, yes, we are going to have rich people because \nthat is what a free society is all about, but everybody is going to \nhave the same opportunity. Everybody who is born into this country or \nbecomes a naturalized citizen in this country is going to have the \nopportunity to succeed in a greater fashion than anyone on the face of \nthis planet has ever succeeded before, and they are going to do it \nwithout government interference.\n  My goodness. How far we have come from those days and not in a good \nway. They couldn't conceive they needed a balanced budget amendment \nbecause the numbers we are talking about they never heard of. If a guy \nsitting around the table said: By the way, do you know the country is \ngoing to be over $1 trillion in debt someday, they would have said: \nWhat is $1 trillion? How many zeros is that? They couldn't even \nconceive of that, so they didn't put that in the Constitution. But this \nisn't difficult to do. It is how much comes in and how much comes out \nand they need to equalize each other.\n  I will be the first to admit our two parties don't understand each \nother. As I said, we are hardwired differently, and I have a lot of \ngood friends on the other side of the aisle. We have good \nconversations. They don't understand how I can possibly think we could \nhave a balanced budget, and I guess I don't understand how they think \nwe can\n\n[[Page S4656]]\n\nspend ourselves into prosperity. We are, indeed, hardwired differently \nthan each other.\n  I watched one of the leaders the other day come out onto the floor. \nHe was carrying on about how bad the balanced budget amendment was. He \nsaid it would be an admission of the failure of this institution to be \nable to do its job. It would be abdicating our ability to do our job. \nLook around. We are $14.3 trillion in debt. Do you think the American \npeople think we are doing our job, when we are at $14.3 trillion in \ndebt and now debating adding another $2.4 trillion to that? If a person \ncomes and spends a little bit of time here, they will understand this \ninstitution cannot budget and do so responsibly. Given the opportunity, \nit will spend and spend and spend and the only way this can be changed \nis if we have a balanced budget provision in the Constitution just as \nvirtually every State in America has. We are going upside down at a \nrate of $4 billion to $5 billion a day. We are borrowing new money, $4 \nbillion to $5 billion a day. That is about 12 hours of the entire \nannual budget for the State of Idaho. This can't go on. The way to fix \nit is with a balanced budget requirement that puts a new rule in place, \nand we need rules, we need sideboards when it comes to spending money.\n  I wish to thank the Senator for providing us with this opportunity. \nThose of us who have actually lived in the real world where we could \nnot print money, we could not borrow the kind of money we are talking \nabout here, where we had to make responsible decisions--it is time this \ngovernment did that, and the only way it is going to do that, \nregardless of flowery speeches given during campaigns--oh, send me to \nWashington; I will take care of this; I will see we balance the budget; \nI won't overspend--they come here and do it. The only way this can be \ndone is to balance the budget. Without a balanced budget amendment to \nthe Constitution, we can't do this.\n  The American people have to do this. We can vote to ask the American \npeople: Do you think we should have a balanced budget amendment to the \nU.S. Constitution? Let's find out. Let's find out. There can't be \nanything wrong with giving the American people the ability to do this. \nIt takes three-fourths of the States to ratify this. Let's give them \nthe opportunity. Let's have the debate. Let's pass this and give it to \nthe States and see if they want to do it.\n  Thank you very much. I appreciate the opportunity.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Let me wrap up this colloquy this morning by thanking \neach one of my colleagues for their comments.\n  Governors are practical people. We have to be. We have no choice. If \njobs are going to be created in our States, we must lead that effort--\nnot by jawboning and indicting the business community but by creating \nthe atmosphere that creates those jobs. If we are going to have a \nbalanced budget, we must lead that effort at the State level. Every \nGovernor who has had an opportunity to speak this morning in this \ncolloquy has made that point. At the end of the day, when our \nlegislative sessions were over, we had to be able to tell the people of \nour great States that we passed the budget; that the budget was, in \nfact, balanced; and, for some of us, that we did not borrow any money \nwhatsoever to get that job done. We could learn something in Washington \nfrom that.\n  This is not a radical idea. All the rhetoric we have heard about what \na radical, crazy idea this is--well, how can it be so radical if 49 out \nof 50 States have decided this is the right course and the right \ndirection for their State governments? I can't imagine the American \npeople want anything less for their Federal Government. And, as Senator \nRisch has just pointed out, why would we not give the American people \nthe opportunity to cast their vote on how best to manage their \ngovernment--their government?\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/19/senate-section/article/S4656-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4656-S4659]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              DEBT CRISIS\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the regrettable \nand avoidable looming debt crisis if we don't take appropriate and \ntimely steps beginning today and continuing over the next few days.\n  As we continue to work to get our economy out from under a protracted \nand painful recession and on a more robust path of growth and job \ncreation, not having an agreement to pay our country's bills has severe \nconsequences. Defaulting could mean not only a potential stoppage of \nSocial Security and veterans' benefits checks, but even more worrying \nthan what could happen to bondholders and the middle class is the \nquestion of whether this could push us back into not only a severe \nrecession but a worldwide economic catastrophe.\n  We can look across at European governments struggling with sovereign \ndebt crises. Also, one of the lessons we should have learned from the \nevents of 2008, and particularly that fall, is that a lack of \nconfidence and a vulnerability in one part of the world's financial \nsystems can be magnified dramatically because of connections and \ninterrelationships and could potentially produce a worldwide crisis.\n  So this is an issue we have to address. A failure to act would \ncripple our government almost immediately. In August, if there is not a \nsolution, it is estimated that spending in the economy could contract \nimmediately from 40 to 50 percent. That means the U.S. economy would be \nhit with a loss of about $134 billion or about 10 percent of GDP for \nthe month of August if we fail to find a solution. A 10-percent loss to \nAugust's GDP could bring our credit markets to a standstill and could \nlead to the loss of millions of additional jobs.\n  One of the ironies of this debate is that the proposal by some on the \nother side to simply not pass debt limit legislation would be \ntolerable. In fact, it would be catastrophic. It would be catastrophic \nin terms of the very objective they are urging--controlling the \ndeficit. As people drop out of the labor force, they require more \nbenefits. They are not able legally or in a position to pay the taxes \nthey were paying while working. In addition to that, it has been \nestimated that for every 1 percent increase in interest rates--and if \nwe default, interest rates will go up on U.S. Treasuries--we will over \n10 years accumulate $1.3 trillion in additional deficit. So in one fell \nswoop, the deficit hawks who are screaming so loudly today could put us \non an even worse deficit trajectory.\n  We all know the job of bringing this budget into alignment is not \ngoing to be easy. It involves many tradeoffs, some of which are likely \nto be very unpopular. It started in 1990, when Republicans joined us in \na balanced approach. Along with my colleagues who served here in the \n1990s under President Clinton, we then took some tough votes with not \none Republican vote in support of us in 1993 when the process of \nbalancing the budget continued. It takes time. It takes difficult \nvotes. It was done in the 1990s.\n  As we all know, when President George W. Bush assumed office, we were \nlooking not at massive deficits, we were looking at a potential surplus \nof trillions of dollars over a 10-year period. But with the programs \nthat President Bush, together with his Republican colleagues, embraced, \nof significant tax cuts, an expansion of entitlements, such as Part D \nMedicare which was not paid for, which was put on the credit card, and \ntwo unfunded wars, we are sitting today with this huge deficit.\n  Frankly, this proposal to raise the debt limit is very simply paying \nfor what President Bush and Republican Congresses did several years \nago. Yet we find my colleagues on the other side saying: Oh, we cannot \ndo that. We cannot do that without significant reductions in programs \nthat are vital to Americans.\n  We have already demonstrated--we did that in a continuing resolution \nthat is covering this year's funding--we can and will make difficult \ncuts. We can reduce spending. But we have to do it in a measured way. \nThe other thing we have to do is recognize that any solution, just as \nit was in the 1990s, will\n\n[[Page S4657]]\n\nrequire revenues as well as expenditures. That is the only way the \narithmetic will work.\n  I find it sometimes ironic when I go around and talk and they say: \nOh, if we don't solve this problem, you are putting all this burden on \nour grandchildren. Where was that spirit when the President cut taxes \nand began to eliminate a surplus that would have benefited our \ngrandchildren? Where was that spirit when the President decided to \nengage in two major wars but not pay for them? Where was that spirit \nwhen the President decided he was going to expand entitlements and not \npay for them? There were very few of my colleagues on the other side \nworrying about grandchildren then.\n  Well, we do have to worry about our grandchildren. That means we have \nto start taking the tough steps today. We have to start making the \nsacrifices that will get our budget in order. Those sacrifices are not \nsimply in cutting programs that are so vital not only to so many \nAmericans but are so vital to our continuing economic growth.\n  I am sure everyone here will say they have important highway projects \nin their States, they have important infrastructure projects in their \nStates. Do we sacrifice those projects? If we do, then we sacrifice our \neconomic efficiency, we sacrifice our productivity, and we give the \nresults to our grandchildren: a decrepit infrastructure, with the \ninability to be competitive in a very competitive global economy.\n  We have to move forward. We have to move forward to avoid a \ncatastrophe to the economy if the debt ceiling is not raised. Also, we \nhave to move forward to begin to balance our budget in the way it has \nbeen done in the past and, frankly, in the way it only can be done; \nthat is, we have to start, beginning today, to make the sacrifices and \nmake the tough choices that will provide a better future for our \ngrandchildren.\n  We have done it in the past. In 1990 and 1993 we took tough steps, as \nI mentioned before, to begin to balance the budget. And in 1997, with a \nRepublican Congress and a Democratic President, we took additional \nsteps. We can do it, and we must do it.\n  The idea that we are going to default is difficult to imagine, but, \nstill, there are those out there on the other side who are saying they \nwill not vote for raising the credit limit in any way, shape, or form. \nI think that is irresponsible. I think we have to be responsible. We \nhave stood up before. We have taken tough votes. We have to do it \nagain.\n  Failing to do that puts a huge burden on the middle class. The \nwealthiest amongst us may be able to negotiate through the vagaries of \nwhat might happen after a credit default by the United States, but for \nSocial Security recipients, for military retirees, for those people who \nare looking for the basic services of government--transit to get to \nwork, the ability to get on a plane--who is going to be manning the TSA \nposts if the government cannot essentially pay its debts? All these \nissues have to be considered.\n  We have to, as I said, talk about revenues too. It is astounding that \npeople would literally be suggesting we cut back Social Security \nbenefits, that we cut back retirement benefits, that we do all these \nthings at the same time we are providing about $4 billion in annual tax \nincentives to the oil industry, when the price of oil is at record \nlevels, their profits are at record levels. These are a host of tax \nprovisions that do not make us anymore productive. In fact, one might \nargue they do not even encourage employment here in the United States. \nOne could make the suggestion, at least the way we set up the system, \nthat it might encourage employment overseas, and then we repatriate the \nprofits here. Well, that might be fine for the big companies and the \nexecutives, but what about Americans who are looking for jobs? What \nabout Americans who are looking just to get by?\n  We also have to recognize that some of the proposals we have made--in \nfact, all of them the President has talked about with respect to \nrevenues--would not be effective immediately because we are still in a \nperiod of very fragile economic growth. They would be effective in \n2013. But they would go to that long-term goal of deficit reduction, \nwhich we can achieve, but it will take time, just as it took time in \nthe 1990s.\n  But even these proposals to close loopholes, which are, in my view, \nvery difficult to defend--and to do so not immediately but several \nyears from now--even these proposals are being resisted by Republicans. \nThat does not make sense to me. I also do not think it makes sense to a \ngrowing number of Americans across this country. They want us to be \nresponsible. They want us to be able to pay our debts. Then they want \nus to get our debts under control. They recognize that requires not \njust good will and good wishes, it requires real, difficult choices and \nsacrifices.\n  We are seeing now an economy that is racking up huge profits for \nindustry. The nonfinancial members of the S 500 index are sitting on \nabout $1.1 trillion in cash. The Federal Reserve indicated similarly \nthat nonfinancial businesses have about $1.9 trillion in cash defined \nas liquid assets.\n  Record profits are being accumulated by corporations. All of this is \ngood, but it is much better if those cash resources and profits are put \nback into the American economy in terms of creating jobs. That should \nbe part of our effort too, not simply reducing the deficit, but \nreducing it in a way where we grow jobs here in the United States. That \nis also at the heart of what the President is talking about in terms of \nhis efforts.\n  We are on the verge of tough votes and tough choices, and I hope we \nmake those tough choices and tough votes. We do have to pay our debts, \nbut then we have to get our debt under control. We have done it. We did \nit in the 1990s. I would argue without some of the policies that were \nenthusiastically embraced by many who are here today, who are talking \nabout sacrifice for the middle class but no sacrifice for the very \nwealthy, we would not be in the same position we are in today.\n  I believe we are at a very critical moment. We have to resolve this \nissue by August 2. I hope we can do that. I hope it will turn on the \nsame kind of sensible, balanced approach that we adopted previously in \nthe 1990s. We have to go ahead and think in terms of restoring our \nfinancial house and then getting our American people back to work. If \nwe do that, I think we will fulfill not only the best hopes and wishes \nof the American people but their strong desires.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, are we in morning business at this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, we know as Members of the Senate we are facing a \ndeadline of August 2 for the extension of our debt ceiling. What is it?\n  The debt ceiling is the authority Congress gives to the President to \nborrow money. You say to yourself: Well, please stop borrowing. We are \nalready deep in debt. But what the President is borrowing money to pay \nfor what we have already spent money on, commitments we have already \nmade.\n  Let me give you an example. Voting to continue the war in Afghanistan \ncosts $10 billion a month. We do not have that money--not enough. We \nhave to borrow 40 cents for every $1 we spend. So when Members of \nCongress say: Continue the war in Afghanistan at $10 billion a month, \nthey are saying we are prepared to borrow $4 billion every single month \nto keep that promise.\n  The President comes to us about once a year and says: I need more \nauthority to continue to borrow money to pay for the things you have \nasked us to do. That is what it comes down to.\n  Nobody likes to vote for the debt ceiling because it is so widely \nmisunderstood. Most people basically say: I don't want to be associated \nwith it. I have been guilty of that in my political career. But the \nfact is, most of us look over our shoulders at the final vote and say: \nWe better pass this darn thing because if we don't, we will default on \nour debt.\n  The full faith and credit of the United States of America is like our \ncredit score. Guess what. We have the best in the world. Of all \ngovernments\n\n[[Page S4658]]\n\nin the world, we have the best: triple A. It does not get any better, \nand it has always been there, and that has helped us. It has helped us \nnot only to borrow money at lower interest costs, but the fact that our \neconomy is looked on as so reliable attracts more businesses to our \ncountry.\n  So if on August 2 we default on our debt for the first time in our \nhistory, our credit score is going to suffer. The people who loan us \nmoney are going to say: We never dreamed the United States of America \nwould fail to make a debt payment. If they are going to fail to make a \ndebt payment, then we are going to have to raise the interest rates \nbecause they are riskier than we thought they were.\n  What happens when you raise the interest rates on the United States \nof America borrowing money? Every percentage point--every 1 percentage \npoint--adds $130 billion a year to our national debt; and over 10 \nyears, 10 times that amount: $1.3 trillion every 10 years for every \nsingle percentage point.\n  So is it important to extend the debt ceiling? You bet it is; \notherwise, our debt goes up, our credit rating goes down.\n  There is another unfortunate consequence. As the debt of America \nrequires a higher interest payment because we have defaulted, interest \nrates go up all across America--in Montana, in Illinois, in every \nState. People who are borrowing money to run a farm, such as our \nPresiding Officer, to buy a car or buy a house will pay more in \ninterest.\n  Is that is a good thing? Of course not, particularly in a weak and \nrecovering economy, with 9 million people out of work, maybe 14 million \nif you add those who are only partially employed. With 14 million \npeople out of work and interest rates going up, businesses do not \nexpand as they should, people do not buy. They put it off because \ninterest rate costs are that much higher. That is what this is about. \nThat is what the August 2 deadline is about.\n  But it is about something more. It is about the debt of this Nation, \nwhich is a serious issue. We are now in a position where, as I \nmentioned earlier, we borrow 40 cents for every $1 we spend. We borrow \nit from Americans who buy our Treasuries and securities, and we borrow \nit from countries around the world who buy our debt.\n  The leading creditor of the United States of America is China. The \nleading competitor of the United States of America is China. Put those \ntwo things together and realize our vulnerability as our debt grows \nlarger and our indebtedness to countries such as China grows larger. \nThat is not good.\n  Plus, my son, daughter, my grandchildren, and yours will end up \npaying this debt. They will pay in their lives for what we are spending \ntoday. Some of those will benefit them, but some won't. What we will \nconsume, they will pay for. That is not fair.\n  If we are going to deal with this debt, there is only one rational \nway to do it. About a year and a half ago, Harry Reid appointed me to \nthe Bowles-Simpson debt commission. We met for 10 months and came up \nwith a conclusion--18 members--and 11 voted for it. We said that if we \nare going to reduce this debt in a meaningful way over the next 10 \nyears, we need to put everything on the table--everything. That is \npainful. It means putting on the table what I have fought for as a \nMember of the House and Senate, and believe in, and I still do, but we \nhave to look at them.\n  Is there a way to save money, to economize, to spread the burden of \nresponsibility and sacrifice so that it is fair in America? Some say: \nNo, we are not going to put everything on the table.\n  Our talks have broken down recently with the Republican leadership \nover whether, under any circumstances--and I underline the word \n``any''--the wealthiest in America should pay more in taxes. They say: \nNo, not a penny.\n  I don't think that is right. I think if we are going to deal with our \ndebt and deficit in a meaningful way, those who are well off and \ncomfortable in this great Nation should help us. They need to sacrifice \nif we are asking the same of working families and everyone else across \nthe board. So this notion of no revenue, no tax increase is, in my \nmind, shortsighted and won't lead us to where we need to be.\n  We also have to put entitlements on the table. That is when we start \ngetting nervous on the Democratic side. We know what the House budget \ndoes to Medicare. Frankly, I voted against that, and I would vote \nagainst it anytime it is brought before us.\n  What it does is dramatically change Medicare as we know it. For about \n40 million Americans, that is their only health insurance. They are \nfolks who are over 65, many with medical conditions, and they are \nuninsurable or certainly they cannot be insured at a premium rate they \ncan afford. Medicare is there for them, and it has been for over 50 \nyears. So the notion in the House Republican budget that we would \ndouble the out-of-pocket expenses for Medicare recipients and \nbeneficiaries up to $6,000 a year is just something most people can't \ndo. You know, if you are wealthy in your retirement, that is one thing. \nMost people are just living paycheck to paycheck on Social Security, \nwith meager savings. The notion of spending $6,000 a year out of pocket \nfor Medicare is beyond them. I reject that House Republican budget.\n  Are there ways to save money in Medicare? Yes. We created a Medicare \nprescription drug program and said that finally we are going to help \npay for the prescription drugs of seniors because if they get their \nmedicine and they take it, they are well, they don't go to the \nhospital, and then their lives are better and our costs are lower. So \nit is better to give them the medicine they need and help them pay for \nit. We created the plan with private health insurance companies right \nin the coverage for this prescription drug benefit under Medicare.\n  What many of us thought we should do is allow the Medicare system \nitself to offer a prescription drug benefit. We should model it after \nthe Veterans' Administration, where the VA buys prescription drugs in \nbulk at a discount so that their veterans can get the benefit of those \nbulk purchases. We can do the same on Medicare and leave it up to \nindividuals across America to pick the plan they want. If you want to \ngo with the private health insurance when it comes to prescription drug \nbenefits, that is your choice. If you want to go with the Medicare \nbenefit, that is your choice. That choice could save us $100 billion a \nyear. That is a lot of money. We can end up with savings there, helping \nto reduce the deficit, and not compromise the basic promise of Medicare \nprescription drugs.\n  The same is true with Social Security. This is where it gets very \ntricky, and a lot of people start heading for the exits. Here is the \nreality. Social Security as currently written, with no changes \nwhatsoever, will make every promised payment to every beneficiary for \n25 years, with an annual cost-of-living increase. You can't say that \nabout anything else in government. But what happens at the end of 25 \nyears? Unless something intervenes, at that point the Social Security \nbenefits drop 22 percent. That is a big hit for folks living on Social \nSecurity.\n  So what can we do today, 25 years in advance--a small thing--to \nSocial Security that will build up the solvency and life of Social \nSecurity for even more years?\n  I think that is an honest challenge. We should view it as an honest \nchallenge not to eliminate Social Security but to say to the generation \nof younger workers in America that it is going to be there, and you \nwill be lucky that it is there because a lot of seniors today can tell \nyou the story of their lives. They paid into Social Security, and they \nnow receive the benefits, but what happened to their other plans for \nretirement? Well, that little 401(k) or IRA or SEP plan took a hit a \nfew years ago, and they lost about 30 percent of their value. Many \nAmericans with the pension plans--some of their companies went out of \nbusiness, and they walked away from those plans.\n  Social Security is still there, and we want it to be there in the \nfuture. We can strengthen Social Security and give it a longer life. We \ncan find ways to strengthen Medicare and give it a longer life and \nstill be committed to the basic mission of these entitlement programs. \nThat has to be part of this conversation.\n  I have spent the last few months following up on the Bowles-Simpson \ndeficit commission, meeting with a number of my Senate colleagues, \nthree on the Democratic side and three Republicans. We have tried to \ntake the\n\n[[Page S4659]]\n\nBowles-Simpson proposal and put it into language that works, make it \nwork. So we have been at it for a long time. We have had our ups and \ndowns. One of our members left, then came back. It is a tough \nassignment. It is not easy. Sometimes emotions run high because there \nare things of great value and importance that are being discussed.\n  Something happened this morning that was perhaps historic. We took \nour plan, which still is short of completion, and we invited every \nMember of the Senate--Democrats and Republicans--to come listen to a \ndescription of the plan. If I am not mistaken--and Senator Warner is \nhere--it was 49 Senators who came. There were no fistfights and no \nswearing. Instead, Democratic and Republican Senators sat in that \nroom--49 of them--and listened to the outline of this proposal from \nthis group of 6 and came out with a positive feeling--not all of them. \nI am not suggesting they all signed up. I would not expect that to \nhappen. But it is significant at this moment in our history that so \nmany felt positive toward what we were doing. I hope we can take it to \nanother level.\n  In the meantime, we have an important responsibility. We need to \nextend the debt ceiling. We cannot compromise the whole faith and \ncredit score of the United States. We cannot let interest rates go up \nand raise our debt. We cannot let interest rates go up and kill the \nrecovery that is taking place in this economy by killing jobs. We need \nto do our part here and solve this problem on a bipartisan basis. I \nhope we can fold into that, as a critical element, a plan to move \nforward in dealing with our debt.\n  Senator Reid, the Democratic majority leader, and Senator McConnell, \nthe Republican minority leader, are working together. America should \ntake heart that they are trying to find a way through a difficult \npolitical challenge. The clock is running, and we have to get it done.\n  Today, we have a largely empty Chamber, as we prepare for a debate on \na Republican alternative, which I will oppose and speak against, and I \nwill tell you why. It is not going to pass. We know that. But we have \nsaid to Republicans: We will give you your chance to make your case. \nThat is all any of us can ask in the Senate. My plea to the Republican \nside of the aisle is, let's do this in a time-efficient manner. Let's \nnot waste time. Let's try to get to a good, healthy debate and a vote \nand move to extend the debt ceiling on a bipartisan basis. If we don't \nand if the rating agencies which downgraded us last week come back and \nhit us again, it will hurt this economy and the families and businesses \nthat count on us to make the right and important decisions on a timely \nbasis.\n  I urge my colleagues on the Republican side, wage a spirited debate \non what you believe in, and we will too, but let's not draw this out \nfor days and weeks. We have to get down to business.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Webb). The junior Senator from Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I commend my colleague, the Senator from \nIllinois, for his comments. I affirm his sentiments.\n  We have two problems in front of us right now--one intermediate \nproblem: raising the debt ceiling. If we have a downgrade in our debt, \nthere will be a tax increase on every American family, every American \nbusiness, in the cost of higher interest rates. We have to get that \nraised, which is something I have been advocating for over a year.\n  We have to take a second step--to put into place the long-term \ndeficit reduction plan. The Senator from Illinois and I and others have \nbeen working on this. The Senator from Georgia and I started this over \na year ago. We had I believe virtually half of the Senate who came and \nsaid it is not perfect, but this makes sense as a way to move forward. \nWe have to do our jobs.\n  I particularly thank the Senator from Illinois, who has worked so \nhard on preserving the safety net in these discussions.\n  Some of my colleagues on the Republican side have recognized that we \nhave to sort through a way to reform our Tax Code in a meaningful way. \nThese are acts of political courage, and I commend them both.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/19/senate-section/article/S4659-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4659-S4660]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, the issue that is under discussion in \nWashington on deficit reduction is of enormous consequence. It will \nimpact not only our generation but the decisions reached will impact \nour children and our grandchildren and the future of our country. It is \nterribly important the American people become engaged in this debate. I \nfear if they do not, if we leave the discussions totally to folks \ninside the beltway, the results will be a disaster for tens of millions \nof working families, for the elderly, for the sick, for the children, \nfor the environment, and for the future of our Nation.\n  So my plea today is for the American people to get heavily involved, \nto get on the phone and call their Senators and their Members of \nCongress to demand not that the budget deal that is reached is a big \ndeal or a small deal or a medium-sized deal but that the budget \nagreement that is reached is a fair deal--one that reflects the values \nof our country, one that understands what is going on in the economy \ntoday, and one that addresses the issue of how we got into this \nhorrendous deficit situation in the first place.\n  When we talk about a fair deal, one has to understand what the \nAmerican economy is today, and that is that we have a middle class that \nis collapsing; we have poverty increasing; and we have a growing gap \nbetween the very wealthiest people in our country and everybody else. \nTo my mind, at a time when the rich are doing phenomenally well, when \ncorporate profits are extremely high, when the effective tax rate for \nthe wealthy is the lowest in modern history, and when we have many \ncorporations making billions of dollars in profits and paying nothing \nin taxes, it would be immoral and bad economic policy to move toward a \ndeficit-reduction approach which balances the budget on the backs of \nworking families, the elderly, the sick, and the poor, and that does \nnot ask the wealthiest people or the largest corporations to contribute \none nickel to deficit reduction. That would be absolutely wrong.\n  Mr. President, one of the areas that concerns me very much is that in \nthe midst of all of this deficit-reduction talk, seemingly out of \nnowhere comes the idea we must make major cuts in Social Security \nbenefits. That is absolutely wrong for a number of reasons.\n  No. 1, Social Security has not contributed one nickel toward our \ndeficit. The Social Security trust fund has a $2.6 trillion surplus. \nSocial Security can pay out every benefit owed to every eligible \nAmerican for the next 25 years. So it is wrong, wrong, wrong to make \nsignificant cuts in Social Security a part of deficit reduction. It is \nwrong because Social Security hasn't contributed to the deficit; it is \nwrong because President Obama specifically campaigned against any cuts \ntoward Social Security; and it is wrong because cutting Social Security \nwould hurt in a very significant way millions of the most vulnerable \npeople in our country.\n  There is a discussion going on about moving toward a so-called \nChained CPI, which would be used to determine Social Security's annual \nCOLA--a new formulation on the COLA. Let me be very clear. When I was \nin the House, I introduced bipartisan legislation to strengthen the \nSocial Security COLA because I believed then, and I believe now, the \ncurrent COLA is inadequate and unfair to seniors because it does not \ntake into account the high cost of health care and prescription drugs.\n  In my view, the current COLA formulation understates what seniors and \ndisabled vets should be getting. What some are proposing in terms of \nmoving toward a Chained CPI would be to move us in exactly the wrong \ndirection. It would not adequately reflect the purchasing needs of \nseniors but, in fact, would underestimate those needs.\n  The Social Security Administration's Chief Actuary estimates the \neffects of\n\n[[Page S4660]]\n\nthe so-called Chained CPI would be that beneficiaries who retire at age \n65 and receive average benefits would get $560 less a year at age 75 \nthan they would under current law. Around here $560 may not seem like a \nlot of money. But if you are 75 years of age and are bringing in \n$14,000 or $16,000 a year, and you are trying to pay for prescription \ndrugs or health care, $560 is, in fact, a lot of money. Worse, if we \nmoved toward that Chained CPI, Social Security benefits, by the time a \nsenior reached 85, he or she would receive $1,000 less a year, which \nwould be a 6.5-percent cut in their benefits.\n  So we are in an unusual moment in that the people who helped cause \nthis recession--the greedy people on Wall Street whose recklessness, \nwhose greed, whose illegal behavior drove us into this recession--are \nnot being asked to contribute one nickel toward deficit reduction. They \nwere bailed out by the American people, and in many respects they are \nnow doing better than they did before the Wall Street crash.\n  Many here are saying, my Republicans friends especially: No, Wall \nStreet CEOs making tens of millions a year, who helped cause this \nrecession, do not have to contribute one penny toward deficit \nreduction. But if you are an 85-year-old senior citizen who is \nstruggling to take care of basic necessities, well, my goodness, we are \ngoing to have to do deficit reduction on your back.\n  That is not what America is supposed to be about, and that is not \nwhat the American people want. Poll after poll suggests the American \npeople believe we should move toward deficit reduction based on the \nconcept of shared sacrifice; that we are all in this together.\n  Even if you are a millionaire and you make a whole lot of campaign \ncontributions, and, yes, if you are a billionaire and you have \nlobbyists running all over Capitol Hill, you know what. You are going \nto have to help us with deficit reduction. And, yes, given the fact \nthat we have major corporation after major corporation--oil companies \nand Wall Street--making billions of dollars in profits and in some \ncases paying nothing in taxes, guess what. We are going to do away with \nthose loopholes so they start contributing toward deficit reduction. \nGiven the fact we have tripled military funding since 1997, yes, we are \ngoing to have to make some cuts in military spending.\n  Let me conclude by simply saying: Yes, we have to reduce our deficit \nand deal with our national debt. But the issue is not a big deal or a \nsmall deal, the issue must be a fair deal--one which protects Social \nSecurity, Medicare, Medicaid, the needs of working families, and a \ndeficit-reduction approach which asks the wealthiest people and the \nlargest corporations to also participate in deficit reduction.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/19/senate-section/article/S4660-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4660]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of H.R. 2055, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2055) making appropriations for military \n     construction, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and related \n     agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2012, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Coburn (for McCain) amendment No. 553, to eliminate the \n     additional amount of $10,000,000, not included in the \n     President's budget request for fiscal year 2012, appropriated \n     for the Department of Defense for planning and design for the \n     Energy Conservation Investment Program.\n       Johnson (SD) modified amendment No. 556, of a perfecting \n     nature.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, as we begin our third day \nof debate on the Military Construction-VA appropriations bill, I would \nlike to encourage my colleagues to file any amendments they may have as \nsoon as possible, as we would like to begin disposing of amendments in \nshort order. While we are waiting, I would like to take a few moments \nto talk about the VA portion of this bill.\n  The bill totals $58.6 billion in discretionary spending for the VA in \nfiscal year 2012. Additionally, the bill contains $52.5 billion in \nadvance appropriations for health care for our vets. One of the very \nfew funding increases above the budget request contained in this bill \nis for VA medical research. As every Senator knows, the unique combat \nsituations in Afghanistan and Iraq have left many vets suffering \nsignificant injuries, including PTSD and TBI. We have a moral \nresponsibility to take care of those who have put their lives on the \nline to defend our Nation and it would be shortsighted to cut funding \nfor critical research designed to improve medical outcomes from \ninjuries suffered on the battlefield.\n  Over the last several years, tremendous progress has been made by the \nDepartment in reducing the number of homeless vets. According to the \nVA, in 2005 an estimated 195,000 vets experienced homelessness on any \ngiven night. Today that figure is down to 75,600. Progress is being \nmade and this bill continues those efforts.\n  The bill also includes funding for the VA to transform from a \nDepartment heavily dependent on paper to a modern agency that leverages \ntechnology to shorten the time vets have to wait for services. The \nfunds contained in this bill are necessary for the VA to deploy its \nautomated claims processing system on time.\n  These are only a few highlights of the VA title of the Military \nConstruction-VA appropriations bill. As I have mentioned from the \noutset, this bill is a result of a bipartisan effort. Again, I urge my \ncolleagues to file any amendments they may have so that we can continue \nto make progress in moving this bill toward final passage.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nCollins be added as a cosponsor to amendment No. 556.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I wish to begin by expressing my \nappreciation for the remarks of the Senator from South Dakota about the \nneed to help our veterans, particularly those who have been serving in \nthese recent endeavors. I wish to express my personal appreciation once \nagain for the service his own son has given our country during this \nperiod, and to the service of the Senator from Illinois, the ranking \nRepublican on this bill, as well as to my own son for having served as \nan enlisted marine and infantryman in Ramadi, Iraq, through some of the \nworst fighting of that war.\n  I rise today to discuss two amendments Senator Warner and I have \nfiled to this particular bill. Each relates to the Navy's proposal to \nhomeport a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier at Naval Station Mayport in \nFlorida by 2019.\n  One amendment would eliminate funding of nearly $15 million for a \nNavy\n\n[[Page S4661]]\n\nmilitary construction project--a four-lane divided highway on the naval \nstation. The Navy describes it as the first in a series of what will be \nincreasingly expensive projects required to enable the Navy to create a \nsecond homeport for aircraft carriers on the east coast.\n  The second amendment would eliminate approximately $15 million for \narchitectural planning and design services for a number of follow-on \nmilitary construction projects at Mayport tied, again, to carrier \nhomeporting.\n  This is a slippery slope. The Navy says it will cost more than $\\1/2\\ \nbillion in one-time costs to homeport a nuclear-powered aircraft \ncarrier in Mayport. Other recurring costs will push the expense much \nhigher. In fact, there are estimates these costs could achieve more \nthan $1 billion by the end of this decade.\n  The reason for filing these amendments is straightforward. We owe it \nto the American taxpayers, as well as to the integrity of our DOD \nbudget process. The Department of Defense has been directed to achieve \nreductions in defense spending totaling hundreds of billions of \ndollars. No part of that budget should be off-limits, especially a \nduplicative, redundant project such as the Navy's carrier homeporting \nplan for Mayport.\n  I wish to make it clear at the outset that this is not a Virginia v. \nFlorida issue, although there are strong political implications in both \nVirginia and in Florida for this move. I have been involved in one way \nor another with naval service since I was 17 years old, and I will \ncontinue to be involved in one way or another long after I am involved \nas a Senator in the Senate.\n  I support the Navy's requirement to sustain the naval station at \nMayport in some fashion, but speaking as a former Secretary of the \nNavy, I wish to point out there are other ways to get there. I question \nthe fiscal responsibility and the strategic necessity to homeport an \naircraft carrier in Mayport when less expensive homeporting \nalternatives do exist.\n  These amendments are directed toward necessary congressional \noversight. The GAO has initiated an independent analysis of \nalternatives. Its assessment will be completed next spring. Before we \ncommit to a plan to build expensive, redundant, nuclear-supported \ninfrastructure on the east coast with long-term spending implications, \nour views on the Navy's proposal should be informed by this GAO study.\n  Let me explain my hesitations about this project. First, the Navy is \nproposing to expand a facility at the same time the size of its fleet \nhas radically declined. This chart shows the size of the U.S. Navy \nactive ship force vessels levels from 1970 until today. In 1970, the \nU.S. Navy had 743 active ships. Today they have 284 deployable battle \nforce ships. It is rather ironic as I stand here today because when I \nwas Secretary of the Navy in the late 1980s, the Navy had exactly twice \nas many combatants as it does today--568 combatants. It is only logical \nthat the Navy's shore footprint should reflect this reality. The Navy's \nplan to build a large duplicative facility for aircraft carriers in \nMayport contradicts this logic.\n  In 1970, with 19 aircraft carriers, which is this line showing the \nhistorical trend on aircraft carriers, the Navy homeported carriers at \n6 locations. As the number of aircraft carriers has declined from 19 to \n11 today, the number of their homeports has held fairly constant. There \nare now 5. So when we had 19 aircraft carriers in the Navy, they \nhomeported them at 6 locations.\n  Today, with 11 aircraft carriers and 1, quite frankly, at risk, which \nI will speak to in a minute, we have 5. The Navy has upgraded its \nfacilities and home ports on the west coast and in Japan, as well as \nour east coast home port in Norfolk to accommodate today's all-nuclear \ncarrier fleet. With a fleet less than half the size of what it was in \n1970--almost one-third of the size of what it was in 1970--it is only \nlogical that we do not require the same number of shore facilities to \nsupport it.\n  Quite frankly, if I had $1 billion to spend, I think I would buy a \ncouple of ships with it and try to get the Navy up to its stated goal, \nwhich I support, of 313 combatants. These are issues of fiscal \nresponsibility--where the Navy puts its money.\n  Over the past 5 years, the Navy has had validated unfunded \nrequirements--validated unfunded requirements--of more than $50 billion \nacross its operations, military construction, modernization and \nacquisition programs. I believe it is more fiscally responsible for the \nNavy to reduce these unfunded requirements than it would be for them to \nbuild a redundant facility.\n  From fiscal year 2008 through 2012, the Navy reported unfunded \npriorities totaling $11.8 billion. These are priorities totaling $11.8 \nbillion. They cover shipbuilding, aircraft procurement, aviation and \nship maintenance, military construction, and other programs--all for \nfuture readiness needs.\n  The Navy's backlog in critical modernization repair projects at the \nfour naval shipyards increased to $3.5 billion in fiscal year 2010 as a \nresult of inadequate investment. The Navy acknowledges that the growing \nrisk for shipyard operations is a major concern. Overall, the Navy's \nshorewide modernization backlog grew to $39.2 billion last year--up \nnearly $3 billion from the previous year. Simply stated, the Navy needs \nto do a better job of managing its existing facilities.\n  So I ask my colleagues: How can we be sympathetic to the Navy's \nrequest for additional funding to cover such shortfalls when it wants \nto invest up to $1 billion in an ill-advised, duplicative carrier \nhomeporting project in Mayport?\n  There has been much discussion about the strategic justification and \nramifications of only having one nuclear aircraft homeport on the east \ncoast. Let me talk about that. First, the Navy says the new homeport is \nneeded to mitigate the risk of a terrorist attack, accident, or natural \ndisaster at the homeporting facility in Norfolk. However, every Navy \nrisk assessment states there is a low risk of such events occurring in \nthe Hampton Roads region. Alternate maintenance facilities for a \ncarrier exist at Norfolk Naval Shipyard and the private shipyard in \nNewport News. Last year, I supported projects at Mayport to cover this \npossibility as well--to dredge its channel and modernize a pier so that \na carrier could make a routine port visit there in the unlikely event \nthat operations in Norfolk were interrupted so that a carrier could use \nMayport in an emergency.\n  There has been some talk about the need for strategic dispersal. I \nrecognize that concept. There have been photographs of Pearl Harbor \nwith battleship row, with the ships bunched together, showing how the \nJapanese aircraft were able to knock them out in 1941. There was \njustification for the Navy's concept of dispersal during the Cold War. \nBut even then many critics from GAO were faulting the Navy at a time \nwhen I was at the Pentagon for its lack of a focused threat assessment \nto justify what some people were calling ``strategic home-porking''--\nputting ships in too many different locations.\n  Today's threats are entirely different, and I would make the rather \nironic note that dispersal in many ways has occurred through reduction. \nI will say this again: The U.S. Navy today is one-half the size it was \nwhen I was Secretary of the Navy, when we had 568 combatants. A certain \namount of dispersal has occurred by the dwindling size of the Navy.\n  The second point is a conventional Pearl Harbor-type attack is very \nunlikely. Secretary of Defense Panetta mentioned this during his Senate \nconfirmation hearing in June:\n\n       The next Pearl Harbor that we confront could very well be a \n     cyber attack that cripples our power systems, our grid, our \n     security systems, our financial systems, and our governmental \n     systems.\n\n  I do not minimize the need to protect our fleet from any sort of \nattack. We have done an extraordinarily good job of that in the Norfolk \narea with high-tech defensive systems. This is not the same type of \nsituation that people have talked about in terms of what happened at \nPearl Harbor in 1941.\n  Another point is that less expensive homeporting options do exist. \nOur Navy's own studies identify other less-expensive options to sustain \nthe facility at Mayport, and I do believe Mayport as a Navy town is \nvery important to the interests of our country and to that region. It \nis an important naval base. But we have a clear responsibility to find \nmore cost-effective, more strategically responsible ways to do that.\n  Again, if I had $1 billion I would put it into ships. If I were \nlooking for the\n\n[[Page S4662]]\n\nright kind of ship to go to Florida, I would look for amphibious and \nsmaller ships so we don't have to build these highly expensive, \nnuclear-capable facilities that, again, are redundant.\n  I must also note that pressures to reduce the Navy budget are getting \nworse. Last week, Marine Corps GEN James Cartwright, the Vice Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff, highlighted this challenge, saying that \nthe Defense Department is ``looking at all options'' to reduce its \nbudget by $400 billion over the next 10 years. General Cartwright then \nconfirmed that the Navy was considering such options as delaying the \nconstruction of a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier or possibly \ncancelling a future aircraft carrier acquisition.\n  The effects of these budget pressures are manifested in the fleet \ntoday. The Navy's readiness for aviation squadrons and its surface \nships has continued to decline since 2007, owing to inadequate funding \nfor maintenance, deferred availabilities, and the fleet's high \noperational tempo. In their testimony on Navy readiness to the \nReadiness Subcommittee on the House side just last week, the Navy \nwitnesses said, ``This is unsustainable over the long term.''\n  So do we want to spend $1 billion on a redundant homeport at the \nexpense of building ships and maintaining our fleet? I would encourage \nmy colleagues to consider a commonsense approach and to take a year's \ntime out before embarking on a duplicative enterprise that the Navy \nsimply cannot afford. The service has far too many higher priorities, \nunfunded requirements, and readiness problems on its plate.\n  The GAO study will be comprehensive, it will be rigorous, and it will \ngive us the information we need to make informed judgments next year \nregarding the Navy's homeporting plan for Mayport. There is no cause to \nrush to judgment now. There is $30 million that could be saved \npresently.\n  As I said, this is a slippery slope that could take us down the road \nto $1 billion. We don't need it. We need the money in other areas in \nthe Navy budget.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida, Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the \nstrategic dispersal of our naval fleet, and how this is vital to our \nnational security. Why is strategic dispersal important? Well, we only \nhave to look back a few decades to December 7, 1941, to see why all of \nour eggs should not be in one basket.\n  In the Pacific fleet, our Navy has had the forethought to station our \nmost priceless assets at four different homeports--San Diego, \nBremerton, Everett, and Japan. The Navy has been slow, however, to \naccomplish the same thing with our Atlantic fleet. When the last \nconventionally powered aircraft carrier, the John F. Kennedy, was \ndecommissioned in 2007, we had a problem. All five nuclear carriers \nwere now in one homeport Norfolk, VA. So since 2007 this has heightened \nthe national security threat.\n  The threat could be an asymmetric one like the USS Cole bombing or \nthe sinking of a freighter in the 15-mile-long channel at Norfolk, \nwhich would bottle up the carriers in port.\n  If we have learned anything, it should be this--we are not \ninvulnerable to attacks or to the whims of Mother Nature, nor are we \nvery good at anticipating when and where the next catastrophe will \noccur. Mayport, unlike Norfolk's carrier berths, is at the mouth of the \nriver, adjacent to the ocean, with a protected harbor from the \ncommercial ship channel.\n  The President's budget request supports the infrastructure \nimprovements needed in order to homeport a carrier in Mayport, FL, in \n2019. Why? The Chief of Naval Operations, ADM Gary Roughead, said that \n``Moving a carrier to Mayport is needed regardless of cost.'' The \nSecretary of the Navy, Ray Mabus, said ``We have to disperse our \ncarrier fleet, from a naval standpoint; it's something we have to do.''\n  The cost to homeport a CVN at Mayport is much less, almost half, of \nwhat the Navy anticipated. The Government Accountability Office \nestimates that the total cost of remaining projects will be from $258 \nmillion to $356 million, instead of $537 million. Indeed, this is cheap \ninsurance when you consider the costs of replacing a carrier at $11.5 \nbillion.\n  The military decision to disperse the fleet has been studied and \nrestudied. Admiral after admiral, Secretary after Secretary have all \ntestified keeping a second Atlantic homeport is essential to national \nsecurity. The U.S. Congress has supported this decision for years.\n  The Senate Armed Services Committee and the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee both have recommended the full funding of the President's \nbudget request for Mayport improvements in 2012. The carrier move \nenjoys broad, bipartisan support in this Chamber.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 568\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise to make pending the Vitter \namendment which is at the desk, and I will be happy to explain what it \nis about. If it is necessary, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and make the Vitter amendment pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to waive reading \nof the admendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment by number.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Vitter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 568.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide that none of the funds appropriated or otherwise \n   made available by this Act may be obligated or expended at a rate \n    higher than the level of the Senate and House of Representative \n           concurrent budget resolution for fiscal year 2012)\n\n       On page 117, between lines 12 and 13, insert the following:\n       Sec. 410. None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by this Act shall exceed the level of the \n     concurrent budget resolution for fiscal year 2012.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I will read it. It is very short, and I \nwill explain it. This amendment simply says:\n\n       None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available \n     by this Act shall exceed the level of the concurrent budget \n     resolution for fiscal year 2012.\n\n  That is the entire amendment.\n  The point this amendment makes is a pretty simple but a basic and \nimportant one. We do not have a concurrent budget resolution for fiscal \nyear 2012. We are in the process of passing an appropriations bill, \nspending money without a budget, without a game plan, without a \nframework. That is clearly putting the cart before the horse and \nclearly having things backward in a dysfunctional process.\n  Every Louisiana family, every Louisiana small business, as families \nand businesses do in Minnesota, sits down and makes a budget, and then \nthey spend money under that budget. That is the rational, \nstraightforward way to do things. Unfortunately, that is not what we \nare doing in Congress and in the Senate.\n  This simple, straightforward process is not only rational, it is not \nonly commonsensical, it is also required by law. Under Federal law, the \nCongress is mandated to pass a budget, to pass a concurrent budget \nresolution by April 15 of every year. We are months beyond April 15--\nseveral months and counting--and not only do we not have this required \nbudget, this game plan, this framework which we are supposed to be \nliving by, but on the Senate side we have not even made a meaningful \neffort to get there.\n  The distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee has not made an \neffort in committee to come up with a Senate budget resolution. There \nhas been no effort in committee, and so no Senate budget has been sent \nto the floor. In fact, the same thing happened in the previous fiscal \nyear. So we are now not just several months past this year's April 15 \ndeadline, but we are over 800 days since the last time we had a budget \nresolution as required by Federal law--800 days, over 800 days and \ncounting.\n  I am afraid this is exactly the sort of thing the American people \nshake their\n\n[[Page S4663]]\n\nheads at. This is exactly the sort of thing they scratch their heads \nabout, shake their heads at, and say: What is wrong in Washington?\n  Every Louisiana family has a budget they have to live within. Every \nLouisiana small business has a budget and that is their framework and \nthey operate within that. Yet Congress, apparently, does not get it, \nparticularly the Senate does not get it under this majority leadership \nand is not even making an attempt to do what is not only a good, sound \nidea but is required by Federal law.\n  Again, I just suggest we put first things first: We have a budget and \nthen we only spend money, only pass appropriations bills pursuant to \nand consistent with that budget. That is why, again, my amendment is \nvery simple:\n\n       None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available \n     by this Act shall exceed the level of the concurrent budget \n     resolution for fiscal year 2012.\n\n  I urge us all to do the right thing. We will have different ideas \nabout a budget. We will have different priorities. We will have an \nimportant and healthy debate, but we need to follow the law. We need to \nfollow common sense. We need to have a budget and then only pass \nspending and appropriations bills under that budget and consistent with \nit.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I share very much the sentiments of my \ncolleague from Louisiana, Mr. Vitter, but I would urge us to not \nsupport the amendment because the Senate has already ruled on this \nquestion.\n  When we debated whether to take up this bill, we voted on a cloture \nmotion in order to bring up an appropriations bill. Normally, we would \nwant to pass a budget resolution before bringing up an appropriations \nbill, and it has been, I think, over 800 days since the leadership of \nthis institution has even written and presented a budget. But I would \nput forward that this bill is rather unique because it conforms to the \nHouse Paul Ryan budget that passed the House on April 15. The \nlegislation before us has come before the Senate because Chairman \nJohnson and I have agreed to put forward a VA-MILCON bill that is \n$1.255 billion in discretionary budget authority below the President's \nrequest. We are coming in $620 million below the 2011 enacted level.\n  We all remember that the House of Representatives has already adopted \nthe MILCON-VA appropriations bill under Chairman Culberson, and the \nSenate bill actually spends in budget authority on the discretionary \nside $2.5 million less than the House bill. Because we did that, 71 to \n26 was the vote on cloture to bring up this bill, including the support \nof the Republican leader, Mr. McConnell, and our vice chairman on the \nRepublican side of the Appropriations Committee, Mr. Cochran.\n  I do think for a bill that has been endorsed by the Veterans of \nForeign Wars and other veterans service organizations, a bill that gets \nthe Senate moving again for its regular duties as part of the \nappropriations process, and for a bill that actually cuts funding--\nChairman Johnson and I have reduced funding in 24 separate programs in \nthis budget, including denying a brandnew courthouse for the Court of \nAppeals for Veterans Claims and pressuring the Army, for example, when \nwe found a proposal to spend $1.4 million on a general's garden in \nGermany. When all those 24 reductions were made--when we denied the new \nbuilding, when we made the other reductions--we came in with a bill \nthat is below the bill passed by the House of Representatives.\n  That is why this legislation has come up. That is why the Senate \nvoted 71 to 26 for cloture to bring up the bill. I would just put \nforward that the fact is, this bill does actually comply with a budget. \nIt complies with the budget of the House of Representatives, which is \nwhy it has such strong bipartisan support.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I congratulate Senator Kirk for bringing \nthis legislation to the floor and getting it through committee in a way \nthat is indicative of where we need to go. We were sent here not to \nincrease spending. We were sent here to try to find a sensible way of \nmoving forward by reducing expenditures and still providing essential \nservices that only the Federal Government can provide. His subcommittee \nand committee have done that with this bill before us.\n  I commend him for bringing this in under budget. Savings actually \nhave occurred. We are changing the culture of the Senate from one of \nincreasing spending to one of oversight and looking carefully at how \nWashington spends taxpayer dollars. Every dollar is important. We have \na lot of those dollars stacked up, in terms of debt, that have to be \naddressed. Looking at each appropriations bill and getting them through \nregular order is how the Senate needs to function. We know we cannot \nget there until we settle this debt limit situation with a sensible, \nrational plan that is credible with financial markets.\n  I have looked at details of this legislation as a member of the \nAppropriations Committee, and I think the Senator from Illinois and his \ncolleague, the chairman, Senator Johnson, have come forward with a very \ngood product that addresses our military construction needs and our \nwelfare benefits and does it in a way that shows we can achieve \nsavings.\n  What I wish to speak about is the balanced budget amendment we will \nbe dealing with later this week. When I first came to Congress, I \ncommitted to the people of Indiana to support a balanced budget \namendment. I have watched the process, and since I have left office and \nnow come back, I have continued to watch the process, and we simply \ndon't have that discipline that enables us to keep our fiscal house in \nbalance.\n  There are so many temptations as a Member of Congress to say yes to \neverybody. Everybody pleads their cause. They come in and make their \ncase. Over the years, our country has accumulated gradually a \nsubstantial amount of debt that we no longer can afford.\n  Washington needs something that locks us into a commitment to be \ncareful with taxpayers' money and not spend more than we take in. Every \nfamily understands this. There is a point at which we simply have to \nsay stop spending at this rate because we cannot afford it. Every \nbusiness understands that. Most of our local governments and State \ngovernments are now realizing that.\n  As we see across the country, very drastic steps need to be taken to \nget the fiscal house back in order. That hasn't happened yet at the \nFederal level. Thankfully, we have before us this week attempt to \ndebate and address the issue of a constitutionally mandated balanced \nbudget. I look forward to that debate.\n  Let's just look back at a little history. When the balanced budget \namendment came before the Senate in 1997, our Nation's debt stood at \n$5.36 trillion. Today, the debt has accelerated to $14.3 trillion and, \nas we know, it is accelerating even faster and climbing toward much \nhigher numbers. We are borrowing more than 40 cents of every $1 we \nspend. That is unsustainable. Ultimately, it is having a negative \nimpact on our economy, but it will continue to have an ever-increasing \nnegative impact in the future if we do not get our fiscal house in \norder.\n  We clearly need a commitment. When we put our hand on the Bible and \nraise our right hand and swear to uphold the Constitution of the United \nStates, that includes a commitment to be careful with the taxpayers' \ndollars and particularly understand the impact that deficit spending \nhas on our economy and on unemployment--a commitment to be open and \nfair and upfront with the taxpayers who are funding all this.\n  Our State of Indiana has to go before the taxpayers each year and say \nthis is a nice proposal, but this is how much it is going to cost. If \nwe, the taxpayers, want to pay for such a proposal with increased taxes \nor we want to pay for it by reducing spending somewhere else, one of \nthose processes will keep us in balance. Congress cannot end this \nsession without achieving that balance. Our State has to go through \nthat every\n\n[[Page S4664]]\n\nyear. That is true of the majority of the States in this country.\n  That doesn't happen here in Washington. We just borrow more and worry \nabout it later. The end of that road is here. We have hit the wall. \nLater is no longer a viable option. More debt is no longer a viable \noption. Without a constructive plan in place to address this now, we \nare going to continue to, in my opinion, remain at a stalemate. There \nis a lot going on in the Senate. There have been hours upon hours of \ndiscussions. Both sides, together, are trying to figure out a plan that \nwill put us on a path to fiscal responsibility, which can both pass the \nHouse and the Senate.\n  The opportunity now is here to include in that plan a balanced budget \namendment. We know it is going to take time to pass this. It requires a \ntwo-thirds vote of each House. If passed and agreed on, it has to be \nsent to the States, and three-quarters of the States have to ratify it. \nIf the American people understood that behind whatever plan we put in \nplace to deal with our fiscal problems we had a balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution in place, they would have assurance that \nwe are on the right track. I think that signal to the financial markets \nand the world. It would show that the United States is aware of its \nproblem, has taken action, and is getting its fiscal house in order. \nThe dollar will stay the world's currency, and America will remain the \nsafest haven in the world to invest.\n  We are seeing debt crises all over the world, and we see our own \ndollar being challenged. The rating agencies are coming forward and \nannouncing the possibility of a drop in our credit rating. The \nstatistics show that a 1-percentage point increase in interest rates--\nwhich investors will demand if we don't show them a credible plan--\nproduces, over a 10-year period, $1.3 trillion of extra money that we \nwill have to spend to cover our debt. We simply cannot continue this \nprocess and ignore the problem. The time to do it is now.\n  Is it difficult? Yes. We have been trying to debate this and work on \nit ever since January. We are not there yet, and the clock is ticking \ntoward August 2. A balanced budget amendment will help enforce a debt-\nreduction plan and gain the confidence of the American people that this \nwill not just be something overturned by the next Congress, and it will \nnot just be a piece of paper that doesn't have a long-term effect. \nBacking up a plan with a balanced budget amendment will provide the \nassurance that going forward America will tend to its fiscal needs and \nstay strong as a nation financially, as well as every other aspect.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask for 10 minutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise to address an issue of fairness \nfor our National Guard soldiers. They serve with honor and bravery at \nhome and abroad. They have earned the respect and admiration of an \nentire Nation with their incredible sacrifices over the last decade.\n  We must not forget they have also, in addition to our respect and \nadmiration, earned their compensation and their benefits. To take back \na veteran's compensation after she or he has fulfilled the requirements \nfor it is unthinkable. Yet that is exactly what is happening around the \ncountry in regard to National Guard bonuses.\n  Let me share the story of PFC Chelsea Wells. This story is emblematic \nof the struggle many men and women in the National Guard are facing \ntoday.\n  I thank Congressman Walden for bringing this situation to the \npublic's attention and to my attention. I add my voice to his to call \nfor fairness for PFC Chelsea Wells and for all other members of the \nNational Guard.\n  Private First Class Wells is from my home State of Oregon, where she \nhas served in the Oregon National Guard for the last 3 years.\n  In 2007, she enlisted as an intelligence analyst in response to the \nneeds of the Army. At the time when she signed her enlistment document, \nshe signed an additional document that stipulated she would receive a \n$20,000 bonus for enlisting in a critical Military Occupancy Specialty \nor MOS.\n  That agreement, which was also signed by the enlisting official at \nher processing station, also stated she would receive the first half of \nher bonus upon completion of her initial training and the second half \nafter 36 months of service.\n  As planned, Private First Class Wells received that first $10,000 \nupon completion of her initial training. However, when her 36 months of \nservice was completed, the second half of the bonus was nowhere to be \nseen. In fact, it was denied.\n  Following an inquiry from Congressman Walden, the National Guard \nstated the payments had been denied because her specialty was not on \nthe critical skills list at the date of enlistment. However, the very \ndocument Private First Class Wells signed--also signed by the enlisting \nofficial--very specifically listed her Military Occupancy Specialty, \n35F, as indeed being a critical skill specialty.\n  I have that document here: ``Annex E to Defense Department Form 4, \nNon-prior Service Enlistment Bonus Addendum.''\n  It says the purpose of this form is ``to explain and confirm \nobligation and to ensure that agreement to these conditions is a matter \nof record.''\n  The entire point of this document is to ensure that there is a clear \nunderstanding in regard to eligibility for bonuses. This document says \non its list of eligibility--and this section is signed by the soldier:\n\n       I am enlisting into a critical skill MOS under the 6x2 or \n     8XO enlistment option and will receive a NPS Critical Skill \n     Bonus (50/50 payment.)\n\n  That means 50 after initial training and 50 at the end of 3 years.\n  At the end of this document, it has section IX, ``Certification by \nService Representative,'' and this is in regard to the enlisting \nofficial, the recruiting officer. It says:\n\n       I certify that I have witnessed the reading and signing of \n     the above agreement and the signature appearing is that of \n     the applicant. I have verified the soldier meets the \n     eligibility requirement of NGR 600-7, paragraph 2-3, and the \n     applicant's MOS/unit is currently eligible for an enlistment \n     cash bonus.\n\n  I think that is pretty clear. The story gets even worse. Not only is \nour own military saying they are not going to award the second half of \nthe bonus, but they want her to return the first half because, \napparently, they made some kind of mistake in between the recruiting \nofficer and the higher-ups. I must say any individual should have the \nright to a reward that he or she was contractually owed. And there are \nno individuals who deserve their reward more than our brave men and \nwomen in uniform who have already made so many sacrifices, large and \nsmall, to ensure the security and safety of our Nation.\n\n  Private First Class Wells upheld her end of the bargain. She signed \nthis enlistment document in good faith. She answered the call to serve \nwhen she was needed, and she served with honor for the full term. Now \nwe must uphold our promise to her and to other National Guard veterans \nwho find themselves being punished due to a dispute that was no fault \nof their own. They signed these documents in good faith, with the \ncertification of the listing officer that they were indeed eligible. \nWhat is absolutely clear is that whatever dispute there may be between \nthe listing officers and authorities higher up the chain, that is not \nChelsea Wells' fault. She served in good faith under a very clear \ndocument, and we owe her and all the National Guard soldiers who are \nbeing pursued in the same fashion the bonuses that were promised to \nthem.\n  We ask a tremendous amount of those who serve. Now is when we should \nbe giving back, not asking for more. Asking a soldier to give back \nmoney they have received under a document they signed in good faith and \nfulfilled in good faith is 100 percent unacceptable. I and my \ncolleagues from the State of Oregon call on the National Guard today to \nresolve this matter and to make sure this wrong is made right.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S4665]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 570, As Modified\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending business to call up my amendment, amendment No. 570, as \nmodified.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Wyden], for himself and Mr. \n     Merkley, proposes an amendment numbered 570.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide for the closure of Umatilla Army Chemical Depot, \n                                Oregon)\n\n       On page 84, between lines 5 and 6, insert the following:\n       Sec. 127. (a) Closure of Umatilla Army Chemical Depot, \n     Oregon.--The closure of the Umatilla Army Chemical Depot, \n     Oregon, and subsequent management and property disposal, may \n     be carried out in accordance with procedures and authorities \n     contained in the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of \n     1990 (part A of title XXIX of Public Law 101-510; 10 U.S.C. \n     2687 note).\n       (b) Retention of Property and Facilities.--The Secretary of \n     the Army may retain minimum essential ranges, facilities, and \n     training areas at Umatilla Army Chemical Depot, totaling \n     approximately 7,500 acres, as a training enclave for the \n     reserve components of the Armed Forces to permit the conduct \n     of individual and annual training.\n       (c) Office of Economic Adjustment Activities.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Office of \n     Economic Adjustment Activities of the Department of Defense \n     may make grants and supplement other Federal funds, using \n     funds made available by title, in connection with the closure \n     and management and disposal provided for in this section, and \n     the projects so supported shall be considered to be \n     authorized by law.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I ask for the immediate consideration of \namendment No. 570, as modified.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The amendment has been reported. It \nis now pending.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, when we have a conflict or a problem in \nmy home State, we resolve it the Oregon way: by finding consensus and \nbuilding common ground.\n  That is why, when it became apparent 20 years ago that the U.S. \nArmy's Chemical Depot in Umatilla, OR, would be closing once all the \nchemical weapons were destroyed, the community leaders gathered all the \nstakeholders and began the process of planning what to do with the land \nonce the facility closed. The Umatilla Depot straddles two counties, \nseveral cities, and historic tribal lands, so there are a lot of folks \nin my home State who are interested in what happens to the land.\n  As progress was made in destroying the weapons at Umatilla, the \ncommunity built common ground and found a genuine consensus. The \nFederal Government would support it. It gave more than $1 million in \nassistance. When the facility was listed in the 2005 BRAC \nrecommendations for closure, the Pentagon eventually recognized the \ngroup of stakeholders as an official Local Reuse Authority.\n  Everything appeared on track until last month. That was when, at the \neleventh hour, the Pentagon changed the rules. After decades of \nplanning and $1 million in preparation, a lawyer at the Pentagon \ndecided to reinterpret the law and declared that the 2005 BRAC report--\nwhich became law when Congress didn't pass a resolution of \ndisapproval--didn't matter. That lawyer decided that the Umatilla Depot \nwould be closed outside of the BRAC authority because the last of the \nchemical weapons wouldn't be destroyed until after the 6-year limit for \ncompletion of BRAC actions. What this lawyer either didn't know or \nsomehow missed is that this was precisely the intention of the BRAC \nCommission when they put the Umatilla Depot on the closure list.\n  The BRAC report discusses the fact that the mission of destroying the \nchemical weapons wouldn't be completed until after the deadline. On \npage 239 of the report, the Commission found that Secretary Rumsfeld's \nassertion that the chemical demilitarization mission at Umatilla would \nbe complete by the second quarter of this year was optimistic. The \nCommission wrote:\n\n       An examination of status information for the depot's \n     mission completion and subsequent closure revealed that dates \n     may slip beyond the 6-year statutory period for completion of \n     the BRAC actions.\n\n  Therefore, the Commission took the Secretary of Defense's \nrecommendation ``Close Umatilla Chemical Depot, OR'' and changed it to \n``On completion of the chemical demilitarization mission in accordance \nwith treaty obligations, close Umatilla Chemical Depot, OR.''\n  These facts make it clear the Commission did not--as the Pentagon has \nclaimed recently--make a conditional recommendation that the facility \nonly be closed if the chemical demilitarization mission is completed by \nSeptember of 2011. Rather, the Commission acknowledged that the closure \nwill have to happen when the demilitarization mission is completed even \nif that is after September of 2011. That decision by the Commission \nbecame law.\n  It is also important to note that the Commission is aware that the \ndemilitarization mission had a deadline of its own. Under the terms of \nthe Chemical Weapons Convention Treaty, Umatilla must complete the \nmission by April 29, 2012.\n  UMCD will meet this deadline, if not beat it. The Commission was not \ngiving authority for the mission at UMCD to be one of a never-ending \nnature. They were simply giving UMCD the additional 8 months provided \nunder the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n  The depot should be closed under BRAC so the will of the community, \nin the form of the local reuse authority, and the will of Congress in \nthe BRAC law will be taken into account.\n  I strongly believe the local community should decide what to do with \nthe land and not somebody who is off in the basement of the Pentagon.\n  I have spoken with Secretary Panetta about this matter, and he is \nfully supportive of our efforts.\n  I wish to also thank Senator Johnson and my good friend from Arizona, \nSenator McCain, who have also been very helpful--and their staff--in \nworking with us. The Pentagon has to implement the law as it is, not, \nin my view, as it wants. But since the lawyers at the Pentagon have in \nrecent weeks thought there was some ambiguity, I wished to clarify it \nfor them with the amendment that has been modified with the good \ncounsel of the staff of Senator McCain.\n  Let me also say, the staff of Senator McCain has been very helpful in \nsaying this would be permissive authority in terms of the Pentagon and \nthat the Senator could join me in a letter making it clear it is \nimportant this be moved expeditiously. I hope we can complete this \nmatter at this time.\n  My amendment, which I offer on behalf of myself and my colleague, \nSenator Merkley, would allow the Pentagon to follow the BRAC \ncommission's report and close the Umatilla Depot under BRAC.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, first of all, I wish to thank the Senator \nfrom Oregon. This is an issue that needs to be resolved, and it has \nbeen a pleasure working with him on not only the behalf of the people \nof Oregon but also on behalf of the Department of Defense.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 564\n\n  Mr. President, I join the Senator from Oklahoma in supporting the \namendment which Senator Coburn had intended to propose. The amendment \nwould have amended Public Law 102-4, the Agent Orange Act of 1991, \nwhich I cosponsored, to provide clarity on the factual basis required \nfor the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to make future determinations on \nthe presumption of connection of military service in Vietnam with \ndiseases associated with exposure to the herbicide commonly known as \nAgent Orange.\n  Agent Orange was unanticipated and certainly not something that at \nthe time, given the scientific knowledge and information we had, was \nthought would be detrimental to the health of the men and women who \nwere serving in the Vietnam war. But the fact is, Agent Orange did have \na very serious health effect on the men and women who were serving and \nthose who came in contact with it. For years, we delayed compensating \nour veterans, those who were exposed to Agent Orange.\n  In 1991, the act was a long overdue answer to questions on the health \neffects of exposure to Agent Orange, and it directed much deserved \ncompensation to our veterans for certain diseases, including non-\nHodgkin's lymphoma and certain cancers.\n  What has happened, and the reason why I appreciate the Senator from\n\n[[Page S4666]]\n\nOklahoma raising this issue, is it has obviously now reached a point \nwhere the Secretary of Veterans Affairs has now expanded the \neligibility to the point where it is beyond any scientific evidence \nthat compensation would be required.\n  In 2006, it was found that the evidence linking ischemic heart \ndisease to exposure to herbicides was inadequate or insufficient. Heart \ndisease, as we all know, is the leading cause of death in America today \nand has been so for decades.\n  In 2008, they updated their findings based on two epidemiological \nstudies which provided ``statistical'' evidence of a relationship. \nStill, they categorized the link between ischemic heart disease and \nexposure to Agent Orange as ``limited or suggestive evidence of an \nassociation.'' That already low standard was further qualified with the \nfollowing statement:\n\n       Epidemiologic evidence suggests an association--\n\n  Suggests an association--\n\n     between exposure to herbicides and the outcome, but a firm \n     conclusion is limited because chance, bias and confounding \n     could not be ruled out with confidence.\n\n  Despite this doubt, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs decided to \ngrant a new presumption for ischemic heart disease, which according to \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs will cost nearly $31.9 billion over \nthe next 10 years. Similarly, with Parkinson's disease, which was also \nfound to be in the category of ``limited or suggestive evidence,'' a \ndecision was made to grant compensation and benefits based on exposure \nto Agent Orange, which according to the VA will cost $3.5 billion over \nthe next 10 years.\n  This process is a risky, hit or miss, and costly way to administer \nthe veterans disability program and resources, which are in scarce \nsupply and which our veterans need and deserve in return for their \nsacrifice to our Nation.\n  In its report to the congressionally mandated Veterans' Disability \nBenefits Commission in 2007, the Institute of Medicine itself found \nthat the ``association'' standard contained in the Agent Orange Act was \ninadequate and potentially misleading. That report recommended the goal \nof the presumptive disability decisionmaking process be to ensure \ncompensation for veterans whose diseases are caused by military service \nand a new primary standard that sufficient evidence to support a \ndetermination of presumption would exist when evidence is sufficient to \nconclude that a causal relationship exists.\n  The Veterans' Disability Benefits Commission endorsed the need for \nestablishing a new framework for presumptions with more transparent \nprocesses, but it failed to take the full step of embracing causality \nin decisionmaking.\n  The amendment my colleague from Oklahoma so bravely intended to offer \nwould have achieved the goal identified by the Institute of Medicine to \nensure that scientifically based causality is at the heart of the \ndisability determination process.\n  My vote in favor of the Agent Orange Act of 1991 was a vote to \ndiscern facts from rhetoric and even politics and to put the welfare of \nour veterans above all other considerations, including costs. My \nsupport of the Coburn amendment would be no different. It is \nappropriate to adopt a clearer, stronger standard for the presumption \nof service-connected disabilities to ensure greater consistency in this \nprocess and, in doing so, to help ensure that our Nation's resources \nare available to provide appropriate compensation and benefits for \nveterans of wars to come.\n  Former Secretary of Veterans Affairs, the Honorable Tony Principi, \nbefore the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, on September 23, 2010, on \nthis very subject--the subject of presumptive disability \ndecisionmaking--said:\n\n       Make no mistake: these decisions do not merely affect those \n     who may or may not receive presumptive service connections \n     and their families. The American people watch these decisions \n     closely, both to ensure that those who have defended our \n     Nation while in uniform are treated fairly, and to ensure \n     that those who have been given the responsibility to \n     administer the program are good stewards of the resources \n     with which they have been entrusted. If the American people \n     lose faith in the integrity of our disability benefits \n     system, veterans and their families will be the ones who \n     suffer. The surest way for that to happen is for the public \n     to be convinced that presumptive service connection decisions \n     are based on anything other than sound scientific advice.\n\n  There is no sound scientific advice that indicates that many of these \ndecisions are valid and directly connected to exposure to Agent Orange. \nI urge the chairman of the committee to look into this issue. We are \ntalking about $31.9 billion and another $3.5 billion which may not be \nnecessary to be spent.\n  I believe and understand the emotion associated with the issue of \nAgent Orange because for so many years our Nation neglected--that was \nnot benign neglect, it was neglect--the plight of veterans who were \nexposed to Agent Orange and the terrible physical problems that ensued \nas a result of that exposure. But now it is pretty clear that the \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs has gone way over in the opposite \ndirection in giving presumptive service connection when there is no \nvalid scientific evidence to convince me that kind of illegibility is \nthere.\n  So I thank my colleague from Oklahoma.\n  I urge the Senator, the distinguished chairman of the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, to look at this issue, look at whether this $31.9 \nbillion, plus $3.5 billion--over $35 billion--over the next 10 years is \nwisely spent. That does not mean we do not provide disability payments \nto those who actually have been exposed and need it. But there is a \nlack of scientific evidence that many of the benefits that are being \nextended are absolutely warranted.\n  So I know the Senator from Oklahoma will not be proposing this \namendment, and I understand that. But I wish to assure the committee \nchairman that when we are talking about this kind of money, we need to \ninvestigate it very seriously and reach decisions which are in the best \ninterests of our veterans. There are veterans out there who need \ncompensation, and every day, unfortunately, we are having young men and \nwomen return from the battlefield who have disabilities as a result of \nserving our Nation in combat. So I hope the chairman of the committee \nwill look at this issue very seriously.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, let me update my colleague. I do plan to \ncall up this amendment, and I do plan to ask for a vote on it because \nit is important. I will call up the amendment in a moment.\n  What has happened--the Senator from Arizona has had the disease \nmelanoma, cancer melanoma at his age. We kind of know somebody at his \nage, if they have large amounts of Sun exposure over prolonged periods \nof time on nevuses or birthmarks, can develop melanoma. There is \ncausation related to that. I have also had melanoma, but I had it as a \nvery young man. What science also knows is that one can develop \nmelanoma without any Sun exposure to a birthmark or a nevus or a mole.\n  What has happened within the VA, we have taken and gone away from \ncausation and gone to any association that could ever be made.\n  I am a survivor of colon cancer. What we know is, our risk for colon \ncancer goes way up if we eat a highly refined diet, with very few \nvegetables, and have that kind of a diet associated also with high \nlevels of sugar. I did not have any of those things, but yet I had \ncolon cancer. Because there is an association, we cannot infer \ncausation.\n  So what is happening now?\n  The Secretary of Veterans Affairs has put us on the hook for people \nwho have no causation but do have association. This amendment, which I \nwill call up, does not change our ability to do that in the future when \nwe, in fact, would see causation. But the presumption that association \nwith the Sun caused my melanoma is wrong. The assumption that my diet \ncaused my colon cancer is wrong. It does cause colon cancers, but we \ncannot show causation.\n  Nobody can speak for veterans better than John McCain, having served \nthe amount of time he did in Vietnam as a prisoner of war. He has the \nbody image that shows his sacrifice. Let me tell you what has happened.\n  We are transferring $\\1/2\\ million to veterans under this decision by \nSecretary Shinseki for people who weigh 350 pounds, smoke three packs \nof cigarettes a day, and have hyperchol-\n\n[[Page S4667]]\n\nesterolemia because they will not take their medicine. We are saying \nthe reason they have heart disease is because, at some point in time \nthey were in Vietnam, because they moved from causation to association.\n  I can think of nothing unfairer to those who are truly needing to \nbenefit from this than to give the benefit to somebody whose lifestyle \nabsolutely caused their heart disease, and there is no association with \ndioxin or Agent Orange, the active ingredient that causes disease, \nwhich we know several of them actually did have. But now we have moved \nto a whole new level where we are saying if someone was exposed, both \nabove or in Vietnam, and they have any of these other diseases which he \nhas listed, that there can be an association.\n  Let me remind you that an association doesn't prove anything about \ncause. It just says there is a statistic out here, and it may be right \nor may not in fact be right. All of the evidence is the other way. The \nSecretary has chosen to spend $42 billion--counting last year and this \nyear--on this program for diseases that are not caused by Agent Orange. \nHow is that fair? How is it fair to the people who are administering \nthis? I found out about it because VA workers called me and said: This \ncannot be right. What are you all doing? Why are you giving money to \npeople who have no association with the disease caused by that? Yet you \nare paying them out of money that should be reserved for those who have \na disease really caused by Agent Orange. Consequently, we are going to \nspend $42 billion that we don't have to pay people.\n  Another interesting fact is, I have a brother who has idiopathic \npancreatitis. The VA told him that under this new guideline he can be \neligible for Agent Orange compensation. He served in Korea, but because \nhe has a chronic disease now, they are lining him up to get a payment \nfrom the VA because he has idiopathic pancreatitis. He is going to get \napproved. There is absolutely no association or causation with that. \nYet that is what is happening.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. 564 be \ncalled up, and the pending amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 564.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

(a) Section 1116(b) of title 38, United States \n     Code, is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (1), by striking ``positive association'' \n     and inserting ``causal relationship''; and\n       (2) by striking paragraph (3).\n       (b) The amendments made by subsection (a) shall apply with \n     respect to determinations made by the Secretary of Veterans \n     Affairs under section 1116 of such title after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. COBURN. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to make it clear that in this \namendment there is no desire to deprive someone who was actually \nexposed to this herbicide called Agent Orange and suffered physical \nconsequences as a result; that this amendment basically draws a \ndifference among three words: One is ``causation,'' which is generally \nthe criteria used in any of these cases, the causation, and that would \nreplace the current ``positive association.''\n  As the Senator just described, positive association could be most any \nencounter that anybody would have had who served. I always thought it \nwas in Vietnam, but now he tells me it is even adding someone who \nserved in Korea.\n  Isn't it true that we are not trying to deprive anyone who was \nlegitimately exposed to Agent Orange and shows the causation, and that \nthey are entitled to benefits from the taxpayers of America? What we \nare talking about, isn't it true, is that ``positive association'' is \nsuch an amorphous definition that it leads to an enormous waste of \ntaxpayer dollars, while there are veterans out there who are in need of \nthese taxpayer dollars for their legitimate reasons?\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, the answer is that the Senator is \nabsolutely correct. We have a lot of science that shows causation with \nthis herbicide and disease. We have made the assumption that any other \nassociation should fall into that same category, such as hairy cell \nleukemia, and we know lots of things about this group to which there is \nonly an association, statistical association, and no correlation, no \ncausation, such as if someone has Parkinson's, they are compensated \nfrom Agent Orange. Yet there is not one scientific study that will show \nthere is any causal relationship between those two diseases.\n  I will answer that I want every veteran to get the compensation due \nthem when they have a disease related to this chemical. If we find in \nthe future more science that would say so, then we will go on the \nscience.\n  Now, we have had a Secretary who doesn't understand the difference \nbetween association and causation, and we are going to spend $42 \nbillion that we don't have, giving it to people whose diseases were not \ncaused by Agent Orange. That is my problem.\n  As a physician, I could never defend myself in a court of law using \nthis logic on anything I would do in practicing medicine. As I stated \nwhile the Senator was talking with the chairman, we have both had \nmelanoma. The Senator's came from something that we know is associated \nwith it and also a cause--it is called the Sun, ultraviolet radiation. \nMine didn't come from that because I didn't have that kind of exposure, \nand I experienced it at a very young age. Under the guidance of the \nSecretary, we both would be compensated as if ultraviolet light was the \ncause of both of our melanomas--the Senator from Arizona, \nappropriately; me, inappropriately.\n  So the fact is, no one ever wants to move back, but this is a mistake \nthe Secretary made. My intent is not to harm any veteran who has a \ndisease that is truly caused by Agent Orange. My intent is to make sure \nwe can have the ability to take care of our veterans in the future by \nspending money wisely to compensate those who are truly injured, truly \ninhibited and limited by their exposure to that as a result of their \nservice to this country.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I first want to say what a good job--\nactually, a wonderful job--the Military Construction Subcommittee \nappropriators have done. They have adopted a very strict budget line, \nthe same as the House of Representatives, and the chairman, Senator \nJohnson, and the ranking member, Senator Kirk, have put together a very \ngood, solid proposal for military construction, and I appreciate \nworking with them. I was the chairman and ranking member of that \nsubcommittee, and I loved working on it because I wanted to take care \nof our troops and to make sure they had the construction they needed \nfor housing and for training headquarters. So I commend the great staff \nof that subcommittee and am very pleased it is continuing in good hands \nsince I have left that committee to go to the Commerce, Justice, \nScience, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.\n  I also want to say that there is so much going on in the Capitol \nright now. I think America is focused on the debt ceiling issue, the \noverwhelming debt we have in this country. We know it is too much, and \nso many have been working in different quarters trying to solve this \nissue.\n  Senator McConnell, the Republican leader, came out with a proposal \nearly this week to try to assure the markets\n\n[[Page S4668]]\n\nand all of the people watching so carefully that we were going to \naddress this issue, even if, in the end, we couldn't come to an \nagreement. So I commend Senator McConnell. He has taken a lot of \ncriticism for the proposal he made, but I think he said from the \nbeginning that it was the last effort so we wouldn't have a default by \nour country. It wasn't his first choice or his second choice or even \nhis third choice, but leaders have to make tough decisions to ensure \nbad things don't happen, if they can avoid leading Members into bad \nsituations. So he was trying to ensure that we wouldn't. I think \nSenator McConnell's proposal has actually spurred people to get going \nand try to come to agreement.\n  I believe the group who is being called the Gang of 6 has come up \nwith some very concrete proposals. It is the first plan I have seen \nthat I believe really begins to cut spending, and it cuts spending \nimmediately. It also has mechanisms that will ensure that the spending \ncuts happen. Caps are put in place.\n  There is a freeze in spending for 4 years. There is a freeze in all \nthe elected representatives' pay. Every Member of Congress and the \nPresident would have a freeze in pay. There is a freeze in budgets.\n  I think it also begins entitlement reform, which is very bold, and it \nis very important that it be done in a bipartisan way. It would go to \nthe chained CPI, which is a better base for determining what kinds of \nincreases there should be for payments that have to be adjusted. So I \nbelieve they have taken a first major step. Now, I put out a Social \nSecurity reform proposal that also lowered the rate of increase of the \nCOLAs. This one does it in a different way. All I wanted to do was to \nmake sure we address that issue as part of Social Security reform, but \nit also affects many other areas, and I think it is something all of \nus, in a bipartisan way, can accept as a reasonable adjustment that \nwill preserve the basic benefits that go across many areas.\n  Also in the proposal that was put out today is a safety net for \npeople at 125 percent of poverty. They will be getting a benefit that \nincreases more--and I think everyone would agree that is a good thing--\nand then the CPI adjustment will be in place for others.\n  I think it also has a very good proposal in the area of taxes because \nthey want to lower the overall rates for everyone and make fewer rate \ngroups, so the top rate would be 29 percent. They even cut the lower \nrate down to 9 percent.\n  So these are good proposals, and I think tax reform is something that \nwill bring in more revenue, and it will bring in more revenue in the \nright way. It will bring in revenue by building the economy, by \nensuring a more fair tax system so there will be less fraud and fewer \nnumbers of people who don't pay taxes.\n  So I think this group has done a good thing--three Democrats and \nthree Republicans working together. Not one of us would have written a \nproposal exactly the same way, but there are 100 in this body, so we \nknow we cannot dictate exactly what we want. I do believe this is a \nresponsible approach that should give us a good start and something \nthat, over a 10-year period, will put us in the position of bringing \ndown our enormous debt, lowering our deficits, lowering our interest \ncosts, and also beginning to reform entitlements.\n  There is going to be so much written and talked about--a lot of \neducation. This plan will begin to go into legislative language, and \nthere may be refinements of it. I am sure there will be amendments. But \nit is a great start, and it has provided great leadership. So many \npeople have been involved in this process--our leaders, the group who \nhas been meeting for months, others who have come together in a \nbipartisan way to do what is right for our country and for our children \nand grandchildren.\n  So I am very pleased we can start this debate and get these things \nout in a way that the American people will have the confidence we are \ngoing to address the debt, do the right thing, bring down the deficits, \nbring down the interest our country is paying, and, most of all, put \npeople back to work by enlivening our economy.\n  That is the key. You can't have 9.1 percent unemployment in this \ncountry and believe that is a recovery. You can't do it. You have to \nput people back to work. That is the way you increase revenue, by \nputting people back to work and having the economy revived. That should \nbe all of our goal, and I think that maybe, just maybe, we are on the \nright track and can do in a bipartisan way the entitlement reforms, the \ntax reforms, and the spending cuts that will put together a package \nthat will put our country on a fiscally responsible path for the \nfuture.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wanted to talk a little bit about our \ndebt ceiling and our deficit and debt issues as well.\n  I wish to thank the Senator from Texas for her words of encouragement \nfor the product that the so-called Gang of 6 read out this morning. It \nwas a remarkable hour. To see roughly 50 Senators, both Republicans and \nDemocrats, set aside the talking points and try to come across a \npartisan divide to hear their colleagues who have been working for such \na long time on a plan, a bipartisan plan, three Democrats and three \nRepublicans, to really try to address in a material way our debt and \nour deficit was, to say the least, refreshing. I wish it weren't as \nunique an experience as it has been, but in the 2\\1/2\\ years I have \nbeen here, I can't remember as thoughtful a conversation as the one we \nhad this morning.\n  I have said for months, month after month, week after week on the \nfloor of the Senate, that I think I am pretty clear about what Colorado \nwants, whether it is red parts of the State or whether it is blue parts \nof the State.\n  They want a plan that materially addresses the problem we face. They \nknow we can't solve it overnight because the hole is so deep, but they \nwant us to move past the rhetoric and the talking points and actually \nstart materially addressing the problem.\n  They want to know that we are all in it together. It took all of us \nto get to this point of a $1.5 trillion deficit and almost $15 trillion \nof debt, and it is going to take all of us to get us out of it, and the \npeople in Colorado know that.\n  They want the plan to be bipartisan because they don't have any \nconfidence in either party's go-it-alone approach on this particular \nset of issues and I think on many other issues as well.\n  The only corollary that I have added to all of that is we need to do \nsomething that satisfies our capital markets that their paper is worth \nwhat we have paid for it and that the full faith and credit of the \nUnited States is good.\n  We face something momentous at this moment in our country. I wanted \nto quote just three brief quotes from the rating agencies recently.\n  This is S, July 14:\n\n       Today's CreditWatch placement signals our view that, owing \n     to the dynamics of the political debate on the debt ceiling, \n     there is at least a one-in-two likelihood, 50 percent chance, \n     that we could lower the long-term rating on the United States \n     within the next 90 days. We have also placed our short-term \n     rating on the U.S. on CreditWatch negative, reflecting our \n     view that the current situation presents such significant \n     uncertainty to the U.S.'s creditworthiness.\n\n  It is important to realize this isn't just about the debt ceiling, \nalthough that is a very important piece of this.\n  Here is S continuing:\n\n       The CreditWatch action reflects our view of two separate \n     but related issues. The first issue is the continuing failure \n     to raise the U.S. government debt ceiling so as to ensure \n     that the government will be able to continue to make \n     scheduled payments. The second pertains to our current view \n     of the likelihood that Congress and the administration will \n     agree on a credible, medium-term fiscal consolidation plan.\n\n  Now, I have taken the view all along that we shouldn't make raising \nthe debt ceiling contingent because it has been a ministerial act for \nmost of our history; it is about debts that are already incurred, not \nabout debts that\n\n[[Page S4669]]\n\nare coming forward. But I understand the politics in the moment and \ntime, and the only point they are trying to make is that we have to do \nsomething material or we are going to be downgraded.\n  Moody's also says: The government bond rating would very likely be \nchanged to negative at the conclusion of the review unless substantial \nand credible agreement is achieved on a budget that includes long-term \ndeficit reduction. To retain a stable outlook, such an agreement should \ninclude a deficit trajectory that leads to stabilization and then \ndecline in the ratios of Federal Government debt-to-GDP and debt-to-\nrevenue beginning with the next few years.\n  They said we are at a unique inflection point.\n  I asked Chairman Bernanke the other day at the Banking Committee--I \nknew the answer, but I asked him anyway--when was the last time our \ncredit ratings were threatened for downgrade. His answer was, not in \nthe 20th century. And I said to him, well, we are now in the 21st \ncentury. The answer was, never. Never in our country's history, that I \nam aware of, has our credit rating--which is the envy of the world and \none of the most important assets that we have as a country and as an \neconomy--been threatened with a downgrade. And now we find ourselves in \nthe position of potentially being downgraded because on the one hand we \nmight not raise the debt ceiling--which I find unimaginable, but it is \npossible--and on the other hand because our politics look so \ndysfunctional to everybody who is watching this debate that there is \nreal concern that we can never get to a long-term debt and deficit plan \nwhere the math actually pencils. What we know about a plan where the \nmath actually pencils is it is going to require a comprehensive \napproach that involves discretionary spending cuts, both for military \nand nonmilitary, that requires entitlement reform and tax reform.\n  A number of weeks ago, Senator Johanns and I sent out a letter that \nsaid just that. We passed it around the Senate offices. There are 32 \nDemocrats who signed it and 32 Republicans who signed it. That is a \npretty big number around here, and that is a pretty bipartisan effort \naround here.\n  Then I began to despair because it didn't feel as if we were making \nprogress toward the goal many of us wanted to get to, and then today we \nhad this conversation with the Gang of 6, who I think have presented a \nplan, as the Senator from Texas said, that is not perfect, and \neverybody is going to have a disagreement about this piece or that \npiece, but does meet the three-part test by and large that I have come \nout to the floor and I have said time and time again that we ought to \nmeet for the people of Colorado, which is whom I represent.\n  What I also know is this: At this remarkable time in the country's \nhistory, if we act in a way that leads to a downgrade of this country's \ncredit rating; if we, the 100 people who are in the Senate at this \nmoment, don't step up to make sure that doesn't happen, no one is ever \ngoing to care what pledge was made about this or that or where we drew \nthe line in the sand. The only thing they are going to know about us is \nwe allowed the full faith and credit of the United States to be \ncompromised for all time. No generation of Americans, no matter how \ndysfunctional their politics was, managed to sacrifice that much of our \nfuture.\n  I believe the only path through this is a bipartisan one, and I \nbelieve the only path through this is a comprehensive one. I think that \nis what the people of Colorado want and what the American people want.\n  So I think today marked an important turning point in the \nconversation we are having around here, and I for my own part believe \nthat if we are confident in the people who sent us here, confident \nenough to do the job they have asked us to do, we can make sure we \ndon't erode the full faith and credit of the United States because \nundoing that is going to be the work of generations if we don't protect \nthe work of generations that have come before us. And I feel confident \nthat we can and that we will.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise briefly to commend the work of the \nGang of 6 and what they have done for our country in what is a \ncomplicated proposal with details forthcoming but largely reflecting \nthe actions of the bipartisan deficit commission and what could be \nbetween a $3.5 trillion and $4.5 trillion reduction in the borrowing \nneeds of the United States.\n  Specifically, so often we do not thank our colleagues here, but I \nwant to thank especially Senator Coburn, Senator Crapo, and Senator \nChambliss on the Republican side, Senator Warner, Senator Conrad, and \nSenator Durbin on the Democratic side, because I think they are \ncreating a vital center on what is the most important issue facing the \ncountry. I believe the outlines of the plan, as I understand it \ntonight, will dramatically reassure the American people, our markets, \nand especially our allies overseas that a free people and their elected \nrepresentatives can kick their spending habit over time.\n  At the meeting this morning we had 43 Senators attending, 23 \nRepublicans and 20 Democrats. In this age of very complicated and tight \nschedules, that is a mass meeting of the Senate.\n  I conclude by saying this may be the rise of the policy wonks as \nopposed to partisans of either side, to actually address the solid \ndetails of what is the most difficult financial problem facing the \ncountry. I commend the work of these three Republicans and these three \nDemocrats in creating a space now where at least 43 Senators attended \nthe meeting on the most creative and most detailed plan I have yet seen \ncome forward to take on this problem.\n  We all know under our Constitution that the Senate may be the most \ndifficult place to pass legislation. To see even this initiative coming \nout of the Senate gives me tremendous optimism that one of the most \ndifficult problems in our country can be handled by some of the most \ncapable policy wonk Members of the Senate.\n  With that, as we begin a discussion on the Gang of 6 proposal, I want \nto take a moment to personally thank these six Senators and what they \nhave done in putting together what appears to be an initial outline of, \nnot just a very good proposal but in several key areas as a fiscal \nconservative, an even better proposal than the bipartisan commission \nput forward.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last night the Senate adopted S. Con. Res. \n25, a concurrent resolution welcoming the independence of the Republic \nof South Sudan, congratulating the people of South Sudan for freely and \npeacefully expressing their will through an internationally accepted \nreferendum, and calling on the governments and people of Sudan and \nSouth Sudan to peacefully resolve outstanding issues including the \nfinal status of Abyei. I was happy to see us recognize this important \ndevelopment.\n\n[[Page S4670]]\n\n  Years ago when violence was raging in Darfur I regularly came to the \nfloor to try to keep the world's attention on the calamities happening \nin that far corner of the world.\n  Fortunately, after a number of years and constant international \npressure, a sizeable international peacekeeping force was deployed in \nDarfur, and over time the worst of the violence largely subsided.\n  Meanwhile a fragile peace treaty--the Comprehensive Peace Agreement \nor CPA--also started to bring an end to a devastating civil war between \nNorth and South Sudan that killed and displaced millions. I give \nPresident George W. Bush credit for seeing that important agreement to \nfruition.\n  A key CPA provision called for an independence referendum for the \nsouthern half of Sudan. This referendum occurred in January and was \nlargely peaceful and without incident.\n  The South voted overwhelmingly for independence, which the North \nagreed to respect. And on Saturday, amid widespread celebration and a \nhost of visiting international dignitaries, South Sudan became the \nworld's newest country.\n  Last year Senator Sherrod Brown and I visited Sudan. I wanted to see \nthe country--and the new one about to emerge--with my own eyes.\n  The South faces a daunting task--building a nation that can be \nresponsive to the needs of its 8 million residents, writing a \nconstitution, and creating a functional government.\n  The people of South Sudan, who have seen so much suffering after \nyears of civil war, deserve this chance at a peaceful and democratic \nnation--and the international community should help it get started and \nremain viable and stable.\n  The people of the North face challenges too, including a fragile \neconomy and a dwindling of the Nile River due to climate change.\n  And despite the peaceful independence process for the South, many \ncomplicated issues related to borders, oil revenues, and immigration \nstill remain to be worked out between both sides.\n  The Obama administration, including its special envoy Ambassador \nPrinceton Lyman, has been working diligently to help resolve these very \nthorny issues.\n  Unfortunately, we have seen a rash of new violence in a number of \nborder areas between North and South Sudan.\n  With much of the world's attention turned elsewhere, we must not let \nnew violence undermine the hard fought gains that have been achieved in \nSudan.\n  First, in May the Sudanese armed forces invaded the disputed oil-rich \nAbyei region, displacing as many as 100,000.\n  Fortunately, both sides met recently in Ethiopia and agreed to \nwithdraw their forces from the region. The U.N. Security Council also \nvoted to send a 4,200-person Ethiopian peacekeeping force there for 6 \nmonths to protect civilians and humanitarian workers.\n  These are steps in the right direction, and I urge both sides to \nrespect the agreement and work to negotiate a long-term solution to \nAbyei that will allow its people to live in peace.\n  More recently there has been a new outbreak of violence--one with \ndisturbing similarities to the violence in Darfur--in an area called \nSouthern Kordofan.\n  Most people have probably never heard of Southern Kordofan--an area \nthat borders South Sudan and is one of the few major oil-producing \nregions in the north.\n  During the North-South civil war, segments of the population \nsupported the south and tensions remain today as a result. Southern \nKordofan has a certain degree of autonomy and recently held separate \nstate elections, yet there were allegations of election rigging in \nfavor of North Sudan.\n  In early June, the North Sudanese government sent troops into the \nNuba region in Southern Kordofan to disarm individuals sympathetic to \nthe South--resulting in the displacement of more than 70,000. \nHumanitarian aid was blocked and U.N. staff harassed and detained.\n  And there have been allegations of targeted aerial bombing and house \nto house violence on the Nuba mountain people that are of grave \nconcern.\n  North Sudan stands to lose sizable revenue from Southern independence \nand Southern Kordofan is one of the North's major sources of oil \nrevenue. Many have speculated about the timing of the attacks--so close \nto Southern independence--but I am not going to dwell on motives \nbecause what matters most is that the aggression stops.\n  Two weeks ago both sides signed an African Union-mediated agreement \nto find a ``peaceful resolution of their differences . . . cease \nhostilities, permit humanitarian access, and allow the return of \ndisplaced persons to their homes.''\n  I hope this agreement is respected. The last thing the people of \nNorth or South Sudan need is more human suffering and displacement.\n  There must be an immediate cessation of hostilities and end to \nharassment of U.N. staff in Southern Kordofan.\n  Both sides must follow through with commitments to demilitarize \nAbyei.\n  Humanitarian agencies must have safe an unrestricted access to the \nareas.\n  And it is long overdue that the various parties in the Darfur \nconflict reach a long-term political settlement that will allow people \nto be safe and to return to their homes.\n  Continued progress on all these fronts is also the best path forward \nfor improving Sudan's relations with the United States and the rest of \nthe global community.\n  President Obama has called on Sudanese leaders to choose peace, and I \nstrongly echo his sentiments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/19/senate-section/article/S4670-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4670-S4671]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           EXTENDING THE TERM OF FBI DIRECTOR ROBERT MUELLER\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in strong support of \nS. 1103, the legislation before the Senate to extend the term of Robert \nMueller, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n  This is an important piece of legislation because without it, \nDirector Mueller's term will end very soon, as he completes his 10 \nyears in office.\n  That would leave the FBI, the Nation's leading law enforcement agency \nand the lead intelligence agency for domestic counterterrorism, without \na Director as we approach the 10th anniversary of the September 11 \nterrorist attacks.\n  This would be unacceptable in my view. Unfortunately, unanimous \nconsent to pass this legislation, S. 1103, is being held up. I urge my \ncolleagues to approve this bill quickly.\n  Earlier this year, the President conducted a search for a replacement \nfor Director Mueller. He determined that the best choice for the \nnation, at this critical time, was not to replace him, but rather to \nseek a legislative extension to Director Mueller's term.\n  The Judiciary Committee held a hearing with Director Mueller on June \n8, 2011, and has considered the text of this legislation, S. 1103. \nUnder a proposed unanimous consent agreement circulated earlier this \nmonth, passage of this legislation would be followed by the President's \nformal nomination of Mr. Mueller for an additional 2 years, and the \nnomination will be placed directly on the Senate's Executive Calendar.\n  I do not know of any Senator who does not respect and support \nDirector Mueller. Over the past 10 years that he has been in office, \nRobert Mueller has provided steady leadership and stability at the FBI. \nHe has worked to transform the Bureau into an agency that can better \ndetect and prevent terrorist attacks against the United States.\n  Under Mueller's direction, the FBI has played an essential role in \nmore than 20 significant counterterrorism operations, while \ninfiltrating and arresting groups of individuals charged with planning \nattacks against our country.\n  The FBI has also built its cyber investigation capability, focused on \ncounterintelligence, investigated public corruption cases, and tracked \nand disrupted gang activity.\n  Despite the major setback of the September 11 attacks, the FBI is \namong our most respected government institutions, and it has changed \ndramatically to respond to the challenges of our time.\n  Let me talk about Director Mueller for a moment, who is, personally, \na symbol of integrity and dedicated public service. I am very pleased \nto call him my friend, and thank him for his willingness to continue to \nserve for another 2 years.\n\n[[Page S4671]]\n\n  I recognize that there were good reasons that Congress placed a term \nlimit on the Director of the FBI. History has shown that the position, \nand the FBI, wield enormous powers and that the Bureau should not have \na director for life.\n  The legislation before us recognizes that concern, and creates a one-\ntime extension that would only apply to Director Mueller. Future FBI \nDirectors would still be limited to a 10-year term.\n  Extending Director Mueller's term at the FBI for an additional 2 \nyears will ensure the evolution of the FBI continues. It will provide \nimportant stability to the President's national security team during \nthis sensitive and challenging time and while it is otherwise going \nthrough important leadership changes.\n  This summer Leon Panetta has succeeded Robert Gates as Secretary of \nDefense, and GEN David Petraeus has been confirmed to be the next \nDirector of the CIA, but because he is transitioning out of \nAfghanistan, General Petraeus won't arrive at Headquarters in Langley \nuntil after Labor Day.\n  We are seeing changes in major military commands, and changes in the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff are coming soon. Also, the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee, which I have the honor of chairing, is now considering the \nnomination of Matt Olsen to be the Director of the National \nCounterterrorism Center, NCTC, because Mike Leiter stepped down as the \nhead of NCTC on July 8.\n  So in the midst of this change, Director Mueller will be an \nexperienced, steady hand among the President's national security \nadvisers. The American people will be well-served having him in place.\n  I support the legislation and urge its adoption. Now is not the time \nto keep it from passing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/19/senate-section/article/S4671-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4671]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 OBJECTION TO CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 872\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I have filed a formal objection to the \nconsideration of H.R. 872, a bill to exempt pesticide applications from \ncoverage under the Clean Water Act. I rise today to explain the \nreasoning for my opposition to this bill.\n  H.R. 872 is based on the notion that the law governing the licensing \nof pesticides provides all the environmental safeguards that are \nnecessary. In proponents' view, obtaining a Clean Water Act permit \nwould be duplicative. That is incorrect.\n  As chairman of the Water and Wildlife Subcommittee of the Senate \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, I have serious concerns about \nhow pesticide pollution is impacting human health, natural resources \nand the economies that depend on them.\n  Today, more than 1,800 waterways in the United States are known to be \nimpaired because of pesticide pollution. Limited water quality sampling \nsuggests the number is actually much higher. In a nationwide study \nconducted by the U.S. Geological Survey, more than half of the streams \nsampled had concentrations of at least one pesticide that exceeded a \nguideline for the protection of aquatic life. In California alone, more \nthan one in four of the State's waters are officially listed as \nimpaired because of pesticide pollution.\n  Chesapeake Bay is the most biologically diverse estuary in the \ncountry and serves as a vital economic resource to the region. One \nrecent study found that portions of the bay with higher concentrations \nof pesticide pollution exhibited decreased species diversity and \nreported a ``surprising number'' of such sites in the lower bay. \nPesticide pollution in the Chesapeake has been linked to fish kills and \nabnormalities. Moreover, extensive samples taken from Chesapeake \ntributaries displayed a range of pesticides and herbicides. Atrazine, \none of Maryland's most used herbicides, was detected in every water \nsample taken. The active ingredient in atrazine is resistant to natural \ndegradation in water and inhibits photosynthesis in plants. The USGS \nfound that concentrations of atrazine commonly found in agricultural \nstreams and rivers produced reproduction and development abnormalities.\n  Pesticides, by their very nature, consist of various toxins. They are \nregulated under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide \nAct, FIFRA, to determine if they are generally safe to use. The law is \nnot designed to deal with the many real-world instances in which those \n``general'' conditions are not applicable.\n  Pesticide pollution can cause severe reproductive and developmental \nharm and even death. Even at levels that allow for the product to be \nregistered, pesticides may cause health problems in fish, amphibians \nand other aquatic species. Additionally, pesticide pollution can affect \nhuman health through contaminated drinking water and bioaccumulation in \nthose that eat contaminated fish.\n  These pollution levels are the result of massive releases of \npesticides that are having adverse environmental impacts that go far \nbeyond what is regulated under the general application rule in FIFRA. \nWe need FIFRA, but we also need the Clean Water Act.\n  Approval of a pesticide under FIFRA only requires that the active \nchemical ``will not generally cause unreasonable adverse effects on the \nenvironment.''\n  Clean Water Act permits, on the other hand, are approved based on a \npesticide's impact on a specific waterway. It takes into account the \nwater body specific context including specific uses, such as swimming \nand fishing, and whether significant fish species rely on the waters. \nAdditionally, Clean Water Act permits place enforceable limits on the \namount and type of pollutants that can be discharged.\n  FIFRA registration is not an acceptable substitute for water \ndischarge permits. The localized impact assessment and enforceable \ndischarge limits of Clean Water Act permits are far better equipped to \naddress water quality issues than FIFRA's nationwide cost-benefit-based \nassessment. To exempt pesticides from comprehensive regulation would \nunreasonably compromise the quality of our waterways.\n  Clearly, the Nation has a problem with pesticide pollution in our \nwaters that needs to be addressed. The courts have said so, and \nscientific data reinforce that conclusion. That doesn't mean that every \nbackyard application of a weed-killer needs a Clean Water Act permit. \nProviding targeted exemptions of de minimis users of pesticides makes \ngood sense. Generally speaking, backyard applicators and local lawn \ncare companies should be exempt from coverage. Regulating these users \nwould do little to improve water quality and would be an unnecessary \nburden on them. Emergency applications to control mosquito outbreaks \nassociated with West Nile virus or a new outbreak of gypsy moth, for \nexample, should be allowed. Permits could be obtained after-the-fact in \nthese emergency situations without penalty. Agricultural applications \nto land should continue to be exempt. Permits should be easy to obtain \nand impose minimal monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting \nrequirements.\n  H.R. 872 simply goes too far, providing blanket exemptions and \nignoring the real water quality problems that pesticides are causing in \nAmerica's waters today. I support a more balanced approach.\n  The Clean Water Act has resulted in tremendous successes in \npreserving and restoring U.S. waterways, but many of our waterways are \nstill impaired and require further attention. To categorically exempt \npesticides from Clean Water Act permitting would be a step backwards in \nour nationwide efforts to ensure our waterways are healthy and safe. We \ncan do better.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/19/senate-section/article/S4671-2", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4671-S4672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REMEMBERING BETTY FORD\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I ask my colleagues to honor the \nmemory of one of our Nations' great leaders, former First Lady Betty \nFord. Mrs. Ford passed away on July 8, 2011, at the age of 93. She \nleaves behind a legacy of candor, service, equal rights for all and a \nstrong record of bipartisanship.\n  Elizabeth Ann Bloomer was born in Chicago, IL, on April 8, 1918, to \nWilliam Stephenson Bloomer and Hortense Neahr. She had two older \nbrothers, William and Robert Bloomer. When she was young, the family \nmoved to Grand Rapids, MI, where she spent her childhood.\n  Dance was a passion of hers from a young age. While performing in \nGrand Rapids, she met Martha Graham, who\n\n[[Page S4672]]\n\nbecame a lifelong friend, and was invited to perform with her dance \ncompany in New York City. To offset the cost of her own lessons, Mrs. \nFord began teaching dance to children. She took on students with \ndisabilities, even learning sign language so she could better help \nthose who were hearing impaired.\n  In 1947 a friend introduced her to Gerald Ford, a lawyer who had been \na Navy lieutenant during World War II. They became engaged in February \n1948 but waited to announce their plans to marry until June, when Ford \nhad won the Republican primary for the local U.S. congressional seat. \nThe couple was married in October 1948 in Grand Rapids, just 2 weeks \nbefore he was elected to his first of 13 congressional terms. They \nspent their honeymoon attending a campaign rally and a University of \nMichigan football game.\n  Betty Ford served as the First Lady of the United States from 1974-\n1977, during her husband's Presidency. Mrs. Ford broke new ground as an \nactivist First Lady who was an outspoken champion for the causes that \nshe cared about passionately. She advocated programs that supported the \narts and provided services for the disabled. She was a champion for \nwomen's rights and an ardent proponent of the equal rights amendment.\n  She became a prominent leader in the women's rights movement and led \nmarches and rallies for the ERA. The National Organization for Women \nappointed her as the cochair of the ERA Countdown Campaign. Even after \nshe left the White House, she continued to lobby for women's equality \nand remained an active voice for the feminist movement.\n  Mrs. Ford never shied away from an opportunity to speak her mind, \neven when her opinions were opposite her husband's. She is known as one \nof the most candid First Ladies in history, who took a strong, public \nstance on those issues she found to be most important: reproductive \nrights, fair pay, and gun control. Mrs. Ford was known for speaking \nplainly about these issues, as well as those that affected her personal \nlife.\n  In 1982, after her recovery from an addiction to alcohol and \nprescription drugs, she founded the Betty Ford Center for chemical \ndependency. Her willingness to openly discuss her personal struggles \nraised awareness of alcoholism and drug addiction. Similarly, she \nbecame a pioneer in the fight against breast cancer when she announced \nshe had been diagnosed with a malignant breast tumor and underwent a \nmastectomy. Seeing her recovery helped to remove the stigma about \ncancer and inspired many more women to seek treatment. She helped to \nget the Susan G. Komen Foundation off the ground when the organization \nwas first started in 1982. In 1987 the first Betty Ford Breast Care \nServices Center was opened in Grand Rapids, MI, to provide state-of-\nthe-art diagnostics, education, and testing for breast health. Since \nthen, six more centers have opened in the Grand Rapids area.\n  In 1991 she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. In 1999 \nMrs. Ford, along with President Ford, received the Congressional Gold \nMedal.\n  In addition to her public service, Mrs. Ford was a devoted wife and \nmother, and was actively involved in her family's life. She volunteered \nto help with her children's Cub Scout activities, football, baseball, \nand of course, her daughter's dance recitals. She also served as a \nSunday school teacher at the family's church, and on the PTA.\n  Betty Ford was a highly respected and beloved leader. She will be \nmissed by all who knew her. She inspired future generations of leaders \nand helped us make huge leaps toward gaining equal opportunities for \nwomen. She is survived by her three sons: Michael Gerald Ford, John \nGardner Ford, and Steven Ford; her daughter Susan Ford; and her \ngrandchildren Sarah, Rebekah, Hannah, Christian, Johnathan, Tyne, and \nHeather.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/19/senate-section/article/S4672-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4672-S4673]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              REMEMBERING CONGRESSMAN ROBERT F. ELLSWORTH\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, today I commemorate the life of Robert F. \nEllsworth--a dear friend and mentor to myself, loving husband to his \nwife Eleanor, and leader to many. In his service throughout his life as \na lawyer, officer, Congressman, Presidential aide, and Ambassador, Bob \nmet challenges as opportunities and transformed ideas into reality. His \nmemorial service was held at St. Francis Episcopal Church in Potomac on \nSaturday, June 11. Along with my own statement, I ask that the \nfollowing statements from that day be printed in the Record.\n\n                   Statement From Senator Pat Roberts\n\n       It is both an honor and a privilege to offer just a few \n     brief thoughts as we friends celebrate the unique and special \n     life of our friend Bob Ellsworth.\n       Many people would define happiness in many different ways. \n     However, a good definition of happiness would be Eleanor in \n     that she brought so much happiness into Bob's life and, for \n     that matter, to everyone privileged to meet and know her. \n     Eleanor, our prayers and thoughts are with you. I really \n     don't think anyone can capture or fully describe Bob \n     Ellsworth, but here is my take:\n       First, he was a friend of the Roberts family dating back to \n     my Dad and such a loyal friend. Second, throughout his \n     wonderful and most notable career, Bob was just plain nice; a \n     true gentleman. The late congressman Bill Emerson of \n     Missouri, who worked as a staffer for Congressman Bob \n     Ellsworth, said he was the best and most unique boss he ever \n     had. Bill often said, ``Bob Ellsworth would come around and \n     ask us if we were happy with our jobs. I first thought I was \n     going to be fired but soon realized he really cared about his \n     staff and wanted them to feel useful and if they thought they \n     were making a difference.'' As a Senator, I try to follow his \n     example with my staff today. But, seriously, who does that \n     today?\n       Third, he was not only my friend but mentor as well. He \n     made wonderful things happen for me and gave me so many \n     opportunities: serving on the German-American International \n     Exchange just as the wall came down and putting up with a \n     freshman Senator and later on the Commission on America's \n     National Interests with the Who's Who of America's foreign \n     and national security policy makers. This time, with Bob's \n     help, I think I actually made a difference. And, he was a \n     mentor and advisor to so many and like so many of his stature \n     and knowledge, he seldom offered advice and counsel without \n     first being asked. Bob Dole and I asked a lot and I know Bob \n     regrets deeply he cannot be in attendance.\n       I affectionately called Bob Ellsworth the Phantom with the \n     light bulbs. He would always call, drop in suddenly, like the \n     Phantom and then give me a rapid fire summary of what others \n     of like mind were thinking and what he thought. During his \n     dissertation and wonderful visit, light bulbs would go off in \n     my head always with the thought, ``Why didn't I think of \n     that?''\n       I really think Bob Ellsworth was a genius who somehow let \n     you believe you really came up with his latest insight. Being \n     an over the top Kansas State University enthusiast, genius \n     may be the proper description but we mere Kansas State \n     graduates simply said he was ``pretty damn smart.''\n       I will miss my friend and mentor as will so many. We shall \n     not see the likes of Bob Ellsworth again. I thank the Dear \n     Lord for allowing me to know, learn from and truly enjoy Bob \n     Ellsworth during this space and time.\n                                  ____\n\n\n          Statement From Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger\n\n       As we grow older, life becomes more and more lonely as the \n     pillars on which we counted disappear one by one. Bob was one \n     of those patriots who sustained our country and gave meaning \n     to our personal life. Over the decades of our acquaintance, \n     he always stood for principles I respect and was committed to \n     concepts of service that have made our country great.\n       He will be missed but long remembered.\n                                  ____\n\n\n       Statement From Former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld\n\n       Bob Ellsworth led a life dedicated to service. From his \n     time as a Naval officer in World War II and in the Korean \n     War, to his service in the Congress and as U.S. ambassador to \n     NATO, to his tour in the Pentagon as an Assistant Secretary \n     and later Deputy Secretary, Bob did not drift from his love \n     of country and sense of duty. Never one to give in to \n     pessimism or mistrust, he radiated warmth and solid, common \n     sense. Our paths first crossed in the early 1960s, a time \n     when warmth and common sense were not always in ample supply. \n     We came to know each other in the U.S. Congress, when \n     differences over civil rights, riots over political \n     assassinations, and rancor over the Vietnam War peaked across \n     the country. His was always a steadying hand. A serious \n     legislator, he believed that his job in representing his \n     constituents consisted of the often unglamorous work of \n     working on legislation in committee rooms and at late nights \n     behind his office desk. Bob wasn't a man short on courage. He \n     helped a small group of upstart Republicans turn out the \n     incumbent House leadership in 1964 and elect Gerald Ford as \n     Minority Leader.\n       It's been said by Soviet dissident Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn \n     that ``hastiness and superficiality'' are distinguishing \n     features of the 20th century, and that nowhere are they on \n     more display than in the press and in politics. But Bob \n     Ellsworth was the antidote to hastiness and superficiality. \n     What he lacked in flash, he made up in substance. As the \n     senior official in charge of Defense Department intelligence \n     operations, Bob manned\n\n[[Page S4673]]\n\n     the ramparts against white-hot Congressional committee \n     investigations that often seemed to be excoriating the \n     intelligence community rather than helping to fix it. He \n     responded to partisanship with collegiality and to bluster \n     with thought. Joyce and I regret that we cannot be with Bob's \n     family and his many friends to mourn, to remember, and to \n     most of all, to celebrate a life lived to its fullest. Our \n     thoughts and prayers are with Eleanor, Ann and William. May \n     God bless Bob Ellsworth, his loving family, and the country \n     he served so ably.\n                                  ____\n\n\n          Statement by Former Senators Bob and Elizabeth Dole\n\n       Dear Friends of Bob Ellsworth,\n       Longstanding commitments in Kansas prevent us from being \n     physically present as you celebrate Bob Ellsworth's life and \n     legacy. But we are very much with you in spirit and in our \n     prayers. We share not only the grief felt by Bob's family and \n     friends--but also their gratitude for all he accomplished in \n     84 remarkable years. Along the way Bob earned many titles of \n     distinction. Yet no resume, however impressive, can do \n     justice to the character of this man. Exactly fifty years \n     have passed since the two Bobs--Ellsworth and Dole--first \n     arrived in Washington. We came from opposite ends of Kansas, \n     and not just geographically. But from the start we were \n     kindred spirits. Bob loved his country second only to his \n     family. He made politics a noble calling. His example of \n     personal civility and respect for his colleagues has much to \n     teach today's public servants as they strive to be patriots \n     ahead of partisans. Nor will either of us ever forget the day \n     in December, 1975, when Bob served as best man at our \n     wedding. The title might well have been coined for him, and \n     not in a ceremonial capacity alone. For the odds were great \n     that, whatever setting Bob graced by his presence, he was the \n     best man there.\n       It is customary to address public officials, and \n     particularly members of Congress, as ``Honorable.'' No man we \n     know did more to deserve that label than Bob Ellsworth. Much \n     as we will miss him, we will be forever thankful that our \n     lives were so entwined with, and enriched by, the life we \n     celebrate today.\n                                  ____\n\n\n          Statement From the Center for the National Interest\n\n       The Center for the National Interest and The National \n     Interest lost a leader and a dear friend with the death of \n     Bob Ellsworth on Monday, May 9.\n       Center Honorary Chairman and former Secretary of State \n     Henry Kissinger, a close colleague for many years, described \n     Ellsworth as ``a great public servant and a valued friend.'' \n     Bob was a key member of the Center's board from its inception \n     and had been Vice Chairman since 2008. He was also President \n     of The National Interest, Inc. and a long-time member of the \n     magazine Advisory Council.\n       Bob was among the small group who advised Richard Nixon on \n     the creation of the Center in the early 1990s. Nixon relied \n     heavily on Bob's advice over the years, both in and out of \n     government--he knew, as he put it, that Bob was one of the \n     rare individuals in Washington who would tell him what he \n     needed to hear, not what he wanted to hear.\n       As a true gentleman, Bob Ellsworth always delivered his \n     candid views with grace and tact, to Nixon and to others. \n     Though very independent-minded--demonstrated in his \n     opposition to the wars in Vietnam and Iraq, and his \n     endorsement of Barack Obama after a lifelong career as a \n     leading Republican--Bob's personal charm and openness ensured \n     that he was widely respected and admired, even by those with \n     different perspectives. Bob was rare for one of his stature \n     and accomplishment in being able to take bold positions on \n     important issues while always remaining civil and ensuring \n     that differences were substantive rather than personal.\n       During his long and varied career, Bob was a soldier, a \n     politician, a diplomat, an official, a scholar, and, most \n     recently, an investor. This included service in World War II \n     and the Korean War, in the United States Congress, as \n     Ambassador to NATO and later Assistant Secretary and Deputy \n     Secretary of Defense. In addition to his leadership at our \n     Center and its magazine, Bob served for many years as \n     Chairman of the Council of the International Institute for \n     Strategic Studies (London). He was also a member of the \n     Council on Foreign Relations, the Atlantic Council, the \n     American Council on Germany, and many other internationally \n     focused organizations.\n       Bob was also a great patriot. He worked and fought \n     throughout his life to advance American leadership, American \n     security, and American principles.

DOWNES\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President. On July 24, 2011, Chief U.S. District \nJudge William F. Downes will retire after 17 years on the Federal bench \nin Wyoming.\n  Judge Downes has long recognized that for our democracy to survive, a \nstrong judicial branch is necessary. As he acknowledged during his \nSenate Judiciary nomination hearing in 1994, the strength of the \njudiciary is not determined by activist judges and changing the law to \nachieve a desired outcome. Rather, a strong judiciary consists of \njudges who uphold the Constitution, are thorough in their decisions, \nhave not formulated an opinion prior to a case being heard, and treat \npeople with respect and decency. This was the standard that Judge \nDownes set for himself in 1994. By all accounts he achieved that \nstandard in his courtroom.\n  Judge Downes, the grandson of Irish immigrants, has enjoyed the \nopportunity to welcome new citizens to our nation by performing \nNaturalization ceremonies. Cited as one of the highlights of his \ncareer, he has always said a Naturalization ceremony is one of the few \ntimes people come to the courthouse happy and leave even happier.\n  He began his public service early in life when he served in the U.S. \nMarine Corps from 1968 to 1971. Though he did not make military service \nhis career, his career in the law has been profoundly affected by his \nmilitary service.\n  In an article that appeared in the 2007 June edition of the Wyoming \nLawyer, Judge Downes discusses the important role played by the citizen \njury system in our government. He quotes from a letter sent by Thomas \nJefferson to Thomas Paine:\n\n       I consider trial by jury as the only anchor yet devised by \n     man by which the government can be held to the principles of \n     the Constitution.\n\n  In the same article, he describes two photos he keeps under the glass \ntop of his desk. One photo is of his family on Easter Sunday in 1985. \nThe other photo, from the spring of 2003, is of a 6-year-old boy named \nTony, clutching a teddy bear, walking out of a church, wiping tears \nfrom his eyes. He had just attended the funeral of his father, MAJ \nKevin G. Nave, USMC, who died on March 26, 2003, in the early stages of \nthe Iraq war.\n  Judge Downes writes:\n\n       Kevin Nave died so that we might have the opportunity to \n     live under a Constitution which guarantees us the opportunity \n     of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\n\n  He ends his article with the following:\n\n       Thomas Jefferson and the other founding fathers of this \n     Nation expected that we citizens would participate in the \n     governance of our nation and, by our efforts, make it a more \n     perfect union. If we judges and lawyers do our utmost to \n     uphold the constitutional right to trial by jury, we will \n     achieve the highest aspiration of our profession. For Tony's \n     sake, and for all our children, we can do no less.\n\n  Judge Downes achieved the highest aspiration of his profession. He \nhas contributed to the governance of our Nation with distinction.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Judge \nDownes, a true American Patriot, for his service to Wyoming and to our \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/19/senate-section/article/S4673-2", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4673-S4674]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DR. GENSHITSU SEN\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I wish to honor the work of Dr. \nGenshitsu Sen, renowned Japanese tea master and humanitarian, who has \npromoted peace and appreciation of the Japanese culture through chado, \nthe Japanese Way of Tea. Dr. Sen is the 15th grand tea master of the \nUrasenke School of Tea, which for nearly 500 years has served to \nperpetuate the ancient rite. On March 3, 1951, just 6 years after the \nend of World War II, during which he served in the Japanese Imperial \nNavy, Dr. Sen performed a tea ceremony in Honolulu, HI, the first such \nperformance outside of Japan. This auspicious occasion launched Dr. \nSen's dream of promoting ``peacefulness through a bowl of tea.'' In the \nyears that followed, Urasenke chado centers were established in cities \nworldwide, including Washington, DC, New York, London, Paris, Rome, Sao \nPaulo, Dusseldorf, Mexico City, Beijing, and Honolulu.\n  Today, in my home State of Hawaii, we celebrate the 60th anniversary \nof Dr. Sen's vision and work to promote\n\n[[Page S4674]]\n\npeace and understanding, with a special tea ceremony performed on a \nsacred American site, the Arizona Memorial. The Memorial is positioned \nabove the sunken battleship USS Arizona, the final resting place of \nhundreds of servicemembers killed in the attack on Pearl Harbor. The \nceremony is a strong statement supporting the potential for peace \ndespite a tragic history.\n  Japan is one of America's strongest and most trusted allies and I \nthank Dr. Sen for his work to promote good relations between our two \ncountries. I also recognize Soshitsu Sen, the 16th and current grand \ntea master of the Urasenke School. Finally, my thanks to Mrs. Jean \nAriyoshi, former First Lady of Hawaii, who was instrumental in \narranging today's historic event at the Arizona Memorial.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/19/senate-section/article/S4674-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4674]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:39 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 33.
